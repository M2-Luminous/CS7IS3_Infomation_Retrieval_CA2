FBIS4-58128 "drnes084_m_94001" FBIS-NES-94-084 Daily Report 2 May 1994 JORDAN King, al-Asad Said to Agree on Ministers' Meeting King, al-Asad Said to Agree on Ministers' Meeting JN0105120394 Amman AL-MAJD in Arabic 2 May 94 p 1 JN0105120394 Amman AL-MAJD Arabic BFN [Text] In addition to extending condolences on the death of Her Majesty Queen Zayn al-Sharaf, the Jordanian queen mother, Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad's visit to Jordan on Thursday [28 April] was a political opportunity to exchange views with Jordan on developments in the Arab situation and Jordanian-Syrian coordination on the political settlement. This is especially true in view of the fact that the visit coincided with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's regional tour and the announcement by Israel and the PLO that they have reached an agreement on the implementation of the Oslo agreement on self-rule in Gaza and Jericho, and that the agreement will be signed on Wednesday under U.S.-Egyptian sponsorship. During their meeting, King Husayn and President al-Asad stressed adherence to a comprehensive and final solution. They emphasized that Syrian-Jordanian-Lebanese coordination will continue and that any new separate deals that would weaken other positions will be avoided. Jordan explained that it rejected and continues to reject U.S. proposals on the formation of a four-way Egyptian-Israeli-Palestinian-Jordanian committee whose task would be to help implement the self-rule agreement. Jordan proposed that a six-way committee be set up within the framework of the Washington negotiations to discuss appropriate ways to link the Palestinian self-rule agreement to other tracks of bilateral negotiations. For this six-way committee, which would be comprised of representatives from Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, the Palestinians, and Israel, to advance the peace negotiations on all tracks, including the Palestinian-Israeli agreement, Jordan believes that U.S. and Russian participation will be useful and will help bring views closer. However, the United States, Israel, and Egypt believe that any formula of this kind means a return to an international peace conference. The three parties believe that a solution can only be reached within a bilateral framework following the example of the Camp David and Oslo agreements. Moreover, Christopher told King Husayn that Arab coordination prevents parties from moving toward separate settlements, for bilateral negotiations are held in isolation from other parties and it would be faster to reach bilateral solutions. In their meeting, which was held during a working luncheon, the Jordanian monarch and the Syrian president agreed that a meeting of the foreign ministers of the Arab parties to the negotiations will be held in Amman soon after the conclusion of the U.S. secretary of state's tour. The aim of the meeting will be to assess the results of this tour and to adopt a unified stand on the resumption of the bilateral negotiations, which are supposed to resume in Washington in mid-May. According to both sides' assessment, the Jordanian-Syrian meeting was successful. It was agreed to intensify contacts to emphasize coordination.
