Armed Islamic Movement [MIA], Armed Islamic Group. The death on Saturday of Sid Ahmed Mourad (alias Djaafar El-Afghani, alias Seif Allah), in a spectacular operation mounted by government security forces has revived enmities between the two militant Islamist organizations. It also poses once again the problem of the congeries of armed Islamist groups and their relations with each other and the FIS. Given the paucity of information available on the subject, it is extremely difficult to characterize these relations. Thus far the only light shed on the murky subject of the armed Islamist groups was furnished by the trial of those responsible for the terrorist attack on Algiers airport; everything else is conjecture. It was through the trial, for example, that we learned that [armed] groups had already formed and were prepared to go into action long before the interruption of the January 1992 legislative elections. The attacks on the border station at Guemmar in November 1991, and against Blida in spring 1990, are proof of that. One of the groups ready for armed action was Tekfir Oua El-Hidjra ("Redemption and Exile" [i.e., declare infidel and withdraw]), led at the time by Ahmed Bouamra ("Ahmed the Pakistani") and Nourredine Seddiki. Composed mainly of "Afghans," the group had declared the Islamist parties "impious" on grounds that voting was against the Shari'ah [Islamic law]. The group was rapidly dismantled by security forces after Seddiki's death in April 1992. Bouamra has vanished into thin air, and people have quit talking about him. The second group was led by Allel Mohamed, alias Moh Leveilley, a young Hussein-Dey merchant and cabaret habitue who joined the FIS when it was riding high. He formed his group during the FIS insurrection of June 1991, joining forces with Ben Mekhebi Fethi (alias Abou Doujana), Nourredine Bouferra, Ben Tebbiche, and Abdelhak Layada, his successor. The third group ready for armed action was led by Mansouri Meliani, who was tried for the airport attack, sentenced to death, and executed last August. By his own admission to the Special Court of Algiers, he had established his "Djamaat Islamiya Moussalaha" (Armed Islamic Groups) about the same time as Moh Leveilley. The decision was taken, he explained, when security forces tried to restore the motto "By the people and for the people" to the facades of the APCs [People's Communal Assemblies] in place of the Islamist motto the FIS had substituted. The restoration, it will be recalled, resulted in some nasty confrontations between security forces and Islamist militants. Meliani said it was these confrontations that had prompted him to action, not the arrest of the FIS directorate, whom he accuses of "compromising with the regime." Meliani then made contact with Sid Ahmed Lahrani, imam of El Feth de Bab El-Oued mosque, who was killed in March 1993 at El-Biar; Abdel Nasser Leulmi, a teacher at the CEM [College of Intermediate Studies] of Bordj El-Bahri, killed in September 1992; Si Ahmed Mourad (Djaafar El-Afghani); a certain Abdelhalim of Benzerga; and the imam Cheikh Nacer from Ouled Yaich. Meliani explained that in order to avoid the mistakes committed by Mustapha Bouyali, precursor of the armed struggle, he opted to recruit his people first and weapons later. He organized his movement by naming three coordinators: Lahrani (Center), Si-Ahmed Mourad (East), and Leulmi (West). The group won notoriety in February 1992 with the attack on the naval repair station near the Admiralty in Algiers, an attack that left seven soldiers, a policeman, and two attackers dead. The groups headed by Bouamra, Allel, and Meliani are unique in that in addition to being independent of each other they have also managed to avoid being controlled by the FIS. That was not the case with the Armed Islamic Movement (MIA) led by Chebouti, or the Haraket addawla al islamiya (HDI) led by Said Mekhloufi, who were close to the Islamist party. When the leaders of that movement--notably Mohamed Said and Abdelrezak Redjam--escaped the clutches of the law and opted for armed struggle, they realized they count not count on Said Mekhloufi or Omar Eulmi (founder of the SIT [Islamic Labor Syndicate] and brother of Abdel Nasser, who was killed in April 1993) to unify all the groups. So they picked Abdelkader Chebouti, whose past actions had made him rather a legend in his own time. Chebouti let himself be convinced. Mekhloufi and the Eulmi brothers did not oppose him. Hocine Abderrahim, principal instigator of the airport attack, later sentenced to death and executed, and Bennouis and Guitli, two long-time Bouyali confederates who later joined the FIS, also supported the decision. But Meliani and Allel balked. An initial effort at unification was made in April 1992, at a meeting held in Zbarbar. The meeting was hosted by a group active in the Bouira region headed by a certain Hocine Moutadjer. In addition to the latter, the meeting was attended by Chebouti, Meliani, Mekhloufi, Omar Eulmi, Abderrahim, Abdelkader Bennouis, and Guitli; Allel Mohamed did not attend. The meeting created a formal structure for the armed movement: Chebouti was made national emir, Meliani national coordinator, Mekhloufi director of military affairs, Eulmi the mufti, and Moutadjer and a certain "Bouratili" treasurers. Guitli and Bennouis were put in charge of the political and information commission, and Abderrahim was made coordinator of the Algiers region, with Said Soussene (later sentenced to death and executed) and Djamel Ressaf (now a fugitive, recently expelled from France) as his deputies; Kamr Eddine Kherbane (now a member of the FIS executive body in exile) was chosen in absentia to handle external affairs. But two days after the meeting, Mehani went back on his promises and withdrew (as he put it) his allegiance to Chebouti. On the ground, in terms of operations, Allel's group has been responsible for the most bloodshed. He was assisted by Soussene, who participated in an ambush in which five policemen were killed in July 1992 at Boudouaou. His arrest led to the dismantling of Allel's group, 10 of whom were killed at their hide-out in Baba Hassen in August 1992. Before that operation, the security forces had struck another spectacular blow on 27 July 1992 with the arrest of Mansouri Meliani. These two events shifted the balance of power, and Chebouti was once again in the strongest position. Moreover, he had just received word of fresh support from Ali Benhadj, who said in a "fetwa" smuggled out of prison that if he were released he would place himself at Chebouti's orders. The meeting at Tamezguida on 31 August 1992 was supposed to consecrate his ascendancy. Allel Mohamed, weakened by the loss of 10 members of his group, agreed to come to Tamezguida accompanied by two of his deputies, Abdelhak Layada (now in prison) and Nourredine Bouferra. But the meeting was aborted due to a security sweep of the area that resulted in the death of Allel and his deputy Bouferra. The meeting could not be held, and Layada took Allel's place. The apprehension of the latter, who was suspected of giving certain names to the authorities--notably Si-Ahmed Lakraoui and Yekhlef Cherrati (arrested at his El-Harrach hide-out in February 1993)--opened the way for Djaafar El-Afghani, who apparently inherited all the survivors from El-Hidjra Oua El-Tekfir (whose philosophy he also appropriated), the Allel group, and the Meliani group, which had picked him, as noted previously, to be eastern coordinator of the Djamaate Islamiya Moussalaha. The preeminent role of Djaafar El-Afghani was also confirmed by Layada himself in an interview with the daily EL MOUDJAHID last October, during the hearing before the magistrate of the Special Court of Algiers. Layada also said in the interview that he had headed a group of 600 men in various locations around the country. The relations between Layada and the FIS are rather tumultuous--especially with the children of Abassi Madani and with Rabah Kebir, whom Layada accuses of having diverted millions of dollars he claims were earmarked for the armed groups. His "mufti," Omar Leulmi, in a cassette circulated clandestinely, rejected all the pretensions of exiled FIS leaders to speak for Islamists, going so far as to threaten them with death. The death of Omar Leulmi, followed several weeks later by Layada's arrest, seems not to have altered relations between the latter's successor and the FIS. Proof came with the assassination of former prime minister Kasdi Merbah, an act for which GIA claimed responsibility while the FIS blamed it on the security forces. It was thanks to this assassination that the GIA came to dominate the political and media scene. Subsequently, the GIA was to claim the 24 October 1993 abduction of three French consular agents and the assassination of Mohamed Bouslimani, who apparently had refused to issue a "fetwa" endorsing the murders committed by the organization. The deadly attacks against foreigners that have taken 21 lives since 1 December are attributed to GIA, which had presented one of the three French consular agents an ultimatum giving foreigners a month to leave Algeria on pain of death. The ultimatum indicated that there would be no more "warnings or abductions" and that it would be "more violent than in Egypt." The deadline was scrupulously observed, and two days after its expiry a Spaniard was slain on the road between Khemis Miliana and Berrouaghia. The most recent victim of this series of killings that has taken 21 lives is Joaquim Grau, assassinated in his bookstore on Rue Didouche Mourad on 22 February. Before the deadline expired, two French surveyors, three Latin American technicians, and two Soviet training officers had been assassinated at Sidi Bel-Abbes, Tiaret, and Laghouat, respectively. The murder of the two French surveyors was officially attributed to a group called "Unified Companies of the Jihad" headed by a former "Afghan," Kada Benchiha, apparently affiliated with the GIA. A different group that seems to be wreaking havoc in the Titteri and Ouarsenis regions is headed by another "Afghan," Sayeh Attia, famous as the author of the murder of 12 Croats last December as well as the ambush that cost the life of the wali of Tissemsilt and his companion. Since Si Ahmed Mourad, Kada Benchiha, and Sayeh Attia all three saw action in Afghanistan, it is quite likely they are all members of the same organization. There is also a striking similarity in their methods of execution: slitting their victims' throats and atrociously mutilating the bodies. Politically, GIA has distinguished itself by its mistrust of all Islamist leaders who want a dialogue with the authorities, threatening them with "the worst of deaths" and affirming, in two successive communiques, that "the mujahidin are in command." When Anwar Haddam and Rabah Kebir for the first time condemned assassinations of intellectuals, the GIA replied by warning its supporters against "djamaate who have been seduced by media celebrity and the lure of power" and "forgotten the oath of unity in the ranks of the mujahidin." Rejecting contacts between the regime and the FIS as "maneuvers designed to stop the jihad," the GIA communique accused Said Mekhloufi of being an undercover agent of Algerian security and claimed his goal was to foment an implosion in the ranks of the mujahidin. The GIA claims to have thwarted the plot and executed 70 infiltrators. It promises the same fate to their "chief," Said Mekhloufi. The FIS has reciprocated the accusation of working with the security services. "GIA does not belong to the FIS. I find that this movement has sometimes claimed credit for curious things, such as the murder of Kasdi Merbah, which everyone knows was the work of the regime," says Kamr Eddine Kherbane, who as noted above is a member of the FIS executive body overseas, and was given responsibility for the movement's "external affairs" at the April 1992 meeting in Zbarbar. In an interview last December with the French weekly NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR, Kherbane, a former air force officer who served as chief of security for the FIS, announced the birth of the Islamic Army of Salvation (AIS), which he considers "the only armed branch of the FIS." According to Kherbane, the AIS now includes Chebouti's MIA and Said Mekhloufi's HDI. In a situation in which responsibility for attacks is seldom claimed, it is difficult to establish how much of the activity is this organization's doing. But observers agree in saying it is strongest in the mountains of Bouzegza, Zbarbar, and the Jijelian region. However that may be, the frictions between AIS and GIA are so acute that analysts concluded--overhastily and ineptly--that the death of Djaafar El-Afghani resulted from an informer's tip triggered by these divergences. This sparked a quite virulent reaction from Anwar Haddam, who several weeks ago called for an end to the terrorist attacks. According to Mr. Haddam, the death of Djaafar El-Afghani--whom he described as the "mujahid commander"--was an "assassination" that imperils dialogue between the regime and the FIS. "Dialogue would be pointless if the regime perseveres in the liquidation of innocents," he says in a communique reported by AFP. Haddam's statement may only reflect panic at the prospect of possible GIA reprisals to avenge its leaders. But whatever it represents, it has done nothing to attenuate dissensions between the GIA and the FIS. And there is no doubt that if the latter agreed publicly to give evidence against Djaafar El-Afghani's organization, its power to do ill would diminish, since it would then be constrained to act openly. Unless Haddam's reaction was just the prelude to a rapprochement meant to strengthen his hand in talks with the regime. Although there is no basis as yet for predicting what position the dissolved Islamist movement will take toward the GIA, it is safe to say it is not going to break with Chebouti's organization. If negotiations between the regime and the FIS continue, the fate of Chebouti and his confederates will have to be discussed. Thus the head of the MIA, already the recipient of Chadli Bendjedid's favor, would have an excellent chance of escaping further criminal prosecution. But here we cross the line into political fiction.
