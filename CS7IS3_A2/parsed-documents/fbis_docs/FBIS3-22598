According to officials at the provincial office for endemic disease prevention and cure, the local incidence rate of snail fever has dropped from 4.41 percent three years ago to the present 1.07 percent, and its incidence rate among cattle has plummeted from 10.6 percent to 3.5 percent. The officials said the work was boosted with the aid of world bank loans, which the province began to use last year to bring snail fever under control. During the past year, the province has been organizing specialists to spread knowledge in 41 counties on health care education, disease statistics, and supervision and treatment of endemic diseases. The province is also promoting a comprehensive plan which involves boosting local economy and optimizing agricultural production. On the other hand, scientific researchers have found more effective ways to check the spread of endemic diseases. In addition, the officials revealed, people in 63 percent of the counties infested with endemic diseases are eating iodine-bearing salt. The incidence rate of malaria has dropped by 54 percent compared with the previous year, and the spread of other diseases such as endemic fluorosis, keshan disease and osteoarthrosis deformans endemica has been checked, local officials said.
