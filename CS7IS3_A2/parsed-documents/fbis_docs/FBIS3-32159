Here is what Pedro Chiriguaya said: [Begin recording] [Chiriguaya] The government is mistaken, totally mistaken. We have already said they are mistaken; there is no reason to raise gasoline prices. [Unidentified reporter] [Words indistinct] go on strike tomorrow [words indistinct] into a nationwide strike? [Chiriguaya] We are just now on our way to the meeting called by the Federation of Oil Workers and the [words indistinct] in Pichincha. A decision will be made on Thursday. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] [Chiriguaya] We must obey our union headquarter's decisions. We believe the strike will be total. [Reporter] [Passage indistinct] [Chiriguaya] In any case, the one to correct the mistake would be the finance minister, as he is the one who raised fuel prices. [end recording] Meanwhile, Fidel Garcia, president of the federation of public employees in Pichincha, announced they will join the strike called by FUT as they consider that the gasoline price hike adversely affects all national sectors, particularly the most needy. Garcia explained that although they are prohibited from participating in the strike, they will go ahead anyway as the government must understand that its duty is to work for Ecuadoreans, not against them. In addition, Luis Macas, Conaie [Confederation of Indian Nationalities of Ecuador] president, said Thursday's strike will be characteristic of a struggle and that demonstrations will continue in the coming days until the government revokes its decision. Macas said that an Indian uprising might occur on 8 or 9 February. Here is what Luis Macas said: [Begin recording] [Macas, in progress] ...of the union workers movement, the Indian-peasant movement, that is all the Ecuadoran people. A day of struggle by the students has been called for today. In the same fashion, tomorrow the whole Ecuadoran population is summoned, all of us who are adversely affected -- that is, from the middle class on down. That measure is nothing more than a statement by the ruling class, by this nation's oligarchy, against all Ecuadoreans. We call on the people to join this struggle; this is a popular struggle. This summons is coordinated precisely through this nation's Indian-peasant, workers, and peoples organizations. [end recording] Along these same lines, student leader (?Elwis Moreira) has said the Student Federation will actively participate in the strike called for tomorrow by Ecuadoran workers. He termed successful the current student demonstrations. Meanwhile, in Guayaquil, at the National Teachers Union of Guayas, Alonso Lopez, president of Teachers' Democratic Front, was asked about what actions are planned for tomorrow. Here is Alfonso Lopez: [Begin recording] [Lopez] Specifically, the Teachers Union has called on all education sectors: supervisors, directors, and students in general, to join [words indistinct] tomorrow the 24-hour protest. They should attend peacefully. But if there is repression, if the repressive forces prevent the demonstration's normal development, we the teachers, together with the organized sectors, are willing to carry the demonstration through to its ultimate consequences. We call on all organized sectors to gather tomorrow morning at 0900 at the Centenario Plaza [words indistinct] in the afternoon at 1600. [passage indistinct] In addition, certain important sectors of the roads in the Guayas Province will be blocked on Friday, as on this day we will not stage a protest. The following day, on Friday we will continue our activities at the National Teachers Union of Guayas [break in reception] [end recording]
