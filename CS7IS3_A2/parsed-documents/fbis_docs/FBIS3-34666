AL-AKHBAR said the agreement will help toward signing a final accord between 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin to implement the Declaration of Principles, which everyone hopes will end the tension and bloody conflict prevailing in the region for approximately 50 years. The paper called on Israel to eliminate any potential obstacles that might mar the tranquility of the negotiations' final phase or that might impede the required measures to implement the accord. The paper warned against building new settlements that will create disputes and a conflict of authority in these territories at a time when understanding and cooperation are needed to streamline the transfer of power in an atmosphere of tranquility and coexistence. AL-JUMHURIYAH praised President Husni Mubarak's efforts to bring the Palestinian and Israeli views closer until the Cairo Declaration was signed. It said: Egypt hosted Palestinian and Israeli negotiating delegations and was open to a difficult dialogue between the two sides at a crucial moment and while the Palestinian and Israeli negotiators faced a difficult situation. The Palestinian negotiator relied on vast Egyptian experience of dialogue and formulating negotiating positions. AL-JUMHURIYAH expressed the hope that the peace process will extend east to include Jordan and Israel and north to include Syria, Lebanon, and Israel. AL-AHRAM emphasized that Egyptian diplomacy did all it could to push negotiations between the two sides to the shore of safety in line with its historical and cultural role in the region as the largest Arab country.
