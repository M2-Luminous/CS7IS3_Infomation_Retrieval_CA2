As of 20 April 1994, the newspaper complex was owed R10.6 million by ARGUMENTY I FAKTY, R35.6 million by ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI, R26.5 million by ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, and R13.9 by SMENA. The total amount owed to the complex by all customers amounted to more than R300 million. Because of systematic nonpayments the printing house is unable to purchase materials and pay for fuel, energy, and transportation, which may jeopardize newspaper printing in St. Petersburg and the Northwestern region altogether. Beginning 25 April 1994, the printing house is compelled to suspend printing the following newspaper until all payments due are received: ARGUMENTY I FAKTY, ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI, and ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA. We suggest that all complaints be addressed to these newspapers' editors.
