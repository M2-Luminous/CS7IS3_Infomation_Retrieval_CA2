FR940202-0-00104 FR940202-0-00012 INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION 49 CFR Parts 1002 and 1312 [Ex Parte No. MC&hyph;213] Range Tariffs_Fax Filing AGENCY: Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). ACTION: Final Rules. SUMMARY: The ICC is issuing final rules permitting carriers to effectuate range tariffs by filing by fax the actual rates applicable to identified shipments prior to transport of those shipments. Section 5(b) of the Negotiated Rates Act of 1993 requires that, as of June 1, 1994, range tariffs must identify the specific rate or discount (from among the range of available rates or discounts) which applies to each specific shipment, or must contain an objective means for determining that rate. Faxed rates, which are intended for use only where carriers must respond rapidly to changing market demands in the spot market, will have an effective period of only 7 days. EFFECTIVE DATE: These regulations are effective on March 4, 1994, and carriers may begin to use the fax filing process for spot market shipments on that date.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Commission issued a Notice of Proposed Rules on August 9, 1993 at 58 FR 42276. Additional information concerning the final rules that are adopted is contained in the Commission's decision.

[Assistance for the hearing impaired is available through TDD services (202) 927&hyph;5721.] Regulatory Flexibility Certification No one has challenged our initial conclusion that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. We reaffirm this conclusion for the reasons previously cited, i.e., that the economic impact will be minimal because the regulation merely provides for another means by which carriers may submit to the agency certain materials already required by statute to be filed with the agency. Thus, the economic impact is unlikely to be significant within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Environmental Statement This action will not significantly affect either the quality of the human environment or the conservation of energy resources.
