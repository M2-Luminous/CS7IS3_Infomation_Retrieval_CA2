FR940413-2-00131 FR940413-2-00063 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION [Docket No. 50&hyph;382] Entergy Operations, Inc.; Partial Withdrawal of Application For Amendment To Facility Operating License The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) has granted the request of Entergy Operations, Inc. (the licensee), to partially withdraw its November 16, 1993, application for proposed amendment to Facility Operating License No. NPF&hyph;38 for the Waterford Steam Electric Station, Unit 3, located in St. Charles Parish, Louisiana. The amendment revised the Technical Specifications (TSs) to provide acceptable conditions for operation when: (1) The core operating limits supervisory system (COLSS) is in service and neither control element assembly calculator (CEAC) is operable and (2) the COLSS is out of service and either or both CEACs are operable. The Commission had previously issued a Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment published in the Federal Register on January 5, 1994 (59 FR 620). However, by supplemental letter dated April 5, 1994, the licensee partially withdrew the proposed change pertaining to the increase of the required power operating limit reduction from 13 percent to 16 percent for limiting anticipated operations occurrences with both CEACs inoperable. For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated November 16, 1993, and the licensee's letter dated April 5, 1994, which partially withdrew the application for license amendment. The above documents are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room located at the University of New Orleans Library, Louisiana Collection, Lakefront, New Orleans, Louisiana 70122. Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 6th day of April 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. David L.
