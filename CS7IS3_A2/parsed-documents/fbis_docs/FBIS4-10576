He indicated that this is why cooperation and help from the consumer countries is needed, and he proposed as a solution that "drug trafficking has to be fought where drugs are consumed." Former Bolivian President Jaime Paz Zamora said these same words when he received the U.S. demand that his country must fight the cultivation of coca leaf, which is the raw material from which cocaine is produced. During the past few days our country has been involved in the trafficking of drugs or other illegal activities such as the Brazilian "numbers game." When the foreign minister was asked what the government is doing to clear up the bad image that has been created, he said: "I believe the government is doing everything it can to control drug trafficking and other illegal activities. We do not have sufficient resources to combat drug trafficking, and the help Paraguay receives from the consumer countries is not very much." He indicated that the government cannot perform miracles without the necessary resources. He stated that our country has requested cooperation and help from the consumer countries, "because drug trafficking must be fought where the drugs are consumed. Because if there is consumption and an good price, then without a doubt there will be production and the possibility of [drug] routes." He then proposed another solution to this scourge: that the consumer countries emphasize aiding the countries where the drug is produced or in countries where drug routes are discovered.
