The sociologists asked them to "name five or six prominent figures in Russia whom you most trust." Let us remind you that similar previous polls took place on 5 August, 27 October, and 15 December of last year. The dynamics of the answers is characteristic: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Aug |Oct |Dec |Apr | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Yeltsin |27 |24 |19 |13 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Yavlinskiy |10 |13 |16 |11 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Gaydar |8 |15 |26 |10 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Zhirinovskiy |2 |1 |16 |6 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Rutskoy |17 |5 |2 |5 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Luzhkov |6 |6 |5 |5 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Shakhray |9 |12 |13 |5 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Pamfilova |- |3 |3 |5 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Chernomyrdin |5 |4 |2 |4 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Zyuganov |1 |2 |6 |4 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- The listed political figures enjoy a relatively greater measure of trust than they do on the whole among Muscovites who have been polled: B. Yeltsin -- among pensioners, executives, and those in the management sphere, servicemen and workers of law and order services, technical specialists, and on the whole among persons of 40 to 55 with a higher education who voted for Russia's Choice and the Party of Russian Unity and Accord [PRES] in the 12 December elections; G. Yavlinskiy -- among executives and those in the management sphere, technical specialists, and generally among those of 40 to 55 with a higher education who voted for Yabloko and the Democratic Reforms Movement; Ye. Gaydar -- among technical specialists, the military, and workers of the law and order services, executives and those in the management sphere, entrepreneurs running their own businesses, and generally people above 40 with a higher education and who voted for Russia's Choice and PRES; V. Zhirinovskiy -- among white collar workers without special education, workers and men in general, persons above 40 with an education below the secondary level and who voted for his party; A. Rutskoy -- among white collar workers without special education, unskilled workers, specialists in the field of science, education and medicine, pensioners, and generally among those of 40 to 55 with an education below secondary level and who voted for the parties of communists, agrarians, Zhirinovskiy, and against everybody; Yu. Luzhkov -- among executives and those in the sphere of management, specialists in the field of science, education, and medicine, and generally among women, persons above 55 who voted for Russia's Choice; S. Shakhray -- among housewives, entrepreneurs who run their own businesses, technical specialists, military and workers of the law and order services, and generally among women, people of 25 to 40 with a higher education and who voted for the PRES and Russia's Choice; E. Pamfilova -- among technical specialists, pensioners, while collar workers without special education, and women generally, persons above 55 with higher education who voted more frequently for Russian's Choice and Yabloko; V. Chernomyrdin -- among executives and those in the management sphere, technical specialists, women generally, persons above 40 with secondary education who voted for PRES and Yabloko; G. Zyuganov -- among pensioners, military, and workers of the law and order services, and generally men, persons above 55 with an education below the secondary level who voted for the Communist Party, the Women of Russia, and Travkin's Democratic Party. Among other Russian political figures who are trusted by Muscovites who took part in the poll are N. Travkin, S. Fedorov, and A. Sobchak with 3 percent each; V. Shumeyko, I. Rybkin, K. Borovoy with 2 percent each; S. Baburin, M. Gorbachev, T. Gdlyan with 1 percent each; G. Popov, A. Volskiy, R. Khasbulatov with under 1 percent. Remarkably, an increasing number of respondents, in each new stage of the poll on trust in political figures, either name no leader they would trust or are generally stumped for an answer. To compare: while there were 36 percent of such persons in December, there were 52 percent in April. A considerable part of Muscovites must feel unprotected today against realities of life which appreciably affects their view of favorite leaders and idols.
