The final acknowledgment made by the U.S. secretary of state on the United States' official position towards this law came out because the South Korean puppets were clamoring that U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Hubbard's remarks calling for the abolition of the NSL in his speech at American University on 25 February were merely an individual's opinion. This proceeded from the present U.S. administration's acknowledgment that one of the reasons for the failure in progress in dialogue and negotiation between the North and the South of Korea lies in South Korea's NSL, and this is, albeit belated, very fortunate. As everyone is well aware, the NSL of South Korea is a product and legacy of the military dictatorship and a most vicious, evil, fascist law blocking free dialogue and exchange between the North and the South by describing us as an antistate organization and as an enemy. Under the patronage of the United States, the successive military dictatorial regimes of South Korea used the NSL and various anticommunist fascist evil laws to brutally suppress the South Korean people's struggle for independence, democracy, reunification, incite North-South confrontation, and block the country's reunification. Following the fifth and sixth republics, the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime has also been mercilessly suppressing not only the South Korean people's struggle for independence, democracy, and reunification, but also young students and people who called for holding dialogue with us, thus blocking the road to dialogue. Last year alone, the Kim Yong-sam fascist ring suppressed and blocked all patriotic struggles of the South Korean students and people for national reconciliation, unity, and reunification such as the North-South students' talks that were slated to be held in Panmunjom on 12 June, the fourth pannational rally in Seoul, the Pyongyang-Seoul university students' soccer games, and the North- South student bicycle race. The rascals went so far as to block our proposals to pay respects before the coffin of Rev. Mun Ik-hwan in Seoul and to hold a working-level contact in Panmunjom between North-South Chondoist representatives in order to discuss holding joint North-South celebrations for the centennial of the Kap-o peasants' war. The truculent, fascist tyranny of the Kim Yong-sam ring which blocked fellow countrymen from expressing condolences and even trampled upon the patriotic and nation-loving will of North-South Chondoists using the NSL evokes strong opposition and rejection by the world's people. The indiscreet infringement upon human rights and the antireunification and antidialogue maneuvers perpetrated indiscreetly by the Kim Yong-sam ring under the mask of being a so- called civilian-led government have been so unscrupulous that even high-ranking U.S. officials were moved to call for the abolishment of the NSL. One of the reasons why the Kim Yong-sam regime has been branded as a civilian-led fascist regime is because it retains the NSL. It is precisely because of the NSL that various channels of dialogue and exchange between the North and the South in the past have failed to make any progress and that numerous South Korean people who had advocated the country's reunification and who had visited the North were imprisoned. This notwithstanding, the Kim Yong-sam ring has not only been brutally suppressing the South Korean people's just struggle for independence, democracy, and reunification with the NSL, but is also clamoring that it is impossible to abolish the NSL and the like today, at a time when the issue of abolishing the law has become an issue. The Kim Yong-sam ring's opposition to the abolition of the NSL proceeds from its wicked intention to suppress the South Korean people's just struggle with the law and to block the country's peace and its peaceful reunification. It also more clearly reveals that the rascals' clamor about a civilian-led government and the like is an out-and-out lie and that the rascals are fascist tyrants and national traitors who are dashing toward fascism, division, and confrontation. The Kim Yong-sam ring is trying to maintain the dirty remainder of its life on a road of fascism and confrontation. This, however, is a gross miscalculation. The road of fascist suppression and confrontation will further incite the popular masses' resistance and will only expedite the Kim Yong-sam ring's ruin. The Kim Yong-sam ring should look straight at the trend of the times and abolish, without delay, the NSL, an antireunification and fascist evil law.
