The proposal was put forward by Fang Rongxin, an executive vice chairman of the CPWDP Central Committee at the second public-address meeting of the ongoing second session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). Fang is one of ten speakers addressing today's meeting. Over the past few years, China has scored world-acknowledged achievements in family planning, Fang said. As a result, population growth has slowed down markedly, and the population structure and quality has improved, he told the meeting. "However, China is still facing an arduous task in checking its population from growing too rapidly," he said. In his speech, Jiang Jingbo, a Standing Committee member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, made a five-point proposal concerning supervision over the work of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the government. The proposal says: -- CPC committees and governments at all levels should increase their contacts with democratic parties; -- The system under which democratic parties participate in discussing state affairs should be further improved; -- A system under which democratic parties exercise supervision over government work should be established and improved; -- Further improve the system under which democratic parties and persons without party affiliation assume leading posts in governments and judicial departments; and -- Make sure that democratic parties enjoy all rights as stipulated in China's constitution. Li Ganliu, vice chairman of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, expressed the hope that the Kuomintang authorities in Taiwan accept the CPC proposal on direct exchanges of mail, trade and shipping and air services across the Taiwan Straits. The Kuomintang in Taiwan should hold talks with the CPC at an early date, he added. In their speeches Li Zhensheng, a former vice president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and He Jindao made proposals on how to promote the use of agro-techniques and put a stop to environmental pollution. In his speech, Zhu Guangya, vice president of the China Association for Science and Technology, emphasized the importance of respecting science.
