Technically they are the servants of the Crown, the policy-makers who determine the fate of Hong Kong's six-million-strong population. Day in and day out, Hong Kong people take it for granted that these mandarins, the civil servants, are there and the services delivered. At midnight June 30, 1997, the Queen, the Union Jack, Governor Chris Patten will all become history in Hong Kong. But will all these familiar faces also be a matter of the past? Who determines their fate? China? Britain? Or Hong Kong? After more than a decade of protracted preparation for 1997, the change in sovereignty from British to Chinese may not have such a profound impact on the man in the street, but for those striding along the corridors of power, it could make or break careers. So much has been said about continuity of service, but with China and Britain in dispute, there is simply no guarantee that the top brass of the Civil Service will ride the through train. Mr Patten obviously has his short-list of candidates to fill the 22 principal official posts which, under the Basic Law, have to be occupied by Chinese nationals without right of abode in any foreign country. Beijing, having announced its plan to go it alone, is compiling its own list. Neither list has been finalised, but preferences are undoubtedly noted for some of the strategic positions. Mr Patten's choices are expected to be the more straightforward, as the basic selection criteria should be the candidates' experience and expertise. China's consideration may be more complicated, as the leadership line-up will have to reflect the change of sovereignty. In any case, the first Chief Executive of the Special Administrative Region (SAR) Government, whose task will be to nominate and report to the Central People's Government on the appointment of principal officials, will have a lot of influence in drawing up the final list. The big question on the minds of Hong Kong's would-be leaders is how the two lists differ and how much disruption that will bring. Under Mr Patten, the careers of the Chief Secretary, Anson Chan Fang On-sang, and the Secretary for the Civil Service, Michael Sze Cho-cheung, have blossomed, but whether they will wilt in the post- 1997 regime is anybody's guess. In the run-up to 1997, save for any unforeseen events, Mrs Chan is sure to stay on as Chief Secretary, and it has also emerged that Mr Sze is a leading contender to be the first local Financial Secretary. Word that both Mrs Chan and Mr Sze will be turfed off the civil service through train at the changeover may be too severe. Equally, it might be rather optimistic to think they can continue to stay in the positions of enormous influence. When the mood in Zhongnanhai accords so much importance to allegiance, an automatic inheritance of the key players in the Patten administration is rather remote. By the same token those who are not seen as particularly favoured by the Governor and who do not openly promote his policy on Sino-British matters stand a better chance of moving up the hierarchy. Joseph Yam Chi-kwong, head of the Monetary Authority, believed to be the public officer in Hong Kong most trusted by China, remains the front-runner as the post-1997 financial chief. As for the post of Chief Secretary, the Secretary for Home Affairs, Michael Suen Ming-yeung, is seen as one of Beijing's potential candidates. By 1997, Mr Suen will be the most senior local policy secretary, because Secretary for Education and Manpower, Michael Leung Mankin, is expected to retire by then. Although Mr Suen, formerly Secretary for Constitutional Affairs held the sensitive position when Sino-British relations deteriorated in the aftermath of the June 4 massacre, his experience and relatively low-key and non-confrontational approach have made him stand out as a candidate for the top position. The next most important post in the SAR hierarchy, but yet to be created, is Hong Kong's top representative in Beijing to lobby on its behalf with the central authorities. Ideally, Hong Kong should have set up its representative office in Beijing, but the current icy relationship has simply made that impossible. But post-1997, such a post will be indispensable, and the candidates are expected to include Secretary for Economic Services, Gordon Siu Kwing-chue, and Secretary for Constitutional Affairs, Nicholas Ng Wing-fui. Their frequent contacts with Chinese officials have given them ample opportunity to deal with their mainland counterparts and understand the mainland system. The policy branch for the Beijing office should be the Constitutional Affairs Branch. While Mr Ng currently occupies the post, in mapping out the new team Mr Patten may want to bring in some new blood, such as Lam Woon-kwong, currently Deputy Secretary for Education and Manpower. Mr Lam's recent performance in handling the old age pension proposal is understood to have impressed the administration. His good political sense may also put him on the list as the post-1997 constitutional chief. Another sensitive position is the Secretary for Security post which is expected to be taken up by Mr Ng's deputy, Peter Lai Hing- ling, given his strong Joint Liaison Group (JLG) experience. Equally, Mr Ng, now a full JLG member, could be a contender. A more difficult vacancy to fill is the high-powered position of head of the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), as the appointee has to be a person of high principle, tough and independent-minded while also senior enough to command the respect of the anti-graft team. Among the senior officials the Treasury Secretary, Donald Tsang Yam-kuen, is considered to have all the qualities to be a leading choice for the ICAC post before and after the changeover. But such a possibility will not deprive him of the chance to be a candidate for the pre-1997 Financial Secretary post, given his experience. Taking over from Mr Tsang before or after 1997 is expected to be his deputy, Kwong Ki-chi, or the Director-General of Industry, Denise Yue Chung-yee, also a deputy in the Finance Branch. As it is the Government's plan to get the new team in place in early 1996 at the latest, Mr Patten still has time to finalise it. China's final decision may depend on Mr Patten's choices. Provided China does not appoint non-civil servants to principal posts, the membership of the pre- or post-1997 leadership will not differ much, as the choices are rather limited. On both lists, would-be leaders are expected to include Secretary for Trade and Industry, Chau Tak-hay, Secretary for Recreation and Culture, James So Yiu-cho, Secretary for Transport, Haider Barma, Commissioner for Transport, Rafael Hui Si-yan, Director of Education, Dominic Wong Shing-wah, Director of the New Airport Projects Co-ordination Office, Billy Lam Chung-lun and head of the Government's Geneva trade office, Joseph Wong Wing-ping.
