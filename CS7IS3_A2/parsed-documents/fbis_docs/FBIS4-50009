Wu Jianmin of the ministry called the charges by US Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord "groundless and irresponsible." Lord made the statements before a US Senate Foreign Affairs Subcommittee meeting on May 4. He said China has assisted the DPRK in the development of ballistic missiles and nuclear devices. Wu said China hopes all parties involved in the nuclear inspection crisis adopt constructive and positive attitudes to reach an early settlement through dialogue. He also said at the briefing that China has noticed genuine concern in Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's statement that Japan's past aggression and colonial rule inflicted unbearable suffering on many people. China appreciates his indications that history shall be treated correctly and the younger generation shall learn a correct historical view Wu said. Wu also announced that Russian Prime Minister Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin will pay an official visit from May 26 to 29, the first time a Russian premier will come to China. Since President Boris Yeltsin's visit in February 1992, Wu said, Sino-Russian relations have undergone steady development in all fields. He said Chernomyrdin's trip will bring new energy to existing ties, particularly economic and trade relations. He also announced President Pascal Lissouba of the Republic of Congo will visit China from May 19 to 25 at the invitation of President Jiang Zemin.
