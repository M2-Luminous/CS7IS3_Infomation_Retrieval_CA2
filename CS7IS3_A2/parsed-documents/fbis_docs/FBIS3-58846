Instead of the approximately 36,000 housing units that were the subject of an agreement, it is now expected that approximately 45,000 units will be built at 40 different locations. They will be handed over at the end of 1994. The Federal Government had originally made 7.8 billion German marks [DM] available for apartments, technical and social infrastructure, certain production facilities, and housing construction combines. Last year, a further DM550 million was added to the housing program. According to figures provided by Hinrichs, contracts for over 40,000 housing units at 37 different locations have been signed. A further four or five locations where 5,000 housing units are to be built are still at the planning stage. [passage omitted]
