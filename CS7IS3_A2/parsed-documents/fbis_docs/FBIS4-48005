FBIS4-48005 "drafr089_c_94028" FBIS-AFR-94-089 Daily Report 9 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 7-8 May South African Press Review for 7-8 May MB0805114094 MB0805114094 BFN [Editorial Report] WEEKEND STAR Mandela's Cabinet -- An editorial in Johannesburg WEEKEND STAR in English on 7-8 May on page 8 describes Nelson Mandela's cabinet "with De Klerk's appointment as second deputy president assured," as "a good blend of the new and old." It notes the "one striking omission" Cyril Ramaphosa, officially explained as choosing "to stay out to guide the ANC during the next five years." "Ramaphosa's decision not to accept another cabinet post is reported to have come after his chief rival Thabo Mbeki, got the nod as first deputy president" and as "heir apparent to Mandela." Mbeki is a "worthy deputy president," but his appointment "does nothing to counter perceptions of the ANC as an organization which favors Xhosas." Alfred Nzo as foreign minister "comes as an unpleasant surprise," due to his "reputation for inefficiency" and Joe Modise as minister of defense is "worrying too," as he was "named in a an ANC investigation" as "negligent of the rights of internees in ANC detention camps. "Mandela's 17 ANC appointments leave 10 vacancies for other parties, thought to include Derek Keys for finance and Roelf Meyer for constitutional affairs. SUNDAY TIMES Celebration of Unity and Democracy -- "A new age now begins in South Africa. The elections have produced so neat a result, such a tidy balance of contending political forces, so as to give a compelling logic to the idea of a government of national unity," notes an editorial in Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in English on 8 May on page 24. President-elect Mandela has already "sketched the themes of his administration as conciliation, nation-building, and upliftment of the poor," a vision "perhaps best summed up in the newly popular slogan: one nation, many cultures." "To give effect to his intentions, Mr Mandela knows, the government must first restore confidence in South Africa's future, especially among such key elites as local and foreign investors" and "he has moved swiftly to do so. The decision to keep Dr Chris Stals at the Reserve Bank and Mr Derek Keys as Finance Minister could not have been easy for a man surrounded, as he still is, by 60s-era social engineers, but it has put two crucial pieces into place." While the "new spirit of conciliation will be severely tested" by the "troubles that lie ahead," "it is proper and understandable if South African hearts swell with pride" as "we have wroght a miracle, we have made a democracy." RAPPORT President Mandela, a New Era -- "When Mr. Mandela is inaugurated on Tuesday as the Republic of South Africa's state president, the country not only enters into a totally new and unknown political era, but the new head of state reaches a milestone one only reads about in fairy tales," says an editorial in Johannesburg RAPPORT in Afrikaans on 8 May on page 20. "To sit in jail for 27 years and then be welcomed as a hero by his people, to feel at home in the presence of princes and statesmen, to be a part of an intense negotiations process, over seventy-years-of-age and still able to keep to a busy schedule which could cause many younger men to stumble, to be politically and socially active after three decades of personal isolation, and then to fill the highest post in the country, is unique indeed for any leader in world history. RAPPORT has been and is still Mr. Mandela's political opponent, and has no reason to embrace him or the ANC. Mr. Mandela probably feels the same about RAPPORT. Politically, the struggle goes on. RAPPORT, as an opposition newspaper will play its watchdog role together with other critical South African media with intensified alertness, especially concerning the interests of the Afrikaans speaking community. But, on the eve of Mr. Mandela's inauguration we wish him well." "Mr. de Klerk, outgoing state president, with his outgoing government, carry with them the wounds of challenging reforms." "RAPPORT did not always agree with Mr. de Klerk's way of handling the whole reform process, but from start to finish he acted in a very dignified manner, and gracefully handled the difficult situations." "We extend our good wishes to Mr. de Klerk who clearly showed the world that this land, especially the Afrikaner who governed till now, has not discarded the policies of civilization, good manners and goodwill on the highest level."
