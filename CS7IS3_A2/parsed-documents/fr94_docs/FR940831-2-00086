FR940831-2-00086 FR940831-2-00065 INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION [Finance Docket No. 32495] Chicago Terminal Corporation; Acquisition of Leasehold Exemption_Elgin, Joliet & Eastern Railway Company Chicago Terminal Corporation (CTC), a noncarrier, has filed a verified notice under 49 CFR part 1150, subpart D_Exempt Transactions to acquire a non-exclusive leasehold interest in the approximately 112-mile rail line between milepost J&hyph;67 + 320 at Upton, IL, and Buchannan Street, Kirk Yard, at Gary, IN, owned by Elgin, Joliet & Eastern Railway Company (EJ&E). The transaction is expected to be consummated on or soon after the effective date of the Commission's decision on the merits of CTC's contemporaneously filed motion to dismiss. 1 1 In its motion to dismiss, CTC asserts that the Commission lacks jurisdiction because CTC is not acquiring a common carrier obligation and allegedly will not become a carrier upon consummation of the transaction. The merits of this motion, as well as of CTC's motion for a protective order, will be addressed in separate decisions. This notice of exemption covers only the acquisition of a leasehold interest and not any other aspect of the transaction. Depending upon the Commission's decision on the motion to dismiss, and absent the filing of a petition for revocation (which would be handled separately), the exemption will stand or be vacated. If the verified notice contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void ab initio. Petitions to reopen the proceeding to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to reopen will not stay the exemption's effectiveness. Pleadings must be filed with the Commission and served on William C. Sippel, Oppenheimer Wolff & Donnelly, Two Prudential Plaza, 45th Floor, 180 North Stetson Avenue, Chicago, IL 60601. Decided: August 22, 1994. By the Commission, David M. Konschnik, Director, Office of Proceedings. Anne K. Quinlan, Acting Secretary.
