Tabarov] [Abstract]Numerical calculations are performed for the transient characteristics of vertical GaAs field-effect phototransistors with various levels of lighting and voltage values on the source and shutter, which creates a potential barrier for electrons. Photocurrent, potential energy distributions, and times to establish steady state and the gain in phototransistors with a concealed shutter for small light sources are calculated and the results presented. It is shown that for both a small barrier and a large barrier, the times for establishing steady photocurrent amount to several nanoseconds and depend on the voltage on the shutter. As voltage on the shutter is increased, speed increases. However, the photocurrent of the structure simultaneously decreases. A reduction in photocurrent at high voltages on the shutter causes a reduction in the properties of the structure. 5 figures, 1 chart and 21 references.
