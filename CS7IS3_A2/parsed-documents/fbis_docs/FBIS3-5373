However, he added, it would be very unfortunate if the British government adopted retaliatory measures because the Malaysian action was not directed at the British Government. Abdullah made the statement after British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd reportedly indicated that the British Government might take retaliatory measures. [passage omitted] We are not hasty in our action against the allegations but we cannot allow the British media to publish baseless statements, he told reporters after presenting Id festival aid to poor people in the northern Penang state. Abdullah said Malaysian leaders had to defend their dignity by taking action owing to the allegations by influential newspapers in Britain. The action by the Malaysian Government resulted from the attitude of the Western media which forced the country to act, he said. Abdullah said the government would wait and see what action the British Government would take in the matter. Any action by the British Government should be directed at the media which brought about this problem between the two countries and should not be a retaliation against this country, he said. He said that if the British Government took retaliatory measures against Malaysia, bilateral relations would be strained and subsequently Britain would be the loser.
