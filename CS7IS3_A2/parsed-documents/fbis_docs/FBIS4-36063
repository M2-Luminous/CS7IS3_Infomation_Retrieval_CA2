Here is little Saddam or the backward Saddam reappearing to try his luck in Yemen, and there are similarities between today and yesterday, when Arab and international states unanimously condemned Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, and stood as one to force the Iraqi Forces to withdraw from Kuwaiti territory. After the failure of Saddam Husayn's scheme in Kuwait, he proceded to burn the oil refineries and oilfields of fraternal Kuwait, dear to the heart of every Arab. Today our people stood steadfast in the Democratic Republic of Yemen with their brave Armed Forces, in the face of the aggressive invasion of the ruling military regime in Sanaa, and caused the failure of its attempts to seize southern Yemen by force. There were unanimous Arab and international demands for a cease-fire and the aggressor's withdrawal. At this very moment, 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has resorted to an attempt to destroy the Aden refineries, a vital and important facility for the entire Yemeni people, both in the south and the north. How ironic that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's four aircraft, which carried out the aerial attack on the Aden refineries, should destroy the fuel tank which supplies fuel to the northern governorates. Our great air defenses were vigilant regarding this aggression, and shot down three aircraft, while the fourth one fled. We shall supply local, Arab, and international public opinion with more details later. God is great, God is great.
