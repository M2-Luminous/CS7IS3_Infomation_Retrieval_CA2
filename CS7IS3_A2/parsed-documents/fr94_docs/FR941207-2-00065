FR941207-2-00065 FR941207-2-00051 [NAFTA&hyph;00132] F.C.I.; Freeman, South Dakota Notice of Revised Determination on Reconsideration On September 9, 1994, the Department issued an Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration for NAFTA Transitional adjustment Assistance for former workers of the subject firm. This notice was published in the Federal Register on September 23, 1994 (59 FR 48914). On reconsideration, it was found that F.C.I. ceased production of industrial back supports in January, 1994. Other findings show substantial worker separations occurred in 1993 and 1994. New findings on reconsideration show that a major declining customer of industrial back supports from F.C.I. decreased its purchases in 1994 and substantially increased its import purchases of back supports. Conclusion After careful consideration of the new facts obtained on reconsideration, it is concluded that the F.C.I. workers in Freeman, South Dakota were adversely affected by increased imports of articles like or directly competitive with the back supports produced at F.C.I. in Freeman, South Dakota. In accordance with the provisions of the Act, I make the following revised certification for the F.C.I. workers in Freeman, South Dakota. ``All workers of F.C.I. in Freeman, South Dakota who were engaged in employment related to the production of back supports who became totally or partially separated from employment on or after June 7, 1993 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 250 of the Trade Act of 1974.'' Signed at Washington, D.C., this 25th of November 1994. Victor J. Trunzo, Program Manager, Policy and Reemployment Services Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance.
