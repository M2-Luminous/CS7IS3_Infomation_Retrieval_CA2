[Pawlak] Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. [Gugala] Prime minister, you have said that decisions about the situation in the coalition will depend on what your PSL [Polish Peasant Party] colleagues would say. Has any decision like this been made? [Pawlak] This concerns not only PSL decisions but also issues connected with the future course of the economic policy and future transformations in our country, and I think that today's OPZZ [National Trade Union Alliance] proceedings show that these disputes and divisions occur not so much between the parties that make up the coalition but, rather, along various lines within the very parliamentary groups that make up the coalition. And this does not concern aspects of procedural matters; it concerns fundamental matters. It is a question of how Poland is going to be reformed from now on. [Gugala] How is Poland going to be reformed from now on? Will you accept the resignation of Mr. Marek Borowski, the deputy prime minister and finance minister? [Pawlak] Yes. I think that this decision by Mr. Borowski was made with his full attention, his full consideration and reflection, and that it how it should be treated. I think that, at the moment, this dispute concerns not so much procedural matters as an answer to the question of whether we are going to proceed in the direction of this straight forward liberal continuation, or, respecting the election results, we are going to fashion a prosocial policy, open to the needs of the economy and also the needs of the society. And these are the questions asked by the people today because, when we meet the voters, we do not hear questions about procedure, about how the government proceeds. We hear questions about what solutions we are implementing, whether, for instance, we are changing policy principles, whether we are, for instance, going toward solutions that stimulate the economy or going toward solutions that shift benefits, social assistance, toward the poorest groups. This concerns, for instance, family benefits and housing benefits, and these are the kind of solutions that are needed now. [Gugala] Prime minister, are you not afraid that this decision by you may bring about a very serious crisis inside the coalition, that it may make it so that it will be difficult to pursue any kind of policy whatsoever? [Pawlak] I think the coalition is based on a jointly greed program, and here the decision of the SdRP [Social Democracy of the Polish Republic] Supreme Council also, first and foremost, points to the programmatic solutions, and I think this is what we are going to focus on. When we signed these coalition agreements, we were talking about the tasks facing us and the people's expectations and not about personalities, and that is how I want to continue to pursue this issue. [Gugala] Is it possible to reconcile people's expectations with too short a blanket, which is what the state finances are? Marek Borowski, the deputy prime minister and finance minister, said that one could not conduct a policy separated from economic realities because it would not yield anything good for the people; on the contrary, it will cause greater inflation and trouble for the people. [Pawlak] We are in agreement here. I think there is no controversy just here, but the question is whether we adopt a policy directed only toward simple fiscal mechanisms and simple mechanisms of distribution or take a direction toward searching for active forms regarding effects on the economy and active forms of receiving resources. Sometimes there were paradoxical situations, where the ministry responsible for revenues voiced doubts over ideas of different ministers aimed at revenue increases. [Gugala] Are you of the opinion that the Finance Ministry failed in finding greater revenues? [Pawlak] We are dealing here, first of all, with different approaches toward the creation of the budget. It cannot be a formula that we create a convenient budget, which could be implemented easily and which could be easily balanced, but that we create a budget that meets social expectations and focuses on areas of particular importance from the viewpoint of the future. Here one can give some thought to whether all resources were used properly. The Sejm commissions, for example, draw attention to the need for modifications in the budget. We will discuss that tomorrow, and I think that many proposals by the commissions can be taken into account as they point to some sources for redistribution within the budget, for better use of resources, and they point to income sources, which can contribute to directing them toward indispensable and useful goals. [Gugala] Does it mean that your government will present a new draft budget? [Pawlak] I do not think so. We are responsible for this government proposal, and I think that not one single person is a guarantor of the budget. Times have changed. There were times in the past when personalities or parties guaranteed this or that political order. Now the majority of the public clearly supports democracy and a free market, so these guarantees are not so obvious and necessary here. This budget is a government proposal, and, as the government, we are going to put forward the solutions that are active and that have received approval from the Sejm commissions. I think that tomorrow, at the government meeting, we will be able to talk about the modifications that were discussed in the Sejm. Some of them will be accepted. There is also a fairly large batch of proposals that simply have no chance of being implemented because they have no basis in the present economic realities. [Gugala] Quite recently, Deputy Prime Minister Marek Borowski was one of our guests, and he said that the budget proposed by the government was already a very optimistic budget, that there were many areas there where the amounts assumed as state budget revenues were in fact wishful thinking. Are you not afraid that it will simply not be possible to get greater budget revenues? [Pawlak] I think that, just as we said, both in the election campaign and in the early months of the government, we have to focus on actions that strive toward universal collection of revenues, collection of taxes, collection of duties, and much attention has to be devoted here to effective operation of these mechanisms. We need to pay much attention to the areas on which the collection of taxes depends--that is, that the whole structure of the treasury offices, the customs offices, is well equipped so that the officials who decide about state revenues have realistic possibilities for receiving the income, and then, in the future, we can also think about reducing the tax rates once they are universally paid. I think it is important to concentrate these modest resources on actions of this kind; then we will have no problems as to whether these views are well grounded, whether this budget is realistic or highly optimistic. This budget is based on realities, and, according to our appraisals and our opinions, it is possible to implement it. [Gugala] But are you not afraid, Prime Minister, that tomorrow you will in fact receive no opportunity to talk about the budget because you will simply have to talk about Marek Borowski? [Pawlak] I think we agreed to form the coalition to implement economic programs, to improve the economic situation in Poland, and for this policy to have a human face and be directed both toward people who are working in factories and enterprises and toward all those who are jobless at the moment, and not through allowances and benefits but through creating jobs. The policy should also be directed toward those who worked honestly and well and now live on old-age and disability pensions. We have been going in this direction, and the first results regarding old-age and disability pensions are visible. There is still a lot to be done in social and health insurance. A serious question is how to effectively overcome unemployment and create jobs. This is a question of large infrastructure programs--for example, the highway construction program, the promotion of export, and.... [Gugala, interrupting] We could talk about this for a very long time. Prime Minister, do you assume that the coalition still exists, only without Mr. Marek Borowski? [Pawlak] It is my conviction that the coalition still exists. While making decisions, every one of us should carefully consider the consequences of these decisions, and I think we have opportunities and possibilities to work for Poland in different places. I think that the effects of our work are of the utmost importance. If we are going to act like that, where we do it is secondary. [Gugala] When are you going to meet Mr. Aleksander Kwasniewski? [Pawlak] We have arranged to hold a coalition meeting tomorrow [8 February], and I think we will discuss issues there, what has to be done and how, and not procedural matters. [Gugala] Thank you for visiting our studio.
