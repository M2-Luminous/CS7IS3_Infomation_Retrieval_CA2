We South Africans are reaping an unwelcome harvest of violence, and of fear. Its seeds were sown by those who dreamed up the notion of apartheid; and when the crop turned out to be ever rising resistance from the people, they set out to suppress it using force and violence. A decade of suppression was a total failure. But it created a new South African culture, in which the state wielded arbitrary armed power without constraint of law, and in which all opposition and resistance was suppressed with violence. The National Party's state spread the new culture in the streets: disputes over power are to be settled by force, and opponents are to be eliminated by violence. It enshrined the new culture in the statute book, with a maze of laws which suppress the right to speak or organise or meet or publish, and which permit the security forces to banish, imprison, torture or assassinate with impunity. Apartheid culture legitimated violence for political ends. And now we live with the fall-out in the AWB [Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging; Afrikaner Resistance Movement], the third force, and Inkatha. Today, violence is the chosen way of politics for all those who seek to preserve their own power by preventing the holding of free and fair elections. Their methods are political murder and house-burning, terror by assault, and by uncontrolled armed impi's. Their threats to the security of all the people have not just grown up naturally. They have been deliberately incited in an attempt to win through violence and fear what they know they will never through the ballot box. This culture of terrorism on one side and fear on the other is the culture we inherit from the era of apartheid. It cannot be wiped out by a simple announcement that we have now a "new" NP. Nor will it be instantly wiped out even by the election of the new ANC led government. But the election of a new government untainted by the apartheid culture of the past, would be a start. We need that start if we are to build a country at peace and a people freed from fear. The ANC does not have to claim that it is "new", and therefore disconnected from its own past. We have pride in our past. We were the party of resistance and of opposition throughout the apartheid era. Our members were the men and women who suffered most directly from the oppressive terror in the era of apartheid violence. We do not want to paint our organization as apartheid and suppression, old in the fight against the culture of violence. We have stood firm against the worst terror the apartheid state could bring against us. We have come through with our ideals intact. Our history is a matter of pride, not to be brushed under the carpet. Throughout the years when the culture of violence was being created, ours was the organization that struggled for the way forward, even though all the force and violence of the apartheid state was mustered to turn the country back. We pioneered the ideal of a non-racial country. We built our party on the unity of white, brown and black members. We pioneered the ideal of votes for all, and an all-inclusive democracy, while the NP clung to its racist ideas. Our past gives the credentials for the carrying out of our promises for the future. April 27th can mark the beginning of the end of the culture of violence. A massive vote of confidence in the policies of the ANC is the starting point for weeding out the culture of violence and terror. It will make it possible once and for all, after all De Klerk's indecisions and inaction, to strip the protective cover the third force and the inciters of violence, and from the terrorist campaigns of Inkatha and the AWB. Voting ANC on April 27th means a start to the weeding out of fear and violence from our country. We will not repeat the failures of the past decade. We will not place reliance on all those failed "safety measures" of reliance on more armed guards, more police immunity, more fire-power; on "security" behind the high walls and razor wire, the guard-dogs and the "armed response" teams. The internal stability units and armed police have failed to make us safer. But they have made the violent men more ruthless, more violent, more desperate, and the security force men more reliant on violence alone to counter violence. It is time for a new way. The ANC proposes To create a new defence force, whose watchwords will be `defence of the people', not suppression of opposition. To reorganise the police force by eliminating "political policing" as exemplified by the third force and the ISU's [Internal Stability Unit], and by encouraging policing for the community and in full consultation with local communities. Instituting a new regime of gun control, to end gun smuggling and minimise the number of firearms held in individual hands. This not an instant cure for the violence which has become deeply embedded in our culture, and which has created the climate of fear everywhere in the country. But it is the only way forward. Curbing the men of violence, empowering the community to defend itself, spreading democratic control into every aspect of public life is the only ground in which a new culture of peace and security can be securely planted in the country. This is not a "quick fix." It is a pledge of immediate action and of long-term reconstruction from the ANC in government. Many of those who vote on April 27th may well be fearful in today's South Africa. They should vote to live freed from fear in the South Africa of the future.
