In the statement given today to the Press Agency of the Slovak Republic, Bratislava Mayor Peter Kresanek believes, along with members of the City Council, that sound reason, responsibility, and the interests of all citizens of the Slovak Republic will prevail. The City Council appeals to mayors of the Association of Towns and Villages of Zitny ostrov with a feeling of regret and misgiving that, instead of taking a common approach in pushing through self-administrative structures and interests of the citizens-voters, they have chosen a path of unrealistic demands that do not represent a real interest of the inhabitants of the towns and villages of that region. In the statement, Mayor Kresanek and members of the Bratislava City Council, addressing their colleagues from the Association of Towns and Villages of Zitny ostrov, call for well-considered conduct and a fundamental reassessment of the course they have taken up to now, which otherwise might lead to raising nationalistic passions.
