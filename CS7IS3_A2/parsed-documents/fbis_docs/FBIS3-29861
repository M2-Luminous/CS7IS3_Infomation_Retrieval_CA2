The current law that restricts broadcasting firms from going public should be lifted to let them procure funds in the multimedia age, the panel said in its report of recommendations. Among other recommendations made in the nine-point proposal is the slight easing of a rule prohibiting one company from owning several broadcasting companies. The panel also recommended that laws be reviewed to make television broadcasting across country borders possible, and that firms' broadcasting areas be enlargened. The Posts and Telecommuncations Ministry is likely to lift the stock-listing restriction in March and ease the rule on prohibiting ownership of several broadcasting firms within this year.
