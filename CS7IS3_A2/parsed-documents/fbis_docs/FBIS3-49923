Goncz said that the four Visegrad countries -- the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia -- are in agreement over all relevant issues, with only minor geographical differences. Goncz believed the plan will be tested by concrete cooperation. Prosperity is also important -- Budapest approaches security in a broader context than the military alone. Prime Minister Peter Boross stressed the peace-partnership scheme as the first far-reaching international initiative by an American President in office for several years to come. Boross was happy with his talks with his Czech, Polish, and Slovak counterparts, and called for greater efforts to solve problems delaying setting up the Visegrad free-trade zone.
