Iranian First Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad Hashemi, Iranian President Hashemi-Rafsanjani's brother and former head of Iranian radio and television, is expected to visit Turkey on May 2, diplomatic sources told TURKISH DAILY NEWS [TDN]. "Economic and political issues will be discussed by Turkish officials during this visit. Hashemi will hold a meeting with Turkish Foreign Ministry Under Secretary Ozdem Sanberk and is expected to be received by Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin and President Suleyman Demirel," a high-ranking Iranian official told TDN. Hashemi will outline the Iranian government's views on latest developments in the region and the world, the same source said. "The Karabakh question, the Bosnia problem and the issue of northern Iraq will be the main topics of the consultations. The views of the Turkish and Iranian governments are quite similar on these subjects. The question for the two friendly countries is how to act together to solve these problems. Economic issues will also be discussed by Turkish and Iranian officials. There is a political will to accelerate economic relations between the two countries," he disclosed. Iran has recently launched a new liberalization project, designed by President Hashemi-Rafsanjani, that aims to create a powerful economic system, which will integrate Iran into the global economic system. Hashemi-Rafsanjani is proposing a privatization campaign for state-owned enterprises, to lift government subsidies, to develop Iran's resources other than crude oil, to encourage exporters and lessen the Iranian economy's dependence on oil revenues. Meanwhile, a Turkish delegation, comprising Eximbank, Treasury and State Pipeline company (BOTAS) officials, will visit Iran in early May. During the visit, Turkish and Iranian officials will discuss the natural gas pipeline project, which there are plans to extend to Europe via Turkey. Iran, which ranks second in the world in terms of natural gas resources, is attaching great importance to this project since its oil export revenues are declining due to low world market prices. Turkey is also trying to break its dependence on natural gas imports from the Russian Federation. Turkey has taken an extremely positive stance toward this project. "We want to realize it as soon as possible," Hayrettin Uzun, general director of BOTAS, told TDN. The delegation will determine the conditions of the purchase by Turkey of 3 million barrels of crude oil from Iran. This deal was decided on at the Turkey-Iran Joint Economic Commission meeting in Tehran in February. The talks will also focus on the economic difficulties facing both countries. Iran, which is trying to reschedule its foreign debts to Western countries, is expected to propose repaying its $70 million debt to Turkey in cash instead of with crude oil, despite its shortage of foreign currency. Turkish and Iranian officials will discuss how to develop the two countries' secondary resources with the aim of increasing their revenues. Economic relations and opportunities for cooperation with the Central Asian republics will be two of the main items discussed during the talks. Security Talks Meanwhile, the eighth Turkey-Iran Joint Security Committee meeting is continuing in Tehran, having begun on Monday. Interior Ministry Deputy Undersecretary Muharrem Goktayoglu is attending the meeting, as the head of the Turkish delegation. Decisions reached in previous security meetings and the activities of the subcommittees are among the topics being debated. The committee is working on developing new policies to be implemented in the future. The Joint Security Committee was established by a security agreement signed in 1992 in Tehran. According to this agreement, Iran has been handing over members of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) to Turkey. The security agreement foresees the type of cooperation between Turkey and Iran that will lead these countries to handing over individuals who are suspected of perpetrating acts against either country. Within the framework of this agreement, joint security committees and subcommittees hold periodic meetings to discuss latest security developments.
