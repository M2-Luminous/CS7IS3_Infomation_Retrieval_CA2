FR940407-0-00079 FR940407-0-00014 The final rules reflect that it most appropriately falls to the States to determine the type and extent of benefits sharing that is practicable and appropriate, given the unique circumstances that any particular discretionary EIP is designed to address. Therefore, the final rules do not require any specific formula for benefit sharing. However, the final rules do recognize that the issue of benefits sharing will be part of the political consensus building process associated with designing a discretionary EIP. In assessing this issue, States should not confuse this sharing with accounting for uncertainty in an EIP. Since uncertainty is to be accounted for through compliance and programmatic uncertainty factors (see paragraph III.F.), determining a degree of sharing based on weighing the uncertainty in an EIP would in essence be accounting twice for the same uncertainty. One commenter also argued that the requirements for attainment as expeditiously as practicable [section 181(a)(1)] and for imposition of reasonably available control measures [section 172(c)(1)] mandate the inclusion of emission fees in EIP's. The EPA encourages States to consider emissions fees, but does not believe that, at present, their impacts are sufficiently well understood in all cases to conclude that, for all EIP's, they are either practicable or reasonably available. B. Interface With Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) and Other Statutory Requirements 1. RACT The proposal was based on an interpretation of the statutory RACT requirements that authorizes sources subject to the statutory RACT requirements (RACT sources) to meet their RACT obligations in the aggregate (i.e., through trading among themselves), and, when such trading results in an exceptional environmental benefit, by acquiring emissions reductions from non-RACT sources (as discussed in paragraph II.D.2.). Further, the proposal defined exceptional environmental benefits in terms of the statutory offset ratios for nonattainment areas and other demonstrations of exceptional long-term environmental benefits. With regard to meeting RACT in the aggregate, all but one commenter agreed with the proposed position that trading be allowed among all RACT sources. Further, these commenters generally felt that such RACT trading should produce emissions reductions that are equivalent to those that would be obtained if each source met its source category-specific RACT limit. On the other hand, one environmental group disagreed with the proposed position allowing all sources covered by RACT requirements to trade among themselves. This commenter stated that nothing in the Act specifically authorizes substituting any trading regime for source-specific RACT requirements. However, if the EPA allows trading to meet RACT requirements, only trading within a given RACT source category should be allowed since section 182(b)(2) addresses RACT by source categories. Further, this commenter stated that since RACT limits have historically been set based on source-specific economic and technical constraints, ``tradeable'' RACT limits must be based on an analysis of the cost savings achievable by meeting RACT through whatever trading approach is permitted in the RACT rule. Since trading approaches provide increased compliance flexibility and cost savings, the commenter believes that any ``tradeable'' RACT limits should be lower than source-specific RACT limits. With regard to RACT/non-RACT trading in general, most commenters, including industry, State and local agencies, and an environmental group, supported such trading. Some stated that any regulation which requires certain reductions to be obtained at specified sources, and nowhere else, contradicts a ``market-based'' approach. They felt that the broadest possible participation in a trading market should be encouraged so as to achieve the most benefits from the program. Some commenters felt that allowing RACT/non-RACT trading encourages the development of new technologies and facilitates obtaining controls on previously unregulated sources and source categories. Limiting trades to particular source categories was thought by some to substantially reduce both the incentives and savings available. Such comments were premised on the belief that trading between different source categories (involving both RACT and non-RACT categories) can have sufficient controls and safeguards built in to ensure compliance. On the other hand, other environmental groups opposed RACT/non-RACT trading. One such commenter asserted that statutory language regarding RACT ``sources'' only refers to stationary sources, such that trading between RACT sources and mobile sources would violate the Act. Further, this commenter asserted that such trading would make it impossible for States to manage mobile source and stationary source budgets properly for purposes of demonstrating RFP and attainment. The other environmental group commended the EPA's objectives, and approved its means in theory, of allowing trades between mobile and stationary sources, but concluded that the time for trading between stationary and mobile sources has not arrived. This conclusion was premised in part on the belief that trading between RACT sources and mobile sources violates the Act, because it is impossible to determine whether a given mobile source emission reduction is truly surplus. Further, both commenters felt that mobile source emissions reductions could not be reliably quantified.
