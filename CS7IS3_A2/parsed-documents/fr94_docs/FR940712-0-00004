Order Denying Clarification and Rehearing; Order No. 563&hyph;B Standards for Electronic Bulletin Boards Required Under Part 284 of the Commission's Regulations [Docket No. RM93&hyph;4&hyph;003] Before Commissioners: Elizabeth Anne Moler, Chair; Vicky A. Bailey, James J. Hoecker, William L. Massey, and Donald F. Santa, Jr. Issued: July 1, 1994. On June 1, 1994, ANR Pipeline Company (ANR) filed a request for clarification or, in the alternative, for rehearing of Order No. 563&hyph;A. 1 ANR seeks clarification that the Commission will not require all pipelines to provide an electronic Index of Purchasers, or, in the alternative, rehearing of the Commission's decision adopting this requirement. The Commission denies the request for clarification and rehearing as premature. 1 Standards For Electronic Bulletin Boards Required Under Part 284 of the Commission's Regulations, Order No. 563, 59 FR 516 (Jan. 5, 1994), III FERC Stats. & Regs. Preambles ¶30,988 (Dec. 23, 1993), order on reh'g , Order No. 563&hyph;A, 59 FR 23624 (May 6, 1994), III FERC Stats. & Regs. Preambles ¶30,994 (May 2, 1994). Background In Order No. 563, the Commission adopted a final rule establishing standards governing the electronic dissemination of information relating to transportation of natural gas. The standards generally reflected consensus agreements reached by industry Working Groups composed of members from all facets of the gas industry. Parties had proposed to include in the standards an electronic Index of Purchasers which would disclose certain information about the capacity rights of shippers on pipelines. The Working Groups, however, were unable to reach consensus on an approach, and a number of participants submitted alternative approaches. One proposal, supported by 44 participants, was to replace some of the Commission's reporting requirements relating to firm and interruptible transportation with an electronic Index composed of nine data elements, available in downloadable form. 2 2 The proposal would replace the Commission's initial and subsequent reports (but not the annual reports and bypass reports) and the requirement to include an Index of Purchasers in pipeline tariffs. In Order No. 563&hyph;A, the Commission found that this proposal had significant merit because it would provide useful information to the market about capacity, while setting the stage for reducing filing burdens and streamlining the Commission's reporting requirements. The Commission expressed interest in pursuing this proposal further and instructed Commission staff to work with the industry Working Groups to develop a final proposal by September 30, 1994. ANR contends the Commission's order is not clear on whether the Index of Purchasers will be adopted upon the submission of the September 30, 1994 report, without an opportunity for further comment. It argues that the Commission should clarify whether this proposal is still open for discussion. In addition, ANR questions whether the Index of Purchasers is needed to promote the Commission's capacity release objectives. It agrees that such an Index does offer the advantage of reducing reporting and tariff requirements, but maintains that, if the Commission adopts the Index for that reason, it should do so only if it concomitantly eliminates the other reporting requirements. Finally, ANR argues that if the Commission requires information not covered by the existing reporting requirements, the Commission must justify the inclusion of such information. In particular, ANR contends the Commission should not require dissemination of competitively sensitive information. Discussion The Commission denies ANR's request that the Commission clarify that pipelines will not have to adopt the Index of Purchasers and ANR's alternative request for rehearing. ANR's requests at this point are premature. In Order No. 563&hyph;A, the Commission only expressed interest in pursuing the Index of Purchasers proposal, but did not make a final determination on the issue. After receiving the September 30, 1994 report from the Working Group, the Commission will evaluate the proposal and determine how best to proceed. As the Commission stated in Order No. 563&hyph;A, the Commission will comply with the Administrative Procedure Act and will provide notice and an opportunity for comment prior to making any changes or revisions to the standards. 3 Thus, ANR will have the opportunity to have its views considered at the appropriate time. 3 Order No. 563&hyph;A, III FERC Stats. & Regs. Preambles at 31,036&hyph;37. The Commission orders: The request for clarification and rehearing is denied. By the Commission. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
