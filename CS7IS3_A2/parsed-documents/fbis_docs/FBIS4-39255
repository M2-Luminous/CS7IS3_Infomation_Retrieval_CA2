No Mines, But There Could Be"] [Text] The Pacific Fleet Command has notified the inhabitants of Maritime Kray (Far East) of the completion of work on clearing the territories of population centers and agricultural land in the proximity of the Pacific Fleet's arms dump at Novonezhino (70 km from Vladivostok). A fire and an explosion occurred at that dump 14-15 May as a result of servicemen's negligence, causing economic damage to the region in excess of 30 billion rubles. The explosion scattered a large quantity of ammunition around the nearby areas, posing a threat to the population. Sappers and others involved in eliminating the aftermath of the explosion have also fully inspected a 3-km-wide belt around the dump and rendered harmless dangerous explosive objects. The population can now embark on normal activities, while being urged not to slacken vigilance. On 31 May a 2-meter rocket thrown out by the blast wave 15 days previously was extracted from the ground in the truck garden of a resident of the village of Romanovka, which is approximately 10 km from the epicenter of the explosions, the newspaper VLADIVOSTOK has reported.
