Develops Evaluation Technology for Ultra High Vacuum Materials Using Molecular Beam 94FE0101E Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 22 Oct 93 p 7 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 94FE0101E Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:CSO [Text] [Nagoya] The group led by Professor Tetsuo Fujimoto, who is the head of the Department of Engineering at Nagoya University, developed a molecular beam technology for evaluating material surfaces of space shuttles and vacuum containers. By applying the technology on stainless steel, the group discovered that surface modification by means of silver ion plating was the most effective way to obtain an ultra-high vacuum material. The technology involves irradiation of the surface of a material with an ultra-high-speed molecular beam, which passes through a rotating disk with slits and is cut into small segments, and the detection and analysis of the scattered molecular beams. This technology is suitable for composition analysis of a material's surface in many fields, including semiconductor surface analysis. Ultraviolet, light-dissociated atomic oxygen exists more than 100 km above the ground, and oxygen atoms are the main component 200-700 km above the ground. Thus, the materials used to construct a space shuttle are exposed to these elements in space and subjected to surface corrosion due to chemical reactions. Also, the interference and adsorption of gaseous molecules on vacuum container material surfaces have caused problems. Many studies have been conducted to modify the surfaces of vacuum materials, which have been evaluated by measuring the quantities of gases emitted by the materials. In particular, for the development of a new material, it is necessary to clearly understand the behavior of gaseous molecules at the material's surface. For this reason, Professor Fujimoto's group developed a gaseous molecular beam method that enabled direct examination of material surfaces. The molecular beam used by the group involved two noble gases, helium and argon. This molecular beam was irradiated obliquely on the surface of a stainless steel piece, which is a commonly used vacuum material, and the reflected molecular beams were analyzed with a quadrupolar mass-spectroscopic analyzer. From these data, the group clarified the correlations between kinetic energy, surface temperature, incident angle and reflection angle, and the group was able to confirm that the superimposition of two spectra corresponding to the scattering and the adsorption/desorption processes was effective for the analysis of the spectra of reflected molecular beams. As a result, the group concluded that ion plating was necessary to reduce the adsorption of gas molecules on the surface of stainless steel. The experiment was repeated with a piece of silver ion-plated stainless steel, and it was proven that the silver ion plating was an effective surface modification technology in obtaining ultra-high vacuum. Various ways to apply this technology are being examined to check material surfaces contaminated by gas molecules. Separately from this research project, Professor Fujimoto's group is in the process of developing a laser technology for detecting dilute gases.
