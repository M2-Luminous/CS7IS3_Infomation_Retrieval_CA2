He has allowed himself six months before taking action, and between 18 and 24 months to straighten out the enterprise. Jean-Marie Decarpentries, a raider in the view of those employees who have met him, has won over clients and collaborators, impressed by his charisma, almost despite themselves. "He is the president who perhaps can save Bull," says Jean-Pierre Muller, president of the Cube, the club of Bull users. Jean-Marie Descarpentries's has set out decisively on the road toward his goal, which is: To recover operational equilibrium by the end of 1994 instead of in 1995 as had been planned by his predecessor, Bernard Pache. To this end, he has organized two think-tank committees, one of them dedicated to persons and jobs, and the other to the profitability of activities. "The sectors that are unprofitable, I shall liquidate," he has warned. Bull's new CEO has chosen his model: Hewlett-Packard, which has one of the industry's best productivity-per-employee ratios, and is one of the sector's only manufacturers to be making money. A plan of action is expected to be submitted to the group's executive committee by the end of the month. The committee could revise the plan at that session. The plan will call for a strengthening of ties with the company's shareholder NEC. Jean-Marie Descarpentries visited Japan this week. The object of the maneuver: Augment the synergy between the two manufacturers, share the production of components, and increase the compatibility of the operating softwares of big mainframe systems. Cooperation may also be under consideration in the field of portables, inasmuch as NEC, as a supplier of screens and microcomputers, is seeking to emerge from its domestic market. For the moment, Bull will settle its debts, which are to reduced from 9.4 billion francs [Fr] to Fr2.4 billion, through a compression of its capital. This operation will be ratified by a general meeting of its stockholders, scheduled for mid-December. The credit for this operation goes to Bernard Pache, who planned it... Jean-Marie Descarpentries, who has been given the task of imparting new sheen to Bull's tarnished image, stands to gain from the heritage left to him by his predecessor. After rendering an elaborate homage to Bernard Pache, Descarpentries asserted that he has no intention of changing his decisions.
