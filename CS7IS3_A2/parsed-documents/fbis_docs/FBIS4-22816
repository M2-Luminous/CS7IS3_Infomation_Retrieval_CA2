They were separated from the residual solid products by treating the latter first with an organic solvent (saturated or aromatic hydrocarbon) at a temperature of 400� and pressure of 250 atm and then with a mixture of concentrated H[.sub]2[/]SO[.sub]4[/] and HNO[.sub]3[/]. In aqueous solutions, the ultradisperse diamonds (3 to 8 x 10[.sup]-3[/] �m in diameter) thus separated formed aggregates up to 200 �m in size. Externally, the ultradisperse diamonds were a dense dark gray powder. Elemental analysis established that they consisted of the following (percent): C, 78.6-78.8; H, 0.65-0.70; O, 16.5-17.0; N, 1.78-2.16; and ash residue, 2.47-1.34. The large amounts of oxygen found in the functional groups on the surface of the ultradisperse diamonds were attributed to the oxidation treatment, as well as to the presence of oxygen (and nitrogen) in the diamonds' defect lattices in the form of various impurity centers during the shock-compression synthesis process. A comparison of the infrared spectra of the ultradisperse diamonds before and after modification confirmed the stability of the diamonds' different functional groups and the change in the chemical state of their surfaces. The presence of different types of nitrogen impurity centers in the ultradisperse diamonds was also confirmed by infrared spectroscopy. Figures 2, table 1; references 9: 7 Russian, 2 Western.
