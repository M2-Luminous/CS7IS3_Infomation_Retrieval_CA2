The call on talks for preparations for a peace conference comes after a meeting of Bougainvillians in Solomon Islands capital, Honiara, on Tuesday. The Bougainvillians issued a joint statement asking the PNG Government to urgently consider calling a cease-fire so that senior leaders of the Bougainville Revolutionary Army [BRA] could attend the meeting. The statement said the terms of the cease-fire could be negotiated. The statement said a lasting peace and amicable solution to the Bougainville conflict could only be solved by the people of the island themselves working together with all sides involved. A scheduled meeting earlier this week to discuss a peace conference fell through because senior BRA leaders said that they could not attend.
