Stressing that she "is more sensitive than anyone else" on the question of safeguarding the rights of the Turkish Cypriot side, Ciller asserted: "We will do nothing that will conflict with the interests of Turkey and north Cyprus." On the Cyprus problem itself, Ciller said: "Nothing has taken place to cause alarm." Prime Minister Ciller replied to journalists' questions during the reception Speaker of Parliament Husamettin Cindoruk held in the Turkish Grand National Assembly yesterday for Children's Day, which is celebrated on 23 April. Regarding a question on President Clinton's statement on Cyprus, she said: "Denktas has approved the package of confidence-building measures [CBM's]. Is that not so? However, he approved the first package. Certain changes were made in the second package. What we have said is that they should reconsider the matter and agree if they can do so. The Foreign Ministry is well informed on the matter. Nothing else has been said outside that framework. Therefore, there is nothing to cause alarm." In a statement through the Prime Minister's Office Press Center yesterday, Ciller said that the Cyprus problem was "definitely" not discussed in the talks she had with President Clinton in camera after the two delegations met in the White House on 14 April. However, Ciller refrained from divulging President Clinton's views. Nevertheless, she outlined her own views, which were conveyed to the Foreign Ministry in a coded message. Ciller said that President Clinton recalled the deadlock in the talks on the CBM's package. She explained that she responded as follows: "The TRNC [Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus] agreed in principle to the original CBM's package. Turkey supported the TRNC in that regard. Later, however, the package was changed. An effort to reconcile the views of the two sides and have the talks on the package resumed by the end of April will be useful." The press center's statement noted that the records of the Clinton-Ciller meeting were conveyed to the Foreign Ministry on the same day.
