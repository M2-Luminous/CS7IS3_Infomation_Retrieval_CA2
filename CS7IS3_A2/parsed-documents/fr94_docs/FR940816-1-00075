FR940816-1-00075 FR940816-1-00011 In 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;512), Congress directed appointment of a Wolf Management Committee, composed of 3 Federal, 3 State and 4 interest group representatives, to develop a plan for wolf restoration to Yellowstone and central Idaho. That Committee provided a majority, but not unanimous, recommendation to Congress in May 1991. Among the measures recommended was a declaration by Congress directing reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone National Park, and possibly central Idaho, as a special nonessential experimental population with particularly liberal management by agencies and the public to resolve potential conflicts. Wolves and ungulates under that plan would be intensively managed by the States with Federal funding and thus implementation costs were estimated to be high. Congress took no action on the Committee's recommendation. In November 1991 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;154), Congress directed the Service, in consultation with the National Park Service and Forest Service, to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS), that considered a broad range of alternatives on wolf reintroduction to Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho. In 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;381), Congress directed the Service to complete the EIS by January 1994 and indicated that the preferred alternative should be consistent with existing law. The Service formed and funded an interagency team to prepare the EIS. In addition to the National Park Service and Forest Service, the States of Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana, USDA Animal Damage Control, and the Wind River and Nez Perce Tribes participated. The Gray Wolf EIS program emphasized public participation. In the spring of 1992, nearly 2,500 groups or individuals that had previously expressed an interest in wolves were directly contacted and the EIS program was widely publicized by the news media. In April 1992, a series of 27 ``issue scoping'' open houses were held in Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho and 7 more in other locations throughout the U.S. The meetings were attended by nearly 1,800 people and thousands of brochures were distributed. Nearly 4,000 people provided their thoughts on issues they felt should be addressed in the EIS. A report describing the public's comments was mailed to 16,000 people in July 1992. In August 1992, another series of 27 ``alternative scoping'' open houses and 3 hearings were held in Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho. Three other hearings were held in Seattle, WA, Salt Lake City, UT, and Washington DC. In addition, a copy of the alternative scoping brochure was inserted into a Sunday edition of the two major newspapers in Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho (total circulation about 250,000). Nearly 2,000 people attended the meetings and nearly 5,000 comments were received about different ways that wolf recovery might be managed. Public comments reflected the strong polarization that has typified management of wolves. A report on the public's ideas and suggestions was mailed to about 30,000 people in November 1992. In April 1993, a Gray Wolf EIS planning update report was published. It discussed the status of the EIS, provided factual information about wolves, and requested the public to report observations of wolves in the northern Rocky Mountains. It was mailed to nearly 40,000 people that had requested information, residing in all 50 states and over 40 foreign countries. The public comment period on the draft EIS (DEIS) began on July 1, 1993, and the notice of availability was published July 16. Full DEIS documents were mailed to potentially affected agencies, public libraries, many interest groups and to all who requested the complete DEIS. In addition, the DEIS summary, a schedule of the 16 hearings, and a request to report wolf sightings were printed in a flyer that was inserted into the Sunday edition of 6 newspapers in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho with a combined circulation of about 280,000. In mid-June 1993, the Service sent out a letter to over 300 groups, primarily in Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho offering a presentation on the DEIS. As a result, 31 presentations were given to about 1,000 people during the comment period on the DEIS. During the public review period from July 1 to November 26, 1993, on the DEIS, comments were received from over 160,200 individuals, organizations, and government agencies. This degree of public response indicated the strong interest people have in the management of wolves. A summary of the public comments was mailed to about 42,000 people on the EIS mailing list in early March 1994. The final EIS was filed with the Environmental Protection Agency on May 4, 1994, and a notice of availability was published on May 9, 1994. The reintroduction of nonessential experimental populations of gray wolves to Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho was the Service's proposed action. The four alternatives considered in detail in the EIS were (1) Natural Recovery (No action), (2) No wolf, (3) Wolf Management Committee, and (4) Reintroduction of Nonexperimental Wolves. The Record of Decision on the EIS was signed by the Secretary of the Interior on June 15, 1994. The Secretary of Agriculture signed a letter concurring with that decision on July 13, 1994. The decision directed the implementation of the Service's proposed action as soon as practical.
