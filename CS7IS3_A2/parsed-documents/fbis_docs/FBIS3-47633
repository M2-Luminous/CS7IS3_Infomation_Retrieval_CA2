In a comparative survey in April, June, September and November last year, Daewoo found a drop in the total number of accounts at its branches after it became mandatory to use real names, but a fast rise in large deposits. Accounts totaled 605,717 in April, rose 3.91 percent to 629,422 in June, fell 13.66 percent to 543,470 in September and sank 6.29 percent to 509,289 in November. Large deposits, above 100 million won (123,304 U.S. dollars), totaled 4,207 in April, rose 6.99 percent to 4,501 in June, dropped 6.51 percent to 4,208 in September and, immediately after introduction of the real-name system, recovered 9.13 percent to 4,592 in November. Large deposits accounted for 0.69 percent of the total accounts in April, 0.72 percent in June, 0.77 percent in September, and 0.9 percent in November. They made their way to the stock market because they had little choice of places to go after the real-name system took effect, a Daewoo official said. Large deposits grew 59 each in Kangnam and Kangpuk, both in Seoul, 47 in Pusan, and 44 in South Kyongsang Province during September-November.
