The draft state budget does not resolve the relationship between the Ministry of Finance and the National Bank of Slovakia which must finance the budget deficit. Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus said that he would discuss the issue with the bank's governor Vladimir Masar. An amendment to the Law on the Central Bank will then be drawn up in July, which will probably increase the payments that the bank has to make to the state budget. Last year, the bank financed a 23 billion crown deficit and the state had to pay 9.6 billion crowns in interest. The bank only made budget contributions of six billion crowns. The amendment increases health expenditures by 1.8 billion and education by 1.2 billion crowns. Costs for family benefits will also be higher. The government also proposes the creation of a reserve for guarantees for social insurance funds. It wants to ensure higher revenues through already prepared increases in value-added and excise taxes. "If the parliament fails to approve the tax laws, the government will withdraw the draft amendment on the state budget," Schmognerova remarked. The amendment also allocates 500 million crowns from the National Property Fund for comprehensive housing construction and 245.5 million crowns for projects converting arms production to civilian purposes, which should already have been financed last year. A total of 3.5 billion crowns from the Fund's money is to be spent on other development programs. Filkus said the draft amendment is conditional on the Slovak Government's obligations to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
