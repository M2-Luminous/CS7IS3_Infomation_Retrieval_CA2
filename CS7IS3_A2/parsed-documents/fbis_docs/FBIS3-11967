At first, it says that the circumstances that existed at the time President de Leon Carpio began his mandate no longer prevail and that the people's expectations have once again been sneered at because, as in the past, the military and economic powers still dominate the country's fate. The URNG claims that the government's partiality is evinced by comparing the prompt solution given to the demands of fuel carriers and the owners of urban transportation vehicles with the police and Army suppression on residents of Santa Lucia Cotzulmaguapa, Escuintla. The indifference shown regarding the murder of a religious leader in San Lucas Toliman, Solola, and the manner in which the government deals with the demands of state employees are other examples. The URNG also refers to the support the president has given the Civilian Self-Defense Patrols [PAC], and his willingness to serve military interests through rewards and salary increases denied others. It stresses the lack of resources in hospitals and the violent removal of people that invade lands, which very much follow the pattern set by predecessors Cerezo and Serrano. The URNG points out that the attack on the San Juan River, at the 20-km marker of the Atlantic Highway, was perpetrated by the military itself, thus reflecting the existing division in the Army which was confirmed by General Quilo Ayuso in his statement. The URNG indicates that the current crisis of ungovernability actually seeks to trigger social explosions, like the one in Santa Lucia Cotzumalguapa, to prolong and increase suppression and to impose a state of exception. The possibility of a coup d'etat, however, should not be discarded. Last, it warns PAC's not to lend themselves to the suppression of popular demands because if they do, as has happened until now, they will be attacked by the guerrillas to break, in this manner, the truce declared with them.
