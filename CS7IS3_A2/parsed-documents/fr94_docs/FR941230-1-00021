FR941230-1-00021 FR941230-1-00004 An agenda showing the scheduling of the speakers will be prepared after the deadline for receiving outlines has passed. Copies of the agenda will be available free of charge at the hearing. Comment is solicited on all aspects of the proposed regulations. In addition, comment is specifically solicited on the following topics: (1) the desirability of adopting the closing agreement procedure for noncompliance in lieu of providing for defeasance, other situations in which the closing agreement procedure, if adopted, should apply, and whether other procedures should be available to issuers; (2) the condition that, in order to take certain remedial actions, certain bonds must contain early redemption provisions; (3) additional limitations on the application of the disposition proceeds rules to reduce administrative burdens on issuers and whether the disposition proceeds rules should apply for purposes of section 148; (4) problems resulting from rules binding an issuer to the form of its transaction (see, for example, New York City v. Commissioner, 103 T.C. No. 27 (1994)); (5) the application of the private security or payment test to variable yield issues; (6) other circumstances in which issuers should be permitted to finance the government use portion of a mixed use facility; (7) the required consistency between arbitrage and private activity bond allocations of proceeds; (8) the treatment of requirements contracts as output contracts; and (9) safe harbors for provisions of the regulations requiring determinations of reasonableness or fair market value. Drafting Information The principal author of these regulations is William P. Cejudo of the Office of Assistant Chief Counsel (Financial Institutions and Products). However, other personnel from the Service and Treasury Department participated in their development. List of Subjects in 26 CFR Part 1 Income taxes, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
