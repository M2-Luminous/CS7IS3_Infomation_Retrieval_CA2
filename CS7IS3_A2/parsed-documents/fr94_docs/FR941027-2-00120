FR941027-2-00120 FR941027-2-00072 International activities and cooperation regarding global climate change are discussed in Chapter 7. The Climate Convention requires all Parties to communicate a national inventory of greenhouse gas emissions and sinks and describe measures taken to implement the convention. To help developing countries meet this commitment, the U.S. initiated its Country Studies program in 1992. This program is providing technical and financial support to developing countries and countries with economies in transition to help them prepare studies to address climate change. Chapter 7 also highlights other ways in which the United States is implementing its financial commitments under the Convention, including numerous U.S. bilateral mitigation projects as well as multilateral cooperation through such organizations as the Global Environment Facility, multilateral development banks, the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, the International Energy Agency, and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation organization. The final chapter of the Climate Action Report addresses future actions to address climate change. In this chapter, two important issues are raised: (1) the uncertainties in projecting the effectiveness of current actions to meet the U.S. domestic commitment to return greenhouse gas emissions to their 1990 levels by the year 2000, and (2) the long-term actions that must be taken to address global warming_as greenhouse gas emissions will continue to rise beyond the turn of the millenium. Preparation of the Report The U.S. Climate Action Report was prepared in a broad interagency process, incorporating_to the greatest extent possible_data from all relevant sectors and programs. Preliminary versions of the Report were circulated to nongovernmental organizations, including environmental and business groups, for their review and comment. Where possible, suggestions received were incorporated into this text.
