FBIS4-17965 "drsov083_a_94007" FBIS-SOV-94-083 Daily Report 28 Apr 1994 RUSSIA INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Interview With Black Sea Fleet Commander Interview With Black Sea Fleet Commander LD2804165994 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1304 GMT 28 Apr 94 LD2804165994 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN ["Exclusive" report No. 17 of 67] [Text] According to politologists, the negotiations between Russian and Ukrainian Defense Ministers on a stage-by-stage settlement of the Black Sea Fleet problem held on April 21-22 in Sevastopol were fruitless. The delegations of two countries have not signed any documents. At the same time the Russian party refused to sign the protocol of the negotiations "due to non-constructive position of the Ukrainian delegation," as one of the members of the Russian delegation said. As experts assert, Kiev's position presents the major stumbling-block because it deems it possible to preserve the Black Sea Fleet in Crimea only on a temporary basis and insists on a joint basing of the Black Sea Fleet and Ukraine's Navy in Sevastopol. At the same time the parties reached an agreement stipulating that Kiev would receive 18.3 percent of the Fleet's ships and Russia would buy the remaining part. To this effect Admiral EDUARD BALTIN, commander of the Black Sea Fleet, answered the questions put by our Interfax correspondent Sergey Safronov. IF: The first and the major question which I would like to put to you is the division of the Black Sea Fleet. All Russians, but not only servicemen, are deeply concerned over this fact. E.BALTIN: This problem is unclear until now. The Ukrainian side puts forward quite different variants regarding the Fleet's division, including the 50:50 proportion. However, it is not clear for me what this means. It is necessary to take into account the value of the property destined to division but not only its quantity. We should introduce definite factors. For example, the value of one naval engineer college in Holland is equal to the value of a half of the Black Sea Fleet because there are many mechanisms and equipment in the college, including atomic reactors for submarines of two generations. At the present stage Ukraine proposes to Russia to divide the Black Sea Fleet after its inventory as of December 1, 1992, that is as of the day I took the office of the Black Sea Fleet commander. However, it is known that before this date Ukraine had already misappropriated 35 percent of the Fleet, including material reserves of the Black Sea Fleet's rear service. According to available information, total losses of the Black Sea Fleet are 101,658 million rubles in 1991 prices. IF: What are the largest sites misappropriated by Kiev? E.BALTIN: First of all, I'd like to note that Russia has lost two naval colleges and a unique center for re-training of naval aviation pilots - it was the sole center in the USSR; the country paid several billion rubles for its construction. The center was used for training of carrier aviation pilots. There was a unique equipment for aircraft's landing, a runway strip with warming, a springboard, etc. A factory for the repair of all major kinds of the Fleet's aviation equipment was in the center in addition to the training base. Now Kiev tries to let this center to Russia. In my opinion, it would be erroneous to rent it because for Moscow it would be a gold rent - a company of SU-27 aircraft assigned to the 60th corps of Ukraine's air defense forces, an aviation grouping near the city of Saki, and the Ukrainian garrison will be maintained at the expense of this rent. In addition, there is an agreement between the governments of the Russian Federation and Ukraine on the cooperation in the sphere of ship building and ship repair signed on January 15, 1993 by the former Ukrainian premier Leonid Kuchma and Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin. In accordance with this agreement the Russian party pledges to supply Kiev with accessory equipment, material resources, armaments, and other military equipment for the ships being built by Ukraine's Navy. Kiev has received a missile cruiser Slava, minor antisubmarine and assault landing crafts, and a patrol boat. These ships were almost ready for exploitation (their readiness was 65-85 percent). The time has passed but Ukraine has not built a single ship. However, it has re-named the missile cruiser two times, at first it was called Bogdan Khmelnitskiy (the initiator of Ukraine's reunification with Russia in XVII century - Interfax) and now - Vilna Ukraina. It is almost ready for 90 percent and Kiev has no force to finish its construction. Meanwhile, the cruiser has 16 rocket launchers with the range 500 kilometers. There are no such ships either in the Black or in the Mediterranean Seas, or in the composition of the 6th Fleet of the US Navy... Besides, the Ukrainian party started to dismantle the cruiser Varyag at the Nikolayev shipyards which was almost ready for service; Ukraine intends to cut the cruiser for metal. The cruiser Ulyanovsk can face the same fate. Destruction of the Fleet is practically underway. I believe that in this case Ukraine has inflicted damage not only to Russia because these ships were the national treasury of all peoples of the Soviet Union. IF: It's not quite clear, why do we need to make inventory of the Black Sea Fleet if a strict registration of all material resources is obligatory held at the Fleet... E.BALTIN: I believe that this inventory is nothing more but an attempt of the Ukrainian party to prolong solution of this issue and to avoid the agreements reached by Russian and Ukrainian presidents earlier and a strive "to dig in an alien bag." Both Russian and Ukrainian military departments know everything about the Black Sea Fleet, they know about every screw, not speaking about the ships. I'd like to note that in contradiction to the Yalta agreements, since last August Kiev stopped to finance training of the Ukrainian Navy personnel which is being carried out on the base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet and takes much money. For example, in the US Navy training of one naval conscript, which is to last 48 days on international standards, costs more than 5000 dollars. Ukrainian mariners are undergoing a more serious training in the training detachments of the Russian Black Sea Fleet and receive military professions almost free of charge. The majority of Ukrainians (thousands of them are on service in the Black Sea Fleet) finish their training in the rank of petty officers and are well-trained. As a commander, I do not have any claims to mariners who swore the oath of allegiance to Ukraine, they serve splendidly. Especially strong personnel is being called up in Ukraine's western regions where conscripts undergo moral training in military commissariats. The conscripts are explained that they will be Ukraine's "gold fund" and the Ukrainian people need them badly. There have been no inter-ethnic conflicts among rank-and-file personnel. Ordinary people understand everything. IF: But it is quite natural that Ukraine needs its own Navy. E.BALTIN: I believe that Ukraine claims for a part of the Black Sea Fleet ships only in order to immediately sell them abroad as scrap amounting to 120-140 dollars per ton. At the same time, currently Kiev is experiencing the deepest crisis and does not understand what threat for the country pose those thousands of mariners who will be thrown into streets. IF: Once upon a time you said that there is little water in the Black Sea and much politics... E.BALTIN: The situation has not changed. As a matter of fact, there is too much politics around the Black Sea Fleet but economy decides everything. I believe that extreme political decisions are adopted at the time when the country's leaders understand that the economy is experiencing a crisis. This results in a confrontation between peoples. IF: Over the last period of time several Ukrainian politicians, including high-ranking ones, have voiced their statements to draw "a third party" to solve the Black Sea Fleet problems, they even called a concrete address -- the United States. What is your attitude towards this fact? E.BALTIN: I can express only my perplexity on this case. Personally I categorically oppose Washington's participation. It's primarily Russia's problem. Given historic and political realities, Moscow is negotiating with Kiev. It's hardly probable that the Russian Federation will negotiate on the Fleet with the involvement of the American party. In general, I believe that having interpreted the Moscow agreement signed by presidents Kravchuk and Yeltsin on its own way, Kiev has violated one of the major articles of this agreement, namely on separate basing of the Russian Black Sea Fleet and Ukraine's Navy. I am convinced that the presence of two Fleets and headquarters in one place of stationing disorganizes the work of the servicemen and destabilizes the situation in Sevastopol. In case the situation does not change, consequences can be unpredictable. In my opinion, absence of money for the construction of its own base is the major reason of this position on the part of Kiev. It's easier to live for somebody's money. IF: What influence can exert the present situation in the Black Sea Fleet on the international situation? E.BALTIN: The activity of the West's forces on the Black Sea is being strengthened because any vacuum in the political space should be filled. Last year NATO's 15 ships visited the Black Sea in accordance with planned exercises, with the participation of Bulgarian and Romanian fleets as well. There has been no such an intensive pressure before. According to available information, a conference of NATO's Allied armed forces was held late October which passed a decision to include the Black Sea into the zone of NATO's interests. According to the unanimously adopted document, a formation of NATO's ships consisting of 8-9 crafts should be created in this region; it will exert control over the activity of other fleets in the Black Sea. Turkey has procured eight Knox frigates which are equipped with missiles. The Turkish fleet has enormously increased its missile potential. IF: What is your attitude towards joint exercises which are conducted between the fleets of the Russian Federation and NATO? E.BALTIN: Such an exercise was conducted in the Norwegian Sea not long ago. One destroyer participated in it on the part of the Russian North Fleet. A three-star admiral was aboard this destroyer, However, a Norwegian rear admiral was commanding at the exercises, it corresponds to the level of a brigade commander... IF: The Republic of Crimea has its first president - Yuriy Meshkov. How you would build your relations with him? I'd like to note that in contradiction to the Yalta agreements, since last August Kiev stopped to finance training of the Ukrainian Navy personnel which is being carried out on the base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet and takes much money. For example, in the US Navy training of one naval conscript, which is to last 48 days on international standards, costs more than 5000 dollars.

IF: The Republic of Crimea has its first president - Yuriy Meshkov. How you would build your relations with him? E.BALTIN: Meshkov has made several resolute political moves and this testifies to the fact that he is a resolute man; as any military man I respect resolute people. At the same time I believe that Meshkov has not made any constitutional violations. IF: How the polemics around the Black Sea Fleet has influenced its combat efficiency? E.BALTIN: The level of combat efficiency has not lowered compared, say, with 1990. The Black Sea Fleet has received various awards for rocket firing, torpedo firings from submarines, and for the operations of the tactical group of missile boats. The marine infantry battalion on fire preparation, which is the best in Russia, serves at the Black Sea Fleet. IF: What is your opinion concerning the plans to create a Russian naval base in the Georgian port of Poti? E.BALTIN: I see no sense in this idea. This zone is deserted by the war; does Russia need this burden, is it not beneficial to build a base on its own territory? There are suitable places for this, say, in the region of Anapa. There exist well developed infrastructures there. One should bear in mind two notions, military necessity and economic expediency. Any operation, even if it is thoroughly prepared, will fail if it has no material support. Economy but not a military commander is the major winner in a war. IF: Are Russian ships on service in the Mediterranean Sea now? E.BALTIN: The Black Sea Fleet is permanently stationing there but given our economic opportunities the number of Russian ships in the Mediterranean Sea is a minimum one, there are less than ten ships there. IF: Has the Black Sea Fleet suffered due to the fact that Ukraine stopped power supply to Crimea for some time? E.BALTIN: Of course, the Fleet has experienced several losses, we were forced to use our own power supply systems, diesel generators, and boiling-rooms, as a result we have spent a great amount of fuel. It is known, that Ukraine is provided with its own resources only for 30 percent, it receives the rest amount from Russia. Consequently, Kiev has no right to speak about possible energy blockade of Crimea. In case it takes place, the Black Sea Fleet can lay several underwater power cables via the Kerchenskiy bay to Russia within two or three months and solve this problem. It is quite possible from the technical point of view. IF: They say that you perfectly shoot from any kinds of arms... E.BALTIN: This is my hobby. I think that every officer, irrespective of the fact where he serves, should possess good skills in order to shoot any kinds of arms.
