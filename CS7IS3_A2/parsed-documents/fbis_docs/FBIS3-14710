Lebanon's AL-SAFIR says that Israel played a key role in planning these operations. Two Israeli officers from the Shin Bet, Israel's state security service, paid several visits to Lebanon and held contacts and meetings with the members of the network. Some of these meetings took place in Israel and Cyprus. The paper adds that employees of the Lebanese Forces' security service took part in these meetings. The paper says that members of this network live outside Lebanon. They were transported to Lebanon on rubber dinghies with the help of the Israeli Navy to carry out these sabotage operations and plant explosives in places of worship and the headquarters of political parties and to attack religious leaders in the Christian areas. AL-SAFIR says that after the Sayyidat al-Najat Church explosion, most of the members of the group that carried out the operation were evacuated by sea or by infiltrating across the occupied border strip with forged identity cards. The paper says that the Lebanese security services received important information about the suspects and explosives experts who had carried out such operations during the civil war, thus facilitating the quick arrest of the network members. The paper explains that the information and confessions obtained by the security services confirm that this network had planned a further series of explosions in the Christian areas to strongly shock the Christian community, cause sectarian strife, and encourage Christian fundamentalists to begin clamoring for autonomous security organs for the Christian community and demanding international protection. The newspaper AL-SAFIR says that the operations involved attacks against places of worship and clerical and political figures and the desecration of Christian cemeteries. The masterminds of these operations aimed to undermine national unity, disrupt relations with Syria -- a country that provides Lebanon with its current security umbrella -- upset Syrian-U.S. relations, impede the peace talks, and abort Pope John Paul II's visit to Lebanon, scheduled for late May. AL-SAFIR says that the scheme also aimed to point the finger of accusation at the Lebanese Muslims after the discovery of an unexploded bomb bearing the inscription: "There is no God but God." The paper accuses some French quarters of trying to establish an unofficial bridge between Lebanon and Israel by arranging a meeting between former Lebanese Army Commander General Michel 'Awn, currently living in Paris, and Uri Lubrani, coordinator of Israeli activity in Lebanon and the head of the delegation negotiating with Lebanon.
