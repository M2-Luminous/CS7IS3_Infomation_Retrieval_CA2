A decision to this effect was adopted by the Saeima's presidium at a request from President Guntis Ulmanis and Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs. The decision notes that "there is no legal ground" for such debate since a meeting between the presidents of the two countries slated for April 20 has been put off indefinitely after an incident with Yeltsin's ruling on a military base in Latvia. The Latvian leadership insists that Yeltsin officially revoke the document, which has been repudiated by Russian foreign and defence ministry officials already.
