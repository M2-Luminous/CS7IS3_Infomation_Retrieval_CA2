The Korea Institute for International Economic Policy said in its report that foreign investment in Korea which had shown a rapid pickup early in the 1980s went into the doldrums from 1989. The report attributed dwindling foreign investment in Korea to the overall deterioration of foreign investment conditions. "Soaring labor costs, a continuation of high interest rates and spiralling inflation combined to aggravate Korea's investment climate," it said. In addition, the existence of various administrative red tape and inadequate protection of intellectual property rights also tarnished Korea's attractiveness to foreign investors, it claimed. According to the report, the rate of capital formation contributed by foreign investment during 1986-1991 stood at a meager 1.1 percent. The rate compares with Taiwan's 3.5 percent, Singapore's 29.4 percent, Hong Kong's 12.1 percent and China's 2.3 percent. Moreover, the latest trend in foreign investment in Korea has shown a sustained fall, casting a pall over the country's bid to join the ranks of advanced industrial countries by attracting more foreign capital, the report said. Foreign investment in Korea soared from the early 1980s as Seoul adopted a massive liberalization policy. Foreign investment reached its zenith in the late 1980s with annual investment amounting to 1.28 billion dollars in 1988. But foreign investment began to slide from 1989 as Korea's investment conditions rapidly deteriorated, dropping to 894 million dollars in 1992. According to the report, foreign-invested manufacturing companies in Korea numbered 1,570 as of March last year with their total investment amounting to about 5.56 billion dollars. By industry, electrics and electronics topped the list of foreign-invested manufacturing companies with 344 in operation, followed by machinery (331) and chemical engineering (241). These three industries account for nearly 58 percent of the total number of foreign-invested manufacturing companies in Korea. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Foreign-invested Manufacturing Cos.

Of the 1,570 foreign-invested manufacturing companies, only 13.6 percent or 214 companies are 100 percent foreign-owned with most of them being joint ventures with Korean companies, according to the report. Japanese investors account for about 61 percent of the total foreign-invested manufacturing companies with investors from the United States making up 21 percent. The remainder are those from European or other countries. To lure more foreign capital, the report proposed an across-the- board improvement in Korea's business conditions. "Korea is still regarded as one of the promising countries for foreign investment because of its high growth potential and sustained economic development," it said. If Korea exerts every effort to revamp its business conditions, foreign investment will make a strong rebound in the future, the report said.
