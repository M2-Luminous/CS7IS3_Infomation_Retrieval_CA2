Nevzorov by V. Shurygin and comments by A. Lukyanov and V. Starodubtsev: "`Our People' in the Duma"] [Text] The patriots Nevzorov, Vlasov, Ilyukhin, Tuleyev, Sevastyanov, Baburin, Isakov, Lemeshev, Romanov, Zyuganov, Starodubtsev, Lukyanov, Govorukhin, and many more besides who are prepared to defend the interests of the motherland at the price of their lives have, according to the election results, been designated deputies of the State Duma. Aleksandr Nevzorov: `It Is My Duty To Continue the Struggle' [Shurygin] Glebych, our wholehearted congratulations on your victory! You are now a deputy, a politician. What does this victory mean to you? How do you view your seat in the new parliament? Who are you in politics? [Nevzorov] Well, first of all I am not a "politician" in the form in which society has become accustomed to seeing him. I am a journalist, I am a soldier. Primarily a professional of my occupation. And I intend, accordingly, to concern myself primarily with my field--television commentary. This is the arena of struggle for me as a politician. I will fight to ensure that the television screen cease being a Tampax and Snickers spokesman for lies and begin to tell people the truth about the entire depth of the tragedy and crisis in which society has found itself. About its heroes and criminals. For me the mandate of deputy is a mandate for hard labor, and I perceive it only as such. [Shurygin] How was it that you all of sudden left the television camera and moved into the role of legitimate politician? [Nevzorov] A national tragedy had occurred before our eyes. The regime in the person of Yeltsin organized the mass killing of our compatriots. My friends were in the shot-up parliament. Many of them were wounded, several gave their lives. It is a matter of honor for me as a man and as a comrade in arms to carry their struggle against the regime. I entered politics as reinforcements enter the trenches after fierce fighting. And I will struggle relentlessly against the killers, looters, and other scum "resting on the laurels" of the October shooting. Let them be in no doubt about this. [Shurygin] What sort of elections were these for you? How were they conducted? What did you find surprising? [Nevzorov] I specially let my name go forward for the central constituency of St. Petersburg, a constituency considered a bastion of "democracy." The most affluent Petersburgers live there. It is an area of offices, fashionable supermarkets, and privatized apartments. And this was my personal challenge to the Democratic Russia riff-raff, who had nominated a whole cohort of their candidates. My victory going away--this is my triumph, my first blow at the murderers, corrupters, and thieves covered by the mask of "democrats." I simply proved that, despite the name Nevzorov, which "liberals" shun like the plague, there are, for all that, still more of "our people" in society. They are more confident, stronger, and more active than the "dems." They were "doomed" to victory! These elections were more honest and objective than the previous ones. Having put the "opposition" under a time constraint with the election campaign, the regime itself found itself under an organizational time constraint, that is, in terms of the organization and coordination of these elections. [Shurygin] Your plans for the immediate future? [Nevzorov] First of all, to restore "Sekundy." This is not my initiative. It is an ultimatum from the electorate. People are demanding, people are expecting "Sekundy." I intend fighting for the restoration on LenTV of an atmosphere of real creativity, not political fawning and the pornography that is flourishing here today. [Shurygin] Whose side are you on, Glebych? Who is covering your rear, who lines up with you? [Nevzorov] All "our people." My loyal brother Lukyanov, Starodubtsev, Zhirinovskiy, Zyuganov, and, of course, the brilliant Aleksandr Prokhanov and his ZAVTRA. I declare, incidentally, that in accordance with a deputy's right to monitor the news media, I, on my own initiative, appoint myself a member of the editorial board of the newspaper ZAVTRA and all subsequent ones. Greetings to all! Anatoliy Lukyanov: `The DEN Offensive Is Under Way!' I believe that the present elections were not by nature either democratic or free. I had great doubts before agreeing to the suggestions that I take part in the elections, but these were outweighed by the realization that had we shunned these elections, we would have deprived ourselves of an opportunity to represent the people's interests not only in the Duma but in local government also. I was nominated by the Smolensk Public Assembly. It unites nonparty people and Communists, people of different nationalities, veterans, and the youth. It is a broad organization performing a great deal of patriotic work. Within a week they had more than twice as many signatures as were needed, and I was registered as a candidate for deputy. I drove to practically all districts of Smolensk Oblast. There were approximately 10,000 persons at the meetings. The mood in the Smolensk region is diametrically opposite to what it is in Moscow. Even in the rural areas, for example, Yeltsin's edict on the sale of land prompted people to vote against the Constitution and against the candidates of the Russia's Choice bloc. The election results are as follows: I obtained 102,000 votes and was 50,000 votes ahead of my rivals. The Communists gained second place in Smolensk Oblast as a whole, Zhirinovskiy coming first. The Constitution was not supported by the electorate in Smolensk Oblast. It was voted down by 55 percent of the electorate. This was the general mood, what is more--both in the city and in rural localities. Very harsh words were leveled at this Constitution because it was seen how the individual's existing rights are being abridged, and there was a very keen awareness of the movement toward presidential dictatorship. Speaking of the election results, it seems to me that all this is logical. People voted not so much for Zhirinovskiy as against the regime that is being installed in Russia. My views do not coincide with what Zhirinovskiy says, but this party expresses the interests of those who keenly sense how methodically the Russian Empire is being demolished and how an offensive against the Russian people, against Russian interests, is under way. Protest in society had matured, and it produced these results. The patriotic movement was not represented at the elections. I believe that, first, everything was done to limit the participation of the patriotic forces in the elections with the consent of the authorities and in accordance with their wishes. The disappearance from the slates of the bloc of Baburin and other patriotic forces was no accident. With their own hands the so-called democrats cleared the way for Zhirinovskiy. The democrats were delighted that Zhirinovskiy, participating in the constitutional assembly, supported the Constitution and strong presidential power and, when speaking, distanced himself from the Communists. I have spoken about where we part company with Zhirinovskiy, but the "Demchoice" representative gave him a positive mark. The "Choicers" calculated that on the main points he would support both the president and the democrats. They struck, therefore, at the main opponents--the patriots and Communists. It all turned out differently. And now they have sensed that the Constitution could work for Zhirinovskiy also. This is why he has come in for such a beating in the press. As far as the Constitution is concerned, I, as a lawyer, can say with confidence that it has been adopted in defiance of the referendum statutes. Only one-third of the electorate voted for the Constitution. One-third of society cannot impose its will on two-thirds. It seems to me that the first thing that the opposition forces in the Duma should do is to return once more to the question of the Constitution. From my viewpoint, a "pocket duma" has not resulted. This Duma will be torn by contradictions, and much will depend on the intelligent, serious formulation of issues by all blocs. Not counting the centrists, the forces in the Duma are divided evenly in two. This is a transitional parliament, which should prepare the ground for real elections. If this Duma does prepare this ground and adopts the requisite laws, it will have accomplished its mission. I dream that one further faction will emerge from among the independent and single-seat deputies: a patriotic bloc. According to my calculations, this means about 20 deputies expressing primarily patriotic views. This faction could, first, help very considerably the cohesion of healthy forces in the Duma and, second, bring order to bear in the ranks of the centrists. This is a serious idea, it needs to be worked on thoroughly. Yuriy Vlasov, say: With whom will he affiliate? Or Sergey Baburin, Nevzorov? Such a patriotic faction could help the work of the Duma very considerably. Newspapers of a patriotic focus could be the particular spokesman for the patriotic bloc. Many newspapers, including your DEN, are banned at this time. You are being published in all cities of Russia--from Krasnoyarsk to Lipetsk--and even overseas, this is not the issue. All publications need to be restored. I believe that one of the first inquiries of the new Duma will be one concerning the press. It will be raised by many factions. All the outrages perpetrated by the authorities in respect to the press--PRAVDA, SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA, DEN, GLASNOST--were connected with preventing the opposition press operating before the elections. When I was asked about the newspaper DEN, I told the electorate that you could ban the newspaper DEN, but THE DEN OFFENSIVE COULD NOT BE BANNED. DEN will come, it will unfailingly come, and even if it is today called ZAVTRA, it will, nonetheless, be that same DEN. A ban on newspapers is a ban on free thought, it is a fear of the opposition. If there is something to set against it, do so. Fulminating against the so-called "red-browns," the "democrats" will soon have nothing against which to plead. It would be boring without DEN! I myself need to figure out my future actions in the Duma. There have been many calls and reports in the foreign press about my alleged nomination for the position of speaker of the Duma. The best speaker in Europe in 1991 could, it is said, pass on his entire experience to the young Duma. I treat these rumors with composure and warily even. We need first to decide the question of the powers of deputies of the Duma, mine included, and only then decide the question of leadership of the house. I do not envy the speaker of our Duma from any party, the Communist Party included. It will be necessary for him, and this would be particularly difficult for me, to be in contact with the people who have unlawfully been oppressing everyone. It will, after all, be necessary to shake the president's hand. How could I do this? An Italian newspaper has already decided everything for us, appointed and elected everyone. Although I could, of course, teach many people about organization of the business of the Duma, work with the opposition, and the patience that a speaker should possess. What would I submit to the first session of the Duma? My first wish would be for a cardinal change in government policy. The formation of a government which can serve the interests of the whole people and cancel the "shock therapy." Vasiliy Starodubtsev: `They Can Be Moved, Apparently...' I considered these elections illegal, but entered the fray with the desire to have at least this platform because I could not remain silent. I did not expect that the defeat of Russia's Choice and the other democratic blocs would be so devastating. They can be moved, apparently. You just have to vote against them. Ten percent of Russians voted for the Agrarian Party. We could have amassed 20 percent had the election campaign been better organized. I myself was elected to the Federation Council for the 71st Two-Seat District at home, in Tver Oblast, since I could not leave the farm for permanent work in the State Duma. But I will, I believe, be an active participant in the affairs of our faction in the State Duma also. Our coalition with the Communists is the most pressing. We will extend a hand to all factions that agree with our two priorities: the first, halting the decline in production and averting the closure of factories and plants at any price; the second, saving the agrarian complex, saving the countryside: without this Russia will die from starvation, reforms indeed! As far as the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia faction is concerned, it will, I believe, prove heterogeneous and amorphous. Whatever the attempts to embroil it with the Communists or with us, there will, I am sure, be people there nonetheless who sincerely ache for Russia, not for the sake of political buffoonery. I am inclined to believe about Zhirinovskiy himself that he is a Trojan Horse inserted in the Kremlin to be the trump card in the hidden struggle of Kremlin political clans. His promises are buttressed by nothing, his populism is dangerous, and his foreign policy ambitions are provocative. The final results have not yet been tallied, for that matter, and we do not yet know who will get how many seats.
