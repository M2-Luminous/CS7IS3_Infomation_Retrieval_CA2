Japan will spend 1 to 1.5 billion yen for this purpose. At a specialists' meeting held in Moscow, Japan presented the name of a tanker, which can be used as a storage facility. It seems that a sales contract will be signed with the owner of the ship as early as mid-January after Russia completes its studies. The ship in question is a chemical tanker of Panamanian registry. Russian specialists will soon inspect the tanker which is anchored at a harbor in Singapore prior to signing a contract. Currently, there are storage facilities in the Russian Far East and about 1,900 tons of liquid radioactive waste can be stored there. However, they are almost full and very old. Saying "the environment in the Far East region is in a critical situation," Russia has asked Japan to provide it with a secondhand tanker with 5,000 to 20,000 tons of storage capacity by utilizing the $100 million support fund designed for the former Soviet Union for dismantling nuclear weapons.
