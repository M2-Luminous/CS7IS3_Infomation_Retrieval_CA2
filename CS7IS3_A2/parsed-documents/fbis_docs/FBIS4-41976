Yeltsin at reception in honor of military academy graduates" in Moscow on 28 June: "It Is Up to You To Reform the Army"] [Text] Comrade generals and admirals, comrade officers! Esteemed representatives of foreign countries' armies! Today, in Moscow's Kremlin, we honor our military academy graduates, representatives of our glorious officers corps. Such graduation ceremonies take place each year. A fresh cohort of highly skilled professionals joins our Armed Forces each year. The Russian Army's hopes are assembled in this splendid hall. You are among those on whom its might and combat ability will be founded. On the whole, Russia's Armed Forces meet the contemporary demands as regards ensuring the country's military security. The young Russian Army confirms this not only in the course of major maneuvers and strategic exercises. Its units and combined units successfully perform peacemaking functions in line with our country's international commitments. The main avenue of our military policy is to reform the Armed Forces. They must satisfy the real needs of the country's necessary and adequate defense. Gradually (and I emphasize: gradually) the Army's numerical strength will be brought to 1.5 million men. The mechanism for the Army's manpower acquisition will also change gradually. We are talking about increasing the proportion of servicemen serving on contract. We will continue to give major attention to the development of Russia's new military infrastructure and to ensuring that it is effectively supplied and organized. We need to learn to pursue a balanced military-technical policy. The root of the problem is to ensure that the tasks we are resolving should be in line with the real potential of the country's economy. It is no secret that today we have limited resources and this is having an acute impact on the Army. It is that much more important to allocate them properly. We will have to reduce the categories and modifications of armaments, the backup services for them, and the range of munitions, consumables, and spares. Diversity in this sphere is an unaffordable luxury. At the same time, however, it is categorically impermissible to squander -- under the pretext of cutbacks -- the unique scientific and technical potential created within the Armed Forces. There are international treaties and agreements. The commitments we have made will be honorably fulfilled. But there cannot be any question whatsoever of any so-called "overfulfillment." This is the president's clear-cut position, this is the principled demand made of the Armed Forces' leadership. The majority of those in this hall will soon return to the forces. I hope that you have soundly mastered one of the main lessons of the science of victory. It is that the Army's strength lies not only in the personnel's combat skills, and not only in the extent to which the military art has been mastered by commanders and troop leaders -- even though there can be no army without this. Its strength is rooted not just in military discipline -- even though there can be no army without this, either. The Russian Army has been invincible whenever humanity within it has gained the upper hand over callousness. Whenever commanding officers have realized that each and every one of their subordinates is neither a robot nor a blind instrument, but a human being. Humanity means neither permissiveness nor mollycoddling. Humanity in the Army means persistently teaching each and every serviceman to perform his combat task and survive in any circumstances. The main point in this process is not to forget your subordinates' dignity and to always feel personally responsible for their lives. This is the behest of our best troop leaders, this is taught to us by the combat experience of our best field commanders. I believe that you will not only continue but will also consolidate this glorious tradition. It must be honestly admitted: We have not been and are not always loyal to this tradition, whether in the past or in the present. In a democratic state, the rights and duties of servicemen must be defined only by the law. The entire legal basis of the Armed Forces' organizational development and activity must be brought in line with the Constitution and the fundamental provisions of the military doctrine. In order to improve the overall system of Armed Forces command and control and strengthen their ties with society, we will gradually introduce and strengthen elements of civilian control over the process of military organizational development. It is impossible not to mention the system of military cadre training at a reception in honor of military academy graduates. We do have a concept for developing the military education system. The tuition plans and programs of higher educational establishments have been clarified. The training of officers in many specialized fields, who are in short supply in the Russian Army, has been organized. This work must be continued. The main avenue must be a line of rationally expanding and integrating the military education establishments. The quality of training must be enhanced by reducing their number. We will continue to give special attention to questions concerning social protection for the Armed Forces personnel and members of their families, as well as for servicemen in the reserve. For those who have spent the best years of their lives serving the motherland. We are implementing a program to provide housing for servicemen and persons discharged from military service in 1994-1995. Money allowances and pensions have been increased, as have the salaries of the Russian Army's [civilian] workers and employees. Additional sources of finance to meet military needs are being sought for this purpose, despite all the complexities. It may well be that the Ministry of Social Protection will have to create a special department for the affairs of persons discharged into the reserve, military invalids, pensioners, and veterans. I take advantage of this occasion to also dwell on questions concerning the Armed Forces' external activity. This primarily involves the formation of a collective security system in the CIS. Nobody and nothing can relieve Russia of its political and moral responsibility for the future of countries and peoples that have marched in step with the Russian state for centuries. Next comes the creation of a promising European security system. We advocate that this system should be all-embracing. It should also mean more than just a bloc structure, like NATO. What is needed is a broader partnership system which would pool and boost all currently operational mechanisms of the CSCE, the European Union, the Western European Union, the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, and so on. The new edifice of European security is hardly likely to be successfully built if its architects try to exclude Russia from their plans. But we also need to actively participate in the existing institutions for cooperation, not to isolate ourselves from them but, on the contrary, to more strongly influence their work from within. Proceeding from Russia's special strategic position in Eurasia, we must single out the creation of an effective security system in the Asia-Pacific region as a special avenue of our military policy. We will continue to actively participate in peacemaking operations, in the work to monitor armaments and the proliferation of nuclear technologies, and, on the whole, in ensuring strategic stability in the world. Russia's foreign policy is gathering pace. A few days ago our country joined the "Partnership for Peace" military-political process. Russia concluded the agreement "On Partnership and Cooperation" with the European Union. Attendance at the conference of the world's seven most developed states lies ahead. This will be, moreover, participation with fully equal rights in political matters. In other words, the political eight will begin their work. Each such step offers fresh opportunities to our country. This will directly affect the Army. The more efficiently we operate, the more real opportunities we will gain to solve its urgent problems. The second anniversary of the formation of the Russian Federation Armed Forces was marked only a short while ago. But its history goes far beyond this date. Today's Army is a direct heir of the glorious traditions and truly great victories of the Russian host. It covered itself with glory on the ice of Lake Peipus [Aleksandr Nevskiy's 1242 victory over the Teutonic knights] and at the battle of Kulikovo [Dmitriy Donskoy's 1380 defeat of the Mongols], near Poltava [1709 defeat of Sweden] and Borodino [1812 victory over Napoleon]. The Russian Army's legendary might was augmented by the military feats of Aleksandr Nevskiy, Dmitriy Donskoy, Aleksandr Suvorov, Fedor Ushakov, Mikhail Kutuzov, and other eminent military leaders. Our forebears' tradition of gaining victory, of defending the Russian state's freedom and independence with arms in their hands, was continued by the Red Army soldiers in harsh battles against German fascism. Now, 53 years after the start of the Great Patriotic War, we realize the full extent of the grandeur of the feat accomplished by our grandfathers and fathers. We give the due credit to the talent of celebrated troop leaders like Zhukov, Vasilevskiy, Konev, Rokossovskiy, Chernyakhovskiy, and many others. Dear graduates! You are celebrating! I congratulate you with all my heart on the successful conclusion of your training! Tomorrow you will return to the ranks and will take on new and more onerous duties. I am confident that the personnel of units, ships, and combined units under your leadership will successfully perform their tasks to defend Russia's state interests. On this memorable day I would like to wish the officer graduates from foreign armies success in their service. I have no doubt that you will retain the warmest memories of the academy, of Moscow, of our country and its people. Special thanks are due to the command and teaching staff of the military academies. I wish you fresh creative accomplishments in your noble work. I wish you all success in your very hard but honorable work for the sake of Russia and for the glory of the fatherland! Godspeed, dear graduates! Success and happiness in your hard service as officers!
