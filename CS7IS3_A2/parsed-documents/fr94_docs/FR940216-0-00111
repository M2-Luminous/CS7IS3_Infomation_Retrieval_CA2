FR940216-0-00111 FR940216-0-00010 One commenter said that EPA should require independent laboratories to use the same test methods as the refinery. EPA agrees with this suggestion, and has incorporated it in the final rule. As discussed in the test method section of this Preamble, EPA requires refiners and importers to use the regulatory test methods when meeting the refinery and import facility testing requirements in order to avoid erroneous test results due to bias among test methods. For the same reason, the accuracy of test results by independent laboratories would be compromised if independent laboratories use non-regulatory test methods. The commenter's suggestion is an appropriate solution to this possibility. Another commenter said that EPA should reduce the length of time independent laboratories are required to retain samples, from the 180-day period in the proposal to 60 days. EPA has retained the 180-day sample retention period to allow EPA the opportunity to obtain portions of samples after it receives quarterly reports from refiners, importers, and independent laboratories. EPA recognizes that certain types of analysis results become less reliable as samples age, but believes there is enough information to be learned from samples older than 60 days to justify the 180-day sample retention requirement. 51 51 Reid vapor pressure is the fuel parameter most susceptible to change due to storage time, because the more volatile fractions of a fuel sample may be lost if samples are not properly capped and stored at cold temperatures. Even in the case of RVP, however, EPA's experience with analyses of samples that have been stored for 180 days has been that the RVP of samples decline only approximately 0.2 psi, which is a change sufficiently small that EPA may continue to use the samples. Lastly, one commenter said that EPA should eliminate the requirement that independent laboratories determine certain information about the gasoline sampled, including the batch volume, storage tank identification, and the grade of gasoline. EPA proposed that independent laboratories obtain this information as part of the verification process over refiner or importer reports, and continues to believe it is necessary. For example, the properties of gasoline produced is only one part of the information necessary for demonstrating compliance; the volume of gasoline produced with given properties also is necessary. Information on storage tank and gasoline grade is included as a means of confirming the gasoline sampled and tested by the refiner or importer, and that by the independent laboratory, is the same. D. Downstream Oxygenate Blending Assumptions EPA received various comments on the assumptions refiners and importers may make regarding downstream oxygenate blending for purposes of calculating the properties of reformulated gasoline blendstock intended for downstream oxygenate blending (RBOB). Under the proposal, and the final rule, refiners and importers of RBOB are responsible for meeting all reformulated gasoline standards, except the oxygen standard; downstream oxygenate blenders are responsible for meeting the oxygen standard for reformulated gasoline produced using RBOB. In order to determine compliance with the non-oxygen reformulated gasoline standards a refiner or importer must calculate the non-oxygen parameter values for the reformulated gasoline. To do this, a refiner or importer must include a value for the oxygen content the RBOB will achieve subsequent to downstream oxygenate blending, because the values of non-oxygen parameters will differ based upon the type and amount of oxygenate blended downstream. 52 52 The impact of blending different oxygenate types and amounts on the non-oxygen properties of RBOB is great. VOC emissions are dramatically affected by changes in RVP, yet different oxygenates affect RVP very differently; ethanol blended above about four volume percent (1.5 weight percent oxygen) increases the RVP of the resulting gasoline by 1 psi, while oxygenates other than ethanol cause very little or no change in RVP. Similarly, toxics emissions performance and benzene are strongly influenced by the dilution effect caused by oxygenate blending, yet different oxygenates must be blended at very different volumes to result in the same oxygen content in the gasoline produced; to produce gasoline with 2.00 weight percent oxygen, for example, requires 5.4 volume percent ethanol, or 11.0 volume percent MTBE. EPA proposed that refiners and importers of RBOB have two options for the oxygen content value used in their calculations of non-oxygen parameters. A refiner or importer could use the actual oxygenate type and amount blended with the RBOB, provided the refiner or importer carries out a program of contractual controls and quality assurance sampling and testing over the downstream oxygenate blending operation. Under the second option, the refiner or importer could make certain default assumptions regarding the type and amount of oxygenate blended downstream. EPA proposed that this assumption must be the ``worst case'' assumption with regard to the oxygenate type, and volume (within the oxygen minimum and maximum requirements). 53 53 The worst case assumption for RVP and VOC emissions performance reduction would be ethanol, at the oxygen maximum level. For toxics emissions performance and benzene, the worst case would be the oxygenate providing the minimum volume (normally ethanol) at the oxygen minimum level. One commenter suggested that EPA should modify the nature of this default assumption, by allowing refiners to designate one of two categories of RBOB, ``ether-only RBOB'' and ``any-oxygenate RBOB.'' These categories would have different assumptions for oxygenate type; ether-only RBOB would be assumed to be blended with MTBE, and any-oxygenate RBOB would be assumed to be blended with ethanol. Notwithstanding the assumption of MTBE use for purposes of compliance calculations for ether-only RBOB, any ether could be added downstream to an ether-only RBOB. However, it would be a violation to add an alcohol to an ether-only RBOB. This commenter stated further that the amount of oxygenate should be assumed to be that amount necessary to add 2.1 weight percent oxygen, the annual average oxygen level that oxygenate blenders must achieve for reformulated gasoline produced using RBOB when meeting the oxygen content standard on average. EPA has generally adopted this suggestion for the final rule, but in a slightly modified form.
