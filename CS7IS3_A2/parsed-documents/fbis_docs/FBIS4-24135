Jean Helen met Jerome Bicamumpaka, the foreign minister of the Rwandan interim government, in Gisenyi: [Begin recording] [Bicamumpaka] Our government praises the French initiative to mobilize the international community to form an expedition force whose aim is to protect the threatened Rwandan civilian population. We think that this operation falls in line with the aim of establishing peace in Rwanda and promoting a fair political compromise in Rwanda, which our government has been trying to achieve for two and a half months now. This operation will make an effective contribution to the efforts aimed at establishing peace in Rwanda as soon as possible. If the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] once again refuses to budge and cooperate with this force, we think this force should have the means to make the RPF comply by force if necessary. [Unidentified correspondent] That is to conduct itself as a buffer force or deploy itself in RPF zones? [Bicamumpaka] This force should absolutely be able to deploy itself in both government and RPF zones because people under threat are not only in our zone, but also in large numbers in the RPF zone. [end recording] [passage omitted] This intervention has given rise to mixed reactions in Burundi, the neighboring country. The Burundian Foreign Minister Jean-Marie Ngendahayo: [Begin Ngendahayo recording] What its neighbor Burundi says is that peace should be established in Rwanda and massacres should be stopped. Concerning Operation Turquoise, Burundi has never been officially consulted, either by France or by the two belligerents. Now, in Burundi we say we have to observe strict neutrality, that is as long as the two belligerents do not agree on this French initiative, French troops and French military equipment will not be allowed to transit through Burundi. But we think that it is very important that everybody makes greater efforts for peace and humanitarian aid for the sake of the Rwandan people. [end recording]
