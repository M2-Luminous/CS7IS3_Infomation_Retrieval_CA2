The position of the powerful industrial kray certainly will prove decisive in the campaign for the high post of president. It is clear that it is not particularly necessary to introduce the former Supreme Council chairman to the Donbass residents. Plyushch here, as however in all of Ukraine, is well-known and respected--for the wisdom and talent of the leader of a state, breadth of state thinking, and consistency in the defense of the interests of the people. Ivan Stepanovych visited the hospitable Donetsk land for two days--he met with miners of the mine imeni Abakumov, machine builders of the Buran plant, and the plant imeni Petrovskiy. He discussed problems of the coal industry with specialists of the Donetskugol association. We met late in the evening after his intensive visit to miners and an hour-long discourse with a television audience on live TV. [Yeremenko] Ivan Stepanovych, as you correctly noted on the program, the programs of the aspirants to the post of president of Ukraine are similar in many ways. Concern about the individual worker stands out in each. The difference is only in the order of setting forth basic points. But there is also a principal difference. How do you see our state in the future: unitary or federative? It was two years ago that you said here in Donetsk that federalization is useful. At the same time, you emphasized that if everything is done rapidly, this could lead only to damage. What do you think today? [Plyushch] I also think this now. First of all, it is necessary to clarify just what we want from federalization. What, are we attracted by a fashionable word? Is the main thing not to call an oblast an oblast, but precisely a land? But if we mean to delegate a significant part of power to the regions and local organs of authority, then I am for such a federation. I am for it with both hands. But if we want each region to consider itself independent from Kiev, then such a federation will give no benefit either to Kiev, or to our state. So let us decide the essence and not the form. My opponents claim that I, they say, am for full economic independence, but against political independence. But permit me to ask: What is economic and what is political independence. According to what methodology are they divided? It seems to me that economics is a continuation of politics, and that politics is a continuation of economics. Everything is closely interrelated. And it is not necessary to absolutize and to politicize the problem. Really, by federation, I understand maximum independence in the resolution of the overwhelming majority of questions on a regional level. But the region's connection with the state is implemented through a system of taxation and the structure of general state organs, and specifically: customs, force ministries, procuracies, courts, banks, and the credit-financial system. And there is no need to be afraid. Here is an appropriate case. For example, Donetskugol has established a departmental bank. It already has 16 branches and correspondent accounts in eight CIS countries and in a dozen countries of the far abroad. In turn, Prominvestbank and the National Bank are trying in various ways to keep it on a leash. The phenomena are understandable--authority is not given up that easily. But, nevertheless, however difficult it may be, Donuglekombank is operating. And this, you will agree, is good. Owing to the bank, the association is resolving many production questions, and it is becoming like a state within a state. So then, is this separatism? I see here an economic independence that is an obligatory element of federalization. [Yeremenko] How do you assess the conference of leaders of the border oblasts of Ukraine and Russia that is being held in Donetsk? [Plyushch] The meeting, and this is the third of its kind, is very necessary. It promotes the development of communications and turning out suitable legislative acts concerning border oblasts, and the establishment of clear borders, as in the whole civilized world. It is time to move from words to action. A world, Asiatic, and various markets exist. Why should a mutually profitable market of CIS countries not work? Who is prohibiting it? I was at the Buran plant yesterday--in two and a half months--it is simply fantastic! It created a new mining machine that is on the level of the best world models. I asked--where did you get the parts? It turns out that 13 percent are from the far abroad, 18 percent are Russian, and the rest are ours. And how are you cooperating with Russia, I inquired of the director? Normally, he answered. You, in the newspaper, must especially emphasize something that has been pretty well forgotten: He who wants to do, finds the means, but he who does not, finds excuses. Of course, it is necessary to help the coal industry, but the main thing is to at least not interfere. The development of Donetskugol under the difficult conditions of a general crisis demonstrates this well. The Donbass is our extremely promising region. And strengthening its economic equal rights relations with Russia will undoubtedly only accrue to the benefit of all of Ukraine. [Yeremenko] Ivan Stepanovych, what are your political sympathies, and who are you counting on during the elections? [Plyushch] I am counting on our people, on their common sense. ...The time of the meeting passed imperceptibly. Ivan Stepanovych's extended journey led to Zaporozhye. It seems that he departed Donetsk, having received fairly good support. The miners of the Donetskugol association alone submitted almost 25,000 signatures in his behalf.
