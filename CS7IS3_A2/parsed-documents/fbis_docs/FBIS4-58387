[passage omitted] Now that an Israeli-PLO agreement can be taken for granted, U.S. Secretary of State Christopher has been concerned over the past two days with the negotiations between Israel and Syria -- perhaps the most difficult in the peace process -- in an attempt to shift the two antagonists, Rabin and al-'Asad, from the stances to which they have clung stubbornly for months. And he seems to have succeeded. Irrespective of the official comments and the needling, negotiations between Israel and Syria have entered a new, "more substantive," phase, as the secretary of state put it. Sunday [1 May] Christopher conveyed to Damascus the proposal for an agreement put forward by Rabin -- a withdrawal from Golan in three stages, the immediate return of three of the five Druze villages, security measures, and the immediate opening of diplomatic missions. The official response was a refusal. "Syria is opposed to an Israeli withdrawal in stages," al-'Asad's spokesman said. And Foreign Minister al-Shar' went further by describing the Israeli offer as "stupid." In fact al-'Asad entrusted Christopher with his counterproposal, which includes a number of "substantive" points. The "al-'Asad Plan" has been received with "great interest" by Foreign Minister Peres, according to whom, "the efforts to achieve peace between Israel and Syria are in earnest." "I think that our proposals mark the start of a new phase in negotiations with Syria," Yossi Beilin said in his office at the Foreign Ministry. Of Israel's young politicians, he has had, and still has, the most important role in the complex negotiations of the peace process, partly thanks to his proximity to Shim'on Peres. [passage omitted] [Stabile] Mr. Beilin, tomorrow the agreement on Gaza and Jericho will be signed. What will happen after that? [Beilin] We have several different alternatives. We hoped that the Palestinians would complete their election process in July so as to establish their Council and immediately start discussing the extension of autonomy to the whole of the West Bank. But if, as it seems, there are no elections in July, and more time is needed, then we will negotiate the transfer of powers only in some fields -- health, education, welfare, and so forth. Be that as it may, from Wednesday [4 May] we will start counting the five years of the transition phase. And we will be able to start right away to negotiate a permanent solution, without necessarily awaiting the end of the second year. [Stabile] Do you not think that you are moving rather too fast? The Palestinians do not seem to be at all ready to take over power in Gaza and Jericho. [Beilin] I have read some newspaper accounts in this regard. I suggest that we should not be paternalistic and tell them what they should do. They are at a delicate stage in their history. They have to create all their institutions from scratch. We must understand them and be patient, as long as our security and our interests are not placed in jeopardy. I hope that the PLO and the Palestinian police are capable of preventing terrorism. This will be the real test of the agreement on Gaza and Jericho. [Stabile] What do you expect? [Beilin] If terrorism becomes less intense, it will be the agreement's greatest success. [Stabile] Otherwise? [Beilin] Otherwise we will be forced to reconsider everything. [Stabile] Chief of Staff Barak has said that Hamas and the PLO have the same final objectives. Do you think that it is possible that Israel could some day conduct a dialogue with Hamas? [Beilin] We must not exclude anyone a priori. If they are prepared to recognize Israel, of course we will not exclude them merely because they call themselves "Hamas." I would point out that for many years the PLO was our worst enemy. But once they changed their minds and put an end to terrorism, we were willing to talk. I am sure that their dreams are the same. But I am interested not in what they dream at night, but in what they do during the day. And as things stand, there are major differences between Hamas and the PLO. [Stabile] How would you regard an involvement by Hamas in the Palestinian elections? [Beilin] If Hamas renounces terrorism and takes part in the elections, we will not oppose it. On the contrary, we would regard it as a positive sign, because it would mean that they have accepted the peace process. But unless it abandons terrorism, we cannot tolerate Hamas' involvement in the election campaign. [Stabile] Are you not afraid of the settlers' reaction to the agreement? [Beilin] I do not think that this opposition will jeopardize the country's stability. Few political leaders now could argue that we should remain in Gaza. On the contrary, there are thousands of Israeli mothers who will be happy that we are leaving. [Stabile] Will the opposition be sharper in the case of Golan? [Beilin] Golan is important to security. And I think that when there are negotiations and a draft agreement with Syria, we must make the relinquishment of Golan the subject of a referendum. Of course, we could lose it, but that is a risk we must face. [Stabile] But are you not afraid that Syria's President al- 'Asad could regard a referendum on Golan as an excuse for avoiding a withdrawal? [Beilin] I think that al-'Asad can understand that the decision to make a future agreement the subject of a referendum is the most important indication of the seriousness of our intentions. Also I can assure you that such an agreement would by no means have an easier life in the Knesset, since we have only a small majority. [Stabile] Meanwhile al-'Asad has rejected your plan. Will you change anything in it? [Beilin] I do not think that Syria will reject all our proposals. If they did so, they would be proving to the world that they are not in earnest in their desire for peace. We have never said: These are our ideas; take them or leave them. That is merely a proposal, but it is the most serious proposal that Israel has ever made. And if there are differences to be bridged, we are prepared to discuss them.
