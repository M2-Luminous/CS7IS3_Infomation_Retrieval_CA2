FBIS4-29577 "dreas118_a_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-118 Daily Report 20 June 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Kakizawa Talks About DPRK Nuclear Issue Kakizawa Talks About DPRK Nuclear Issue Roundtable Discussion Held OW1906140894 OW1906140894 BFN [Editorial Report] Tokyo NHK General Television Network at 0000 GMT on 19 June, in its 60-minute live roundtable discussion program titled "Sunday Discussion," carries an approximately 21- minute interview with Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa on the situation on the Korean Peninsula. The program, entitled "The Issue of the DPRK's Suspected Nuclear Development -- What Is President Kim Il-song Really Thinking?," is participated in by Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, Keio University professor Masao Okonogi, NHK Political Department reporter Ryuichi Tejima, and later by Serig Harrison -- according to on-screen caption -- a member of the Carnegie International Peace Foundation and Pak Su-kil -- according to on-screen caption -- director of the ROK Foreign and Security Affairs Research Institute, with NHK Commentator Takashi Yamamoto serving as moderator. At 0002 GMT, after a brief video review on recent developments in the situation on the Korean Peninsula, Yamamoto introduces today's guests, explaining the program will have two parts with the first half placing emphasis on an interview with Foreign Minister Kakizawa and the second half of the program will be for discussions among the participants in the NHK studio and participants in Seoul and Washington through a satellite hookup. Yamamoto first asks Kakizawa about his evaluation of the drastic change in the situation following former U.S. President Carter's visit to the DPRK. Kakizawa says: "In talks with Carter, the DPRK sent various messages such as the freezing of its nuclear development program and a guarantee for nuclear inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. I think the DPRK gave positive answers in the talks. In this sense, the talks have provided the basis for talks between the United States and the DPRK... [pauses] truly speaking there is the possibility that the talks will be considered as having paved the way for future U.S.-DPRK talks. In this sense, the talks were meaningful." He adds that after hearing the details of the talks form Carter, the Clinton administration will add finishing touches through diplomatic channels to what has been discussed between Carter and Kim Il-song. But he says it will take some time before the third round of U.S.- DPRK talks is held. Asked what he thinks about the possibility of summit talks between South and North Korea, Kakizawa notes: "We hope that summit talks will materialize. But the two sides need to discuss at the working level details of the talks, such as places for them, and I think such working level talks will be held early next week." At 0005 GMT, South Korean Foreign and Security Affairs Research Institute Director Pak Su-kil joins the program via a satellite hookup. Asked about how the South Korean Government views the DPRK's offer to hold summit talks. Pak, speaking in Korean with voiced-over simultaneous translation in Japanese, quotes Kim Yong- sam as accepting the DPRK's proposal to hold summmit talks. Pak then cites what was discussed between Kim Yong-sam and Carter in Seoul on 18 June. In the NHK studio, Keio University professor Okonogi gives his view on the situation, saying Pyongyang aimed to take the opportunity of Carter's visit as breakthrough in the situation. Saying Pyongyang has turned to taking a flexible, realistic approach, Yamamoto asks Foreign Minister Kakizawa what he thinks of such an attitude. Kakizawa answers: "The DPRK has taken such an attitude mindful of the fact that its replacement of all of the fuel rods from experimental reactors has caused unexpectedly harsh criticism by the international community, including China. I think Kim Il-song must have thought that if no progress were made in the situation, resolutions for sanctions against the DPRK will be adopted at the UN Security Council [UNSC], thus driving Pyongyang into a corner, and that it is necessary to decisively provide a breakthrough, as professor Okonogi has said, by taking advantage of Carter's visit to Pyongyang before the situation becomes worse for the DPRK. But there are still some vague points in Pyongyang's position. Although Kim Il-song has reportedly proposed freezing the nuclear development program, I wonder what he means by freeze. He also said the DPRK will freeze its program if the United States extends cooperation in transforming its graphite-based reactor into a light-water reactor. But it takes much time, and I wonder who will bear the cost. In addition, when Pyongyang comes to accept the IAEA inspections, I wonder -- although there are nuclear facilities that are believed to be radioactive waste storage facilities -- whether the DPRK will accept special inspections of such facilities. Special inspections of such facilities enables the IAEA to judge whether reactors have been operated for nuclear development purposes in the past. Unless special inspections are made, the IAEA will not be able to grasp the facts concerning nuclear development. For this reason, I wonder whether the DPRK will accept special inspections." Citing Kim Il-song's previous remarks that the DPRK has nothing to hide expect military facilities, Kakizawa says: "I think, if what he means by military facilities are the radioactive waste storage facilities, there is a wide gap between the West and the DPRK in their views on special inspections." Yamamoto says it is still unclear whether inspections will be made to judge whether the DPRK tried to develop nuclear weapons in the past, and asks Foreign Minister Kakizawa how Japan will deal with the issue of the DPRK's past nuclear development activities. Kakizawa notes: "Japan is serious about this issue because it considers that if the DPRK comes to possess nuclear weapons in the future, it would drastically change the framework of security in Northeast Asia and that the DPRK's missiles, which are under development now, would become a direct threat to Japan. Another concern is that if the DPRK should come to develop nuclear arms, it would be a serious blow to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] -- which is signed by 164 nations -- and cause distrust between NPT member nations." He adds that if other nations should come to possess nuclear weapons one after another, it would create a world trend that seriously runs counter to Japan's three principles of not making, possessing, or bringing in nuclear weapons. He then says: "I hope the DPRK's past nuclear development plans will also be included in the subject of inspections." NHK reporter Tejima also asks what approach Japan will take in having the DPRK's past nuclear development plans inspected. Kakizawa says: "This will be the major issue to be solved." He then notes the need to make efforts to keep close ties with the United States and South Korea to ensure that the IAEA inspections will include inspections of the DPRK's past nuclear development activities. Asked if Japan plans to call on the United States to make it clear that inspections will include inspections of the DPRK's past development activities, Kakizawa says it is necessary to see based on the results of coming various talks between Washington and Pyongyang, reiterating Japan welcomes the favorable development of the situation. At 0018 GMT, Carnegie International Peace Foundation member Serig Harrison in Washington joins the program through remote hookup, citing U.S. Government reaction to the outcome of Carter-Kim Il-song talks, stressing the effect of Japan's cooperation in building a light-water reactor. Kakizawa says "it is not easy for the government to win the people's consensus" on cooperation in building a light-water reactor because past talks between Japan and the DPRK on normalizing diplomatic relations ended in failure due to the DPRK's own convenience. Regarding the possible resumption of Japan- DPRK talks, Kakizawa says: "Japan always opens its door to the DPRK. If the DPRK wants to resume talks, Japan is willing to take its seat for talks." Asked whether it is necessary to continue to discuss sanction measures, Kakizawa says: "Although discussions on sanctions will be continued until the situation becomes clear, I think calls for sanctions at the UNSC will be toned down because of the DPRK's positive message." As for sanctions against the DPRK, NHK reporter Tejima explains the major points of the sanctions proposed by the United States. He then asks Kakizawa what went on in his recent talks with Chinese leaders. Kakizawa reviews the outcome of his talks, explaining China's basic stand of settling the issue through dialogue. Citing the government as previously saying it will act within the limits of the Constitution, Yamamoto asks what it means by the limits of the Constitution. Kakizawa says it is necessary to discuss to what extent Japan can implement sanctions if they are adopted at the UNSC. As the last question, Yamamoto asks Kakizawa what role Japan can play in settling the issue. Kakizawa says: "Since the DPRK seems to be placing emphasis on dialogue with the United States, Japan intends to exchange opinions with the United States and cooperate in materializing U.S.- DPRK talks." He stresses it is also important to keep close contact with South Korea, China, and Russia. At 0038 GMT, the interview with Kakizawa ends and he leaves the studio.
