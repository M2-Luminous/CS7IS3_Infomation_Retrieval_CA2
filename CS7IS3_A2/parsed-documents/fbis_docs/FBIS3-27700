Zhu Rongji said: You all are old friends of the Chinese people and well-established Japanese entrepreneurs. I can tell you that China's economic reform is bound to succeed, and China will maintain its annual economic growth rate at 8 to 9 percent for a long time to come. You should have full confidence in it. Zhu Rongji added emphatically: Favorable temporal, geographical, human, and other factors bind China and Japan closely together. Friendly relations and cooperation between China and Japan are an irresistible historical trend. China needs Japan's capital and technology for its development, whereas Japan needs China's markets and resources for its economic development. Only by increasing cooperation can China and Japan achieve their own prosperity. In conducting equal and mutually beneficial cooperation, China and Japan should show mutual understanding, consult with each other in a friendly manner, and solve existing problems. Zhu Rongji expressed the hope that Japan's economic circles would consider the overall interest in developing Sino-Japanese cooperation and work with China in constantly advancing good-neighbor and friendly relations between China and Japan. His speech won warm applause from those present at the breakfast. Prominent Japanese entrepreneurs attending the breakfast included Naohiko Kumagaya, president of Mitsui & Co., Ltd.; Yosuo Matsushita, president of Sakura Bank; Joichi Aoi, president of Toshiba Corporation; Katsunosuke Maeda, president of Toray Industries; and Yoshiro Sasaki, vice president of Nippon Steel Corporation.
