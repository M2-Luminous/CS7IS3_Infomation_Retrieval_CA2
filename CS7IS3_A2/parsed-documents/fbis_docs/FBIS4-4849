Most of these Chinese overstayed their visas and went underground to get higher-paying jobs at places of employment other than the original business firms where they received job training, the agency said. The number of Chinese who disappeared under similar circumstances in 1992 was 35, it said. Of a total 76 foreign business trainees who went missing in 1993, 85 percent were Chinese. Many of the missing hid themselves shortly before the expiration of their agreed training tenures and then overstayed their visas to land higher-paying work than their previous jobs, an agency official said. The Philippines ranked second with nine missing persons, followed by Bangladesh with two, the agency said. A total of 19,000 foreign business trainees from 108 countries are presently working in Japan, of which Chinese account for about 10,000. In addition to the missing trainees, 17 Chinese university and college students have disappeared while the whereabouts of 58 Chinese students of technical and language schools also remains unknown, it said. The reasons for the disappearance of the students were not immediately known. An agency official said, "disappearances among Chinese business trainees may increase further in the future."
