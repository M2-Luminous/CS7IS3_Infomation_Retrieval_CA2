Egypt and Thailand were among the most significant importers of our aircraft hardware. We exported small arms mainly to Turkey, where the Czech Arms Plants Uhersky Brod rearmed the police force. We sold seven ground armored vehicles to Angola. Bretislav Gregr, the director of the Special Materials Department at the Trade and Industry Ministry, told us that the provision of import and export licenses for military material is the basic condition for conducting international trade in arms. A license is issued on the basis of an application, the most important detail of which is the confirmation of the end user; this is verified by the representative offices. At the moment, the situation is more complicated because a new law on conducting foreign trade in military material has been in force since 1 April. It stipulates a two-tier licensing procedure. First, a company must apply for a general permit to enter onto the market with military material, a permit that entitles it to supply, market, or enter into tender proceedings. The holder of this permit must then apply for a license for each specific deal he wants to complete. A company must comply with a number of conditions before being issued a general permit. The company in question must, for example, have a majority share of Czech capital, its owners must be Czech citizens with permanent residence in the Czech Republic, and they need to have a negative screenings certificate, a clean criminal record, sufficient financial backing for the company, and so on. At the moment, some 10 enterprises are applying for this permit; one of them has already obtained it. According to B. Gregr, it is a new limited company whose statutory bodies had Army connections and, thus, knowledge of the military sphere. The new wording of the law allows for the validity of the licenses issued previously. Some 40 companies that obtained a license to export military material before 1 April of this year have to obtain a new export permit within six months. These companies include, for example, Aero Vodochody, whose shipment for the Thai Royal Air Force was impounded recently in Austria.
