(0130 GMT) and only the captain and his co-pilot remained on board, the [Saudi Airlines] spokesman said. The passengers, almost all of whom were Ethiopian, were safe, he said. There were thought to be three or four hijackers, according to the spokesman. He said airport officials were negotiating with the hijackers, but gave no official details on their demands. But an unofficial source at Jomo Kenyatta Airport said the hijackers were demanding to fly to Italy and told airport officials to re-fuel the plan. The Saudi ambassador to Nairobi had rushed to the scene, the Saudi Embassy here said, but gave no other information.
