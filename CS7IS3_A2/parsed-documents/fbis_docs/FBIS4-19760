Nineteen Turkish Cypriots who had illegally passed from the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus to south Cyprus received inhuman treatment and were evicted. Some of the evicted have been living in south Cyprus for a long time. Greek Cypriots evicting a group of Turkish Cypriots by beating them, at a time when the Greek Cypriot authorities are talking about peace and friendship, proves once more that the two people cannot coexist. The fact that the Greek Cypriot authorities, who have shown their true face to world, increased their pressure on the Turkish Cypriot minority living in the south Cyprus at a time when the confidence-building measures are being negotiated, exacerbates feelings of distrust between the two populations. Even Yilmaz Mavideniz, among the evicted Turkish Cypriots, who was in close cooperation with the Greek Cypriot police was not spared eviction.
