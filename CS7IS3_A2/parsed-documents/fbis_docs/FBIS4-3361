This was disclosed by Chen Keqin, director of the Press and Publication Bureau of the province, at the provincial culture and sports work meeting a few days ago. Chen Keqin said that the press and publishing in Hainan Province had developed without the government's financial investment. When the province was established in April 1988, there were only one publishing house for books (the Hainan People's Publishing House), one newspaper (HAINAN RIBAO), and one magazine (TIANYA) [THE END OF THE WORLD -- 1131 1509; reference to Hainan's geographical location]. At present, there are four publishing houses (companies) for books, one audio-video publishing house, 17 newspapers, 37 magazines, more than 30 bookstores, over 30 printing presses, and 139 newspapers and magazines for restricted circulation. Last year, the province published more than 7 million copies of 518 book titles, more than 100 million copies of 14 newspapers, 3.58 million copies of 31 kinds of magazines, and more than 35 million copies (cassettes) of over 30,000 kinds of audio- video products. Chen Keqing said that the press and publishing had made great contributions to the flourishing of the economy and culture in Hainan, and Hainan would adopt effective measures to promote the continuous and healthy development of the press and publishing.
