The occupants, of which only 73 remain in the Belgian ambassador's residence and 21 in the German Embassy, discontinued their efforts to travel to the countries whose missions they invaded, the Cuban foreign minister asserted. Robaina told almost 200 U.S. citizens, who came to Cuba as part of a campaign to challenge the Washington government's prohibition against U.S. citizens' travel to the island, about the occupation of diplomatic missions. He said the U.S. Interests Section in Havana has denied 40,000 visas to Cubans who had their documents in order and wanted to visit the United States this year. "We could add the almost 150 Cubans in the embassies to those 40,000 because they would not have acted by force if they knew they would achieve their objective through regular mechanisms," Robaina said. Cuba and the United States have a valid immigration agreement, which was signed in 1987. The agreement stipulates that Washington will grant up to 20,000 entry visas to Cuban citizens every year. In reality, however, it only grants approximately 1,500 every year. Robaina confirmed the Cuban Government's position that it will not authorize the people who occupied foreign missions by force to leave the country. [passage omitted]
