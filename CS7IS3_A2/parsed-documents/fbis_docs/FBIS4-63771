Douglas Hurd, head of the British Foreign Office, is in Kiev on a one-day official visit. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko described the atmosphere at the meeting as constructive and open. Answering a question about the situation in the Crimea following the adoption of a new constitution by the Crimean parliament, he said his position on this has been set out in a letter to the UN secretary general. The decision of the Crimean parliament is illegal and contradicts the Ukrainian Constitution, Zlenko stressed. For his own part, Hurd said Great Britain supports the Ukraine's integrity and sovereignty of its present borders and he hopes the dispute between Kiev and the Simferopol authorities will be resolved "by peaceful means and without the use of force." The British minister said he discussed this problem with Russian leaders in Moscow this morning. He said Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin hold a similar point of view and consider that the problem must be resolved without the use of force. Hurd also hopes bilateral relations between Ukraine and the European Union and NATO will develop successfully.
