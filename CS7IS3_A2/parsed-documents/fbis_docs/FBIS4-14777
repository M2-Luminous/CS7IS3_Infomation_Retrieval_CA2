Only a few members of the group left in automobiles for southeast Armenia. Their meeting with Nagorno-Karabakh leaders will be held either in Armenia's border areas or in a Nagorno-Karabakh village close to the Lachin corridor. The ITAR- TASS correspondent learned this at the Armenian Supreme Soviet press center. It will probably take the parliamentarians 10 hours to travel there and back. There is a shortage of seats so no journalists are involved in the trip. The CIS interparliamentary assembly delegation plan to return to Moscow this evening.
