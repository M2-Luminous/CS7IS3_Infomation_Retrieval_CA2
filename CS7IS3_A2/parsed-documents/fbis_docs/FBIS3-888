Officially, this was due to schedule constraints. The High Council of Resistance took this opportunity to hold a news conference in Libreville today. The High Council of Resistance says it agrees with the head of state and the prime minister on the idea of dialogue. There are, however, several outstanding differences to be solved. The opposition thinks discussions should focus mainly on the progress of democracy. During the news conference, the High Council of Resistance deputy chairman, Jean-Louis Agondjo-Okawe, stressed that while the opposition remains open to dialogue, it will not take part in negotiations in a state of emergency, referring to the state of alert, which was reimposed following recent disturbances in Libreville. Pierre Louis Agondjo-Okawe spoke to Jonas Lomba. [Begin Agondjo-Okawe recording] The situation must first of all be eased. We can then begin negotiations in the presence of mediators. First, we need to remove all these obstacles before starting negotiations; not to discuss the formation of a government or the government's program, but to hold proper discussions [words indistinct] on the state of democracy. The national conference democracy is still (?in its early stages). We do not want to be told that we first have to enter a government because that is out of the question. We want the United States to be present at the negotiations for a number of reasons. First, it is currently the world's greatest power, and second, we are obliged to trade with it. It will also be a guarantee for the Gabonese. [end recording]
