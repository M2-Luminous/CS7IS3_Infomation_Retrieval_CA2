FBIS4-66018 "drweu103_q_94004" FBIS-WEU-94-103 Daily Report 19 May 1994 TURKEY Columnist on Government Democratization Package Columnist on Government Democratization Package TA2605141994 Istanbul MILLIYET in Turkish 19 May 94 p 13 TA2605141994 Istanbul MILLIYET Turkish BFN ["Daily" column by Yalcin Dogan: "Democratization Scandal!"] [Excerpt] The southeast and consequently the "Kurdish package" has been excluded from the democratization package that was announced yesterday. About 20 days ago, the Social Democratic Populist Party [SDPP] submitted a draft to the True Path Party [TPP]. This draft included some rights "which were supposed to be granted to the Kurds." The package announced yesterday, however, does not incorporate these. The SDPP first drafted a proposal for the democratization package, to which it attaches great importance and to which it links its very existence in the government. This draft was then discussed at a meeting attended by Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, SDPP leader Murat Karayalcin, as well as certain TPP and SDPP deputies. During the meeting, Ciller described the proposal as "very good, very appropriate" and the SDPP members were ecstatic. Yesterday, however, those same ecstatic SDPP members were very reticent. What does this draft, which was reportedly "agreed upon" and which was suspended yesterday, actually contain? These are the details: In the draft, the SDPP says: "The legal and de facto obstacles that emerge during the expression of a cultural identity will be eliminated." What are these obstacles? The draft proposes "the introduction of Kurdish education, Kurdish radio and television broadcasting, the elimination of the difficulties encountered when people use their Kurdish names, and the obstacles in establishing foundations." There are still actual obstacles in presenting names and establishing foundations. Moreover, the draft includes the practical suggestion "to begin Kurdish television broadcasting with GAP [Southeast Anatolia Project] TV." The draft, which was approved by Ciller 20 days ago, provoked the reaction of TPP members last week and was subsequently rejected. What does this leave us with? We are left with amendments to certain articles of the Constitution and various arrangements which are not really related to democratization, such as lowering the age to vote and be elected, making it easier for deputies to switch parties, and controlling the annulment of laws. This is an insipid package, which does not need to be called a democratization package. For example, it does not grant the right to strike and conduct collective wage negotiations to civil servant unions and continues to prevent university teachers from joining a political party. It is merely a bunch of decisions necessitated by current conditions. Therefore, let no one attempt to publicize it as a "democratization package." On the contrary, as stated in yesterday's news conference, "the new provincial administration law will spread the state of emergency conditions not only to the southeast, but to the entire country." This is not what we say. During yesterday's news conference, Ciller said the following in answer to a question: "The provincial private administration law must be enacted before we can lift the state of emergency." Here, too, she confuses the provincial private administration and the provincial administration law. But, this is another matter. Nonetheless, the so-called democratization package acquires a "scandalous" nature because of the prime minister's own statement. Ciller links the lifting of the state of emergency to the enactment of the provincial administration law. In the text she read earlier, however, she describes the "provincial administration law as part of democratization." In fact, the provincial administration law is the alternative to the state of emergency. Then, what is it doing in the democratization package? Alternatively, since when has the state of emergency been a part of democratization? This draft law, which has been overlooked, in fact "spreads the state of emergency to the entire country." So much so that "the district official is the only ruler in the district and the governor is the only ruler in the province." [passage omitted]
