We publish here the closing section of his speech at this meeting that was attended by many statesmen from the Balkan countries and at which the main topics were Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] and Kosova. ``... What do the Kosovars want? Nothing more and nothing less than to be allowed to freely exercise their will as a people. The Kosovars ask to realize their aspirations in a peaceful way. A peaceful movement of this kind is something new in the Balkans and, if it brings results, can only increase the hopes of the Balkan peoples for a brighter future. It will be a clear and fair sign that conflicts even in the Balkans can be solved in a civilized manner before resorting to force. "Many people suggest that the Kosovars should accept autonomy, similar to that created in 1974. Those who support this idea seem to forget that such a thing was tried in the past. It did not work. The Serbian regime succeeded in revoking Kosova's autonomy even at a time when Yugoslavia possessed a complex structure that all the constitutive people might have hoped would protect them. Autonomy would now be entirely in the hands of Serbia." To Ask For Autonomy for the Kosovars Is To Ask Them To Remain Under Greater Serbia ``To suggest autonomy for Kosova is as if to ask Slovenia to return to what used to be called Yugoslavia, to ask Croatia to forget the war visited upon it by the Serbian aggressor, its cities turned to dust and ashes like Vukovar, the bombardment of Dubrovnik, and the forced migrations, and to return to Yugoslavia. To ask Kosova to accept autonomy is as if to ask Bosnia to forget its 200,000 dead, its thousands upon thousands of women raped, and the millions of people ethnically cleansed, and to return to Yugoslavia. Those who suggest autonomy for Kosova must realize clearly that this is the same as asking the Kosovars to remain under Greater Serbia, under Serbian dictatorship, always oppressed, persecuted, harassed in every possible way, and treated as a colony. Those who suggest autonomy only show that they are not ready to grapple with the regime of a dictator. ``The people of Kosova are not asking for independence just like that. Their case is not simply one of secessionism. The state of which they are once a part has disintegrated and no other state that may subsequently arise can incorporate them within its borders against their will. When the problems in Yugoslavia started, Kosova asked simply for equality. All that Kosova asks now is to enter as an equal partner into negotiations and for a satisfactory solution to be found. What is wrong with equality? The Serbs should never be frightened of equality. The demands of the Albanians of Kosova are in no way directed against the Serbs, and are not directed against Serbian cultural monuments, or against Serbian civilization, in spite of the fact that it has been these same Serbs who, in the last two or three years, have mercilessly destroyed the civilization of non-Serbs in Croatia, Bosnia, and elsewhere. ``The Albanians of Kosova do not possess the argument of force. They cannot compel the international community to take sufficient measures against Serbia. Nevertheless, we insist on certain steps that the international community should urgently take. ``One step that must be taken immediately, in our view, is to tighten the international sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro, and to make the eventual lifting of these sanctions conditional upon achieving a satisfactory solution for all the problems of the Yugoslav crisis, including Kosova. This is in the spirit of the decisions of the London Conference on the Former Yugoslavia. It must be underlined that Kosova is suffering the effect of these sanctions for no fault of its own. "The people of Kosova are nevertheless ready to continue to endure these sanctions, although they are an additional difficulty, in the hope that these sanctions, however inadequate they may be, may have some effect in halting Serbia." Kosova Is a Regional Problem ``Kosova must then be demilitarized and its democratic institutions restored. A form of international protectorate must be established in Kosova. Because Kosova is a regional problem and not Serbia's internal affair, the neighboring Balkan countries must play a more constructive role, because peace is endangered in these countries, too. The worst thing that can happan is for Balkan countries to take the side of the aggressor. ``The presence of observers and the maintenance of sanctions can only normalize the situation and reinforce the people's constant belief that their situation can be alleviated only by peaceful means. This is the only way in which the necessary conditions can be created to enable us to take part as equals and without preconditions in negotiations on Kosova. Otherwise, the future will be unsure and unpredictable. Let me underline once again, on behalf of the government of Kosova, that we have a mandate to act upon the will of the people, and we will continue to do this. Self- determination is not an exclusive right of the Serbs, but a principle applied throughout the world. In this context and in this spirit, we appeal to the United Nations Security Council, the CSCE, the United States, and Russia, and all democratic governments, to help Kosova to avert conflict and to achieve a normal life for its people. "We invite all democratic government to recognize the will of the people of Kosova for a free and self-determined existence. Only justice can be eternal," Dr. Bujar Bukoshi, prime minister of the republic of Kosova, said in conclusion.
