FR940816-2-00010 FR940816-2-00008 National Institute of Standards and Technology AGENCY: National Institute of Standards and Technology, Commerce. ACTION: Notice of government owned inventions available for licensing. SUMMARY: The inventions listed below are owned by the U.S. Government, as represented by the Department of Commerce, and are available for licensing in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 207 and 37 CFR Part 404 to achieve expeditious commercialization of results of federally funded research and development. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Technical and licensing information on these inventions may be obtained by writing to: Marcia Salkeld, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Office of Technology Commercialization, Physics Building, Room B&hyph;256, Gaithersburg, MD 20899; Fax 301&hyph;869&hyph;2751. Any request for information should include the NIST Docket No. and Title for the relevant invention as indicated below. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The inventions available for licensing are: NIST Docket NO. 91&hyph;007 Title: X-Ray Photoelectron Emission Spectrometry System. Description: New NIST technology using x-ray photoelectron emission spectroscopy makes it possible to obtain depth information on chemical species located 1 to 5 nanometers beneath a material surface. The technique eliminates distortions in the data which may result from changes in position between the sample and electron spectrometer during analysis. It also takes advantage of the x-ray reflectivity of the sample. NIST Docket No. 92&hyph;049 Title: Faraday Effect Magnetic Field Sensor. Description: NIST researchers have successfully demonstrated a flux-concentration technique for enhancing the sensitivity of magneto-optic magnetic field sensors. The resulting Faraday effect sensor is 200 times more sensitive than the magneto-optic material alone. NIST Docket No. 93&hyph;024 Title: Piezoelectric Linear Stepping Motor. Description: The NIST ``Miliped'' is a piezo driven linear stepping motor that uses a novel application of the expansion properties of piezo ceramics coupled with a novel motor housing. This design provides greater clamping/driving force in a robust and stiff actuator that is easily manufactured. Range of travel is limited only by housing length with a minimum step size limited only by the quality of the power supply. NIST Docket No. 93&hyph;053 Title: Thin Film High Temperature Silicide Thermocouples. Description: The invention includes a method of preparing a thin film metal silicide thermoelements for thermocouples with superior durability in air at 700&hyph;900 degrees Celsius and thermocouples made using this structure. NIST Docket No. 93&hyph;072C Title: Multiple Memory Self-Organizing Pattern Recognition Network. Description: A NIST neural network has been developed which allows patterns to be filtered, recognized, and classified with no prespecified class or filtering information. The technology allows adaptive, high accuracy, parallel classification of complex noisy patterns from a small set of training examples. Dated: August 9, 1994. Samuel Kramer, Associate Director.
