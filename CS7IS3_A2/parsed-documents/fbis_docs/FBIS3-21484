On this basis, one can compare the nation's economy to a government economy. One of the main differences between a government economy and a free economy is that in a government economy price increases are made by the government, while in a free economy the fluctuations of supply and demand determine price changes. It is for this reason, and perhaps others, that most economists believe that government involvement in an economy will have a positive result when the government's share in all production is more than 75 percent or less than 30 percent. Between 30 percent and 75 percent, the government's share in total production is not that desirable. Last week the Council of Ministers was unable to pass Note 25, and in reality the Majles opposed price increases for some government goods, and the people were very happy with this Majles measure. However, every day we see that the prices of goods and services are increasing without the Majles taking the government to task for it. As examples, one can mention the increased prices for Vahed Company bus tickets, meat, chicken, milk, residential rentals and hundreds of other items. However, because some of these things are not marketed directly by the government, there is no need for the Majles to approve increases in their prices. On the other hand the Economic Council, which was once called the Price Setting Council, considers the setting the prices of goods and services to be one of its responsibilities, because in Iran's government economy leaving prices all at once to market supply and demand is impossible. This may be due to the fact that one of the basic bottlenecks in Iran's economy is the marketing of goods. When supply cannot respond to increased demand, in a free economy the result is definitely an increase in price. Unfortunately, however, the current situation in the nation's economy is neither fish nor fowl. The government does not have the least involvement in price fluctuations and on the other hand some of the things the government does cause price increases. For example, the increase in the price of Vahed bus tickets led to increases in other transportation fares. Of course, since the government has decided to leave it to the market to set prices and to refrain from unnecessary intervention, the public was forced to accept price increases in transportation services. Unfortunately, however, the planners of such an economy (neither government nor private) did not take all the aspects into account. They must not [as published] keep the following points in mind at all times: 1. If the economy is to turn a greater role over to the private sector, then the problem of supply in the economy must first be solved. Otherwise, the pricing mechanism will not be efficient. 2. An economy and people who have gotten used to government pricing over a period of many years cannot support the lack of government involvement, especially in the domestic commercial sector. Moreover, if the government exercises effective control over prices and distribution procedures, it will be more beneficial to society and the government. It must be said that government pricing is not at all in conflict with the policies of privatization. 3. Again, because of limited supply, proposed price increases for government goods will have no effect other than to cause a series of price increases for other goods. In short, under current circumstances, neither the government nor the private sector is able to manage Iran's economy. Before some kind of damage is done to the various sectors, the respected Council of Ministers must go into action before certain conditions reduce its involvement, while at the same time, as it sets the prices for government goods and services it must also keep in mind the effects this will have on other goods.
