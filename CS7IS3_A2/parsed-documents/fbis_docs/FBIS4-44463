This series of undertakings has already attracted broad attention from media circles at home and abroad. On 30 March, the State Foreign Current Management Office, Policy Regulations Department Department Chief Yang Gonglin agreed to an interview by this reporter. Department Chief Yang provided a detailed and authoritative elaboration of matters of concern to readers. The transition period of reform is going smoothly, the RMB exchange rate is basically stable Since the start of reform of the foreign exchange system, the originally specified program called for a transition period of January to March, the reason being that the pace of reform was quite substantial, which contained much substance, and some measures had to be implemented in succession up to April 1. Looking at the situation at present, during these three months, China's foreign exchange management system reform has seen the transition from the old to the new system. First, a smooth change has been brought about from dual exchange rates to a single exchange rate, and the basic stability of the exchange rate has been maintained. Second, the turnover of foreign exchange to higher authorities and the retention of a portion of foreign exchange have been eliminated, and a bank foreign exchange conversion system has been implemented, increasing the amounts of foreign exchange on hand. Foreign currency on hand at the end of last year was $21.1 billion, which at present it has reached more than $27 billion. It should be stressed that this is mainly due not to an increase in export generated foreign exchange, but reflects changes in foreign exchange allocation mechanisms. Following the elimination of the turning over of foreign exchange to higher authorities and the retaining of foreign currency, enterprises were happy to go to the bank for foreign exchange conversion, and have also taken foreign currency retained abroad and returned it for conversion. In addition, in the non-trade area, after the issuing of foreign exchange certificates (FEC) ceased, there was direct formation of foreign exchange income, and there was some foreign exchange income earned last year year has been recalled for conversion this year. Due to these factors, the overall increase in foreign exchange income can be explained by the smooth progress of this reform. But we also cannot be blindly optimistic, there is also a need to increase export generated foreign exchange. During the transition period, the People's Bank has adopted a number of measures to ensure that enterprises that are importing can use foreign currency. Third, after the issuing of FECs ceased, the reclaiming of FECs has gone smoothly, and up to the end of February, close to 1 billion yuan worth of FEC had been reclaimed, though several hundreds of millions remain in circulation. Fourth, the interbank foreign exchange market has been prepared, and already, in the five cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hangzhou and Shenzhen a linked network has been achieved, and starting from 1 March, foreign exchange transactions are being conducted transregionally, while the test running results have been very good. After 1 April, other cities will be linked one by one to the network including Guangzhou, Xiamen, Chengdu, Wuhan, Nanjing, and Qingdao, and there will be a progressive expansion of the area of coverage. Here I must stress that in some locales people are saying that the network has encountered difficulties, and that the operation of interbank foreign exchange market will be postponed, hence deducing of exchange rates cannot be stabilized. This rumor is completely unfounded, and the stability of exchange rates is primarily determined by the supply and demand relationship of foreign currencies, and bears no direct relationship whatever to the network. At the same time, within the transition period, the relevant concrete implementation plans were drafted, in order to gradually place the reform program implementation on an institutional basis. Each bank, in order to enter the unified market, also is properly handling the mental and technological operational preparation. The reasons for those achievements that have been attained within the transition period include: one, this instance of reform is a steady deepening of the previous several instances of foreign exchange system reform; second, the policy measures are reliable, and retain the foreign exchange swap centers for supply of foreign currencies, while the central bank makes up the difference to ensure that there is not advantage in the foreign exchange; third, the transparency level is high, and has been understood and supported by all. In the process of reform, maintaining stable exchange rates is a very important condition. Modern exchange rates are a product of the market, and are produced on the basis of a weighted average price of the foreign exchange bought and sold throughout the country in the 18 foreign exchange swap centers, and basically reflects market supply and demand relations. At the same time, due to the practice of the foreign exchange conversion system, and increases in the state's foreign exchange surplus, the ability of the state to intervene in the market also increases. A Unified Foreign Exchange Market Begins To Operate, the Price Formation Mechanism is Becoming More Perfected Starting on 1 April, operation of a national unified interbank foreign exchange market began, in contrast to the situation in the past where scattered enterprises used a nonstandard market to conduct foreign exchange transactions through swap centers. The past foreign exchange swap centers, even though it historically had a major effect, in the end it was decentralized, and nonstandard. Under the premise that banks convert foreign currency and sell foreign currency as a service to enterprises, the banks per se will engender the problem of regulation of foreign currency funds. Hence banks must mutually buy and sell foreign currencies, and at the same time, objectively they can demand that the central bank handle intervention in the foreign exchange market. The foreign exchange center established in Shanghai is a leap into the foreign exchange market. The market will take headquarters of all banks involving domestic foreign exchange work as its principle focus. At the same time will allow foreign capital banks to apply for admission. Considering the conditions of China's current stage of development and the stipulations in the foreign exchange system reform plan that ensure no change in foreign-funded enterprise, foreign exchange management, swap centers will still be retained, this will primarily be of service to foreign currency regulation among foreign-funded enterprises, and assist them in maintaining balance. However, the prices of swap centers will be consistent with the prices of the unified market, this is an issue which is being put into effect. After the formation of a unified market, rational operation of foreign currency funds will be promoted, and different foreign currency prices engendered by foreign currency supply and demand imbalances between regions will be resolved, further perfecting the price formation mechanism, and this will be beneficial to stabilizing exchange rates. From now on the interbank foreign exchange market transaction first day closing price will be taken as the primary basis for the central bank published second day RMB to US dollar middle rate. Looking at the current supply and demand situation, foreign currency supply will be ensured, while foreign currency demand will also not suddenly increase. Therefore, foreign exchange prices will remain stable at the current levels. Comprehensive Implementation of Currency Conversion Currency Purchasing, Foreign Exchange Quotas Will Not Be Abolished Starting on 1 April, there will be a comprehensive implementation of a bank currency conversion, and currency purchasing system. However, there will also need to be an adjustment period, as the past operation sequence of enterprise foreign currency employment has already been completely replaced by the new system, and for this reason it is necessary to as rapidly as possible become familiar with the new sequence. The enterprise foreign exchange employment examination and approval system has basically already been abolished, and enterprise foreign exchange employment has become much more convenient. At the same time even more pressure is being placed on enterprises, and it is necessary to protect against exchange rate risks, while the basic stability of the RMB exchange rate depends on the concern and safeguarding of enterprises and various circles of the society. Enterprises, in the process of engaging in international trade, must pay attention to forecasting trends in various currencies, and choose a suitable currency for settling accounts, while mastering the use of financial methods for avoiding and reducing exchange rate risks. At present in the society there are rumors that indicate the foreign exchange quota on 1 April must be abolished or people will be forced to sell. This is completely without foundation. In the past the foreign exchange quotas that enterprises had still can be used by at the enterprises' own initiative, and there is no issue that became invalid on 1 April. In addition there will be no coercion to sell, therefore enterprises can be completely at ease, and there is no need to believe all that one hears.
