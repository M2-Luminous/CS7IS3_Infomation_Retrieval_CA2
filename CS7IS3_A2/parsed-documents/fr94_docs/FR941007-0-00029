After this six-month period of time, the nurse must be granted permanent state licensure in order to maintain his or her eligibility for H&hyph;1A classification in the state of employment or any other state or territory of the United States. (C) A nurse shall automatically lose his or her eligibility for H&hyph;1A classification if he or she is no longer performing the duties of a registered professional nurse.

An extension of stay may be authorized for a period of up to two years for a beneficiary of an H&hyph;1A petition. The alien's total period of stay may not exceed five years, except in extraordinary circumstances. An H&hyph;1A alien who has been in the United States for a period of five years in such status may receive a one-year extension of stay if it is established by the petitioner that extraordinary circumstances exist which warrant such an extension. Extraordinary circumstances shall exist when the director finds that termination of the alien's services will impose extreme hardship on the petitioner's business operation or that the alien's services are required in the national welfare, safety, or security interests of the United States. Each request for an extension of stay for the beneficiary of an H&hyph;1A petition must be accompanied by a current copy of the Department of Labor's notice of acceptance of the petitioner's attestation on Form ETA 9029. A request for an extension of stay filed in behalf of an alien who initially entered the United States on the basis of a temporary license must be accompanied by evidence that the alien has remained in a valid H&hyph;1A status since his or her initial entry into the United States. * * * * * Dated: September 16, 1994.
