The sources told LOS TIEMPOS in La Paz that the subversive group that was broken up in 1991 resumed its terrorist activities in La Paz, Cochabamba, and Sucre by calling for armed insurrection in various rural districts. They said this subversive organization "plans to act with greater force" in La Paz and Cochabamba Departments, and that the signs of subversive activity "are the writing on walls seen by state intelligence in the two departments' rural districts." They indicated that the EGTK, in contrast to other guerrilla organizations with similar characteristics such as the Nestor Paz Zamora Command (CNPZ) or the Zarate Willka Armed Liberation Forces (FAL-ZW), "still have ideological leaders because not all of them were arrested by the intelligence organizations." The sources added: "An example is the recent capture of Victor Poma after three years. He was accused of terrorist activities and actions against state security." The EGTK began subversive activities on 4 July 1991 when it blew up two high-tension pylons in El Alto's Alto Lima area. This terrorist action lead to the death of one of its members and was the beginning of a series of subversive acts against state security, which later led to the arrest of its main leaders. The intelligence organizations then arrested brothers Raul Garcia and Albaro Garcia, and Felipe Quispe, alias "El Mallku," who are currently in the high-security Chonchocoro prison. The sources said Victor Poma's arrest is the beginning for the arrest of Carlos Lara, who has been identified as one of the EGTK "general staff" members and is currently a fugitive from justice.
