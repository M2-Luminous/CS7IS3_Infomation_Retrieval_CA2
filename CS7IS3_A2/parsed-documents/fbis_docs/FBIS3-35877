Sviridov; from the "Vesti" newscast] [Text] [Sviridov] Official Minsk is awaiting the visit of Oleg Soskovets, the first deputy prime minister of the Russian Government. It is thought that in the course of the talks a package of documents will be finally agreed on the unification of the two states monetary systems. There is especial controversy on the question of mutual settlements. But Vladimir Ratkevich, the chairman of the State Committee for Foreign Economic Relations, considers that: [Ratkevich] It is pointless for the Russians to worry that Belarus will dump a great deal of funds onto Russia's monetary system; that there will be inflation. I am sure that when Russia takes down its customs barriers, takes down its customs, and when prices are equalized it will be more efficient for enterprises to get what they need both in Belarus and Russia. [Sviridov] Meanwhile, in the republic discussions are being held on the possible exchange rate. For citizens of course a rate of one to one has been fixed. Industrialists insist on their own: One to three or one to four. No doubt not without justification, because trade with Russia comprises almost 70 percent of its overall volume with countries of the former USSR.
