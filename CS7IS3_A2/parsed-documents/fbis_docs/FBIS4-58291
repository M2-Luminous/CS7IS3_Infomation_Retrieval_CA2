Musa said: We hope the clashes will stop, as President Mubarak said. He called for putting an end to armed clashes in order to protect Yemeni unity from disintegration. Commenting on the results of the elections in South Africa, Musa said the African National Congress had been favored and expected to win the majority of votes. He remarked that this is a giant step in South African history because, once the elections are over, the road will be open to putting an end once and for all to racial discrimination and apartheid, so they can embark on a new era of democracy and majority rule. Egypt is looking forward to the final results and the proclamation of the new system in South Africa, he said. Touching on the situation in Rwanda, the foreign minister said the situation in Rwanda is very serious and requires collective African action. This is what President Mubarak emphasized in his messages and in his contacts with the United Nations and the OAU, because it is primarily an African responsibility. But it is also an international responsibility, Musa said.
