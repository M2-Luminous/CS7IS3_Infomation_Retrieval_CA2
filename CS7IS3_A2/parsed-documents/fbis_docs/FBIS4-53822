The chief Indonesian delegate, Brig. Gen. Cholid Ghozali, in remarks at the meeting's opening, said the gathering was an opportunity to formulate better ways of maintaining security and stability along the border shared by the two countries. He said talks at the meeting would also touch on the implementation of certain portions of a memorandum of understanding between the two countries on the establishment of their sub-committee on border security. Formation of the sub-committee on border security was decided at a meeting of the Indonesia-PNG Joint Border Committee held in Rabaul last year, he noted. The leader of the PNG delegation, Colonel Andrew Trongat, meanwhile said the meeting would try to find ways of improving security in the border region where a number of small incidents had taken place. Overall security in the border region, however, was "good", he said. What the present meeting had to try to accomplish was better coordination between security agencies on both sides of the border to minimize the occurrence of incidents, Trongat said. Security in RI-PNG border regions was in the past sometimes stirred by Indonesians crossing the border into PNG territory instigated by the security disturbing movement, GPK. Irian Jaya Governor Jacob Pattipi said recently these people had been deceived by hollow promises of a better life. Most of the border-crossers had now returned to their home villages in Irian Jaya with the assistance of the PNG government, he said.
