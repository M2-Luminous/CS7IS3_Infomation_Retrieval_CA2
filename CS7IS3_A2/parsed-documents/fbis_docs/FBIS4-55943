All the members of Moravcik's new government are at present undergoing the screening required by law to see if they collaborated with the communist secret police. However, the process is being held up because it is not clear who should issue the certificates, Moravcik said recently. Under the former federation, screening certificates were issued by the Federal Interior Ministry, and "from the constitutional law on the demise of the federation it follows that the relevant organ for the issue of screening certificates is the Slovak Interior Ministry," Valko says. In March 1993 the government of ex-premier Vladimir Meciar entrusted the SIS with issuing screening certificates for a period of nine months. After this the question of the competent body was to be dealt with by legislation, but this never happened. The present government, according to its statements, intends to solve the problem by amending the law on the SIS and the screening law, which bans secret police collaborators from holding high office. "I find it very difficult to understand how, in a government which included a professor of administrative law (Katharina Tothova) and where the government decree was conceived by legislators, such a misunderstanding could have occurred," Valko said.
