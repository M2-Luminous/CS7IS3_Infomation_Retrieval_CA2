FBIS4-34828 "drlat122_t_94004" FBIS-LAT-94-122 Daily Report 22 Jun 1994 Venezuela Government Denies Responsibility for Crisis Government Denies Responsibility for Crisis PA2406040594 Caracas Union Radio Network in Spanish 2200 GMT 22 Jun 94 PA2406040594 Caracas Union Radio Network Spanish BFN [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] [Text] The government does not take responsibility for the financial crisis the nation is experiencing, because, according to Guillermo Alvarez Bajares, OCI [Central Information Office] director, the Executive Branch does not have a major say in decisions made by the Banking Superintendency and the Central Bank of Venezuela. In his statements, which were motivated by the proposed censure vote against Finance Minister Julio Sosa, Alvarez Bajares said that the responsibility falls on the Congress, because the government's legal actions, which are very well defined, exclude it from making such decisions. Regardless of whether the parliament approves the appointment, it is the president who appoints candidates to head these organizations. In the opinion of the OCI director, government officials are not implementing decisions of the Fogade [Deposit Guarantee and Banking Protection Fund], Banking Superintendency, and Central Bank of Venezuela. As a result, contradictions appear in each of these institutions. He admitted that the situation is difficult to manage. Even though the decision to subsidize the banks was made at a cabinet meeting and subsequently sent to the Congress for its approval, Alvarez Bajares insisted that the problem belongs to the political parties that approved the subsidies and now criticize the situation. [Begin Alvarez Bajares recording] Except for the [words indistinct] management problem it has inherited and its attempts to mitigate the resulting social effects, the government has little responsibility for management as far as a decisions made on specific issues are concerned. The government does not manage monetary policy, it does not manage the amount of subsidies granted to banks, and it does not manage or control bank operations. The OCI minister reiterated that the government does not necessarily agree with policies adopted until now; it is just the contrary. The government objects to the high interest rates, among other things, but this policy is not the responsibility of the Finance Ministry, he noted.
