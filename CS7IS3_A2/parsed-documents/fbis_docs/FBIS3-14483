The shootings were "a premeditated crime carried out in cold blood by killers within the Israeli army who want to kill the peace process," Sha'th told AFP. Israeli troops shot dead six members of the armed wing of PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat's Fatah group on Monday in a Gaza Strip refugee camp. Another Palestinian died and 29 were wounded in clashes with Israeli troops on Tuesday. Palestinian witnesses denied Israeli army allegations that the Fatah men were armed, and said they were shot in cold blood as they handed out leaflets. The shootings came as Israel and the PLO prepared to meet in Cairo Tuesday amid hopes of clinching a security deal for protecting Palestinians, opening the way for a resumption of autonomy negotiations. Sha'th said it was not a coincidence that last week "five Palestinians were killed in Hebron (last week) on the eve of a resumption of talks ... and that they (Israeli soldiers) committed a crime in Gaza on the eve of Tuesday's talks." Sha'th said he has also been in touch with the US officials about the incident. Army deputy chief of staff General Amnon Shahaq telephoned Sha'th during the night to explain the shootings were "not premeditated" and that such incidents were unavoidable, Israeli state radio said. Sha'th declined to say whether Tuesday's talks would now be postponed following the latest shootings. He said he had been in contact with PLO headquarters in Tunis where "intense meetings have been going on all night." An Israeli foreign ministry spokesman said Israeli negotiators were to fly to Cairo Tuesday despite fears that the talks may not go ahead. Five Palestinians were killed in a 20-hour Israeli army operation last week in Hebron, when soldiers pounded a house being used as a hideout for members of the Islamic Resistance Movement HAMAS, hours before Israeli and PLO delegations met in Cairo.
