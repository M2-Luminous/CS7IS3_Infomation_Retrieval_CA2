FBIS4-48174 "drafr093_c_94007" FBIS-AFR-94-093 Daily Report 13 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 13 May South African Press Review for 13 May MB1305153394 MB1305153394 BFN [Editorial Report] THE STAR The Rainbow Cabinet -- President Mandela's first Cabinet is "a mixed bag," its composition "partly determined by the constitutional provision that parties which achieved a specified amount of electoral support had to be represented," notes an editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 11 May on page 8. Keeping Keys and Roelf Meyer and the portfolios of the three IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] ministers "strike a good balance," while "most interest -- and criticism -- has centered" on ANC appointees such as Alfred Nzo and the omission of Cyril Ramaphosa. The deputy premiership for the "controversial Winnie Mandela is bound to raise hackles in some quarters." The "absence" of Freedom Front leader Viljoen and "the entire white right is unfortunate." However, the "most pertinent question" is how the "rainbow Cabinet" will function. "Winnie Mandela will need to co-operate closely with her minister, the IFP's Dr. Ben Ngubane. Bantu Holomisa is deputy to Environment Affairs and Tourism Minister, Dawie de Villiers. Home Affairs Mangosuthu Buthelezi must work together with Public Works' Jeff Radebe, the ANC's southern Natal leader and a bitter enemy in the past." Were the implications not so serious, it might be said these combinations were put together by someone with a fine sense of humor. But co-operation at Cabinet level will be vital if the new dispensation is to work effectively." Cabinet members and their deputies "will have to approach their new roles in the spirit of reconciliation so apparent in President Mandela's every action since assuming the presidency." BUSINESS DAY Cabinet of Reconciliation -- "President's Nelson Mandela's insistence on Tuesday that the entire nation should give equal respect to the two halves of the double-barrelled national anthem was yet another symbolic illustration of what is more materially apparent in the construction of the Cabinet," begins the Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 13 May in a page-10 editorial. "From the perspective of those who may have had fears about the future and the ANC's plans for it, Mandela has gone far further than could reasonably have been asked of him in giving meaning to the concept of reconciliation." Both the National Party and the Inkatha Freedom Party have been given "more Cabinet posts than their electoral performances entitled them to"....and have been given "quality portfolios which should build public confidence generally." BUSINESS DAY adds that Buthelezi's appointment to a "national rather than regional" portfolio is "visionary." The positioning of the ANC's "two `unguided missiles' -- Winnie Mandela and Bantu Holomisa" also shows "extensive thought." The idea being that they can cause less harm inside government than outside. The editorial writes that "it seems that reconciliation is a higher priority than efficiency and experience." NEW NATION Foreign Involvement in Ending Apartheid Viewed -- "It was a joyous week for all South Africans as we were joined by the world in celebrating the inauguration of President Mandela, who has over decades come to personify the ideals that so many had given up their lives for." So begins the Johannesburg NEW NATION in English on 13 May in a page-7 editorial. "However, it must be of concern to many that, while statesmen from countries to the north of us were acknowledged in as far as they were accorded places alongside leaders from Britain and the United States, there was no specific mention of the scale of the sacrifices that their people made." Angola, Mozambique, Zambia, and Tanzania are mentioned, but most the editorial's praise is reserved for Cuba. "What needs to be said very forcefully is that we might not have been in a position to celebrate a victory this week had it not been for the Cubans, who in the spirit of internationalism, committed their lives to defeating apartheid's defence force at Cuito Cuanavale."
