Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-09Feb94-Russia Agrarian Lobby Pushes Through Costly Farm Program SUMMARY The agricultural lobby--f resh from success in the 12 December parliamentary election and format ion of one of the largest factions in the State Duma--has quickly demonstrated its power by winning cabinet approval of a program of government support for state and collective farms that will cost trillions of rubles and, according to reformers, set off a wave of inflation. Deputy Premier for agriculture Aleksandr Zaveryukha appears to have orchestrated the drive, instigating the Agrarian faction in the Duma to press for the new program and taking advantage of the resignation of the cabinet's tight money defenders, First Deputy Premier Yegor Gaydar and Deputy Premier Boris Fedorov, to push it through the cabinet. Although the program still must gain Duma approval, the close cooperation between the powerful Agrarian faction in the Duma and Zaveryukha in the cabinet, aided by a sympathetic Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin, has so far proved to be a powerful force in the first post-election struggle over resources. END SUMMARY Zaveryukha, targeted by reformers as one of the cabinet's main foes of reform and fiscal discipline, appears to have played the central role in designing the new.agricultural program and in organizing the cabinet's approval of it. As the second part of a two-pronged campaign, he encouraged Agrarian leaders in parliament to press for greater financial support for agriculture and manuevered within the government to pave the way for the Agrarians' moves in parliament: --On the eve of the 11 January opening of the Duma, Zaveryukha and Agriculture Minister Viktor Khlystun met with the Agrarian faction and spoke on the financial crisis in agriculture, appearing to encourage them to press the cabinet for more money for agriculture (Selskaya Zhizn, 11 January). --An Agriculture Ministry report issued in early January said that the government owed farms 1.3 trillion for agricultural products purchased in 1993 and 800 billion in funds allocated to agriculture but not delivered (Interfax, 14 January). The Agrarian faction in the Duma later used these figures in a resolution calling on the cabinet to pay these debts. --According to the 13 January Rossiyskaya Gazeta, the cabinet had already prepared a draft decree "On Functioning of the Agroindustrial Complex in 1994" apparently strengthening the role of the Agriculture Ministry (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 13 January). According to Deputy Finance Minister Aleksey Krasnopivtsev, the decree called for 25.6 trillion rubles for agriculture (Interfax, 20 January). At a mid-January conference on the decree, Zaveryukha urged that the draft be submitted to the cabinet by 20 January (Interfax, 20 January). Thus the decree was substantially prepared before the Agrarian faction in the Duma on 19 January proposed a resolution calling for a decree "On Functioning of the Agroindustrial Complex in 1994." --The Agrarian faction took up its part of the drive within days after the Duma opened its first session on 11 January. It moved to both press agriculture's financial demands in the wake of Gaydar's resignation on 16 January and to protect Zaveryukha after Fedorov issued a 17 January ultimatum refusing to rejoin the cabinet unless Zaveryukha was removed. At the 19 January Duma session, Chairman of the Duma's Agrarian Committee Aleksandr Nazarchuk demanded immediate discussion of the agricultural situation. The Agrarian faction called on the Duma to approve a statement defending Zaveryukha, assailing Fedorov as "personally responsible for the financial catastrophe in agriculture," and, using the figures in the Agriculture Ministry report, called on the government to pay its debts to the farmers. The Agrarians also presented a resolution asking the Duma to call upon the cabinet to adopt within five days a decree "On the Functioning of the Agroindustrial Complex in 1994" which would satisfy the financial demands of the agrarians (Segodnya, 2O January). The Duma rejected the statement as too extreme (ITAR-TASS, 19 January; Sovetskaya Rossiya, 2O January), but adopted the resolution (ITAR-TASS, Radio Rossii, 19 January; Sovetskaya Rossiya, 20 January). The resolution was approved only on the second vote and, to much surprise, after receiving support from a highly unlikely side- -Russia's Choice leader Gaydar (Radio Rossii, 19 January; Segodnya, 20 January), whose party has been the main foe of the Agrarians and whose tight money policies have stopped government payments to farms. The hostility between Gaydar and the Agrarians had been reflected on the eve of the Duma opening when Agrarian Party Chairman Mikhail Lapshin assailed Russia's Choice for stating that it would not negotiate with "extremists" like the Agrarian Party (Selskaya Zhizn, 11 January). Journalists were "amazed" at Gaydar's support for the Agrarians' resolution, according to the 20 January Segodnya, which reported speculation that he may have been motivated by suspicions that the cabinet was already considering a decree on agricultural subsidies that would be even more "destructive "--suspicions that were probably well founded in view of Zaveryukha's activities. --By 24 January, Zaveryukha told reporters that the cabinet had prepared a draft decree on a program for the agroindustrial complex in 1994 in response to the Duma's demand. He said that the program would pay 1.3 trillion to farms for their 1993 products, allow farms to postpone repayment of their 1993 credits until the next harvest, and keep present state subsidies for equipment, parts, fuel, and fertilizer. He insisted the program would cost the budget only 13-14 trillion, not the 26 trillion that "monetarist-critics" were claiming, and that the budget "can cope" with this amount (Segodnya, 25 January; Interfax, 26 January). Chernomyrdin Cooperation Zaveryukha has appeared to have Premier Chernomyrdin's support in his efforts to boost spending on agriculture despite criticism from reformist quarters. The two traveled to a 25 January Orel conference on agriculture in the Central Russian provinces and made statements pledging large sums to agriculture, setting off alarm among reformers that the cabinet was abandoning tight money and selling out to the farm lobby. According to the 26 January Segodnya, Chernomyrdin promised 2.3 trillion to pay for government debts to farms and large sums to develop Central Russia's agriculture, while Zaveryukha promised even more--40 trillion for Central Russia by the year 2000--prompting the premier to rebuke him for "excessive openness." Novaya Yezhednevnaya Gazeta on 29 January said Chernomyrdin's promise of 2.3 trillion caused monetarists "to accuse the new cabinet of an 'economic coup'" and reported Yeltsin's press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov's 27 January statement that the president was dissatisfied with the cabinet's new agricultural policy. Chernomyrdin quickly asserted that Zaveryukha's 4O trillion was intended to cover agriculture all the way to the year 205O and defended his deputy, complaining that he was being turned into a "scapegoat" (Ostankino TV, 26 January). Zaveryukha also complained that the press was trying to discredit him (Izvestiya, 29 January). Cabinet Approval Zaveryukha scored a major success when the cabinet Presidium met on 3 February and approved the decree "On Functioning of the Agroindustrial Complex in 1994." The Agriculture Ministry declared the cost of the program mandated in the decree to be 14.2 trillion rubles, but critics objected that its real cost is 34 trillion rubles--or "22 billion dollars at the present [exchange] rate" (Segodnya, Kommersant-Daily, 4 February; Andrey Illarionov in the 8 February Izvestiya). (See Note 1 ) The cabinet vigorously debated--for two and a half hours, according to the 5 February Selskaya Zhizn--the cost of the program and how the money would be used. Acting Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin objected that the program would disrupt financial stabilization, and Deputy Premier Anatoliy Chubays objected to provisions for importing agricultural equipment (Izvestiya, 4 February). Even Chernomyrdin cautioned that support for agriculture must be balanced against the need to prevent hyperinflation (Selskaya Zhizn, 5 February), but he went along with the agricultural lobby. (Note 1) The session was closed and reporters were able to learn details only from various participants, resulting in somewhat differing accounts in Segodnya, Izvestiya, Nezavisimaya Gazeta, and Selskaya Zhizn. The pro-agricultural lobby paper Selskaya Zhizn minimized the size of the program, declaring that it totalled only 14 trillion, while the reports in the pro-reform Segodnya, Izvestiya, and Kommersant-Daily stressed statements by the Ministry of the Economy and Chernomyrdin aide Andrey Illarionov that it would total over 34 trillion. Reaction The cabinet decision brought pleasure to the Agrarians but dismay to reformers. Although the decree reportedly did not meet agricultural demands in full, Agrarian Party leaders at a 3 February news conference proclaimed themselves satisfied with it and with the program's restoration of state orders for the main agricultural products (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, Izvestiya, 4 February). In contrast, one of Chernomyrdin's top economic advisers, leader of the premier's Analysis and Planning Group Andrey Illarionov, protested that spending measures in the program will set off hyperinflation and resigned. Illarionov, although a leader of Gaydar's 1992 Working Center for Economic Reforms, had been chosen by Chernomyrdin to head the new Analysis and Planning Group set up in April 1993 to help the new premier deal with macroeconomics (Kommersant-Daily, 4 May 1993). Illarionov told reporters after the cabinet meeting that the January 1994 program provided not only 14.2 trillion of budget subsidies but also 14.5 trillion credit for equipment and 6 trillion credit for the spring sowing--a total of 34.7 trillion. He added that only 8.2 trillion of this 34.7 trillion can be paid for with existing funds and the rest will come from credit emissions and therefore boost inflation to 35 percent a month in April and 50 percent in June and lead to an explosion of "hyperinflation" (Izvestiya, Segodnya, 4 February). In addition to talking to reporters, Illarionov wrote an article published on the front page of the 8 February Izvestiya assailing the cabinet for caving in to the agricultural lobby and complaining that the farmers are "feeding off the people" instead of feeding the people. Illarionov on 7 February sent a letter of resignation to the premier, protesting the allocation of so many resources to the "agroindustrial lobby," the cabinet's abandonment of its anti-inflationary course, and the premier's reliance on agricultural lobbyists (Russian TV, 7 February). (See Note 2) (Note 2) A cabinet spokesman subsequently announced that Illarionov had been fired for "violating labor discipline" (giving lectures in Britain without informing the government) and asserted that his statement of resignation over policy was just an attempt to conceal his dismissal (Interfax, 8 February). Implications The quick post-election victory of the agricultural lobby over reformers and monetarists dims prospects for holding back inflation and fighting off similar claims by other segments of the economy that are still dependent on government support. Chernomyrdin, although voicing concern about inflation, stuck by Zaveryukha and appeared to give the agricultural lobby most of what it wanted. With a big faction in the Duma and a close alliance with the Communist Party faction, the Agrarians stand a good chance of winning approval for their program when the cabinet presents it to the Duma.
