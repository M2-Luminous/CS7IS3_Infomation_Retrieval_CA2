It is not a secret that parliament's crisis on May 18 was intendedly provoked by the authorities. They knew that the irritated opposition would leave Parliament's session and would prefer to conduct a rally. Dispersion of the demonstrators, arrests and slaughter of the deputies and party leaders on May 21 just poured oil in the flame. Yesterday the police seized and beat the deputy and the PFA leader, Ibragim Ibragimli. On the same day the Milli Majlis made a request to President Aliyev to reduce the quorum in the Majlis from 34 to 26 voices. The approval of this request by President Aliyev means that any his proposals will be immediately adopted by legislative body of the country. The opposition is put in the following conditions: Either it will capitulate and resign itself to dictatorship or it will put resistance. The authorities commit outrages and realizing the danger of it, they try to make their activities legal. The conflict between the opposition and the authorities takes place on the background of worsened geopolitical situation and due to this fact foreign forces urge Azerbaijan on confrontation with elements of civil war. Probably, the foreign forces intend to remove the current president. However, he will not leave his office easily and the situation can lose control. One should take into account that Azerbaijan is at the state of war and civil confrontation in the Republic can cause serious consequences.
