These projects are being offered in response to the increased costs and the difficulties in developing natural gas due to environmental concerns, to the competition between countries wanting natural gas that has occurred as a result of countries no longer willing to finance natural gas development, and lastly, to the increased demand for natural gas in Eastern Asia. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) intends to raise the issue of natural gas development as one of the key energy measures it will promote next year. To do that, it plans to beef up the development of natural gas and the way that oil corporations function at the liquefaction stage, and in the future, promote funding of large-scale projects (Sakhalin, Natuna, etc.) and develop mid-size projects (Papua New Guinea, Borneo, Joseph Bonaparte Gulf, etc.), which are likely to pose future problems in terms of development, and try to make inroads at the executive levels of natural gas departments in oil corporations. Also, in the area of long-term projects lacking adequate structures such as in Turkmenistan, the agency is planning to have the oil corporations themselves develop master plans and do the necessary feasibility studies by conducting research surveys on natural gas development and business conditions. Meanwhile, a study will also be done on receiving and distribution systems for natural gas in Japan. Specifically, it is considering the idea of relieving some of the growing congestion on the Pacific coast by building a base for unloading natural gas on the Japan Sea coast. MITI is also thinking about using offgas fields on the Japan Sea coast as underground storage bases to deal with peak periods and energy security needs. In addition to these activities, the agency also plans to conduct a feasibility study on a domestic LPG supply system (medium-range project) that would be built around a pipeline laid between a supply base on the Japan Sea coast and demand bases in the Tokai and Kanto areas. It also plans to introduce new policies to promote economic cooperation on energy with other Asian-Pacific countries.
