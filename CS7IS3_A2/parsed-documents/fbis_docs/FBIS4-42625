FBIS4-42625 "drweu109_h_94004" FBIS-WEU-94-109 Daily Report 6 Jun 1994 GERMANY Bonn Refuses To Report Missiles to UN Register Bonn Refuses To Report Missiles to UN Register AU0606162594 Hamburg DER SPIEGEL in German 6 Jun 94 p 17 AU0606162594 Hamburg DER SPIEGEL German BFN [Unattributed report: "Bonn Secrets"] [Text] The FRG Government refuses to report the number of German missiles to the arms register of the United Nations. The latest report contains information on the purchase of 30 "Mars" rocket launchers and the 6,180 missiles belonging to them (with a range of 38 km) that were procured by the Bundeswehr last year. But the total number of systems and missiles of this series and other types is missing. However, the United States and Great Britain do not shrink from listing their considerable arsenals (120,331 and 32,853 units respectively). The Mars systems, which are jointly produced with Germany, are also contained. In contrast to 1992, Bonn also did not report 40 guided AA-10 missiles from GDR [German Democratic Republic] arsenals this time. The Defense Ministry supports the mystery-mongering with the statement that "this data must not be conveyed to the United Nations because a relevant secrecy agreement does not exist." The arms register, for whose establishment the FRG also pressed in 1991, is to provide a survey of international arms arsenals and arms exports.
