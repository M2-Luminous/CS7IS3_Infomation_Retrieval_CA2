At the end of the workers assembly just before noon, an act on the decision made in the assembly was signed by the local UOM secretary general, Marcelo Sosa; Pedro Waisman, head of the Tierra del Fuego Industrial Union; and a Labor Ministry representative. The act was signed during a meeting held by representatives of all the parties involved, in the this capital's Albatros Hotel. During the assembly in this city's Augusto Lacerre Sports Center, which was headed by Marcelo Sosa in the presence of about 500 union members, the workers accepted all the points of the agreement announced in Buenos Aires on 3 June. It was learned, however, that about 30 percent of the union members disagreed with the agreement establishing a gradual increase of 300 percent in one year -- which triples the basic salary of the national agreement in the household goods metal sector -- on a variable scale starting at 120 percent and increasing 20 percent per month, reaching 310 percent in one year. [figures as received] The agreement's approval by the majority of the metalworkers put an end to 18 days of conflict including picket lines and threats of repression by Tierra del Fuego police. At the assembly's end, Sosa said that "the workers decided to obey the agreement" reached in Buenos Aires on 3 June. Sosa accused businessmen by saying "we ran into an intransigent position by businessmen." Sosa confirmed, however, that a new round of negotiations between workers and businessmen for the payment of the days not worked [salarios caidos] will begin in this city on 6 June, and that the talks will be held with each company. The businessmen agreed to rehire the 127 workers dismissed from the Continental factory and the 63 dismissed from the Crown Mustang plant, which is located in Rio Grande, about 200 km from this capital. The only unresolved point is the 15 days not worked, but it was learned here that an agreement probably will be reached to pay the days not worked during the conflict, but businessmen would demand that the workers compensate for the days not worked.
