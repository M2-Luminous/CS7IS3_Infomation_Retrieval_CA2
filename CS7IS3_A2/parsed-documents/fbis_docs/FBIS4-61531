The president stated in his interview with Lithuanian radio that the operativeness of their work is beneath criticism. Many prosecutors' offices and courts do not observe legal norms under which preliminary investigations must be completed within two months and cases investigated within 25 days. Everything is delayed for months and even years. This causes the justified indignation of society and government institutions. Algirdas Brazauskas said that he was also upset by this. During the entire period of investigation, the accused are kept in overcrowded cells with unsanitary conditions. People are simply neglected there. The president stressed that it would be very difficult to administer justice in this way. "I am not speaking about the investigation of cases, which is an exceptional prerogative of the court, and no one has the right to interfere with its work. However, the observance of deadlines and the quality of preliminary investigations is the common concern of us all," said Algirdas Brazauskas. The president particularly focused on those cases, which are being investigated by the Prosecutor General's Office and the Supreme Court. The criminal case in which Makutinovich and Sklyar, members of the Vilnius OMON [special Soviet militia units], are accused of crimes against the state, has been sitting in the Supreme Court since September 1993, while they had to be sued within 10 days. It has been already a year and the criminal case of violations in printing the litas has not received any legal assessment. This notorious case, which puts high-ranking government officials on trial, was suspended by the Supreme Court on 1 February. The latter authorized the Prosecutor General's Office to provide new evidence within a month. However, no additional material was obtained. The president said that he would demand an explanation from both institutions.
