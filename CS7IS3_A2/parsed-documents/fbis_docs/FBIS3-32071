Camacho read a communique to the media which stated that free access will be allowed to two "buffer zones" in Ocosingo and Las Margaritas "as long as weapons are not carried." San Miguel and Guadalupe Tepeyac are villages located far from San Cristobal and to which the Army has never had access during the conflict because of local guerrilla resistance. Camacho also said that armed members of the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN), which began a military uprising in southern Mexico on 1 January, should not be present in the area, either. Camacho, who announced a series of actions in support of the "life and dignity" of the people in Chiapas, did not talk about the possibility of a dialogue with the rebels, which remains at a standstill. The communique read by Camacho and addressed to the EZLN General Command said "these will be the first two buffer zones" to be established in the state, and he added that "the Mexican Army from its positions will offer facilities for the movement of residents, supplies, and medicines to each one of these villages." "The Mexican Army has already left all areas where it had a presence in Chiapas State," said Camacho in his message to the guerrillas. He said that "traffic will be allowed through the access routes" to the buffer zone towns "as long as no weapons are carried." He added that the perimeters proposed for these places "must be respected." "In these areas there must be no armed presence of the EZLN," stated the commissioner, and added that the Mexican Red Cross will provide in both towns "humanitarian health services and will assist with supplies." Camacho added that "everyone will receive health care," but "only the civilian population" will receive supplies. Camacho said the services provided at the two places will consist of health brigades to fight malaria and cholera, to provide universal vaccinations and first aid, and to support the transportation of patients to hospitals in Chiapas State or in other places in the country in the cases that may so require. Regarding the supplies, the commissioner announced that warehouse and distribution centers for supplying the civilian population will be "gradually" installed and that humanitarian organizations may support the effort in coordination with the Red Cross. He added that the effort "will have full public and private support." "With these actions, we all support the life and dignity of individuals over all forceful actions and military presence," the commissioner stressed.
