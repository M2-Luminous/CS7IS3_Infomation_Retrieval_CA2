He defended the government's decision to ban two Chinese scholars--Liu Binyan and Ruan Ming--from attending June 4 commemorative activities in Hong Kong. Mr Patten said people should not be allowed to use the territory to criticize what is happening elsewhere at "sensitive moments." His comments implied that the government would consider a further ban on Chinese dissidents during other politically sensitive periods. "I think there is a difference between the freedoms that we all exercise here and at sensitive moments," he said on his return from Britain. "There are just some moments--you know it as well--which are more sensitive than others." The two outspoken Chinese dissidents, who are now in the United States, were reportedly denied visas by the British Consulate in New York upon the Hong Kong Government's instruction. Mr Patten also rejected comments by Chinese officials who attacked the government for allowing exiled labour activist Han Dongfang to stay in the territory. "It's a problem they have created, not us," Mr Patten said. Mr Han was refused entry into China when attempting to return home last year.
