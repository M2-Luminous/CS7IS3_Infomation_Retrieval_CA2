FR940722-2-00040 FR940722-2-00024 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission [Project Nos. 1417&hyph;001, 1835&hyph;013] Central Nebraska Public Power and Irrigation District Nebraska Public Power District; Notice Extending Time to Comment on Revised Draft Environmental Impact Statement July 18, 1994. On April 1, 1994, the Commission issued a revised draft environmental impact statement (RDEIS) on applications for relicensing the Kingsley Dam Project No. 1417 and the North Plate/Keystone Diversion Dam No. 1835. These two hydropower projects are located on the North Platte, South Platte, and Platte Rivers in Nebraska. Comments on the RDEIS are currently due on July 25, 1994. Several parties have filed motions requesting or supporting an extension of time to comment on the RDEIS. Interior seeks an extension until August 12, 1994, to submit comments on the RDEIS that will incorporate pulse flow recommendations to be included in its revised recommendations under Section 10(j) of the Federal Power Act. EPA requests a conference on water quality issues pursuant to its EIS review authority, and seeks a further extension of the comment period on the RDEIS to September 8, 1994, to permit the conference to be held. Interior states that the pulse flow recommendations are its highest priority and, together with its other Section 10(j) recommendations, will form the basis for formal consultation with the Commission under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act. In view of the potential significance of Interior's recommendations in these proceedings, the extension is reasonable and will be granted. 1 1 Because all parties will benefit from a prompt ruling and it appears that no prejudice will result, this notice is being issued in advance of the usual 15-day period for answers to Interior's motion. See 18 CFR ยง385.213(d). After reviewing the parties' comments on the RDEIS and Interior's revised Section 10(j) recommendations, the Commission staff will determine how Interior's revised recommendations should be incorporated into the EIS process and will provide an additional opportunity for comment, if appropriate. EPA states that a conference is needed to assist the parties in evaluating the RDEIS and to discuss issues related to water quality, such as minimum flows to meet water quality temperature standards and the Commission's role under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act. However, by letter dated July 12, 1994, Governor Nelson of Nebraska questioned the need for a conference and informed the Commission that the State has no plans to change or reconsider its Section 401 certifications for these projects. In view of the general nature of EPA's request, the advanced stage of these proceedings, and the information presented in Governor Nelson's letter, the Commission staff has determined that there is no need for a conference on water quality issues as part of the EIS process. The comment period on the RDEIS is extended to August 12, 1994. Anyone wishing to comment in writing on the RDEIS must do so by that date. Comments must be filed with the Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426. Comments should clearly reference the Kingsley Dam Project No. 1417 and the North Platte/Keystone Diversion Dam Project No. 1835 on the first page.
