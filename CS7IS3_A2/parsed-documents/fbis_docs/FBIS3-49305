It does not really matter whether this happens jointly or on an individual basis. This is what Czech Deputy Defense Minister Jiri Pospisil said shortly after his arrival by air from Warsaw. He also explained to the Visegrad defense ministers in the Polish capital that our side regards the "Partnership for Peace" plan as the maximum of what NATO is able to grant to us at the present time. It is also regarded as a minimum designed to ensure that security requirements are met. The sides that attended the Warsaw meeting expressed their unequivocal consent with Partnership for Peace. However, Deputy Minister Pospisil admitted that there are differences as regards the considerations regarding the possible coordination of a joint approach to NATO. While Poland and Slovakia favor this option, Hungary's stance appears to be closer to the Czech stance. Polish President Walesa, who met the ministers, pointed out that, first and foremost, it should be the Czech Republic that should make use of the historical opportunity of joining NATO. If it does not do so, Poland will reportedly look for new partners. But I do not know which countries he meant, Jiri Pospisil said.
