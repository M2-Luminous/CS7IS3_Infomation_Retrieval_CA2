The first recipe is known as unorthodox stabilization and the second as the orthodox policy of the IMF. If demand alone is restricted, the economy's unemployment rate rises and investments which support agricultural production levels and small manufacturers are reduced. On the other hand, if prices and salaries are frozen -- in keeping with the unorthodox plan -- and demand is not controlled, inflation will quickly increase as occurred during the Cruzado Plan (in Brazil), which aimed at zero inflation in 1986. The decision was made not to devalue the currency because the exchange rate was considered real and there was a trade surplus. This trend continued through 1986 before the Cruzado Plan was implemented. During the first few weeks of the program, businesses became more efficient, chose their products well, and increased productivity, but the tenets of the plan did not prove true: the trade surplus did not continue and the balanced budget that was relied upon was abandoned; salary increases returned, and the loss of competitiveness because of a fixed exchange rate halted investment growth. In Argentina, the Austral Plan was the answer to a prolonged period of high inflation rates due to uncontrolled government spending. This plan consisted in a freeze on prices, public spending, and salaries, that is, the unorthodox plan. Its failure was due to the unfreezing of prices that must be implemented during periods of economic recession and when the fiscal deficit has been reduced; otherwise inflationary pressures will be triggered again due to government spending and the upsetting of relative prices. Argentine President Carlos Menem's current plan, based on the orthodox plan of controlling demand, has been successful thus far because of the income received from the substantial privatization of government-owned businesses. The fixed exchange rate, in line with the U.S. dollar, has supplied the consumer market with imported goods but has not resulted in a parallel flow of exports. The Menem plan has been partially implemented in the Mexican experience. This plan is known as the Stability, Competitiveness and Employment Pact (PECE), and its emphasis is on reducing transfers abroad that occur because of an overvalued exchange rate and reduced government spending. During the first phase the restrictive credit policy was used to complement budget adjustments and the currency exchange policy. Like in the Menem plan, privatization has contributed to fiscal resources without inflationary pressures. The relative success of these orthodox anti-inflationary strategies in Argentina and Mexico are due to the fact that they were implemented during a period of relative stagnation, during which unemployment has played an important role as a deflationary mechanism. The Colombian experience with the orthodox strategy implemented by Finance Minister Rudolf Hommes has not had the same success because of the inert components of the generalized system of adjusting interest and salary rates. Simultaneously, uncontrolled spending on public security has been inevitable due to the high level of violence in Colombia which, according to the National Department of Planning, has reached a world-record 77 murders per 100,000 residents, followed by Brazil, in a distant second place with 24 murders per 100,000 residents. The exchange rate as an instrument for making the economy competitive on real international levels does not work if we do not keep salary trends in mind. This happened to the Chilean economy in the 1980's, with a reulsting high social cost. According to Rudiger Dornbush, in the preface to his book "Fighting Inflation" (Editorial Grijalbo 1993), the combination of orthodox and unorthodox plans requires conviction and a minimum sustained effort so that after brief moderate successes the inflationary spiral will not be recur. If not, the current decade's illusion of monetary stability will mirror the frustration of the previous decade.
