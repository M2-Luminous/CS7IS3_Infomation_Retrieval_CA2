The Hungarian side sees long-term possibilities in the cooperation of the Visegrad group. Among other things, these were the subjects in Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky's interview for NEPSZABADSAG. [Kis] A real war of statements was waged in Central Europe in the days and weeks preceding the summit in Brussels and Prague; a lot of attacks were also directed at the program of Partnership for Peace. It seems that the Hungarian politics tried to distance itself from this heated campaign. What was the reason for this restraint? [Jeszenszky] Partly, perhaps, our being well informed. For us, the program of Partnership for Peace has never seemed alarming. From the very beginning, we saw something positive in this concept. We saw the great step forward this represents, even compared with the NATO position of six months ago. In the past year, I often met with NATO leaders and the foreign ministers or other political leaders of NATO members under formal or less-formal circumstances. Therefore, I had the opportunity to see this evolution. In addition, it is also well known that Hungary has good relations with the current leadership in Russia. As a historian, I am also aware of the huge responsibility of the U.S. leaders, and of the great stakes involved. Today it is really imaginable that, as a result of the changes of 1989-1990, a change could take place in the division of Europe and a dividing line move further to the East than previously, not only the welfare line, but also the political line. However, this would be the worse alternative compared to the creation of a more uniform European thinking. All the more so because, for us, the relations with Russia and Ukraine are extremely important both politically and economically. Taking all this into consideration, the peace partnership is a big stake. This idea provides a rather progressive program, and if we succeed in implementing this, mankind will gain much more than just security guarantees for a few Central European countries that will make the democratic process irreversible, and this is very important for us. In other words, this is a program that provides both short-term and long-term promising prospects. This is why Hungary did not show disappointment and refrained from using a demanding tone. Besides, I have repeatedly spoken abroad in recent weeks, so the Hungarian position is well known there. In addition, what we heard in recent days was even more reassuring; the U.S. leadership cannot be accused of any kind of naivete; nor can it be accused of not being aware of the possible dangers and failing to prepare for worse scenarios as well. [Kis] To what extent does this program fulfill the previous Hungarian expectations? [Jeszenszky] This fulfills the expectations of the Hungarian Government, and we see a serious development in the NATO position. A lot is said about differentiation. They often mention a process of self-selection in connection with the countries involved, and this is an advantage for us in any case. This approach represents a faster road toward full membership or toward very close cooperation for countries that are ready for this both militarily and politically, countries where democracy is stable and political control over the Army is obvious. The quality of cooperation will count, and political compatibility is as important as the military compatibility of the countries involved. [Kis] From the Hungarian viewpoint, which part of the program is the most essential? [Jeszenszky] I would stress the fact that the informal confidence that has developed in the last three and a half years is now becoming formal through this program, because there will be a Hungarian representative in the NATO in the framework of this Partnership for Peace. There will also be a Hungarian officer at NATO military headquarters, and the daily contacts that will emerge as a result will make us even more a partner in the eyes of the Western public and the Western political leaders. The warning that emerged during the last talks is important: A security guarantee voiced as a political intention is not sufficient, because the NATO statute makes it a matter of sovereign decisions of the member states how they act in case of a conflict; of course, there is an obligation of common defense but, within this, individual governments have considerable freedom of decision. [Kis] The debate on the Partnership for Peace made a real test of the Visegrad cooperation. In your opinion, to what extent is the Visegrad Group in a crisis? [Jeszenszky] The Visegrad cooperation is not threatened by the Partnership for Peace. This program does not mean any kind of conflict. It is a secondary issue whether we coordinate our positions on the program, we make common statements, or issue separate statements. There has been no basic difference between the Visegrad countries regarding their relations with NATO. However, if we speak about the Visegrad group in a wider sense, my opinion is that, no matter what others say, this cooperation does not depend on the intention of some political leaders, although the role of our late prime minister was considerable. Actually, the Visegrad cooperation lies on history, geography, and the common difficult experiences of our recent history, as well as on our common goals and current situation. In this respect, these three or four countries are close to each other. Given the fact that this cooperation lies on facts and not on political intentions, I am optimistic in the long run too. I am convinced that the Visegrad cooperation -- Central Europe in a wider sense -- creates a unity that will continue to preserve a lot of its culture and bilateral relations in the future too. Actually, it was the Cold War that divided the original Central Europe and this Cold War brought iron curtains and dividing walls between individual countries. It is very difficult to dismantle the dividing walls between various societies. This explains the fact that there are occasional regressions in political relations and tones. However, in the final analysis, objective factors determine the common fate and cooperation of these countries. [Kis] In your opinion, when can Hungary's NATO membership become timely? According to what scenario can this membership become a reality? [Jeszenszky] Regarding the European Union, one can predict more or less realistically. In the case of the NATO, it is more difficult to predict, because many things could happen that might accelerate or slow down the process. However, in my opinion, the timing of formal membership is not the really essential thing. The essential thing is that Hungary should advance this process and fulfill the practical cooperation and political dialogue. In this respect, Hungary is already a NATO member in a certain sense. General Shalikashvili also stressed that they have the closest relations with the Hungarian Army in this region. Of course, we do not want to outdistance others or gain advantages at others' detriment, because Central Europe will actually live or fall together. However, we gladly accept the pioneering role that we have fulfilled in many respects so far. We have nothing against others if they can advance together with us. We can be quite satisfied with Hungary's relations with the West, including the United States and NATO, and both the personal and institutional relations have become very deep since I first stepped into NATO Headquarters in the summer of 1990. This is quite reassuring for us.
