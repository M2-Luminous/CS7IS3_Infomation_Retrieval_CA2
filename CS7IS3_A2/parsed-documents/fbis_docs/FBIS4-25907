Speaking at a dinner in his honor, he said both nations should prepare for overall bilateral relations, which should include friendship, mutual understanding, trade and personnel exchange. On the vital nuclear issue on the peninsula, he noted that unfortunately this problem has caused great misunderstanding between the two nations, and expressed the hope that the dispute can be solved through joint efforts. As soon as a solution to this issue is found, other problems can also be solved, he said. Carter added that he and the U.S. leaders are confident that a peaceful unification of the Korean peninsula can be achieved. Kim Yong-nam, vice premier and foreign minister of the DPRK, said that it is the common desire of both nations and their people that bilateral relations will be normalized one day. Kim pointed out that if the U.S. respects the DPRK's sovereignty and treats it justly, a perfect solution to the nuclear issue will certainly be found. This solution will be conducive to peace in Asia and throughout the world as well, he added. Carter passed through the truce village of Panmunjon and arrived here Wednesday morning on a four-day private visit to the DPRK for possible mediation of the dispute over Pyongyang's suspected nuclear weapons program. He is expected to meet with the DPRK's leader Kim Il-song. Carter met with South Korean President Kim Yong-sam and Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu before arriving here.
