FR941107-1-00049 FR941107-1-00010 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 49 CFR Part 580 [Docket No. 92&hyph;20; Notice 4] Petition for Approval of Alternate Odometer Disclosure Requirements AGENCY: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Department of Transportation. ACTION: Notice of Final Denial. SUMMARY: The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) denies the petition submitted by the State of Florida for approval of alternate odometer disclosure requirements. Only one comment was submitted in response to NHTSA's preliminary determination that Florida's proposed procedures threaten the integrity of the current disclosure system. The agency reaffirms that determination, and Florida must conform its procedures to the odometer disclosure requirements of 49 CFR Part 580. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John Donaldson, Office of the Chief Counsel, Room 5219, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, D.C., 20590 (202) 366&hyph;1834. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background To address the problem of odometer fraud, 49 U.S.C. Chapter 327 (previously 15 U.S.C. 1981 et seq .) (the Act) provides that each person transferring ownership of a motor vehicle must disclose the mileage on the vehicle's title. The Act requires the States to conform their procedures to ensure that the titles they issue contain odometer disclosure statements. Section 32705(d) of the Act directs NHTSA to approve alternate methods of odometer disclosure submitted by a State, provided that those methods are consistent with the purposes of the disclosure required by the Act. NHTSA's implementing regulation, 49 CFR Part 580, identifies specific elements to be included in the odometer disclosure statement (49 CFR 580.5 and 580.7). The elements of central importance to the instant petition are the name and current address of both the transferor and the transferee. The regulation also sets forth procedures a petitioning State must follow to seek approval of alternate requirements to those otherwise required of the State (49 CFR 580.11). In accordance with this latter provision, the State of Florida submitted a petition for approval of alternate disclosure requirements. Basis for the Petition Florida seeks approval for alternative procedures to those contained in 49 U.S.C. 32705(b) (previously 15 U.S.C. 1988(d)) and 49 CFR 580.5 (c)(3) and (c)(4). (The petition identifies paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of the regulation, but it is clear from its context that paragraphs (c)(3) and (c)(4) were intended.) These provisions require odometer disclosure statements to be made on a title produced by means of a secure printing process and to include the name and current address of the transferor and transferee. Florida currently uses two motor vehicle title forms, copies of which were submitted with the petition. In all aspects of relevance here, the forms are identical. Both forms contain one block for transfer of title by the seller on the front and three blocks for dealer reassignment and one block for application for title on the back. Florida states that the transfer of title and the dealer reassignment blocks appear as prescribed by 49 CFR 580.5, except that they do not contain a space for the address of the transferor and transferee. Notwithstanding the absence of address spaces in these locations, Florida asserts that its titles comply with the Federal requirements in all cases except those involving reassignment by a licensed motor vehicle dealer. Florida explains that State law (Florida Statutes, Chapter 319) precludes the assignment of a motor vehicle title by anyone other than the person in whose name the title was issued, unless the person is a dealer. Consequently, in a sale between non-dealers, Florida points out that the required addresses will be available because the transferor's address appears on the front of the title and the transferee's address will eventually appear in the block for ``Application for Title by Purchaser.'' Citing NHTSA's determination (53 FR No. 151 at 29470, Aug. 5, 1988) that information located elsewhere on the title need not be repeated in the disclosure statement, Florida argues that its titles comply with Federal requirements related to transfers between non-dealers. The alternate procedures for which Florida seeks approval apply to transfers by or between licensed dealers. Florida acknowledges that its titles do not make accommodation for the address of a dealer. Instead, the dealer is required to include its license number in the reassignment block appearing on the back of the title, when effecting a subsequent transfer. According to Florida, the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (DHS) maintains records of all licensed dealers in the State, indexed by both license number and name, from which current address information is freely available upon request. Florida asserts that this system is superior to the requirement of NHTSA's regulation, because the State records contain the latest available address information, and because consumers can be informed by the DHS of avenues of relief through the State's consumer complaint process and its $25,000 dealer license bond. Accordingly, Florida concludes that the odometer disclosure procedures it imposes on dealers are fully consistent with the purposes behind the Federal odometer disclosure requirements, and that its petition should therefore be granted.
