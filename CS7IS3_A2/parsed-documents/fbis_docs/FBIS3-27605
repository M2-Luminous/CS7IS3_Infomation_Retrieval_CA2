Comrade Jia Qinglin said: Last year, expressway builders worked day and night for Fujian's expressway projects. The provincial party committee, provincial government, and people throughout the province are thankful to them. We must build highways if we want to live a happy life. Since the deepening of reform, more and more people have understood the importance of building expressways and have acknowledged your achievements. Owing to speedy economic development in the province, however, Fujian's transportation facilities have become incompatible with economic construction. Therefore the people throughout the province urgently feel the need to have expressways built. In this situation, you have a heavier burden to undertake and a more glorious task to fulfill. We should seize the opportunity and do a good job in expressway construction. [words indistinct]
