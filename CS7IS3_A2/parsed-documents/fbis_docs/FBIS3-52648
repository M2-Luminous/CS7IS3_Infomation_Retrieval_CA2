We are going to Jordan because clearing the air is good. We view our brothers in Jordan as one people and one country, and our interests are common and interlinked. It is therefore impermissible for vital differences to exist between us. As for the issues of economy and agreements, we believe that first, we must be on our territory so that we might reach an agreement. We have concluded no agreements over the past year or two because our land is occupied. This land must first return to its owners so that we can build establishments and have our own economy that can cooperate with other economies. [Al-Damardash] 'Amr Musa said he expects the negotiations to resume soon. Can you tell us on what he bases his expectation and if there is any sign of such a thing? [Qaddumi] Our acceptance of the Madrid conference means we accepted the resumption of negotiations. These negotiations have gone on for 22 months and we are still negotiating. There is no alternative but negotiations, because international changes dictate that all parties resort to negotiations for the sake of a comprehensive solution.
