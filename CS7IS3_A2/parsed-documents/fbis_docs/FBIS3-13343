He also called on the Arabs to set up an Arab Free Trade Area (AFTA) similar to the U.S.-Canadian-Mexican one (NAFTA), the other economic blocs (GATT), and the Asian bloc. He stressed that peace is not a gift or a present given by Israel to the Arabs, but rather the opposite, adding that the Arab boycott of Israel will continue as long as the latter continues to occupy Arab territories. He noted that the Palestinian-Israeli agreement has given more hope than contained in its clauses. These remarks were made during Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid's dialogue at a seminar held by the al-Jizah Rotary Club with businessmen and intellectuals who are Rotarians. In a reply to a question, the Arab League secretary general said: What we should focus on now is the global economic struggle going on around us. Globalism might be a source of hope for some, but it is a source of anxiety for others. Today's world is one of major economic blocs or groupings in which there is no place for individual countries. Our Arab world cannot live on the margin. [passage omitted] In reply to another question, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said: The application of the GATT agreement's clauses will result in the liberalization of international trade in many commodities and services; it will lead to the elimination of subsidies for agricultural exports and for farmers and the elimination of the textiles agreement so that it will become part of GATT in 10 years. This is in addition to all the other GATT clauses. Responding to another question, the Arab League secretary general said: It is evident from the above that Arab agricultural products will suffer too much due to the high cost of Arab agricultural production when compared with imports from countries that enjoy a very high level of economic efficiency, particularly as the Arab countries import more than 60 percent of their food requirements. This is bound to affect the Arab countries' exports due to the factors of quality and competition. It is also bound to subject the Arab markets to an intensive invasion by competing products, especially when conditions for preventing commodity subsidies are imposed. The same will apply to the services trade and government purchases sectors. In return, the Arab countries will benefit from the liberalization of the building equipment, agricultural machinery, and medical equipment trade. If we look at the list of countries that will annually benefit from GATT, we will notice that the European Union [EU] will be the first beneficiary, followed by North America, China, the Asian countries, and Japan. The last group to benefit from GATT will be the Gulf countries (their share of international trade will be $3.1 billion compared to the $80.7 billion that the EU will attain). Thus, this agreement imposes on us as many challenges as benefits. This requires us to start preparing for it starting right now throughout the years of grace, some lasting up to 10 years, allowed by GATT to the developing countries so that they can reorganize their economic infrastructures in line with the requirements of the new phase of global economy. Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid went on to say: I personally heard about the so-called Middle East market in 1988 from a senior Israeli official, who added to it a new Marshall plan for the Middle East where Israel would be one of the principal links. The call for this market intensified following the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles on 13 September 1993. The region is being prepared for the post-peace-talks era and the envisioned future; and the future relations between its countries are being prepared for. We are facing a new epoch in the history of the region that requires a radical and comprehensive change in line with efforts for achieving a comprehensive and just settlement for the Arab-Israeli conflict. In this context, Israel is aiming to establish the so-called Middle East market and this makes us ask: Where do we stand in all this? How do we prepare for dealing with it? Israel's objectives depend on Arab acceptance, because Israel cannot impose its objectives on the Arab world regardless of the form this market takes. If such a market is set up, our dealings with it will proceed from certain facts, which I summarize as the following: -- The Arabs are a huge force with a variety of resources and potentials. They are widespread and have many markets--something that guarantees their ability to set up a huge economic grouping capable of securing the unity of the Arab region and preserving its identity, apart from its ability to affect things rather than be affected. -- There is nothing that frightens this huge force, because Israel is no more than a small area restricted by limited resources in the midst of a vast Arab ocean that has great potentials and resources. Israel will not have any distinctive economic advantage, but one can deal with it in accordance with specific standards and measures, which each Arab country will set according to its own national interests and within the framework of its full sovereignty over its territory and national resources. -- The Arabs need to formulate a comprehensive strategic concept specifying higher Arab interests and a united Arab stand regarding the challenges of peace, regional cooperation, and its limits. -- Efforts toward Arab reconciliation should continue preparing to mobilize Arab integration efforts. The latter will be turned into a pillar of Arab potential when confronting the coming challenges. Answering a question, the secretary general said that the Palestinian-Israeli declaration of principles provided great hope, much greater than what was actually written into the text. (We do not have time to discuss this agreement or analyze its articles). But evidence shows that the road to the expected peace gave Israel the impression and feeling that the Arab world's market, which contains over 150 million consumers, could compensate for what it might have to relinquish regionally or diplomatically. The greatest compensation for the shattering of Israel's dream of becoming Greater Israel from the Nile to the Euphrates has been the alternative dream of becoming the economic superpower that can invade the Arab markets as it pleases. It believes that it has an economic advantage that enables it to invade Arab markets, since the net domestic product per capita in Israel is seven times greater than that on the West Bank and 14 times that in the Gaza Strip. The net national product per capita in Israel amounts to nearly $11,000, whereas in the West Bank it amounts to $2,000 and in the Gaza Strip, $1,300. Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said: This is the way Israel looks at the other Arab countries when contemplating the peace. I believe it is useful to keep in mind on this occasion that peace with Egypt did not allow Israel to enter the Arab world. This was because Egypt was greatly concerned about not establishing relations with Israel at the expense of its relations with the Arab world. This leads me reiterate my earlier statement that peace is not a gift or present from Israel to the Arabs. In fact, the contrary is true; Israel is the one that desperately needs peace and cooperation, which will not be realized except through its comprehensive and full withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories. Answering a question, the secretary general affirmed that the Israeli boycott will continue as long as Israel occupies any part of Arab territory. He added that the peace process, which the Arab League supports in accordance with international resolutions, still has many obstacles and difficulties to overcome, and this is only to be expected. However, insistence on attaining the objective and preserving cohesion are two basic issues for realizing the desired goals. The secretary general called on the Arabs to seriously consider establishing an Arab Free Trade Area (AFTA), along the lines of NAFTA and the rest of the big economic groupings. He said: I believe that the time periods provided by the GATT treaty allow us to set up this area with the objective of determining the best ways to market our Arab products in view of the international competition that is characteristic of the 21st century.
