The number of persons under observation at the Sour El-Ghozlane hospital reportedly has reached 68, a majority of whom are adolescents. "Those infected were immediately put in isolation," say top local health officials, adding that "the prognosis for these patients is good." The health director and the head of the daira of Sour El-Ghozlane noted in that regard that "the appearance of this waterborne epidemic may be due to problems in the city's water treatment system." Other sources point to the decrepit condition of pipes carrying waste water, which might have seeped into potable water conduits.
