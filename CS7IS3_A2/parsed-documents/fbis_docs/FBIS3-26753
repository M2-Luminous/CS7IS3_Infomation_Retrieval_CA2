Government at all levels must take the "vegetable basket" and "rice sack" seriously. No matter how heavy their workload is, they must place the "vegetable basket" and "rice sack" high on their agenda. They must devote major efforts -- and display great resolution -- to carrying out this major task that has a direct bearing on people's lives and economic development as a whole. This is the demand set by Chen Huanyou, secretary of the provincial Party Committee and governor, at the provincial conference on the "vegetable basket," grain, and edible oil that was held yesterday. Comrade Chen Huanyou said: The overall situation in our province is excellent insofar as the "vegetable basket" and "rice sack" are concerned. In recent years, Jiangsu's grain output has stabilized at around 32 billion kg; production of nonstaple foodstuffs has also increased. Last year, output of hogs and aquatic products reached new highs; production of poultry, eggs, and fruit is on the rise, and acreage for vegetables -- output as well -- expanded significantly in rural areas. Therefore, we have a solid base and there should be no shortages. Why then did prices rise sharply a short while ago? The reasons are as follows: 1) Prices of farm products were too low to begin with, so prices naturally rose once controls were lifted. 2) The effect of natural disasters. The freezing cold last November did considerable damage to vegetables. 3) An excessive amount of vegetable plots in the outskirts have been diverted to other purposes in recent years. In some localities, those plots have not been promptly replaced. 4) Inefficient administration. It is still not easy for peasants to sell their produce in cities, and a handful of unlawful businessmen were cornering the market and cheating the customers. 5) Regulatory mechanisms were not functioning well. After grain prices rose abnormally, no immediate action was taken to bring prices down by selling large quantities of grain. Therefore, we must have a high sense of political responsibility and pay great attention to solving the problems related to the "vegetable basket." Only then will we be able to maintain social tranquility and stability and create a good external environment for reform and economic development. [passage omitted] Ji Yunshi, member of the Standing Committee of the provincial Party Committee and deputy governor, and Jiang Yongron, deputy governor, were present at the meeting. Jiang Yongrong gave a report outlining specific arrangements with regard to "vegetable basket" work.
