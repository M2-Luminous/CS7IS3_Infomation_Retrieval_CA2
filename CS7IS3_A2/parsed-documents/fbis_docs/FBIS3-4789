In fact, some think that the presence of that organization in their company is a thorn in their side, a BISNIS source reported here. One businessman said that his company rejected an SPSI PUK (Shop Steward) even though two years ago he stated before the MUSPIDA [Congress of Provincial Heads] that he would help form that labor organization. "The important thing is that we have fulfilled all our obligations and that we have complied with all labor regulations in a proper way," said that businessman, who asked that his name not be mentioned. According to the latest figures from the South Kalimantan Department of Manpower only 81 of 462 companies in that province have allowed their workers to join that labor organization. "We have repeatedly told them how important it is to have a PUK from the SPSI in a company, but the companies just pay no attention to that suggestion," said one official of the agency. Syakhrian Sulaiman, Deputy Chairman of the DPD (Provincial Executive Board) of the SPSI verified those statements and expressed his regrets that the business community in this province still does not regard the SPSI as a business partner but rather as a 'bogey-man'. He said that for no obvious reason 28 large companies have disallowed SPSI PUKs in their companies. In addition, there are also about 30 companies which are not registered with SPSI's DPD. Not having an SPSI PUK in a company can invite labor disputes to surface in the form of strikes or demonstrations which are damaging to both parties. "If there is an SPSI PUK in the company, at the very least the problem can be overcome or it might never occur," affirmed South Kalimantan's SPSI Deputy Chairman. He said that Law Number 21 of 1954 is not going as well as expected due to the absence of a labor organization in a company. A KKB (Joint Labor Agreement) between employers and employees is there to prevent possible disputes from arising. "That's why HIPs (PANCASILA [Five Principles of the Nation] Industrial Relations), such as those proposed by the government, are not going as well as expected in companies which have no SPSI PUK," said Syakhrian. Based on figures taken from the Banjarmasin branch of Astek [Workmen's Insurance] Inc, there were 1,010 occupational accidents in 1993 and 951 in the previous year. BUMNs [State-Owned Corporations] under the Department of Manpower paid out 842 million rupiahs in compensation. The amounts of compensation were: 762 JKK (Occupational Accident Insurance) cases; 179 JHT (Old-age Insurance) cases; and 77 JK (Life Insurance) cases. The main cause of occupational accidents was negligence.
