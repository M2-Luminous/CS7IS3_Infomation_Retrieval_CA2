Gen. Sokolov visited Abkhazia earlier on the same mission and is reported to have spent the day before the meeting reconnoitering at the Inguri River, the place proposed for the deployment of the peacekeeping contingent to disengage the warring sides. According to unconfirmed information, about 3,000 servicemen can be ready to carry out this task within a few hours. In accordance with the Georgian-Abkhaz agreements previously reached under the aegis of the United Nations and with Russian mediation, the peacekeeping forces are also to ensure the security of the refugees returning to their previous places of residence. Various sources put their number at 250-300,000. Offical sources in Tbilisi are not reporting any details about the meeting between Eduard Shevardnadze and are not commenting on it. However, to judge from the way events are developing, the peacekeeping troops may be introduced into the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict zone in the very near future.
