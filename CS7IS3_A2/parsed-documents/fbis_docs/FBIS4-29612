Under the current system introduced in 1971 to cope with a glut of domestic rice supplies, every rice grower is forced to reduce rice paddies by the same percentage to curb the total volume of domestically produced rice. The policy, however, has been criticized for discouraging rice farmers who want to enhance production efficiency by expanding their rice fields to compete with less expensive foreign rice. Moreover, due to an unusually cool summer last year, the country suffered its worst rice shortage in the postwar period, prompting the government to urgently import foreign rice and setting off a panic among consumers searching for domestic grains. Under the new policy being considered by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, the government would set a target of reducing total rice acreage in each prefecture, with flexible consideration of each farmer's desire to produce rice, the sources said. The government would also provide subsidies to rice growers meeting the annual government-set target for curtailing rice paddies. The ministry will work out the details of the new system after the Agricultural Administration Council, an advisory body to the prime minister, submits an interim report on the future of Japanese agriculture in July, according to the sources.
