Following his misleading information and unfounded assessment of the "virtues" of the confidence-building measures, Butrus-Ghali stressed that several options can be considered for Cyprus. He said that the island can be abandoned to deal with its own problem, sanctions can be adopted, talks on the essence of the problem can be resumed, and the UN Security Council members can hold talks with the concerned sides. Butrus-Ghali noted after his so-called options that: "Considering the fact that the two sides have agreed in principle to the package of confidence-building measures, the international effort to reach an agreement can be resumed." Yes, that is the sentence that should be considered. Looking at the matter, an outsider may ask: "Since the hope that an agreement can be reached on the implementation of the package still exists, then why has the UN secretary general criticized the Turkish Cypriot side to such an extent in his report, particularly after Rauf Denktas made two important concessions at the last moment?" One of those concessions was the acceptance of the map on Maras [Varosha] and the other was the acceptance of the lifting of the Turkish Cypriot side's objection to that area's access road. The map undermined the agreement on the "fenced area" in Maras and supported the Greek Cypriot demand on "municipal boundaries." Consequently, it allowed the Greek Cypriot side to acquire an additional one and a half square km of valuable land. However, what is more important than the value of the land the Greek Cypriot side has acquired was the mistake that was made in the negotiating process. The Turkish Cypriot side has had to put up with UN officials' changing approaches. Butrus-Ghali initially commented on the access road as follows: "The Turkish Cypriot side must not worry about holding on to the northern part of Dhimokratias Avenue if it keeps the access road under its control. You may block the access road to paralyze Maras if necessary." That meant that the access road was a trump card. However, it has been given away in the Vienna talks. That was later confirmed in writing in Nicosia. The plan was to force the Turkish Cypriot side to make concessions by convincing it that the UN secretary general's report would accuse it of maintaining an intransigent approach. That created a wave of fear on the Turkish Cypriot side. The approach was successfully applied. However, it seems that there is more to the matter. That state of affairs will not end as long as the fear exists on the Turkish Cypriot side. A number of officials have expressed the view that "the Turkish Cypriot side was late in responding and the situation would have been different if Rauf Denktas had agreed earlier." That is meaningless. The Turkish Cypriot side would have been accused of maintaining an irreconcilable approach even if it had agreed to every demand in the hope that the promises that were reluctantly made to it in Vienna would be kept. Nothing can be achieved through expecting the UN officials to force the Greek Cypriot side to make concessions in return for those made by the Turkish Cypriot side. It is common knowledge that talks are resumed from the point at which they are broken off and that the concessions made remain in effect. Yes, that scenario has to end. Considering the point which has been reached in the Cyprus problem, the Turkish and Turkish Cypriot diplomats will make a very serious mistake if they agree to resuming the talks on the confidence-building measures. Considering the "injustice" that has been done, the Turkish Cypriot side should not attend the talks in which more injustice will be done. Instead, those who have acted in an unjust way must be forced to regret what they have done. For example, the Turkish Cypriot side can inform the world that it will no longer "wait" for the Greek Cypriot side to agree to a reconciliation and move to convert several buildings in Maras, which were used as hotels in the past, into boarding houses for the Eastern Mediterranean University students. Unfortunately, the new world order has given into unjust and tyrannical behavior. Christ said that "anyone who is slapped in the face should not retaliate but turn the other cheek." The Western countries have retained that teaching as a legend but have forced the other countries in the world to comply with it. Obviously, Turkish and Turkish Cypriot diplomacy will be exalted not through appreciative remarks by foreign countries but through reacting to an attack in a similar way.
