Traffic on the Oruro-La Paz road was maintained although the flow dropped considerably because bus drivers suspended services to safeguard their buses. In Caracollo, 37 km from Oruro, peasants and students were prevented from blocking the road toward the south. After being briefly blocked, a military presence now guarantees the free flow of traffic. Peasants blocked the Oruro-Cochabamba road, suspending all traffic. The traffic police have reported that the peasants broke the windshields of three buses and demanded money to let them pass. It has been announced that inter-department bus services will be totally normalized today. While there was military presence on the roads yesterday, the situation in the cities was totally calm, contrary to previous days when many demonstrations were held. Railway services are working normally but under military custody. Yesterday peasants had to lift their blockade in Banderani and Cona Cona stations on the Oruro-Cochabamba railway stretch due to the presence of military troops. The national railway service operations manager reported that services are being provided normally, although every train is guarded by military troops. Private school classes were suspended today for 24-hours as determined by the Private School Teachers Association in support for the urban teachers' demands.
