In selling off the country's state-owned enterprises to foreigners, Yu Xiaosong, vice minister of the State Economic and Trade Commission, said recently that limitation should be imposed in two areas. One is that asset evaluation must be conducted by a qualified evaluation organization before a state-owned enterprise is to transfer part or all of its equities to a foreign investor, which is a new form for China to attract foreign direct investments. Yu said such evaluation is necessary as there is not yet a fair and scientific method. The other aspect concerns whether or not one or a group of foreign investors is allowed to buy all stakes or a holding stake in a Chinese state-owned enterprise. And this depends on the status and function of the enterprise in China's national economy, yu added. Such takeovers are not proper for important large state-owned enterprises, a large power plant for instance, which will trigger such problems as electricity supply, charges and production capacity, Yu said. Yu said the Chinese partner's stake in a large state enterprise must be higher than 50 percent regardless of the number of shareholders in the enterprise.
