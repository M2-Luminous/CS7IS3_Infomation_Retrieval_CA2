The soundness of the cycle from basic research and technical development to the market has enabled machine translation, an achievement from research in high technology, to be quickly turned into products and has enabled the language information processing industry to take its initial shape in China. The products are marketed at home and abroad, earning profits of more than $5 million every year. According to a briefing, the machine translation system is one that uses a computer's understanding of the meaning of human languages and words to complete the process of changing one language into another for people. It is an integrated science that involves various branches of learning, including linguistics, computational linguistics, and computing technology, and it has been listed at the top of the world's 10 greatest high technologies in the 21st century by an authoritative international organization. Other countries have invested huge capital in its development. The competition in this field is very keen. Chen Zhaoxiong [7115 5128 7160], a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences [CAS], solved a series of technical problems and initiated a system for the theory on translation with the aid of an intelligent machine through his explorations in theoretical research and in an overall plan. As a result, he laid a foundation for converting the achievement from research into this high technology into products. In 1992, the CAS set up a special task force concerning the project of the application of an intelligent machine translation system. After two years' hard work, it completed the transition from the system for the theory on translation with the aid of an intelligent machine to an application system. The project was appraised by the State Science and Technology Commission as taking a leading place both at home and abroad. The rate of accuracy of its translation reached 83 percent, thus surpassing the maximum capability -- 70 percent -- of machine translation's accuracy which had long been held by international machine translation circles. The project won an award for scientific and technological advance, first degree, from the CAS for its achievement. To expedite the industrialization of the application system of intelligent machine translation by converting it into products as quickly as possible so as to gain investment returns from the market for input into new research and development and to enable a sound cycle to take shape, Chen Zhaoxiong set his goal on a pocket electronic translation machine. Though such a product had broad prospects for capturing the market both at home and abroad, it encountered two long-standing technical problems, namely, a low rate of translation accuracy and a long period for development. It took two years to complete a system for the crudest model of machine translation. Taking advantage of its abundant technical forces, the CAS concentrated its efforts on tackling the problems. In two months' time, it completed the development of the system, solved the two major technical problems of compressing the vast vocabulary into the space restricted by a pocket machine and turning out a real-time translation, and successfully developed the world's first intelligent machine translation product -- the Kuaiyitong [fast translation master] 863A pocket electronic translation machine -- thereby attaining the goal of translating English into Chinese through a machine. Such a new product is capable of displaying on the screen a Chinese sentence corresponding to its English sentence within a few seconds after the latter is entered onto the keyboard, complete with simultaneous pronunciations in English and Mandarin. Shortly after 10,000 Kuaiyitong units were marketed in Hong Kong, they were all sold. At present, the product enjoys sales of 1,000 units a day on the international market. The big economic returns produced from quickly turning an achievement from high technology theory into products attracted businessmen from both at home and abroad; one after another, they requested a joint venture and cooperation. The Institute of Computing Technology of the CAS set up the Kezhi Company in a timely manner to conduct joint-venture development with foreign businessmen. It earned $4.44 million for the state from the technical licensing of the pocket intelligent English-Chinese translation system alone. To date, it is the project that has earned the highest amount of foreign exchange for China from the transfer of rights to use a type of software. So far, the Kezhi Company has also developed an intelligent Chinese- English machine translation system. It has also successively started the research and development of Russian-Chinese and German-Chinese machine translation systems, a combination system for phonetic sound identification, and other projects, and it has made very good progress.
