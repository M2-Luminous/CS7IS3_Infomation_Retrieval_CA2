The statement says that Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina, supported the proposal made by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman concerning a cease-fire and the territorial delineation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Muslim side has not yet signed, and the Muslim side points out that talks should continue on some details. The Croatian mission attached to the EU provides detailed information about the agreements reached at the meeting -- under UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] auspices -- by the military commanders of the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] and the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The statement lays special emphasis on the agreement that a meeting be held on 14 January in Medjugorje at which talks would be held on the establishment of an EU administration in Mostar. It also carries the whole proposal of President Tudjman put forward at the meeting in Bonn. We recall that President Tudjman made the offer that by 15 January at 0000, all hostilities between the Croatian and the Muslim peoples must cease. The signatories would then bind themselves to adhering to humanitarian and international warfare law. It was envisaged that (?disobedient) formations would be disbanded and that war criminals would be tried. The agreement envisages the closure of prison camps and the release of prisoners by 31 January. Muslim accession to this agreement would guarantee the free passage of humanitarian convoys and humanitarian aid. The agreement envisages the regulation of relations in the Union of Republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina, accompanied by the mutual respect of the Croat and Muslim people. The agreement seeks 17.5 percent of Bosnia-Herzegovina for the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, and 33.33 percent for the Bosniak Muslim republic. The town of Mostar would be under EU administration for up to two years. It would be the capital of Herceg-Bosna and the return of its citizens would be ensured by a special agreement. The agreement -- a statement on which will be issued by the Muslims by 15 January -- envisages that if the Union of Bosnia-Herzegovina falls apart there would not be changes in the borders between the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna and the Bosniak-Muslim republic. These two republics would be able to establish special relations with Croatia.
