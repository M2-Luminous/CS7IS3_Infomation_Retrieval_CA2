Moreover, according to the former employees of the Military Health Institute, the small pox virus has never been destroyed. There was no small pox virus in the viral strain bank that the army liquidated last February, while, according to information available, it was not destroyed in the 1980's either. So far, none of the army or civilian officials we asked has explained what has actually happened to the small pox virus. The director of the Central Military Health Institute, Vladimir Radovnicky, believes that the virus was destroyed between 1976 and 1978. "The small pox virus strain (variola maior) was here once, because there is a diagnostic serum. It was a problem of the 1970's. The strain was probably destroyed. Nevertheless, I cannot give a definite answer of when and how it was destroyed. I can only confirm that the small pox virus was not in the strain bank that was destroyed earlier this year. It would be hard for me to trace what happened in the 1960's and 1970's," he said. He then emphasized that there is no viral strain, even less the small pox one, in his institute now. A former employee of the same institute, who wishes to remain anonymous, and who used to work with the small pox viruses, asserted that, after the small pox research was concluded in the 1970's, the strain was frozen in liquid nitrogen and placed in a special container. In 1979, when thanks to the world-wide systematic inoculation, small pox was completely suppressed, the General Commission for Elimination of Small Pox recommended that all remaining stock of small pox virus be either destroyed or transferred to reference laboratories in the United States and the USSR. "We have not respected the research recommendation by the world commission out of laziness, rather than out of bad intentions," the former staffer of the research laboratory admitted.
