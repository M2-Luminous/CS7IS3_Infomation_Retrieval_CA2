Criticized by his fellow bishops at the 32d General Assembly of the National Conference of Brazilian Bishops (CNBB) for having made political remarks, CNBB President Dom Luciano Mendes de Almeida yesterday stated that he will no longer reveal his ideas about the October elections. Dom Serafim Fernandes, archbishop of Belo Horizonte and vice president of the CNBB, has said that Mendes de Almeida's opinions reflect "only his personal views," and are not in keeping with CNBB ideas about the current political situation. Fernandes said: He has every right to express his personal views on the electoral process, but they do not necessarily reflect the CNBB's position. In informal comments made at the Itaici convent on 17 April, Mendes de Almeida described the PSDB-PFL [Brazilian Social Democracy Party-Liberal Front Party] alliance as "a rather coercive marriage." In recent days, the bishops have exchanged caustic remarks over the release of an electoral leaflet sponsored by the CNBB. The wording of the leaflet was considered to be favorable to the PT [Workers Party]. Catholic priests and laymen have criticized Mendes de Almeida's remark about the PSDB-PFL coalition. One of his main critics was Dom Jose Carlos de Lima Vaz, auxiliary bishop of Rio de Janeiro. Lima Vaz said Mendes de Almeida's remarks may lead to misunderstandings, and may give the impression that the CNBB has reservations about the PFL. Dom Boaventura Kloppenburg, bishop of Novo Hamburgo, also criticized Mendes de Almeida by noting that no one may state that the market economy proposal -- which is upheld by several parties, the PFL included -- is unfeasible. Mendes de Almeida had been criticized earlier for having met last week with PT leader Luis Inacio Lula da Silva. The meeting was seen as a move to bring the Church and the PT closer together. According to Mendes de Almeida, the meeting was held at Lula's request and was focused on specific issues, such as the removal of the proposal to decriminalize abortion from the PT program. He assured his CNBB colleagues that the Church will not support any one candidate. Mendes de Almeida said at the CNBB assembly: We ought to meet with all the other presidential candidates, too.
