They have achieved such savings by reducing the number and scope of official banquets and curtailing or symplifying the presidential security service, the Board of Audit and Inspection (BAI) said Friday. The presidential secretariat managed to save 1,792 million won and the presidential security service, 1,299 million won, the BAI said. It said the secretariat sliced the number of dinner parties catered by hotels to 54 down from 210 times in 1992 when No Tae-u was president. It also reduced the amount spent per person at luncheons and dinner parties to 22,000 won each from 42,000 won and 65,000 won, respectively. BAI officials said the secretariat spent 154.9 million won for luncheons and dinners, down 585.4 million won from 743.9 million won the previous year. It managed the savings by serving such humble dishes as noodle soup, they said. The BAI, however, issued five warnings and handed two official notices to the secretariat and the security service after noting they had wasted money by asking for service without concluding contracts beforehand. As for souvenirs, Chongwadae managed to halve the cost of wristwatches carrying the presidential insignia while reducing the number of souvenirs to 15 kinds from 112 under the previous administration. Chongwadae thus slashed souvenir expenses to 383 million won in 1993, down from 742 million won the previous year, the BAI said. The presidential security service, meanwhile, registered savings totalling 1,299 million won by cutting back on manpower and reducing information-gathering activities and travel, the BAI said. The board pointed out that the secretariat failed to follow the rules on budget spending and accounting when it designated suppliers before drawing up contracts to buy such equipment as computers (41.7 million won), work on facilities (74.6 million won) and publication of pictorial magazines and opinion polls (64.7 million won).
