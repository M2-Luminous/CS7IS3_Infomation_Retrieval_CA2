[Sha'th] Today's meeting saw a qualitative change in this responsiveness. There has always been Palestinian apprehension that assistance might be so late in coming that it would be impossible to establish Palestinian institutions on liberated Palestinian territory in time to enable them to stand on their own and begin an independent Palestinian economy. Today, I say that there has been a transformation. It is true the sums we are talking about are not great. There is a commitment to offer $720 million. Today we obtained a commitment to transfer $40 million of that in the form of currency during the next week. However, this $40 million is only 40 out of 70, which is the deficit in the current expenditure budget of the coming Palestinian government within the national authority. This is more than half of the amount needed to pay the government's expenditure for the next few months. This is enough to cover the deficit for three months. It will be followed by a meeting on 11 July to fulfill the commitment to cover this deficit. Therefore, today's development was not only progress in terms of the promised sums but in terms of the monies transferred to finance the difficult part, namely, the current expenditure of the Palestinian government. ['Amarah] Then you believe this assistance is enough to meet the requirements of development and to rebuild the infrastructure in the Palestinian autonomy areas, especially the Gaza Strip? [Sha'th] These amounts are not budgeted for all the expenditures concerning investments or long-term projects. They will cover current expenditures, that is, the police, the employees of the Palestinian authority, and certain very urgent projects, such as programs to rehabilitate Palestinian detainees just released, and to give some compensation to thousands of Palestinians who have borne the brunt of the occupation, namely, the handicapped, the injured, families of martyrs and detainees and others. These will be projects to [word indistinct] assistance for them economically. There are projects like the Gaza cleaning project, which will cost $15 million, employing 15,000 laborers for three months. Thus, all the manifestations of former occupation will be removed, such as barbed wire, cement blocks that barricade roads, and the garbage the Israelis left on the streets. Therefore, it is an urgent payment to implement urgent projects and to cover the expenditures of the Palestinian government. We are well aware that this assistance is just the beginning. The Palestinian people will play their role, which they have proved for themselves and the world throughout long years of struggle for their homeland. The Palestinians who have been steadfast in the occupied territories for many years are asked to transform their energies and resources into building their independent and free country. Palestinians abroad, who have suffered and sacrificed in order to return to their country, and who contributed to building the countries of their brothers outside Palestine, are now prepared to return to rebuild their homeland. I believe self-reliance is the main Palestinian motto. This self-reliance now needs support to transform it into reality as soon as possible. I would also like to say that the much talked about delay in our Arab brothers' assistance to us, which I considered painful, is now beginning to become clearer. We say Arab backing has always been presented to the Palestinian people. Palestinians have always been grateful to their Arab brothers. Some Arabs contributed their money, some their own souls, and some their land from which the Palestinian people set out--in Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, Syria, Tunisian, the Gulf countries. All these Arab states gave their contributions. There were reasons for delays in this contribution. Now, I am happy to say that one-quarter of the amount given today was contributed by fraternal Saudi Arabia. Two other Arab states have promised the World Bank to announce a definite amount of assistance. This was not announced today, but it will be announced within two days. This will restore to the Palestinians the feeling that their Arab brothers are by their side in the process of liberation and reconstruction. ['Amarah] Last question, Dr. Sha'th. No definite date has been fixed for Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's arrival in Jericho. What is the cause of this hesitation? [Sha'th] President Yasir 'Arafat will be returning to his homeland for which he fought for many years. He did not link his return to his homeland with the realization of all his demands of support for this homeland. 'Arafat has expressed the Palestinian concern that the international community, which pushed toward the peace process and which saluted it in Washington on 13 September 1993, is hesitating to carry out its responsibility to transform this peace into facts on the ground. 'Arafat felt this concern. He was expressing to the international community his people's concern. But I now believe he is ready, as always, to return to this homeland to lead his people on their liberated land.
