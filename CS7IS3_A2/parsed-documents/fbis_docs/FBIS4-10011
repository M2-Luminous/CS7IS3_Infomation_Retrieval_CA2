A natural consequence of our geography, this priority is also linked with historical and cultural factors and the existence of sizable joint undertakings. Within the economic-commercial area, relations with Latin American countries are equally intense. Brazilian trade with ALADI [Latin American Integration Association] countries accounts for 25 percent of our foreign trade. This remarkable increase in the commercial flow toward Latin America has occurred in the middle of a process marked by the consolidation of regionalization and globalization of the world economy and the exhaustion of the import replacement model in Brazil. The conclusion of the Uruguay round of GATT [General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs] talks has brought prospects for strengthening the multilateral system of commerce. At a regional level, the implementation of NAFTA has made it even more obvious that it is necessary to accelerate the consolidation of Mercosur [Common Market of the South] and the implementation of the proposal for a South American Free Trade Area (SAFTA). Few times in history have been so favorable for promoting cooperation with Latin American countries. The general predomination of democratic governments is the foundation for political coordination among the countries of the region and for the emergence of political forums like the Rio Group. This democratic atmosphere has to a considerable extent contributed to overcoming old regional distrust and rivalry. Among the initiatives aimed at strengthening confidence among the countries of the region is the understanding between Brazil and Argentina, which concluded with the signing of the historical Quadripartite Agreement of Nuclear Safeguards. The approval of a set of amendments to the Tlatelolco Treaty and the Declaration of Mendoza, which was signed before the Treaty for Proscription of Chemical Weapons, are also part of that context. Brazil has developed a tradition of confidence that pervades our relations with all South American countries. The fact that Brazilian diplomacy has been traditionally based upon the principles of self determination, non-interference, and respect for international law, has helped strengthen the reliability of the country before its neighbors. We have also attained valuable diplomatic achievements, which are represented by agreements like the River Plate Basin Treaty, the Amazonas Cooperation Treaty, the Treaty of Montevideo (ALADI), and the Treaty of Asuncion (Mercosur). Among the matters to which Itamaraty is attaching top priority, I would mention first the negotiations over Mercosur and the promotion of SAFTA. The liberalization process within Mercosur is moving forward as scheduled, with strong, positive impact on commercial exchange between the four partners, which has practically tripled since the signing of the Treaty of Asuncion. As of 1 January 1995 a free trade zone will come into force in the Mercosur zone. The proposal for the creation of SAFTA, which President Franco announced at the last presidential meeting of the Rio Group, has been welcomed, as I could see at the 8th ALADI Council of Ministers' meeting and, more recently, during a meeting with the economy and foreign ministers of Mercosur countries. At the bilateral level, high-level political contacts have substantially intensified. President Itamar Franco met abroad with Presidents Carlos Menem, Luis Alberto Lacalle, Rafael Caldera, and Cesar Gaviria. He attended the inauguration of Presidents Juan Carlos Wasmosy and Eduardo Frei, making valuable contacts with those chiefs of state. He met in Brasilia with the presidents of Argentina, Uruguay, and Guyana, and with the then presidents-elect of Bolivia and Paraguay. In my capacity as head of Itamaraty, I visited Argentina, Uruguay, Colombia, and Bolivia. This intensification of the meetings with top authorities of neighboring countries has healthily diversified the mechanisms for consultation and coordination, and the integration programs. Standing mechanisms for regular consultation have recently been instituted between Itamaraty and the Argentine Foreign Ministry. A high-level Binational Commission was also created to coordinate the work on various cooperation projects with Venezuela. At a recent meeting in Leticia, Presidents Itamar Franco and Cesar Gaviria installed the Brazilian-Colombian Neighborhood Committee. The consideration of border problems in those forums serves as a safeguard against the undesirable politicization of matters that are more directly important for local communities, opening prospects for cooperation whose potential had not been properly developed. In this spirit, Itamaraty has extended decisive support for the initiatives aimed at promoting physical integration and the integration of the power generation sectors with neighboring countries, either at a multilateral level, like the Paraguay-Parana waterway, or at a bilateral level, like the Brazil-Bolivia gas pipeline. This set of initiatives proves that Latin America is not merely a diplomatic option for Brazil. It is an area for priority action, to which the Brazilian Government should devote top attention in permanent contact with civilian society.
