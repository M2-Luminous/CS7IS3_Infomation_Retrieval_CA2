FBIS3-54588 "drnes019_q_94001" FBIS-NES-94-019 Document Type:Daily Report 28 Jan 1994 Bangladesh Attorney General Reportedly Removed From Post BK2301154894 Hong Kong AFP in English 0651 GMT 23 Jan 94 BK2301154894 Hong Kong AFP Language: English Article Type:BFN [By Nadeem Qadir] [Text] Dhaka, Jan 23 (AFP) -- The attorney general who successfully prosecuted and sent to jail former Bangladesh president Hussain Mohammad Ershad has been removed, although he says he was not informed of the government's decision. Lawyers also invariably described Aminul Haq's removal as "surprising," although he is known not to be a supporter of the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). The official BSS news agency announced late Saturday [22 January] that "the government has appointed Additional Attorney General Abdul Wadud Khandakar as attorney general of Bangladesh in addition to his own duties, until further order." Khandakar is known for his close links to the BNP. The appointment, BSS said, was effective January 2 and had been approved by Bangladesh President Abdur Rahman Biswas as Haq was under medical treatment abroad. But Haq said Sunday he had returned home last Monday and had met Biswas on Friday, yet was not informed of his removal and had continued to work as attorney general the last few days. "I have not yet received any official letter and was surprised to hear the government announcement," he told AFP by telephone. A top justice official confirmed the firing. "Yes, he (Haq) has been relieved of his responsibilities and papers are being processed to enable Khandakar to take full charge," the official said. After hearing of his removal Haq said he was not going to the office Sunday, a normal working day in predominantly Muslim Bangladesh. The ministry official refused to comment as to why Haq had not been informed. Haq came to the limelight after successfully sending the deposed Ershad to jail for 20 years on weapons and graft charges, and was appointed attorney general by acting president Shahabuddin Ahmed's interim government in 1991. One opposition member of parliament was quoted as saying that "he (Haq) did not join the government politically, but served his position well." Khandakar told the daily MORNING SUN newspaper that he had received the order and had assumed the post of attorney general. "The gentleman (Haq) was not in the country and in (his) absence an attorney general cannot handover charges to anyone," Khandakar said. "That is why it has been given retrospective effect, otherwise there would be a constitutional problem." He said the president appoints the attorney general under a constitutional provision as recommended by the prime minister. The former attorney general had offered to resign soon after Prime Minister Khaleda Zia came to power in March, 1991, but he was asked to carry on. He again offered to resign in April, 1992, when the government charged 24 main organisers of a "peoples' court" for treason. The mock "peoples' court" condemned Golam Azam, chief of the Moslem fundamentalist Jamaat-e-Islami party, to "death" for crimes allegedly committed during Bangladesh's 1971 independence war, but the government said the peoples' court action was not legal. Haq, besides pursuing several more graft charges against Ershad, was also entangled in the citizenship case of Azam. A High Court bench last year restored Azam's citizenship, but Huq had appealed against it. The former attorney general was reluctant to say much about his removal and replacement by a man who apparently enjoys closer political ties to the government. Asked his feelings on the government decision, Haq replied: "I have no feelings."
