Addressing students and teachers of the Odessa Polytechnical Institute, Kravchuk underlined that "the main thing is that nobody hinders him." According to Kravchuk, Masol meets all demands of the parliament and the Ukrainian society which they put forward with respect to the head of the government. "Masol has re-oriented both in his ideology and in his perception of the Ukrainian economy and the program proclaimed by him in the parliament testifies to this fact," Kravchuk said. At the parliament's session Masol declared that he is in favor of introduction of several changes into Ukraine's Constitution, which would stipulate that the prime minister is the head of the executive power and carries personal responsibility in for the economic transformations in the country in the face of the people. "The crisis is not over yet, it is deepening and we are probably on the threshold of a burst," he said. However, he reassured the deputies that "the government would do its utmost to stabilize the situation" but this will begin "not earlier than in a year or in a year and a half." Masol called his election to the post of the head of the Cabinet "a chance for those who want to work." "The future Cabinet of Ministers, he continued, will consist of like minded professionals who stand on the market platform and are outside any political orientations. Ukraine's national interests will be their major goal," Masol stressed. He addressed to Ukraine's political forces and people with a request "to abstain from destructive moves." The parliament has proposed to the premier to present a plan of urgent measures to stabilize the social-economic situation in the country to the parliament for consideration and to make necessary changes in the composition of the cabinet. After Masol's election the parliament speaker Aleksandr Moroz declared to journalists that substantial changes would take place in the government. In his words, "the Cabinet will be primarily formed on the professional basis but not in accordance with political points of views." Deputy Yefim Zvyagilsky, former acting premier, gave a positive assessment to Masol's election because "he knows Masol as a professional, an experienced industrialist." Deputy Petr Simonenko, leader of Ukraine's Communist Party, said that the new head of the government "as well as we, the communists," understands the problems of the Ukrainian people." "We have several differences but they are not principal ones and will not prevent our work," he added. At the same time leader of the Popular Rukh Vyacheslav Chernovil believes that "the government headed by Masol will go along the way of reforms too slowly." In his opinion, "Masol would not have been elected" if the voting had not been postponed for Thursday morning but was held the previous evening. Chernovil asserts that "an active work to buy over the deputies was being conducted" at night from 15 to 16 June. Leader of the Ukrainian conservative republican party Stepan Khmara called the premier's elections held before creation of a necessary legislative basis, in particular, before the adoption of the decree on the government as premature.
