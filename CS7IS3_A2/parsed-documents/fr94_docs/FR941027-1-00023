FR941027-1-00023 FR941027-1-00008 1. Alternative Sites on the Continental Shelf In the Miami nearshore area, hardgrounds supporting coral and algal communities are concentrated on the continental shelf. Disposal operations on the shelf could adversely impact this reef habitat. Because the shelf is narrow, about 3.3 nmi (6 km) off Government Cut, the transport of dredged materials for disposal beyond the shelf is both practical and economically feasible. Therefore, alternative sites on the continental shelf are not desirable. 2. Designated Interim Site (Candidate Site) The preferred alternative considered in this document is the final designation of an ODMDS. This site is an area of approximately one square nautical mile with the following corner coordinates: 25 ○45 ’30 ’ ’ N, 80 ○03 ’54 ’ ’ W; 25 ○45 ’30 ’ ’ N, 80 ○02 ’50 ’ ’ W; 25 ○44 ’30 ’ ’ N, 80 ○02 ’50 ’ ’ W; 25 ○44 ’30 ’ ’ N, 80 ○03 ’54 ’ ’ W. The site is centered at: 25 ○45 ’00 ’ ’ N and 80 ○03 ’22 ’ ’ W. This site is considered suitable in terms of practicality and economic feasibility. Sections 228.5 and 228.6 of EPA's Ocean Dumping Regulations and Criteria 40 CFR establish criteria for the evaluation of ocean disposal sites. 3. Alternative Sites Beyond the Continental Shelf The western edge of the Gulf Stream meanders about one mile east of the candidate site. Dumping in the Gulf Stream was considered, but the enormous task and expense of monitoring disposal under such conditions caused sufficient concern to eliminate that option. 4. No Action Under the ``no action'' alternative, the interim site would not receive final designation. The Water Resources Act of 1992, Title V, Section 506(a) prohibits the continued use of ocean dump sites which have not been designated by EPA as Section 102 dump sites after January 1, 1997. If EPA fails to designate the Miami ODMDS by that date, the continued foreseeable need to have an appropriate site for disposal of suitable sediments from dredging projects in the Miami area would place pressure on the Corps and EPA to approve on a project-by-project basis the use of temporary ocean dumping locations pursuant to either Clean Water Act Section 404 or MPRSA Section 103. The DEIS presents the information needed to evaluate the suitability of ocean disposal areas for final designation use and is based on one of a series of disposal site environmental studies. The environmental studies and final designation are being conducted in accordance with the requirements of MPRSA, the Ocean Dumping Regulations, and other applicable federal environmental legislation. Comments received on the DEIS will be addressed in the FEIS. This Proposed Rule is being published between the DEIS and the Final EIS (FEIS). EPA will accept comments on the Proposed Rule during the 45-day NEPA review period. Comments on the Proposed Rule will be addressed in the Final Rule, which will be published following the completion of the 30-day NEPA review period of the FEIS. Responses in the Final Rule may refer to earlier published responses, as appropriate. C. Proposed Site Designation The proposed site is located east of Miami, Florida, the western boundary being 3.6 nautical miles (nmi) offshore. The proposed ODMDS occupies an area of about 1 square nautical mile (nmi2), in the configuration of an approximate 1 nmi by 1 nmi square. Water depths within the area range from 427 to 785 feet. The coordinates of the Miami site proposed for final designation are as follows: ␣ 1␣ 1␣ 25 ○45 ’30 ’ ’ N 80 ○03 ’54 ’ ’ W; 25 ○45 ’30 ’ ’ N 80 ○02 ’50 ’ ’ W; 25 ○44 ’30 ’ ’ N 80 ○03 ’54 ’ ’ W; and 25 ○44 ’30 ’ ’ N 80 ○02 ’50 ’ ’ W. Center coordinates are 25 ○45 ’00 ’ ’ N and 80 ○03 ’22 ’ ’ W. D. Regulatory Requirements Pursuant to the Ocean Dumping Regulations, 40 CFR Part 228.5, five general criteria are used in the selection and approval for continuing use of ocean disposal sites. Sites are selected so as to minimize interference with other marine activities, to prevent any temporary perturbations associated with the disposal from causing impacts outside the disposal site, and to permit effective monitoring to detect any adverse impacts at an early stage. Where feasible, locations off the Continental Shelf and other sites that have been historically used are to be chosen. If, at any time, disposal operations at a site cause unacceptable adverse impacts, further use of the site can be restricted or terminated by EPA. The proposed site conforms to the five general criteria. In addition to these general criteria in Section 228.5, Section 228.6 lists the 11 specific criteria used in evaluating a proposed disposal site to assure that the general criteria are met. Application of these 11 criteria constitutes an environmental assessment of the impact of disposal at the site. The characteristics of the proposed site are reviewed below in terms of these 11 criteria (the EIS may be consulted for additional information). 1. Geographical Position, Depth of Water, Bottom Topography, and Distance [from Coast 228.6(a)(1)] 40 CFR The boundary and center coordinates of the proposed site are given above. The western boundary of the proposed site is located about 3.6 nmi offshore of Miami, Florida. The site is an approximate 1 nmi by 1 nmi square configuration. Water depth in the area ranges from 427 to 785 feet.
