Pronouncing the verdict on Thursday [28 April], the state protection senate at the Frankfurt Higher Regional Court spoke of a "particularly grave wrong" committed by the terrorist. This means that Eva Haule cannot expect her case to be reexamined after 15 years for suspension of sentence or pardoning. The senate is convinced that Eva Haule was part of the commando that carried out the car bomb attack on the airport and killed U.S. soldier Edward Pimental in a forest near Wiesbaden the previous night to get hold of his U.S. identity card. This identity card enabled one of the terrorists to take the bomb to the car park in front of the U.S. headquarters at the Frankfurt airport. The explosion killed two people and very seriously injured another two. Several other people were injured. Property damage was approximately 1 million marks. Haule has also been sentenced to 15 years for an attempted bomb attack on a NATO military school in Oberammergau, Bavaria, by the Stuttgart Higher Regional Court.
