At least such a harsh suggestion was heard at the regular conference of the first deputy chairman of the Government of Russia, Oleg Soskovets. The measure is highly favored by economic managers since it sometimes enables them to solve operational problems. At this one they were considering various ways of stabilizing the financial situation of nuclear power plants and enterprises of the nuclear fuel cycle. The situation is such that nuclear power plants may be transformed quickly and easily from energy producers to energy consumers. Many of the plants are threatening to shut down. Representatives of nuclear power plants state that they have no money for fuel because the Russian Joint-Stock Company Unified Energy System Rossiya owes them 450 billion rubles [R]. The latter, in turn, does not consider itself to blame--the direct consumers of energy owe it even more. The government has promised credit in the amount of R50 billion to settle the accounts of the nuclear power plants. But that will apparently not solve the basic problem. The money will be spent on plugging up holes, and after a month or two the situation will return to its original impasse. Therefore, in the opinion of the majority of those present, it is necessary to change the system: to create a market for electric energy. It must be sold and not "released." The conference earmarked a number of immediate measures which could possibly help to emerge from the crisis. Among them are deferring payments on taxes to the republic budget and granting nuclear power plants the right to conclude direct agreements for the delivery of electric energy to regional consumers. There was an amusing side to this. A representative of one of the nuclear power plants who was among those picketing the White House was interested to hear a proposal from the Ministry of Nuclear Energy to find additional funds by reducing the wages of the workers at the plants. He said something to the effect that for the sake of the country's safety he could take such a measure if he received his "gigantic" wage of 200,000 every month. But for now he cannot, since the last time he was paid was in February.
