Economics Minister Karel Dyba also promoted trade links during his late April visit to Taiwan. Latin America Trip According to the 27 April issue of HOSPODARSKE NOVINY, Klaus's visit, which included a large delegation of businessmen, confirmed the growing Czech interest in Latin America. As Klaus explained, "In this market we are achieving the highest sales in value-added products; three times more machinery and machine tools are going to South America than to industrially developed countries." Milos Sklenka, a HOSPODARSKE NOVINY correspondent who accompanied the delegation, said that Klaus's tour of Latin America, as well as his visit to Mexico last year, demonstrated that the rapidly developing markets on the Latin subcontinent could be very advantageous to the Czech Republic. Sklenka noted that during Klaus's stay in Buenos Aires, Santiago de Chile, and Brasilia, he proposed removing tariff and nontariff restrictions and increasing mutual trade, eventually leading to the establishment of a free trade zone. Sklenka also reported on the Latin American hosts' reaction to the visit, pointing out that there was substantial interest in the Czech model of privatization and macroeconomic policy. Argentina appeared to be particularly enthusiastic about the proposal, asserting that it could be implemented within three years. Chile's response was relatively reserved, although Chilean leaders did not reject the proposals altogether. Brazil, meanwhile, appeared to be pressing for more regional trade liberalization. According to Sklenka's report, Klaus's talks with the Argentine President Carlos Menem and Economic Minister D. Cavallo concluded with a memorandum of understanding between the two countries on preparing an agreement for a future free trade zone. The participants in the meeting expressed hope that it will eventually lead to free trade between Central European markets and the South American Mercosure (Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay). New agreements are to be concluded on investment support and guarantees, dual taxation, and visa-less diplomatic travel. In the 22 April issue of HOSPODARSKE NOVINY, Sklenka published an interview with Cavallo, who said that "while Argentina should become a gateway for Czech products to South America, we would like the Czech Republic to become a catalyst for the expansion of Argentine trade in Central and Eastern Europe." In Chile, Sklenka reported, Klaus led the negotiations with President Eduardo Frei and Finance Minister Eduardo Aninate on greater trade liberalization between the two countries. During the last year, Czech exports to Chile ($5.6 million), which were three times higher than imports, consisted mainly of iron and steel, tractors, trucks, and textiles. Meanwhile, Chile exported to the Czech Republic mainly fruit and vegetables, but also some cotton, raw materials, and cattle feed. This trade had come to a virtual halt during the Pinochet government from 1973 to 1990. Taiwan Trip Karel Dyba was accompanied to Taiwan by the president of the Industrial and Transportation Chamber, Stepan Popovich, and several industrial representatives. According to the 25 April issue of HOSPODARSKE NOVINY, Czech "industry captains" spent five days negotiating trade relations with the Taiwanese semigovernmental organization CENTRA, which provides assistance to Taiwanese foreign trade. It is expected that a text of an agreement with the Taiwanese CNFT (Chinese National Federation of Industry) would be approved. The agreement is to cover information exchange, support of business exchanges, mutual trade stimulation, and production cooperation. The Chamber vice president, Pavel Prior, stressed to the Chinese the advantages of investing in the Czech Republic and expressed hope that the Taiwanese would help them penetrate the Asian markets. In the same issue of HOSPODARSKE NOVINY, Pavel Prior noted that competition in Asia is very keen. The Czechs recently lost a bid to build a metro for the Japanese, and apparently the Taiwanese expect better banking terms than the CSOB [Czech National Bank] seemed to be willing to offer.
