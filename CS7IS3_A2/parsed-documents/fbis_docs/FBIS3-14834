The meeting was attended by lawmakers from the Democratic and Republican Parties. The White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said that the meeting of the U.S. President with congressmen focused on providing U.S. aid to Russia. Recently, a number of U.S. lawmakers called to freeze U.S. aid or reduce it, following a scandal which flared up around the CIA officer Aldrich Ames and his wife charged with spying both for Russia and the United States. "Undoubtedly, the president intends to oppose any efforts aimed at reducing U.S. aid to Russia," Dee Dee Myers said, adding that the president is convinced that the politics of the U.S. Administration, including its support to Moscow, meets U.S. national interests. Dee Dee Myers said that at present, the U.S. and Russia are making efforts to settle the problem around the "Ames" case at different levels and using different channels. The press secretary pointed out that the Russians had not responded to U.S. demands so far, adding that they expected a reply in the near future. No one of the U.S. administration has mentioned yet what demands Washington made on Moscow, motivating their silence by the interests of national security. Presumably, one of the channels expected to be used by the two sides to resolve their problem is a visit to Washington by first Russian Deputy Foreign Minister G. Mamedov. The high-ranking Russian diplomat, who arrived in Washington on Thursday night, intends to meet U.S. First Deputy Secretary of State [title as received] Strobe Talbott and other foreign ministry officials on Friday. Mamedov's visit to Washington had been scheduled long ago to discuss different problems of international politics. Nevertheless, talking to journalists on Friday Mamedov made it clear that the "Ames case" would be discussed. "We are concerned about anything which might be detrimental to Russo-American partnership," Mamedov said. "However, we believe that we have accumulated enough confidence and gave sufficient impetus to these relations so that we could overcome any problem," he said.
