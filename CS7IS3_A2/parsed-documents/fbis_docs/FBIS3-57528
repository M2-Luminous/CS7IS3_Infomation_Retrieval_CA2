The meeting, which lasted more than an hour, took place at the initiative of People's Deputies of Ukraine Volodymyr Terekhov and Serhiy Tsekov, ardent supporters of Yuriy Myeshkov, the winner in the first round of the presidential election in the Crimea. In the opinion of one of the meeting's participants, who wished to remain anonymous, the talk with President Kravchuk was not open in all respects, because the plans of the Myeshkov supporters did not envisage the presence at the meeting of other Crimean politicians, the political opponents to the Republican Movement of the Crimea (RRK). Volodymyr Terekhov wanted to know whether Kiev was planning to use force against the RRK and when Ukraine would begin to combat terrorism in the Crimea. To the first question, Leonid Kravchuk said no. As far as the second question was concerned, he said the Ukrainian procuracy was already taking necessary measures but that was a problem of power not only in Kiev, but in Simferopol as well. The Ukrainian president said he had nothing against Yuriy Myeshkov personally or against the movement he heads. The president, however, stressed that all the citizens and political forces in Ukraine, the Crimea included, should abide by the laws of Ukraine. Leonid Kravchuk spoke out against granting dual citizenship to the residents of the peninsula. In the opinion of a meeting participant who was interviewed by the UNIAN correspondent, Kravchuk is well informed about everything happening in the Crimea and in the entourage of Myeshkov in particular. The people's deputy also believes that the holding of the meeting was due, first and foremost, to the uncertainty of Myeshkov and his team in their own strength. "They did not want to win at the presidential election, because they were not ready for this and now they do not know what to do with this." He admitted that if Crimean residents learn about the latest maneuvers of Myeshkov and his supporters, about their refusal from the election promises (a referendum on the status of the Crimea, secession from Ukraine, etc.) the second round of the election scheduled for 30 January may fail to take place.
