The statements by Tindemans were greeted with astonishment by both his entourage and by Dutch members of his political group. The former Belgian prime minister will announce his choice to the new group that is elected as soon as it takes up its duties after the European elections next 9 and 12 June. The EPP [Group of the European People's Party] chairman Wilfried Martens said he was "embarrassed" by the statement made by Tindemans, for there had been no consultation with him, nor any decision within the party on a potential candidate to succeed Delors. Up to now, the only candidate declared by the PPE group is former Netherlands Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers, who has officially submitted his candidacy to succeed Delors, something which the Belgian prime minister has not done. "I would not attach too much importance to these statements," Martens affirmed. According to him, if the PPE decides to present a single candidate for the post of EC president, it will make its decision at the summit meeting of the heads of government and chairmen of Christian Democratic parties to be held in Brussels on 22 June.
