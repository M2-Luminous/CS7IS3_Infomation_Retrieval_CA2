He described as "perfectly correct" his party's support to last Wednesday's package. This included a resolution on political and economic amnesty, amnesty in connection with the adoption of the new constitution, a memorandum of concord and a resolution to rescind the Duma resolution on setting up a commission of inquiry into last October's uprising. Shakhray said it was impossible to pass a legal judgment on the October events in Moscow because this could be passed only on criminal cases rather than "acts of civil war". He said the winner was alone in a position to enforce his legal judgment through government structures. At the same time, he expressed regret that the uprising leaders had been released so soon by the Prosecutor General Office [PGO]. Shakhray said the State Duma must issue a statement saying "no one is allowed" to take advantage of the amnesty to incite people for renewed violence. Shakhray said the faction's position had enlisted support from PRUC's regional branches. He said Yeltsin's representatives knew about a forthcoming resolution and the balance of forces in parliament let alone attended the session a day before the resolution was approved [sentence as received]. Shakhray said this was an indication of lack of coordination on the federal level between actions taken by administration, government, parliamentary and PGO officials with each side left to act on its own. Shakhray expressed regret over Prosecutor General Aleksey Kazannik's resignation. In his view, the PGO was not dragged into politics under Kazannik but there is a threat that this may happen following his departure.
