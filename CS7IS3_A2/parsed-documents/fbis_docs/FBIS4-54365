The committee, led by vice minister Shigeo Mochizuki, will hold its first meeting on Friday. The 12-member committee will draw up an action program by October or November on how to narrow differences in such areas as costs, personnel, materials and machinery. The ministry last year compared the cost of Japanese materials, machinery and other areas in flood control projects with U.S. costs. It found that costs in Japan were on average 30 percent higher than those in the U.S.
