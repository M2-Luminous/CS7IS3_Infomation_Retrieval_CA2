Zaytsev, chief of the October Railroad, by Ye. Chubasheva in St. Petersburg; date not given: "Under the `Roof' of the Road"] [Text] Exactly three years ago the only just then created registration department of the committee for foreign relations of the Saint Petersburg municipal council registered the first joint venture. Now there are more than 7,000 of them in the city. Some of them have become strong firms, others--are born and die like ephemeral butterflies, not having stood up to competition. Two out of 10 joint ventures have officially announced their own liquidation. The October Railroad is one of the region's leaders with respect to the number of joint-stock company and joint venture institutions. A. Zaytsev, chief of the October Railroad, tells about this sphere of activity. [Chubasheva] About 50 joint ventures and joint-stock companies are under the railroad's "roof." What will they give the mainline? [Zaytsev] They will make it possible to survive. The railroads remain state enterprises in the Ministry of Railways system. However, they are forced to operate within the framework of market relationships. Previously the government always set the prices for the services of the roads but it also ensured their vital activity and supplied the cars and locomotives, cross ties and fuel... Now the Ministry of Railways has been left not only without funds but also without plants. We get nothing in a centralized fashion. The Riga Electric Car Building Plant, the Poltava Diesel Locomotive Repair Plant, and others have found themselves beyond the border. The Russian High-Speed Mainlines Joint-Stock Company is building the high-speed Moscow--Saint Petersburg road. The Gelleflint Joint-Stock Company is engaged in work on the Vacha--Kochkoma border section, which will connect Karelia with Finland by the shortest route. Passenger cars are being made in the Tverskoy zavod Joint-Stock Company. The Torzhok Car Building Plant Joint-Stock Company has already created the first Russian Bylina electric trains... The road participated in the financing and reconstruction of these and other enterprises and they are already producing. There are a number of commercial structures in which we have invested money with the sole purpose of getting income. Transport operations, especially passenger, do not yield a profit but on the other hand the road has millions of rubles in profit from ancillary activity, including from participation in various commercial structures. And yet the main goal of this not typical for us activity is not the money but the necessity to preserve the highest volume and cheapest for the population form of transportation. This cheapness, although relative, is long since no longer a contribution of the government. Subsidies have been abolished and you won't get compensation payments to cover losses. Today life has compelled state enterprises to adapt to market relationships, and to enter into them through the commercial structures which have been created under their "roof." Far from all the enterprises into which we have entered and which we have created ourselves are flourishing. One has had to take one's share out of 10 joint ventures and the work of several more doesn't justify our hopes. We have recently left the structure of the Russian-Italian Furniture Production Enterprise, which had promised to become highly profitable and to supply railroad children's institutions with its products. Here our compatriots have accused their foreign partners of dishonesty. There are also positive examples. There is the work of the Raskom joint venture. The railroad workers, jointly with the specialists of several US firms, have created a new communications line, having run it along the supports of the contact system on the existing Moscow--Petersburg mainline. It will play a large role in the conducting of the Goodwill Games, improve the quality of communications in the region, and yield millions of rubles in profit. [Chubasheva] The unsinkable "flagships" of our industry such as Kirovskiy zavod are suffering failure. Why are you, and not the general director of Kirovets, making an attempt to save its branch in Tikhvin, Transmash, from bankruptcy through attracting Austrian technologies there? [Zaytsev] This is an attempt not to save Transmash but to protect the October road from collapse. Equipment is needed to maintain the quality of the tracks. It's time to produce it ourselves and not to purchase it for foreign currency. There are no plants in the CIS which produce heavy-duty track machines. However, there is the potential of the unutilized productive capacities in Tikhvin. There is the technology of the best in the world producer of such equipment--the Austrian firm Plasser and Toyrer [as transliterated]. We have acquired several samples from it and in the course of periodic talks we have proposed a variant of the collaboration with Transmash to the guests and have acquainted them with its possibilities on the spot. This plant, which previously worked for "defense," has, with the help of the road's investments, already reorganized a number of its shops to turn out component parts for the production of electric trains. We would like to utilize the potential of this enterprise also in future. The industry of the region is so varied and developed that it is capable of turning out all the necessary technical facilities for Russian railroads. We look with hope at the Kirovskiy zavod, which could build general-purpose diesel locomotives. The Czechs made them previously. Now we have been left without passenger locomotives. This is not a railroad but a national problem. The government should intervene now: remove taxes and grant preferential credits to those enterprises which are being reconstructed for the needs of transportation--things should get going. [Chubasheva] Payment for hauls with commodities is being used ever more widely recently. What do you think of this? [Zaytsev] Payments "in kind" have entered firmly into practice, incidentally, in the interests of the very enterprises who are not able to pay for transport operations in money. It's advantageous to us to receive crushed stone. It's needed for repairing the track bed. The Cherepovets Combine has paid with metal--it comes in handy for manufacturing electric train bodies. The Apatit Production Association has owed us 6.5 billion rubles for transport operations. They propose settling with products. One would think, why fertilizers for a railroad? But we'll take it. Otherwise you won't get anything from them. And we will sell the apatites to the Novgorod Azot Association and the Voskresensk Mineral Fertilizers Production Plant. Willy-nilly the railroad has become an unique "sales service" for many enterprises. The ties of the railroad people are extensive and one can find buyers. But who should be engaged in this? We don't have any specialists in sales. So we are looking for people and creating structures which would run all these commercial operations and would find materials the railroad needs in exchange for those that the non-payers offer us. Today one can supply all the construction projects which are underway on the mainline with the materials and equipment being delivered by debtors. One can even obtain rails and cross ties not by direct contracts but by having formed a network of enterprises which have owed one another. For example, contact wire is already being manufactured at the road's order this way--our debtors supply the copper to the producer. "Spin around as you are able. Only don't ask for anything,"--such has become the position of the Minstry recently. Quite recently they stigmatized the leaders of the October Railroad for the fact that we take "in kind" for a haul. Now they have authorized one even to register the debts officially as securities--bills of exchange (veksel). All the railroads are obliged to collect a debt from clients in their products. Eurosib (Evrosib), one of the joint-stock companies organized on the railroad, is engaged, by the way, in selling metal. And rather successfully. The last operation yielded a R1.5 billion profit. Eurosib has contracts with foreign and domestic clientele engaged in the dispatching of freight. This is a purely market structure. It gets the money at once and is not bound by any moral obligations like the railroad, which is obligated to all to provide transportation, even if it is not paid for it. [Chubasheva] But a road can "strangle" a debtor by not providing cars to the enterprise? [Zaytsev] Yes, we have received a directive from the Ministry: conclude a contract with clients and don't provide cars for loading if the terms are not fulfilled, in particular, with respect to payment. However, for our actions to be lawful, it is necessary, at a minimum, to change the Charter of the railroads in which it is written that at the request of the enterprises one is to provide them with rolling stock for hauls. The port workers, for example, are able to not take from us the cars they have ordered and to dictate whatever they like. The power engineering people threaten to cut off the electricity. They all are now bosses. The road has received the usual refusal of its being made a joint-stock company and cannot conduct a dialog with them "as an equal." The debts of the enterprises of the October Railroad have grown already to R100 billion. [Chubasheva] And in such a situation you are starting new construction projects and creating new structures? [Zaytsev] We are electrifying multi-kilometer sections of the mainline, for example, Volkhovstroy--Svir, and we are erecting housing. [Chubasheva] And the railroad workers ride in Japanese automobiles. They already know in the city: a Mazda has passed by--this means, almost for sure, a railroad worker has driven by. Are you cooperating with this firm? [Zaytsev] The time when all will ride in automobiles remains a dream for the present. But we have gambled on one firm from economic considerations. The very same Eurosib is the official Mazda dealer in Saint Petersburg. They are selling the automobiles successfully and have opened a technical service station. There are about a thousand Mazdas now in the city and no more do their owners have problems with repair. By using one brand of machines, the enterprise has completely reorganized the service park for them. Yes, today we have spent money. But tomorrow it will be recouped. I believe in common sense. In the fact that the recession is not eternal. I believe in the upsurge of the country's economy. It will come and will require an increase in the volume of transport operations from the railroads. We must be ready for this so as not to become a break on the development of production. That is why we are doing so much today for the future.
