It is expected that the position of some parties regarding this matter will become clear today and tomorrow. Mennam reports: [Mennam] The National Liberation Front [FLN] has been holding an emergency meeting in Hotel Aurassi since this morning. The meeting is due to last for two days. The meeting was preceded by a session of the political bureau to decide on the meeting's agenda, which will focus on studying the general situation in the country and the progress of the national dialogue. In this context, the meeting is expected to make a decision on the FLN's participation in the national conference which is due to be held on 25-26 January. A further report on this morning's session from the radio team in Hotel Aurassi: [Correspondent] The FLN's Central Committee emergency meeting is being held this time amid circumstances characterized by the gravity of the prevailing situation in the country at all levels. In this context, FLN Secretary General Abdelhamid Mehri dealt with the situation in his opening speech in which he talked about his party's stance vis-a-vis the process of the dialogue and the developments in the country since the resignation of former President Bendjedid and the appointment of what was described by Mehri as an effective authority to run the transitional phase. Mehri's statement included a critical view of the way the dialogue has been handled and the way the Higher State Council [HCE] has been running the country's affairs. In the opinion of the FLN's leading official, the results reached have been negative in all spheres. The HCE assumed the role of leading the corrective [tashihiyah] movement and did not confine itself to the limits of the presidential post, according to Mehri. It sought to create better political parties, a better constitution and, in a sense, to shape the political map that has been created by the society. The result was that in place of what has been removed there is a vacuum, and this has not been replaced by anything better -- so much so that the authority is about to lose channels of communication, leaving the opportunity for the emergence of a lack of clarity in all the stances taken with a view to resolving the crisis, in Mehri's opinion. Generally, Mehri repeated to the FLN Central Committee his previous statements regarding the absence of a debate on central issues, such as ways of stopping the chain of violence. As far as he is concerned the dialogue has focused on ways of dividing up posts as a means of raising the issue of how to extend the transitional phase. The logic applied by the FLN's leadership to the process of the dialogue made the secretary general regard the dialogue meetings as a series of meetings which were far away from public debates among the various sides. Mehri's perception moves toward a rejection of what he termed as bearing responsibility for disinforming public opinion and officials. He added that his party cannot say that the dialogue has succeeded while thousands of families are experiencing helplessness and hunger, and, furthermore, the people have become afraid of the state. We have noted the absence of former Prime Minister Mouloud Hamrouche and the participation of other traditional members of the FLN in the meeting. Regarding participating in or boycotting the national conference, the dominant view among members is that there is a possibility that the Central Committee will recommend the political bureau to make the FLN's final decision.
