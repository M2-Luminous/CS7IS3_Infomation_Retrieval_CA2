NUB said that North Korea had embarked on a large-scale restructuring of various production facilities across the country, after admitting to the failure of the third seven-year economic development plan at the 21st plenary session of the party's sixth Central Committee last December. Through the reorganization, the communist North is drastically reducing the functions and scale of heavy industry, while concentrating on fostering trade and light industry to promote exports, NUB noted. A NUB official said, "North Korea's reorganization of production systems is focused on strengthening light industry and foreign trade. However, it does not mean any change in the fundamental economic system of socialism."
