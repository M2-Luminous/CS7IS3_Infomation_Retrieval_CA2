The envoy, Iqbal Riza, was to have travelled to Kigali by road Monday to continue discussions to pave the way for the return of UN peacekeepers to stem ethnic slaughter in Rwanda. But after talks in the morning with leaders of the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) at their headquarters in Mulindi, northern Rwanda, Riza cancelled the trip and returned to Uganda by helicopter, a UN spokesman said. "We did not obtain explicit guarantees from the two parties about his safety," spokesman Abdul Kabia said by telephone from Kigali, where fighting tailed off despite sporadic gunfire. Kabia said both sides had agreed to a two-day truce to allow Riza to hold talks with rebel leaders and Rwanda's interim government on plans to deploy 5,500 UN troops to stem a six-week-old bloodbath in which up to half-a-million people have been killed. The rebels, however, said they had not agreed to a full truce, but had agreed to hold fire wherever possible to allow Riza to travel safely. But Riza was still concerned about negotiating a dangerous crossing just outside Kigali, Kabia said. "The truce is largely holding," Kabia said. "There are occasional exchanges of fire, but there's a lot less fighting than usual and so we consider that the truce is being respected."
