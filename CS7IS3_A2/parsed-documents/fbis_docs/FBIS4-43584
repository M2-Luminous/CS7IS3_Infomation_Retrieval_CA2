His use of such strident terms as "statistical chicanery" and "touched-up figures" speaks for itself. He and the Liberal Party ought to look ahead. Anders Fogh Rasmussen is desperately trying to talk away the economic upturn that is in progress. In an recent article in BERLINGSKE TIDENDE, he gave a fresh example of his numerical exercises with the aim of showing that the forthcoming drop in unemployment is not "real." At the same time he makes a big thing out of the fact that the latest unemployment figures, for February, show an increase compared with January. It is evident from, among other things, the comments from the Danish Bureau of Statistics on the February unemployment figures that the increase is presumably due to transition problems with the labor market reform. The other current indicators of economic development confirm that an upturn is in progress. Thus the newly released national economic figures for the fourth quarter of 1993 show a big growth in production, and employment in the private sector (seasonally adjusted) has started to rise. Therefore there is absolutely no reason to believe that the government's current estimate of an unemployment decline of 20,000 in 1994 and another 25,000 in 1995 will not prove valid. This would mean that over 60,000 fewer people will be unemployed at the end of 1995 compared with today. The government's estimate is also increasingly supported by other economic analysts, both at home and abroad. But that may really be the most important reason for Rasmussen's frustration. In addition Rasmussen airs his well-known views on "statistical chicanery" and "touched-up figures." The strident language speaks for itself. It is difficult in a short article to take a stand on the numerical acrobatics. I will not weary the reader with this. And all the figures behind the government's estimate have been laid out fully and openly in the "Economic Digest." But I would like to make two comments. The first is that Rasmussen has suddenly started to include 1993 in his calculations. It is unfair to use the large drop in employment and the sharp rise in unemployment last year as a yardstick for evaluating the government's policy. The most important measures -- the tax and labor market reform and increased public investments -- did not have an impact until the beginning of this year. Instead of concentrating on the past, Rasmussen should look ahead -- that is the Liberal Party slogan, after all -- and comment on the estimate for 1995 when the effects of the government's economic policy achieve their full impact in the form of a continued drop in unemployment, a sharp rise in employment in the private sector, and a substantial improvement of public budgets. My second comment is that Rasmussen has made a factual error. He alleges that the government's current employment estimate includes people who are on leave from work under the new system. As I have explained in answering a long list of questions from the Folketing Political-Economic Affairs Committee, this is just not correct. Rasmussen should have known this from his frequent use of the "Economic Digest." In general Rasmussen's insinuating tone is ill placed. Of course the Economic Ministry uses internationally approved methods when it adds up employment and unemployment. And the methods are the same as those used by previous governments. Rasmussen must feel hard-pressed when he resorts to this kind of "argument."
