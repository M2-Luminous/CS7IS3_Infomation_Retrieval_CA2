This was said by Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who was speaking to journalists after a wreathe-laying ceremony at Yuriy Gagarin's tomb by the Kremlin Wall. In Boris Yeltsin's words, the idea of concluding a civic accord memorandum has been backed by the State Duma, the Federation Council, the government, and by many parliamentary groups. Boris Yeltsin said: "At 1000 hours tomorrow, I summon heads of organizations to agree on the drafting of the text itself." Boris Yeltsin noted the need for "all the strata of our society to take part" in drawing up the memorandum, "so that it really is a civic accord." "And after that, we are going to sign it," the president said.
