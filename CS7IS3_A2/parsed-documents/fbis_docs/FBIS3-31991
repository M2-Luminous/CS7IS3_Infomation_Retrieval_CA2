The communique reads as follows: A working session between the Haitian delegation, led by President Jean-Bertrand Aristide; and a Canadian delegation, led by Andre Ouellet, minister of foreign affairs, took place on 24 January at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Ottawa. The session's agenda included the following points: the Haitian crisis; the United Nations file; the training of a managerial staff for a national police force, as provided for in the Governors Island agreement; and Haitian-Canadian bilateral cooperation. The two delegations agreed on the following points: To disentangle the Haitian situation, the embargo must be total; this will shorten the duration of the crisis. Other countries should be added to the four friendly countries that now include Canada, Venezuela, the United States, and France. The police force can be trained outside of Haiti. It will be done either with the collaboration of the United States or with the participation of several friendly countries. This force will receive training not only in maintaining order and safety, but also in respect for the law and the Constitution. The two delegations reviewed several branches of activity in which Haitian-Canadian cooperation will be broadened following the return of democracy to Haiti: education, literacy, cooperative communication, and energy. Also discussed was a radio station that would allow the Haitian people to be well informed about what is being done and said on their behalf throughout the world. This would break the rule of silence and disinformation imposed by the military regime. This press communique is signed by Jean-Claude Martineau, spokesman for President Aristide.
