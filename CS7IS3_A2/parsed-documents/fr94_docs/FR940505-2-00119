FR940505-2-00119 FR940505-2-00085 A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change The proposed rule change consists of a technical amendment to the clearing fund formula to clearly delineate the clearing fund requirements of NSCC's regular clearing members (``clearing members'') and NCCC's members that only use the mutual fund services (``mutual fund services members''). All NSCC members that use the mutual fund services are required to make clearing fund deposits relating to their mutual fund services usage. For clearing members, this requirement is in addition to their normal clearing fund requirements. Previously, clearing members' clearing fund requirements for usage of mutual fund services was set forth in NSCC Procedure XV, A. I.(a)(iii). However, in the recently approved File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;93&hyph;11, 2 NSCC moved this clearing fund requirement to Procedure XV, A.I.(b). Because section A.I.(b) is entitled ``Clearing Fund Formula for Mutual Fund Services Members,'' it is not clear that this requirement applies to both clearing members and members that only use the mutual fund services members even though the mutual fund services clearing formula refers to ``Members'' (i.e., clearing members) and even though NSCC intended that clearing members remain subject to the mutual fund services clearing fund requirement. Accordingly, the proposed rule change is reinserting into section A.I.(a), ``Clearing Fund Formula for Members,'' the mutual fund services component of the clearing fund formula for the purposes of clarity and is limiting section A.I.(b) to mutual fund services members. 2 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33525 (January 26, 1994), 59 FR 04959, [File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;93&hyph;11] (order approving a proposed rule change relating to capital and clearing fund requirements for users of mutual fund services). B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition NSCC does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition. C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others Written comments were not and are not intended to be solicited with respect to the proposed rule change, and none have been received. III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A)(i) of the Act 3 and subparagraph (e)(1) of Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder 4 because it involves an interpretation of an existing rule of the self-regulatory organization. At any time within sixty days of the filing of such proposed rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 3 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A)(i) (1988). 4 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4(e)(1) (1993).
