Weckbach-Mara; place and date not given: "Coalition -- Fight Over Taxes Aggravating!"] [Text] [Weckbach-Mara] Will the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] make its coalition statement in favor of the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] subject to any conditions? [Solms] Yes. We will tell the voters in good time before the elections which liberal principles are indispensable for us. [Weckbach-Mara] What are the most important touchstones for the FDP? [Solms] It starts with simple issues, such as rejection of the speed limit and of the increase in mineral oil taxes. We are for, not against, cars. We demand more parking space to prevent inner cities from depopulating, as well as a rapid construction of roads running east-west, funded by private means and by further measures. [Weckbach-Mara] The FDP's demand to check the solidarity surcharge after three years is unanimously rejected by the CDU/CSU. Are you going to stick to this position? [Solms] By all means; this is one of the most important touchstones of the coalition. The least that can be done is to check the solidarity surcharge at regular intervals and to start gradually removing it after three years. We want to lower taxes in other fields as well to create jobs: Anyone investing in new jobs will pay less in taxes. [Weckbach-Mara] Everyone is talking about public austerity measures. How do you want to put this into effect? [Solms] It all begins within the government machinery. With the FDP, there will be fewer ministries in the future: The Ministries for Family and the Elderly, Women, Young People, and Health will be combined into one again. The Ministry for Education and Research will be turned into a Ministry for Future-Oriented Affairs. The Ministries for Transport and Housing Construction could be combined into an Infrastructure Ministry, together with the Ministry for Postal and Telecommunications Affairs. Lufthansa will be privatized. The total number of state secretaries will be cut by one-third. [Weckbach-Mara] The European authorities will get away unscathed? [Solms] These must be cut down as well. The European Union [EU] is violating the Maastricht Treaty with its excess bureaucracy. We have to put an end to the regulation mania. It is nonsense to have Brussels telling us from where we may import our bananas, or how many kilograms a German worker is allowed to lift. At the same time, the EU fails to act when it comes to remedying bad situations, down to the field of health affairs, in order to prevent catastrophes like Mad Cow Disease [Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy -- BSE] from spreading. [Weckbach-Mara] The CDU and CSU insist on the great bugging campaign against suspect major criminals.... [Solms] This would not help the fight against mass crimes, the point where we have to start. We must strengthen police and we need more posts on the federal and laender levels, better training and equipment, better international cooperation. We also need a legal reform that speeds up judicial procedures and introduces a compensation scheme for victims.
