It involves filling the vacancy for an ombudsman -- a post that has been vacant for over a year -- and vacancies in the General Council of the Judiciary, the board of directors of the Spanish Radio and Television Company, the Nuclear Safety Council, and the Universities Council. As Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, minister of the Prime Minister's Office, announced following the cabinet meeting yesterday, there is an agreement between the Socialist parliamentary group and those of United Left, Convergence and Union, the Basque Nationalist Party, the Canary Islands Coalition, and the mixed group to present the Congress [of Deputies] in plenary session, following the Easter Week break, with a number of parliamentary initiatives winding up a lengthy series of talks in order to complete the above-mentioned "impetus." Last, the leading opposition group -- the People's Party -- is excluded from an agreement that, according to Perez Rubalcaba, could no longer be postponed in order to prevent the above-mentioned bodies' "institutional deterioration."
