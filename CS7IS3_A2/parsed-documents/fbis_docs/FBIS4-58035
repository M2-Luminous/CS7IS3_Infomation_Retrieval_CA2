He explained the PUK's understanding of this issue. It is worth noting that certain parties used particular parts of the interview for their own interpretations and to serve their own objectives. Therefore, to avoid misleading the masses or distorting the PUK's views and policies, we would like to declare to the masses of Kurdistan that the PUK considers federalism a gain for Kurdistan because it establishes the status of Kurdistan within an Iraqi framework on a federal basis. The PUK considers this to be the fruit of the blood of hundreds of thousands of martyrs and of a long and bitter struggle by the Kurdish people. The PUK played an effective and important role and has made sacrifices to accomplish this. Under no circumstances will the PUK accept lesser gains for narrow party interests and developments; this is impossible. Self-rule is not a PUK slogan. However, no other political party can be prevented from raising the self-rule slogan instead of the slogan of obtaining our people's legitimate rights. The PUK adheres to the idea of federalism in form and content. Establishing relations between the Kurds and Arabs in Iraq on the basis of federalism without achieving democracy remains an impossible dream. Therefore, eliminating the dictatorship and achieving democracy in Iraq are two prerequisites for establishing and safeguarding federalism in Kurdistan and Iraq. Negotiating with Saddam Husayn for any reason whatsoever will only result in repeating the tragedies of the Kurdish people and the destruction of Kurdistan. All the countries and people of the world consider Saddam Husayn and his regime to be big war criminals, genocidal criminals, and a contributing factor to instability in the region. Negotiations between Kurds or any Kurdistan party in Iraq with this regime constitutes a link with a collapsing regime that is ostracized by the countries of the region and the world. In effect it would mean substituting a considerable and realistic gain for an illusion. The PUK considers dialogue one of the ways and means of struggle. However, initiating a dialogue with Saddam Husayn--with his criminal killers of Kurds, enemies of mankind, democracy, peace, and human rights, the chauvinists, and racists--would be inexcusable under the current circumstances. This is because Saddam Husayn and the Ba'thists do not recognize any of our Kurdish people's rights. They consider death and destruction as the only legitimate right we Kurdish people have left. Our people have tried to engage in dialogues with the Iraqi regime several times, and they must have learned a lesson from this experience. The Baghdad regime may provide funds and arms to those who side with it, but it will never recognize the Kurdish people's rights, nor will it improve the living conditions of the Kurds. The PUK considers the gains made in Iraqi Kurdistan, embodied in the parliament and federal government, freedom, and peace, to be great gains that cannot be safeguarded through dialogue with Saddam Husayn. In fact, a dialogue with Saddam Husayn might destroy these gains. Safeguarding these gains can be achieved through the unity of the people and cooperation among the Kurdistan Front parties and the sons of our people. We believe that safeguarding and promoting these gains is a turning point for establishing a firm entity in Kurdistan. No one has a right to make us lose this opportunity.
