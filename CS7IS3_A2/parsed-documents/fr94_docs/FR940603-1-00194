FR940603-1-00194 FR940603-1-00009 The unit removal prices shall include all material and labor required to reinstall in accordance with specifications any conductors temporarily detached. The Bidder will reinstall at his own expense any other units removed by him for his own convenience. The removal units are specified by the prefix I and followed by the assembly unit designation of existing assembly unit to be removed. For example, an I&hyph;A1 signifies the removal of an A1 assembly unit. The following special notes apply to specific removal units: XXXX . a. Poles. All poles of the same height, regardless of pole class, are designated by the same unit. Thus an I&hyph;30-foot pole signifies the removal of a 30-foot pole of any class. The Bidder is not required under this unit to remove from the pole any ground wire or pole numbering attached to the pole. This unit includes the refilling and tamping of holes in a workmanlike manner unless they are to be reused. b. Pole-Top Assemblies. The unit of removal of pole-top assemblies includes, in addition to the removal of the assembly itself, any necessary handling, resagging, and retying of conductors in those cases where an existing pole-top assembly will be removed and replaced by a new pole-top assembly and where any existing conductor is to be reused. The unit of removal of pole-top assemblies also includes any holding or handling of mainline or tap conductors at tap lines, angles, and deadends where such is involved, and reinstalling of such conductor in accordance with the specifications; for example, an I&hyph;A5&hyph;4 will include the disconnection of the tap conductors, snubbing off the tap line at the nearest practical point and the reconnection and resagging of these tap conductors if necessary to the new tap assembly when installed. The new unit of construction, however, will be specified separately in Section N. c. Conductor. The conductor removal unit covers the removal of 1,000 feet of conductor or cable and reeling or coiling it in a workmanlike manner in such a way that it can be reused by the Bidder or the Owner. The Owner will furnish to the Bidder reels if it is to be returned to the Owner's warehouse on reels. The Bidder will retain possession of all jumpers, tie wire, armor rods, connectors, and other conductor accessories removed. These items will not be returned to the Owner. The removal unit for each size of conductor or cable is shown by the prefix I followed by D and the conductor or cable type; thus an I&hyph;D&hyph;6ACWC signifies the removal unit for 1,000 feet of 6A Copperweld-copper conductor. d. Guys. All guys regardless of length, type of attachment, or size of guy strand are specified by the same unit; thus an I&hyph;E signifies the removal of any guy. e. Anchors. Only anchor rods are to be removed by the Bidder in anchor removal units. The anchor will be left in the ground; thus an I&hyph;F signifies the removal of any anchor rod. If the rod cannot be unscrewed, the end of the rod shall either be cut off or bent down so that the rod will be at least 18 inches below ground. f. Transformers. The unit for removal of transformer assembly units is divided into two sections, (1) Conventional Transformer Assembly, and (2) Self-Protected Transformer Assembly. Only one unit is specified for each type, and all sizes of transformers from 1 to 25 kVA within each group will be covered by the same unit. ``Self-protected'' refers to transformers where all protective equipment is mounted on or within the transformer. ``Conventional'' refers to transformers where protective equipment is mounted separately from the transformer. The unit is designated by the prefix I followed by the description of the unit to be removed; thus IG Conventional signifies the removal of a conventional transformer assembly for any size transformer from 1 to 25 kVA. g. Secondary units. The unit for removal of secondary assemblies includes, in addition to the removal of the assembly itself, all necessary handling such as untying, resagging, and retying of secondary conductor or cables where existing secondary conductor or cable is to be reused. In addition, the unit for removal of the secondary assembly includes the handling or holding of any conductor at tap lines where such is involved, and the reinstalling of such tap conductor in accordance with the specifications. h. Service unit. The unit for removal of service assemblies includes, in addition to the removal of the assembly itself, all necessary handling such as untying, resagging, and retying of service conductor or cable where existing service conductor or cable is to be reused.
