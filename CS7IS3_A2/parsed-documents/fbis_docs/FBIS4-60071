The National Religious Party has called on the public to rise up and prevent what it terms the government head-long dive into the abyss. The head of Tzomet, Refa'el Eytan, says the attacks are the inevitable outcome of a government that ordered the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] to flee Gaza, in his words, in the middle of the night. The YI'UD [Independent and Democratic Israel] party is demanding that the prime minister halt the passage of all vehicles from Gaza into Israeli territory. A short time ago, reporter Harley Braidman got this reaction from the senior Likud member of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee Eliyahu Ben-Elisar: [Begin Ben-Elisar recording] This is a tragedy because again everybody can see what a catastrophe was bestowed upon us by a government which is blind and weak, and is pursuing a policy which could not succeed, could have no chance of succeeding because it is against nature, and against human character and mentality. How can a foreign and powerful nation like Israel try to strike a peace agreement with a snake, with 'Arafat, with the PLO, and believe that this is the only way out of the difficulties, and trust such a man, who is not being trusted by his Arab colleagues? Believe me, I know what I am saying. [passage omitted] [end recording]
