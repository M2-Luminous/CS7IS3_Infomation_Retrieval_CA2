The CGT also chose new members to its Directive Council, which is dominated by pro-government unions and is expected to continue its negotiations with the Justicialist administration. "It is not time to throw stones or make strikes, and we will favour dialogue over all things," 55-year-old Alberto Cassia said after being sworn in as CGT head. Cassia, a former deputy, has lead the union in Mendoza and has close ties with ex-SUPE head Diego Ibanez, who is a close friend of President Carlos Menem's. Cassia has also had a place as a workers representative on the state oil company YPF's [Government Oil Deposits] board of directors. The new leadership does not include any members of either the breakaway Argentine Workers Movement or the anti-government Argentine Workers Congress. Neither group attended the gathering staged in the Federal Capital at the Parque Norte sports centre. Luis Barrionuevo, the UTGRA [Argentine Union of Restaurant Workers] restaurant workers union leader, is another prominent unionist that does not have a place on the new Directive Council. AB [Banking Association] bank clerks union leader Juan Jose Zanola is the CGT's joint secretary general. The other 22 places on the council are shared among members of the staunch pro-government union and the moderate pro-government unions that negotiated Cassia's candidacy prior to the Congress. The powerful UOM [Metalworkers Union] metal workers union significantly has chosen to keep its participation in the new CGT at a minimum: La Matanza UOM leader Carlos Gdansky was appointed to the minor post of register secretary. UOM metal workers union leader Lorenzo Miguel said that "although we are friends of the President (Carlos Menem) we are independent enough to defend the rights of the workers." Cassia, in turn, said that he will immediately request a meeting with Menem and Labour Minister Armando Caro Figueroa. "(The CGT), shares the socio-economic model of Carlos Menem's government with the logical disagreements that organized labour has with certain official plans that affect workers rights," Cassia told a local news agency. He added that the CGT "will, if necessary, use the right to strike." Organizers said that 1,186 delegates of 171 trade unions participated in the Congress in which the only ticket presented was the one headed by Cassia.
