To prevent local residents from being further harmed by drinking underground water, in addition to urging the Environmental Protection Administration [EPA] to examine how seriously local soil and underground water have been polluted, Chao Shao-kang also hoped the Public Health Administration [PHA] would investigate the matter. The following is a report by Lin Sung-hua. [Begin recording] Lin: Those living in Taoyuan's Chupei area should be aware that the underground water you have been drinking might have impaired your health for a long time. On 2 June, Legislator Chao Shao-kang revealed that organic waste generated from manufacturing electronics products by [words indistinct] has been dumped either in the areas near the factory or into wells the company dug near the factory, and this might have caused harmful effects on local residents over the last nearly 30 years. Legislator Chao pointed out that the Taiwan U.S. RCA Company, whose factory is located in Taoyuan's Chupei area, was taken over by General Electric Company in 1986 and was again taken over by Thompson Company two years later. When Thompson Company purchased the factory, it was worried about pollution problems and asked U.S. environmental protection company [name indistinct] to take soil and underground water samples from the areas near the factory for examination in the United States. Results of the examination showed that the soil and underground water contained very high concentrations of volatile organic substances. Legislator Chao said Thompson Company planned to hold a news briefing to explain the pollution caused by General Electric. But it was worried that local residents might ask for compensation, and so decided to seal off the wells and close down the factory. Chao Shao-kang said [sentences indistinct]. He said the land where the factory is located has been sold to China Electric Company and another company, who knew nothing about the pollution problem. Because the land is within the Taoyuan urban area, it might be developed into a commercial or residential area. To prevent more people from being harmed, Legislator Chao decided to expose the fact. He said both Thompson and General Electric are well-known companies throughout the world and they did pollute Chinese soil. After making pollution money for nearly 30 years, they sold the land at a profit -- their behavior is quite contemptible. In addition to asking the government to sue the two companies at the International Court, Legislator Chao also hoped the EPA will immediately look into how serious the pollution is. He also hoped the PHA will conduct epidemic diseases examination among local residents so the government can assist them in demanding compensation from the two companies. [end recording]
