They called on UN military officials to urgently draft plans for the relief of a Canadian contingent trapped in the eastern Bosnian enclave of Srebrenica and to reopen the northeastern airport of Tuzla. They also reaffirmed their pledge made in August to use air power if requested by the United Nations to break the Serb siege of Sarajevo and other Moslem communities in the former Yugoslav republic. The calls came in a communique issued after a two-day summit of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation that saw the Bosnian conflict haunt NATO's efforts to build a new European security order. Britain and France proposed Monday that NATO offer tactical air support to allow Dutch UN Protection Force troops to relieve some 300 Canadians blocked for six months by Serbs in Srebrenica. They also called for warplanes to open the Tuzla airport, a key access point for relief deliveries to central Bosnia that has been blocked by Serb shelling since May 1992 and is currently guarded by Nordic UN troops. "We urge the UNPROFOR authorities to draw up urgently plans to ensure that the blocked rotation of the UNPROFOR contingent in Srebrenica can take place and to examine how the airport at Tuzla can be opened for humanitarian relief purposes," the communique said. NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner confirmed that the call included the possible use of NATO warplanes if requested by the United Nations and reflected a desire for tougher Western action in the 21-month-old conflict. "I see a stronger determination to implement UN resolutions and get rid of the obstacles," he told a news conference. "My impression is that there is a clear determination not to just continue the situation as it stands." Woerner said NATO had the capacity to act effectively in Bosnia. "The main thing is still the political will and determination of member countries to use it." U.S. President Bill Clinton said he backed the Franco-British proposal knowing full well that it could involve the use of U.S. air power. He also reiterated his warning against NATO making idle threats, adding "we should not say things that we do not intend to do." NATO military officials stressed that air power was of only limited effectiveness against artillery and it would be extremely difficult to keep Tuzla airport open only with warplanes. "These two are classic cases where over a sustained period of time one of the parties has not allowed UNPROFOR (the UN Protection Force) to perform its duties," said a British official, who asked not to be named. A French official, who also requested anonymity, said the credibility of the West and UNPROFOR's mission to protect relief operations in the former Yugoslav republic was at stake. "The 16 (NATO members) do not want to make war, but we are not ready to let local factions do what they want," he said. Officials said the proposal received support at a dinner meeting of the government chiefs Monday. Britain and other countries were opposed to air strikes around Sarajevo, fearing they could unleash a chain of reprisals and endanger the lives of UN troops on the ground. The West's inability to take effective action intruded on the summit here aimed at opening a new chapter in NATO's 45-year history by offering military links with the old East Bloc as a prelude to eventual enlargement. On Monday the summit launched a Partnership for Peace programme that would provide for joint military planning, training, and other activities and give the Eastern states the right to NATO consultations in crisis. But, in the face of strong opposition by Russia, the scheme stops short of promising automatic membership to participants as eagerly sought by countries such as Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.
