"It is unfair so much money is charged for a simple, administrative form," the Honduran minister said, reacting to a decision the U.S. Government announced on 20 June. This decision will be applied in all Central American countries. Fernando Sanchez, the U.S. consul in Tegucigalpa, has said the charge is to prevent people who do not even have $20 from approaching the U.S. Consulate to request a visa, because their intention is none other than to migrate to the United States. "I believe this is an unfair decision. I have said the only way to prevent large flows of Caribbean and Central American immigrants to the United States and the developed countries is by consolidating freer, stronger, and more competitive economies in our countries," Paz Aguilar said. According to Sanchez' estimates, approximately 50,000 Hondurans go to the consulate every year to request visas, of which approximately 30,000 are granted, meaning the consulate would be receiving $1 million if the current flow of applications continues.
