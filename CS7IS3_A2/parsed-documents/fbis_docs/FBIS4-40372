Three of them are devoted to problems of housing construction. In addition, he has also signed the edicts "On Protecting Consumers' Interests From Dishonest Advertizing," "On Improving the Work of the Russian Federation Banking System," "On Some Measures to Encourage Investment Activity, Including by Attracting Foreign Credits," and "On Some Measures to Ensure State Management of the Economy." Yeltsin's lawmaking activity is due to two factors, in the opinion of observers. First, the president is concerned at the slow progress of the reforms. Second, he has been forced to take some steps to compensate for the Duma's inactivity. Whereas the first set of edicts, signed at the end of May, was prepared exclusively by government experts, the latter documents are the work of government economists collaborating with their colleagues from the president's team. All the documents have been presented for signature on the government's behalf. In the opinion of Deputy Economy Minister Sergey Vasilyev, one of the authors of the edicts, the package of housing edicts occupies a special place. These are norm-setting documents, which prescribe incentives for the process of housing construction. They deal with the rules for the sale of unfinished apartment blocks and the provision of incentives for the creation of savings for housing. And in particular on the enshrinement of housing certificates in law. During the preparation of the documents it was the edict on improving the banking system which sparked off the stormiest debates. This edict, in fact, stipulates the extent to which foreign banks are allowed to penetrate the Russian market. Russian commercial banks showed tremendous interest in this document. As IZVESTIYA has learned, the text of the edict was reworked after the president's press conference, where he firmly advocated that foreign banks be allowed access to the Russian market. The edict "On Protecting Consumers' Interests From Dishonest Advertising" can begin working effectively as soon as a number of amendments have been made to the existing legislation. These amendments will regulate the work of the mass media and the advertisers. Meanwhile, this edict already makes it possible to apply fairly tough sanctions to advertisers themselves, even to the point of withholding their license. In addition, restrictions are being placed on the ability of unlicensed organizations to attract funds from the population. At the moment only banks, insurance companies, and pension funds, on the one hand, and joint-stock companies, on the other, are allowed to do that. Their activity is regulated in the following way: There are restrictions on the ratio of outside resources and firms' own resources and there is also a prescription that a balance and the main technical-economic parameters must be published in the press. Before trying to persuade the population to subscribe money to a loan, joint-stock companies will have to declare their anticipated profit. The edict "On Some Measures to Ensure State Management of the Economy" ought to have been adopted long ago. Essentially, the edict is designed to put an end to the absurd situation at present in which a director can dispose of an enterprise entirely as though it were his property but without bearing the slightest responsibility to the actual owner, the state, which can neither dismiss nor punish a negligent manager. Mutual relations between the state and the director will henceforth be regulated not by labor law but by civil law. A contract will be concluded with a director for the right to manage an enterprise, the form of which is stipulated by the edict. The contract may be cancelled if the accords are not observed.
