Minister Sarid said that the three rabbis behind the injunction were irresponsible people who were toying with the fate of the IDF and threatening the very existence of the state. If each and every individual exhorted their supporters to refuse objectionable orders, it would mean the end of the IDF, which would rapidly disintegrate together with rest of the country. The State of Israel should be pitied for having such stupid, irresponsible, reckless and good-for-nothing rabbis, Sarid said. Knesset Member [MK] Moshe Qatzav, the chairman of the Likud Knesset faction, called on the government not to put the soldiers' obligation to obey orders to the test in the context of evacuating Jews from Hebron. MK Qatzav told our correspondent that such action by the government could lead to chaos within the IDF.
