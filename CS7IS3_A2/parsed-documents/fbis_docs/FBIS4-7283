Regarding Sakigake's formation of a new floor group "Sakeigake-Seiun" (tentative name) with the "Group Seiun," composed of Dietmen who have left the New Japan Party [JNP], Takemura stated: "Various moves were still noticed within the JNP," and disclosed the new group would not be formed until 9 May, when the long vacation comes to an end. The decision seems to have been made while taking into account the possibility of recuriting those Dietmen who have hinted at leaving the JNP.
