[Gruber] Yes. We are comparing the figures we continue to receive with the figures the TE is giving on television. We see we have more or less the same figures, but we still lack many figures, above all from the countryside. We only have figures from the cities, which is what has been shown. [Bloise] What guarantees do the women, above all, have in your government if you win the presidency? [Gruber] Look, as a woman I believe women should be granted greater participation, so women would have equal participation with the men in my government. I do not want to imply that men would not participate, but we would.... [changes thought] We will certainly try to make sure that women have a major role in my government. They will. [Bloise] The Arnulfist Party has always stood out as a nationalist party that is deeply rooted among the people. What will be your position concerning a renegotiation of the military bases? [Gruber] We have said my government will hold a referendum and the Panamanian people will decide whether the military bases will remain beyond 1999. If they decide yes, then we will ask the United States to renegotiate these bases -- provided the United States also wants this. [Bloise] Under what conditions would these negotiations be carried out? [Gruber] We would first have to talk with the Americans. That is what I can tell you. [Bloise] What will be your government's position regarding the foreign debt? [Gruber] We know we have a commitment, and the debt must be paid. My government will not say it will not pay. We have this commitment, and we will fulfill this commitment, too. [Bloise] How will you feel concerning results.... [changes thought] What will be your position concerning the results of today's elections? [Gruber] How can I feel? We know the results will be known, perhaps in the early morning hours, and we also know the results will be in our favor. Therefore, we will feel happy, and we feel happy about the support the Panamanian people have given us. We have a commitment to the Panamanian people, so we will wait for the results. It is only a matter of a few hours. Thank you. [Crowd chants "Mireya!"]
