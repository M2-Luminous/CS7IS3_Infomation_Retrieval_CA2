According to Ukrainian Foreign Minister Zlenko, this would assist with creating a kind of atmosphere that would help to resolve many problems on the former USSR territory. Ukraine might be a significant addition to the axis, Foreign Minister Zlenko suggested. However, he remarked that the issue had not as yet been settled. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Zlenko did not sound optimistic when speaking about possible joining of Russia to the G-7. He considered Russian-Ukrainian relations to be normal ones between partners. However, he pointed out that there were some unsettled problems. Commenting on the Crimean issue, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Zlenko said "Russia and Ukraine display tolerance towards the Crimea." According to him, to resolve the issue as some Crimean politicians propose to do would mean transgressing the principles of international law. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Zlenko confirmed the intention of Kiev to settle the issue concerning the Black Sea Fleet in accordance with the Yalta, Massandra and Dagomys agreements. He said this approach had been agreed upon during his meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev in Odessa last autumn.
