Their objective is to strike at political stability in Egypt and try to weaken its economy. They hide behind Islam although they are a misguided group. The majority of the Egyptian people are Muslim and do not need guardians or someone to teach them about Islam. He said that the issue of terrorism in Egypt is different from the issue of terrorism in Algeria, where the terrorist groups succeeded in getting into parliament. But in Egypt the terrorists have failed to get into the People's Assembly or Consultative Council. They have also failed to infiltrate the ranks of the Army, security forces, and large institutions. In addition, the terrorist phenomenon in Egypt is different from that in the United Kingdom, for example, due to the presence of the shadow government and some form of Irish independence from the United Kingdom. Al-Sharif said this in answer to a question posed by an African journalist about the parallels between terrorism in Egypt and Algeria and the possibility of holding a dialogue with the terrorists in Egypt to reach a peaceful solution, such as that going on now between the United Kingdom and Ireland. During his meeting with the members of the conference of the African Journalists Office under the chairmanship of Mahfuz al-Ansari, head of the African Journalists Union and chief editor of AL-JUMHURIYAH, al-Sharif added that there are 440 seats in the People's Assembly, representing all political trends. None of them belong to the groups that describe themselves as Islamic. None of the so-called Islamic groups have managed to get into the opposition parties such as the National Progressive Unionist Grouping Party, the Wafd Party, and the Labor Party. He noted that the Muslim Brotherhood are represented by only 12 members out of the 43 members from the Labor Party; and they succeeded only because they belong to big families and tribes in the rural areas. He said the National Democratic Party has given opportunities to people from all political currents in Egypt, considering that 33,000 citizens ran in the elections. [passage omitted]
