The six cities are Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Wuhan, Chongqing and Harbin. According to the latest statistics from a symposium in Harbin, these cities have completed more than 15,800 projects since 1991, costing 57.71 billion yuan, of which some 8 billion yuan were state loans. Going into operation, they will bring in 95.36 billion yuan in increased output value, 19.938 billion yuan in taxes and profits and 4.313 billion U.S. dollars in exports. The industrial modernization process in these cities has seen good results in many aspects. Thanks to it, the cities' pillar industries have achieved a rapid growth. At present, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang and Wuhan are technically strong in the auto sector, regaining the leading position in the country. And power facilities from Shanghai and Harbin have obtained over two-thirds of the domestic market share. A batch of enterprises with high efficiency have become honey pots in these cities. During the 1991-1993 period, two-thirds of the cities' output value and taxes and profits increment had resulted from improved facilities. For example, taxes and profits in Chongqing Steel and Iron Company jumped from 1991's 200 million yuan to 1993's 650 million yuan. Also, the process has reinforced the competence of quite a few large and medium-sized enterprises. In Tianjin, about 45 percent of some 60 big enterprises which used 5.2 billion yuan in technological upgrading have established a niche in the domestic and overseas market. In Shanghai, many technological enhancement projects have been undertaken, involving the sectors such as communications, computers, bio-medicine and micro-electronics. Experts hold that problems like capital shortage and rigid management still hinder the process. This year's newly-issued investment and tax policies may also bring about challenges as well as chances. These six cities, most of whose medium and large enterprises were set up in the 1950s, had exerted an important impact on China's development at that time. Since the 1980s, their industrial strength has been weakened owing to out-of-date facilities and products. So the Chinese Government launched the campaign of industrial modernization in the cities in 1991.
