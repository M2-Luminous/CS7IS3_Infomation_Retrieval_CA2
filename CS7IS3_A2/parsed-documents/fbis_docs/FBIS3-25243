However, the poll could go ahead without the Inkatha Freedom Party, the Bophuthatswana Government, and the Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front] which includes the Conservative Party. The three Freedom Alliance members failed to register before last night's midnight deadline. But this came as no surprise as they had stated earlier that they would not be contesting the election despite a flurry of urgent meetings with the government and the ANC [African National Congress] in the pasts few weeks to try to accommodate their minimum demands for participation. Both the government and the ANC have expressed willingness to accept a possible extension of the deadline. The main parties that will be contesting the elections are the ANC, the National Party, the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress], and the Democratic Party. Others in the race are the African Christian Democratic Party, Mr. Armichand Rajbansi's Minority Front, and several parties with strong regional bases. Qwaqwa based Dikwankwetla [The Strong], Gazankulu's Ximoko Progressive Party, Lebowa's United People's Front, and the Ciskei-based African Democratic Movement. The more conventional parties were joined by several new comers with diverse election tickets. These includes the Realists, the North-West Democratic, the Merit Party, the Islamic, the Workers' International to rebuild the fourth international South Africa, and the worker's list parties. Three parties hope to bring women's interests to the fore. They are the Women's Rights Peace Party, the South African Women's Party, and a One Woman Party, the Keep It Straight and Simple Party, or KISS, for short, whose main thrust is the abolition of taxes.
