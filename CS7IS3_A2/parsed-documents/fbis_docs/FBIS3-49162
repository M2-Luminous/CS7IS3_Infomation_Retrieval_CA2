He said he considered 1993 to be a lost year because Slovakia lost its good initial position it had acquired after the 1992 elections. All of this was caused by the HZDS's (ruling Movement For a Democratic Slovakia) refusal to share power and decision-making after it won the elections. At that time, it was possible to create a broad coalition called for by President Michal Kovac in his New Year's address, Uhrik said. The fact that the HZDS (66 deputies in the 150-seat Slovak parliament) started to discuss coalition with the SNS (14 deputies) only last summer is an evidence of the failed policy of the party which had been refusing to share power for a year, Uhrik stated. The principles of cooperation between the two parties will have to be somewhat modified now. The SNS cannot play the role of a mere "tool in the electoral machinery" in the coalition, Uhrik concluded.
