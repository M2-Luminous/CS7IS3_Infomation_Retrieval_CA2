The government agrees to redivision of some of the planned spendings but it rejects attempts to hike the budget shortfall to a limit that will provoke heavy inflation, said Osis. The government bases its work on the two principal criteria, the priority of economic development and reforms, and the macroeconomic stabilization, the minister said. "If the increased budget deficit causes inflation and undermines the macroeconomic stability I will be the first to retire," Osis said. The government's resignation is inevitable then because it will not be able to follow the course of reforms in compliance with the distorted budget plan. On the other hand, there are no other political forces in Latvia that could set up a tenable government, Osis said. [passage omitted] The Latvian Saeima [parliament] is considering the budget plan in its current plenary session.
