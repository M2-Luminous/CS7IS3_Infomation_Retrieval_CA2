FR941012-0-00147 FR941012-0-00011 OSHA has added the requirement of retraining of employees demonstrating unsafe job performance based on practice in the industry. OSHA received comment that some employers who are providing training do require retraining where unsafe job performance is identified (Ex. 29). The proposed rule also contained minimum training elements that included recognition of safety hazards associated with the employee's particular work tasks and the protective and preventive measures to deal with those hazards; recognition and prevention of general safety hazards in the logging industry; and safe use and maintenance of any machine, equipment or tool used by an employee. One commenter agreed that training should list the hazards of each step of an employee's job and describe how these particular hazards could be controlled (Ex. 5&hyph;17). There were no comments opposing this provision. In the final rule, OSHA has added the requirement that employees be trained in the procedures, practices and requirements of the employer's work site in recognition of the number of comments who describe the logging industry as highly transient (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). While new employees may be experienced and well-trained in the recognition of hazards of the job and in the safe use of equipment of the trade, they may be unaware of the operating protocol of a particular establishment, such as how work activities are organized, or what system of signals is being used. OSHA has also added a provision in the final rule requiring that each employee be trained in the requirements of this section. OSHA believes it is important that employees know the various provisions of this section so they can actively participate in contributing to their own protection. This provision is included in other OSHA standards (e.g., 29 CFR 1910.132, 29 CFR 1910.146, 29 CFR 1910.1047). Paragraph (i)(4) of the final rule permits the employer to limit training of an employee due to unsafe job performance and for any employee assigned to new work tasks, tools, equipment, machines or vehicles to those content elements in paragraph (i)(3) that are relevant to the circumstances giving rise to the need for training. The proposed rule did not contain a similar provision. OSHA has added this provision to reduce the burden of the training requirement by allowing employers to focus the additional training on the elements necessary to prepare the employee to safely perform the job or operate a new piece of equipment. For example, OSHA is aware that an employee who is assigned to operate a new machine, may not need retraining in recognition of general hazards in the logging industry or the requirements of the logging standard. In paragraph (i)(5) of the final rule OSHA establishes certain exceptions to the training requirement. Current and new employees who have received training previously do not need to be retrained in those elements of paragraph (i)(3) for which they have received training. This paragraph also reinforces that each current and new employee must still receive training in those elements for which they have not previously been trained. Even though certain limited exceptions to the training requirements are allowed, this paragraph reinforces that the employer is responsible for ensuring that each current and new employee can properly and safely perform the work tasks and operate the tools, equipment, machines and vehicles used in their job. The proposed rule would have required new employees to be trained, regardless of whether they were experienced or had been trained previously, before initial assignment. The proposed standard also would have required each new and current employee to receive annual retraining. Several commenters were confused about who was required to be trained under the proposed rule and many commenters opposed retraining of previously trained workers (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;33, 5&hyph;35, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;43, 5&hyph;53; Tr. W1 63, OR 85). According to these commenters, employees move from employer to employer and requiring retraining of each new employee would be both duplicative and costly. As discussed above in the Major Issues section, OSHA has addressed the commenters' concerns by allowing previous training to be acceptable in lieu of new initial training for both current and new employees. In order to determine whether the training exception is applicable to a particular employee, the employer must first ascertain whether previous training has satisfied the training content requirements of paragraph (i)(3). Determining whether previous training meets the requirements of this section should not be difficult with regard to current employees. Employers can examine their training materials to ensure that each of the training content requirements has already been covered in training sessions. OSHA notes that each current and new employee will at least have to be trained in the requirements of this new standard. OSHA believes that many employers will provide training on the new final rule in the monthly safety and health meetings
