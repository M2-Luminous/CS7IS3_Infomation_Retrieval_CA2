However, according to Draskovic, no agreement was reached because the Socialists "rejected a compromise". Depos, as the leading parliamentary opposition party offered the SPS a compromise to the effect that a deputy of the democratic opposition of Serbia be appointed Assembly speaker, and in return it would give up not only the post of prime minister, but also all government ministries. As a sign of good will we offered to have two deputy speakers in the Assembly presidency. To reject the readiness of the largest opposition party to support the formation of a minority Socialist government in the name of national unity, while in exchange it would obtain only the post of the first among the equal in the Serbian Assembly, is the proof of the Socialists' utmost intolerance," Draskovic said.
