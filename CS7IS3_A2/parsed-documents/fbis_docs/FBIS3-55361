He met with the Saeima's [parliament] deputy chairman, Aivars Berkis, and with representatives from various fractions. The guest was mainly interested in the solution of the question of citizenship in Latvia. Mr. Berkis pointed out that the bill passed in its first reading is the basis of further work on the bill on citizenship which should ensure survival of the Latvian nation. At present, there are 1.7 million citizens in the Republic of Latvia. 79 per cent of them are Latvians. Max Van der Stoel pointed out that he understands the necessity of the use of such criteria for granting citizenship as the knowledge of the Latvian language and residence in Latvia within a certain number of years. According to Max Van der Stoel, Latvian citizenship should not be granted to people who, holding high posts, acted against Latvia's interests. However, he cannot understand the necessity of using the system of quotas. At the end of the talk, Mr. Berkis pointed out that it is impossible to form a two-community society in Latvia. Max Van der Stoel reminded that in the previous year, 10,000 representatives from other nationalities left Latvia and there is no reason for thinking that their number will increase in future.
