The Israeli newspaper HA'ARETZ reported that Peres wanted to meet 'Arafat in Cairo on Monday to put the peace talks back on track. "The atmosphere is not suitable for such a meeting," the PLO representative to Cairo, Sa'id Kamal, told AFP, referring to the February 25 mosque massacre in Hebron on the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Kamal criticized the UN Security Council, which has been in session for the last week, for "not adopting a resolution condemning Israel after the massacre." The proposed resolution condemning the massacre by an Israeli settler has been held up by a disagreement between the PLO and United States over a reference to Jerusalem and to an international presence in the occupied territories. HA'ARETZ said the call for an 'Arafat-Peres meeting was passed on to the Palestine Liberation Organisation in Tunis by Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias, who has been touring the Middle East. Peres said meanwhile that Israel was ready to respond to the Palestinian conditions for a resumption of the autonomy talks which were broken off in the wake of the mosque carnage. "We have no reason to oppose demands which can advance the peace process and calm the situation," he told Israeli radio. "We can for example agree to enlarge the ranks of the Palestinian police and to ban armed settlers from entering a Palestinian village under curfew," said Peres, who signed a security deal with 'Arafat in Cairo on February 9. 'Arafat was expected in the Egyptian capital later Sunday for talks with President Husni Mubarak on the Hebron massacre. He was also due to meet Nabil Sha'th, his political adviser, who travelled to Washington last week for talks with US Secretary of State Warren Christopher on the Palestinian demands, said Kamal. The PLO wants Jewish settlers in the Gaza Strip and West Bank to be disarmed after a settler shot dead dozens of Muslim worshipers in Hebron. It has also called for international protection and the dismantling of some Jewish settlements, notably Qiryat Arba' near Hebron, where mosque killer Barukh Goldstein lived, and settlements in the town centre. Peres told the US television network CNN on Saturday that Israel accepted Palestinian demands for security guarantees, including the presence of international observers, but the details would have to be discussed. He was in favour of "the presence of a temporary foreign or international group" in the territories. But Prime Minister 'Yitzhak Rabin has ruled out any armed observers saying the only international role in the territories would be to monitor how the Palestinians spend money from donor countries during autonomy.
