It also reveals a 0.2 percent improvement against April. In April, the indicator displayed a 0.1 percent fall in economic growth, a decrease of 0.3 points. Compared with May 1993, economic growth was 1.4 points higher. This latest development permits the conclusion that the west German economy has overcome the recession and will embark upon a path of growth in the summer. If the positive trend of the past few months continues, a 1.5 percent increase in the GNP should be achieved in 1994. May also appears a good month regarding the extent of the signs of improvement. All six individual growth figures given in the indicator have improved, most of them considerably. The structure of interest rates has again normalized following an uninterrupted fall since December 1990. In March, capital market interest rates were 0.36 percent points higher than short-term rates for three-month money deposits. After boosting exports in previous months, the positive economic signals now seem to be boosting domestic demand. In February, the processing industry registered a 2.3 percent increase in demand against January. In January, the construction industry enjoyed a veritable leap in demand as orders increased by over 10 percent compared with December, which in itself was quite a good month. Retail trade turnover, always a reliable indicator of private consumption in recent months, in February saw a 1-percent growth against January. In the meantime, the traffic lights of exports have settled on green. In February, foreign orders for the processing industries increased by 3.8 percent against January. The Institute for Economic Research's exports surveys for enterprises are becoming increasingly optimistic. In March, the number of enterprises expecting further improvement over the next three months leapt from 14.2 percent in February to 15.6 percent. The business climate in the processing industry also improved from minus 18.7 percent in February to minus 12.5 percent in March.
