This is undoubtedly to the credit of Ajar leader Aslan Abashidze, chairman of the Supreme Council of the autonomous republic. It appears that "Big Granddaddy," as Abashidze is called among his own people, is distinguished by a rare capacity for avoiding predetermined conflicts and shunning dangerous alliances and burdensome obligations. It is said that he knows how to make money and loves Ajaria, Russia, and his grandson. In addition, he knows how to "keep up his reputation." There are not that many meetings between the chairman of the Supreme Council of Ajaria and the head of the Georgian state, and they have all been held either on neutral territory or in Ajaria. [Imedashvili] Mr. Abashidze, when were you last in Tbilisi? [Abashidze] I have not been to Tbilisi since October 1990. I consider the situation in the country to be very unstable, and a visit by me could be used to inflame the atmosphere. These cannot be called apprehensions, I simply avoid needless complications.... [Imedashvili] According to the information of sociological polls, inhabitants of Georgia most often cite you as a possible successor to Shevardnadze. You are also spoken of as the most realistic candidate for the office of prime minister of the country. [Abashidze] It is not a new topic, but I believe that at this time I am needed by Georgia here more than in the office of prime minister. As far as the results of sociological surveys are concerned... We do not publish them in our newspapers. I am skeptical toward this information; a poll of some 1,000 persons is not serious. I personally know approximately what percentage of the population supports me in this part of Georgia or in another and, of course, in Ajaria. [Imedashvili] How many in Ajaria? [Abashidze] We know that the Ajar leadership has total support. [Imedashvili] There are stories to the effect that Ajaria has peacefully achieved full independence from Tbilisi, which Abkhazia and South Ossetia have not managed. How true is this? [Abashidze] As truthful as stories usually are. We sought nothing, and it cannot be said that we had some special program in this connection. As far as I am concerned, I have always, wherever I have worked, defended the interests of my department. I believe that everyone should defend his home, street, neighborhood, city. The legislative base that we used to have accorded the regions quite extensive rights--we have not taken advantage of even half of them. It is always the case that we say one thing, think another, and do something else. The main problem in the relations between the center and the regions today is not legislation, the problem is the government bureaucrat, who sits on a bench in Tbilisi and considers himself the sole arbiter of fate. It may be said that it was this that brought about what has happened in Georgia. Ajaria is not threatened by the fate of Abkhazia or the Tskhinvali region, our republic is populated by ethnic Georgians. But the opposition of the center and the regions, which exists at administrative officer level, could, of course, lead to cataclysms because there is always the danger of the accession to power of people who are totally uninhibited. [Imedashvili] You are satisfied with your relations with Tbilisi? [Abashidze] I cannot speak of a complete idyll here. It happens that some leader from Tbilisi will impede some decision or other, and jealousy is sensed at times. When a little man sits at a big table, it is always fraught with unpleasantness. [Imedashvili] Your view of the future territorial arrangement of Georgia? [Abashidze] The rayons and oblasts of Georgia took shape over many centuries. Territorially and ethnically, this is certain, there is nothing that could be changed--there would be fighting for each square meter. We are left merely with the question of imparting to this reality a reasonable form and of precisely delineating what pertains to the jurisdiction of the federal authorities, and what to the regional authorities. And under no circumstances can the nationality issue--Ossetian or Abkhaz--be substituted for this problem. [Imedashvili] You are the leader of the "For the Revival of Ajaria" movement, and its motto is: "A wealthy individual means a wealthy state." Are you a wealthy individual? [Abashidze] The richest people, as we all know, live in Georgia; everyone is a millionaire in Georgia (laughs). No, I am not avoiding an answer. Economically, our family lives well; there are no problems. The Abashidzes are not by nature squanderers but accumulators. I have worked my whole life and held quite high office and I was left a substantial inheritance--my grandfather was a notable individual--even in spite of the expropriation of 1937. Incidentally, the princely Abashidze family ruled Ajaria from 1462 through the end of the 19th Century. [Imedashvili] And as regards the "wealthy state?" [Abashidze] Just as throughout Georgia, the same problems: inflation, low living standard, decline in production. We are trying to the best of our ability to get the work of the enterprises back to normal and to help the population with social benefits. In general, I feel sorry for today's Georgia. It was created in order to be a prosperous country. Had we immediately created a free economic zone in Ajaria, Georgia would now be unrecognizable, but certain forces do not want this--to the detriment of the entire country. This is beyond any logic, but there are always some people who are afraid of new things and who are protesting even the building of a pedestrian subway. I have seen films about the old Hong Kong before the creation of a free economic zone there. Compared with that Hong Kong, Batumi is Paris. And had there been free economic zones in Batumi, Poti, Sukhumi, things might not have reached the point of explosion. When people live well, many problems are removed. When they live badly, there are always political forces that take advantage of this to assert themselves. [Imedashvili] Georgia is integrating in several alliances, among which are CIS and Black Sea economic cooperation. Which of them is most promising, in your view? [Abashidze] Friendship is an unparalleled value. We, figuratively speaking, went a-hunting and all went separately. Some people are the hunters, some, the prey. Georgia has fewer chances of procuring rich spoils than others, and for this reason we need to proceed together, having united on a new basis, on a platform of sincerity. Sincerity, sincerity, and yet again sincerity--this is my principle in all things. We need first and foremost good relations with Russia. We are interrelated and urgently need one another. Making friends with Russia does not mean falling out with the rest. On the contrary, stable relations with it will help us to more quickly begin cooperation with other countries. [Imedashvili] Is sincerity typical of your relations with Shevardnadze? [Abashidze] I have never concealed anything, I speak openly, harshly at times, too emotionally at times. There are words that I would not use at a grand forum, but I always say everything one on one. This is my main weapon. Life is easier if you don't harbor grudges. And you have more friends also. Don't they say that everyone strives for the pure spring? [Imedashvili] What do you do, aside from work? [Abashidze] Now, only work. This is my sole hobby. I have, in addition, a grandson, we are great friends. It is said that I have the capabilities of an artist, but I have no time for drawing. Life has been such that I have been unable to take advantage of what I was given from above. [Imedashvili] What have you managed to get done in the time that you have been leader of Ajaria? [Abashidze] We do not have hundreds of thousands of refugees or tens of thousands of people killed, disgraced, and destitute. We have preserved peace at home, we have not made a single mistake here. We have no nationality problem, no Abkhaz living in Ajaria has taken part in the interethnic conflict. What have I not achieved? I have not managed to school many officials in executive discipline. They cannot work at full stretch, they cannot learn to work in a team, everyone wants to be a soloist. Perhaps this is an ailment of people of the Caucasus, hot-blooded people....
