How has this happened? Our country supplies half of the contingent of Blue Helmets currently in Rwanda to help the implementation of the Arusha peace plan. However, the document does not please everybody and particularly not the supporters of the National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development (MRND), the former single party. Indeed, the latter have never completely abandoned their conviction that the best possible outcome to the war started in 1990 by the Rwandan Patriotic Front (FPR) guerrillas was a military victory which the government army had failed to secure. Thus any compromise required by the peace negotiations is seen, in these conservative ranks, as a concession to the enemy. Human Rights For instance, the conservatives do not like Brussels' insistence on reaffirming the duty to respect human rights, although these reminders have concerned all sides in the conflict. Similarly, they have often criticized Belgium for having withdrawn after one month the soldiers sent at the beginning of the war to ensure the evacuation of our fellow citizens who wanted to leave the country in October 1990, unlike the French who left their men until the Blue Helmets arrived last December. The French presence made it easier for the Rwandan Government Army to withstand the thrust of the FPR which, without that, "diplomatic circles say," would have reached Kigali by force of arms. Bitterness It is easy to see the bitterness which this inability to ensure a military victory for their ideas is creating in many MRND supporters for whom the FPR is synonymous with Tutsis which is synonymous with monarchy. It must be remembered that the FPR was created by Tutsi (the minority ethnic group) exiles in Uganda, although it now has in its ranks an unspecified number of Hutus, like its President Alexis Kanyerengwe. Moreover, since independence and the abolition of the monarchy "with Belgium's help," the country's past is seen in Rwanda as uniformly equal to what it had become in the last years of colonization: A feudal-type kingdom in which the Tutsi chiefs oppressed the Hutu peasants. As soon as the Blue Helmets arrived, the Belgians, who form half of them, were therefore the target of a campaign of denigration by Rwandan conservatives, especially since, in accordance with the peace plan, they escorted to Kigali an FPR battalion responsible for the protection of that party's future ministers.
