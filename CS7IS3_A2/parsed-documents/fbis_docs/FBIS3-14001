Sensing the National Front-Left combine's resolve not to support the resolution unless the United States was named in it, the ruling party sought the BJP's help in convincing recalcitrant parties to give up their demand. It was also agreed that since most parties had differed on how the Kashmir tangle should be handled, the proposed debate on the strife-torn state will be held later. The strongly-worded resolution, passed by both Houses of Parliament this afternoon, focused its attack mainly on Pakistan. Though there are oblique references to the Clinton Administration for its support to Pakistan, it has not been named. The resolution says: "Any attempt from any quarter to interfere in the internal affairs of India will be met resolutely." Sources said after yesterday's abortive attempt to convince the NF-Left combine not to insist on naming the United States in the resolution, the Speaker convened another meeting this morning in his Parliament chamber. The leader of the Opposition and senior BJP member, Mr. Atal Behari Vajpayee, along with Left party leaders, Mr. Indrajit Gupta, Mr. Chitta Basu and Mr. Saifuddin Chowdhury, were present at the meeting. The Union home minister, Mr. S.B. Chavan, and the parliamentary affairs minister, Mr. V.C. Shukla, were representing the government. Both Mr. Chavan and Mr. Shukla made it clear to Opposition leaders that the government was in no position to name the United States in the resolution. But Left party leaders stuck to their stand and argued that the Clinton government had been encouraging Pakistan by questioning not only India's human rights records in Kashmir but also its territorial integrity. Hence, without naming the United States, the resolution on Kashmir would be meaningless. But Mr. Vajpayee convinced the dissenting parties to agree to what the government was saying and not to question the wording of the resolution since its main objective was to convey a clear message to the world that Indian political parties, despite their differences, were firmly behind the government when its territorial integrity was at stake. He insisted that the main thrust of the resolution was to isolate Pakistan. "Instead of doing that should we waste time arguing whether the United States should also be named in the resolution?" He warned if Parliament failed to get the resolution passed unanimously it would only help Pakistan's gameplan and prove that even on such a vital issue, the Indian people were divided. This did the trick and Left leaders gave up their obstinate stand and decided not to insist on naming the United States. Mr. Chitta Basu said: "The argument put forward by Mr. Vajpayee convinced us and we decided not to press for naming the United States. We too felt that it is more important to get the resolution passed unanimously than exposing our differences." Despite the Left's decision to go along with the resolution, the CPI(M) [Communist Party of India-Marxist] general secretary, Mr. Harkishen Singh Surjeet, in a statement hit out at the government for failing to mention the United States in its Kashmir resolution. The statement said: "The resolution has failed to nail down the Clinton Administration which, under the guise of protecting human rights, is encouraging such activities for establishing its hegemony." Later, all members of Parliament, cut across the party lines in decrying Pakistan's continued support of terrorism in Kashmir. The resolution, moved in the Lok Sabha by the Speaker, Mr. Shivraj Patil, and in the Rajya Sabha by the Chairman, Mr. K.R. Narayanan, firmly said India had the capacity to counter all designs against its unity and integrity. *
