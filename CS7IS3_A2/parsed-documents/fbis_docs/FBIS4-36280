In this regard, he noted that our country has from the very beginning announced that it will abide by UN Security Council Resolution 924 which was issued on Wednesday [1 June]. In a telephone interview with Voice of America the day before yesterday, brother 'Abd-al-Ghani said the Republic of Yemen regrets the position of certain Arab states toward the situation in Yemen. He stressed that the statement issued at the conclusion of the meetings of the Gulf Cooperation Council foreign ministers is considered an interference in Yemeni internal affairs. 'Abd-al-Ghani praised the position adopted by the fraternal State of Qatar rejecting this statement that failed to mention the Yemeni unity, which was underlined by the UN Security Council resolution. In his interview with Voice of America, 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani strongly denied that the Yemeni Air Force planes have raided Aden refinery. He said such refineries are the property of the Yemeni people and the government cannot destroy its own installations. He also stressed that the forces of constitutional legitimacy are concerned not to attack any position close to any vital installation in the country. He stressed that the forces of constitutional legitimacy have always taken care not to hit Salah-al-Din Camp, which is adjacent to the refinery, despite the fact that devastating Scud missiles -- which left behind innocent victims and material damage in the civilian neighborhoods where they fell -- were being fired from that camp. He underlined the secessionist elements' responsibility in hitting the Aden refinery to create among the Yemeni people in Aden some kind of bitterness.
