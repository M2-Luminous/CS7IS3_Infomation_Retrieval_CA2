Jerath: "The Raphel Rhetoric; U.S. Line on Kashmir Might Spur New Strategic Alliance"] [Text] We must indeed thank Robin Raphel. Deliberately or inadvertently, she has given us a peep into her mind and forewarned us of the direction in which her thoughts are running and the shape she intends to give to U.S. policy on South Asia. Whatever the State Department may say now to defuse her bombshell, India cannot afford to ignore the signals coming loud and clear from her comments. She is, after all, the point person in Washington for South Asia. Moreover, she has a blank page on which to write and was hand-picked for the job by President Bill Clinton whom she knows personally. When a key person such as Raphel gives a backgrounder, her statements cannot be dismissed as off-the-cuff remarks and must be presumed to be inputs for a policy in the making, if not a part of official policy already. The most disturbing element in Raphel's statement questioning the validity of Kashmir's accession to India is that she has sought to give a quantitatively new dimension to the entire issue. She has chosen to revive a 1947 U.S. position, which held Jammu and Kashmir as disputed territory even before the United Nations put an international seal on it in 1948, thus taking the dispute beyond the confines of Indo-Pak rivalry over the state and the consequent threat of a nuclear war in the subcontinent which Washington has been touting as the reason for its excessive concern. In fact, Raphel's comments clearly hint at a direct U.S. interest in Kashmir which is not necessarily circumscribed by its policies on India and Pakistan. Washington's escalating interest in Kashmir must be seen in the context of its strategically sensitive location. It provides direct access into Tibet and consequently China. It is also contiguous with the Islamic Crescent with a border just 20 kilometres away from the Central Asian Republic of Tajikistan where the battle lines currently being drawn by the U.S., Russia and Iran to gain supremacy could change the destiny of the entire region. If the U.S. desire for a toehold in this area after the Second World War was primarily to contain Russia, today, its guns are trained on China and Iran. And Kashmir, with its unique position, has the potential of becoming a key factor in the new geopolitical strategy being fashioned in Washington to deal with the two nations the U.S. sees as major threats. It is worth noting that the U.S. was the first country to open an embassy in the Tajik Capital of Dushanbe. It is also significant that Raphel's present tour, said to be aimed at acquainting herself with South Asia, takes her to Dushanbe and Moscow after Dhaka, Islamabad and Kabul. To give Washington the benefit of the doubt when it says that Raphel's remarks are not a policy statement, it is true that the attempt to redraw the geopolitical map of the region by linking Kashmir to the Central Asian belt is merely one of the options being explored by strategists in the U.S. The Clinton administration's bewildering flip-flops on the Kashmir issue indicate that a policy has yet to be formulated. But the mounting pressures and the red herrings that pop up from time to time clearly suggest that the U.S. intends to keep its options on Kashmir open. By letting the cat out of the bag on the new thinking in Washington, Raphel may have done us a great favour. If, indeed, her statements do not yet constitute U.S. policy, India must move in before they do and firmly link Kashmir to its own survival as a modern, secular, market democracy. An independent Kashmir, subject to buffeting pressures in a region where ambitious powers are striving to carve out spheres of influence, cannot benefit anyone, neither India, nor Pakistan, nor even the Kashmiri people. One only has to look at Afghanistan to see the consequences of meddling in areas where dormant tribal affiliations can resurface with a vengeance in bloody ethnic strife. Has the world already forgotten the brutal onslaught on Kashmir by Waziri tribesmen from the North-West Frontier in September 1947 when the state was not under India's protective umbrella? Can Pakistan afford a sharpening of existing fissiparous tendencies in Baluchistan and the NWFP [North-West Frontier Province] once a free Kashmir which includes POK becomes a reality? As for India, the Kashmir question has never been so vital for its future. A second partition, once again on religious lines, fostered by Pakistan, could destroy the foundation of the Indian nation. An independent Kashmir is bound to raise a big question mark on the status of 120 million Muslims in the rest of India, making the bloody aftermath of the Ayodhya crisis look like a teddy bear's picnic. The trouble is that the perceptions of the Raphels of this world are shaped by shallow interactions on Delhi's cocktail circuit where flippant remarks pass off as studied analysis, and compounded by a decidedly grim situation on the ground in the Valley. Raphel is therefore not alone in believing that India has lost Kashmir, that it never was a part of the Indian maintream, that severing the state from the rest of the country will not have any economic, social or political consequences here. It is imperative for India to disabuse policy makers and strategists, not just in Washington but in other Western Capitals as well, of the fundamental fallacies in their perceptions without indulging in xenophobic hysteria or jingoism. The unanimous outburst here against Raphel's statements is a good beginning. The strong reactions Raphel has provoked send a more effective message than any official exchange. Unfortunately, Washington is too far away to understand the depth of feeling in India. There must be a follow-up to the protest. What is needed is a concerted strategy -- some "creative diplomacy," to use Washington's new catchword -- to hammer in some home truths to those who think they can resolve the problems of this region. Here again, the Clinton administration may have unwittingly helped us. In trying to extricate itself from the tight spot in which it finds itself thanks to Raphel, the State Department has trilateralised the Kashmir issue by including China-held parts of the state in its definition of disputed territory. Although there has been no reaction from Beijing yet on the controversy, China cannot but be aware of the implications for its security of Washington's formulations. Similarly, Iran, which considers itself a major player in a region which has opened up with demise of the Soviet Union, will be watching events here very closely. Quite clearly, the Clinton administration has ended up muddying the waters and if it is not careful, it may soon find that its ham-handed attempts to redraw the lines in this region will make allies of those it wants to see least in a strategic convergence -- India, China and Iran.
