The delegation consisted of President Radovan Karadzic and General Ratko Mladic, commander in chief of the armed forces. TANJUG learned of the meeting from its sources in the Serb republic. Also attending the meeting was General Michael Rose, commander of the blue helmets in Bosnia, . The topic of the talks was the question of the withdrawal of Serb forces from the 3-km zone around Gorazde, something which is being insisted upon by the Muslim side as a condition for participation in the Geneva conference. The continued presence of Serbs in the zone, as claimed by UN officials in Geneva is the reason for the fact that the Haris Silajdzic-led delegation failed to turn up for the opening of the conference on a comprehensive cease-fire, which had been scheduled to open today in Geneva. According to Serb republic sources, Karadzic and Gen. Rose should inform Akashi late this evening whether the Serbs have withdrawn, as Karadzic has promised. According to a statement of the Serb Republic Foreign Minister Buha given earlier this evening to TANJUG, there are prospects that the negotiations initiated by Akashi might nevertheless begin tomorrow. According to Buha, the Muslim delegation has arrived in Geneva and is having talks with the Croat delegation on the territorial division of the cantons in the newly-formed federation.
