There were no victims or substantial property damage. Iraultza, an extremist group not linked to ETA [Basque Fatherland and Liberty Orgainzation] and which usually attacks state organizations, claimed responsibility for the attack in a call to the newspaper EGIN, the traditional mouthpiece of this terrorist band. An official spokesman said that only the bomb's "primer," which was homemade and had been placed at the Consulate's entrance, exploded. According to Vice Consul Jose Miguel Arechavala, nine days ago a telephone call was made to the Consulate. The caller said he was calling on behalf of Iraultza. He threatened to plant a bomb to protest the Mexican Government's action in the armed conflict in Chiapas State. In recent days, demonstrations and rallies have been organized in several places of Spain to protest the actions of the Mexican Army in the insurrection of peasants and Indians in Chiapas.
