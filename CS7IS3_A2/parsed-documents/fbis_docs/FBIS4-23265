In a communique signed by its president, Ameh Ebute, a copy of which has reached AFP, the senate "decides to restore all democratic institutions" of Nigeria, "calls for the publication of the results of the June 12 election", and the "formation of a government of national unity and reconciliation...by the elected president." Moshood Abiola, the billionaire Yoruba Muslim, claims to have won the 12 June 1993 elections on the basis of official results published in each of the 30 states of the federation after the closure of polling stations, and collected by his supporters. These results were never officially published by the National Electoral Commission in Abuja, the federal capital, as stipulated by the Constitution. This is because the former administration of General Ibrahim Babangida said the elections were full of irregularities which, up to now, have not been proved. The Senate and all democratic institutions of Nigeria were dissolved on 18 November 1993 by General Abacha, 24 hours after his sudden takeover of power in the country.
