Some even seized the opportunity to advocate "Taiwan Independence." This phenomenon has aroused concern on and outside the island. In its 10 April editorial, Hong Kong's HSIN PAO said that Taiwan officials' criticism of mainland over the Qiandao Lake incident can be said to be unprecedented in recent years. Whether the Taiwan authorities will slow down development of cross-strait relations because of this incident is worth giving thought. Brief commentaries and column articles carried by the TAIWAN WORLD FORUM [shi jie lun tan bao 0013 3954 6158 1086 1032] said: As the Qiandao Lake boat tragedy is an isolated incident that has unfortunately taken place, it should be analyzed objectively and calmly so that its aftermath can best be dealt with and not to push the incident toward a political confrontation between the two sides of the strait. Its brief commentary pointed out: Cross-strait peace will benefit both sides; although the Qiandao Lake incident has grieved people, if it is to be viewed from the perspective of the state and the nationality as a whole, it virtually should not go to the extent of retrogressing the cross-strait relations that only serves to sadden our own people and gladden the enemy. Some Hong Kong and Taiwan media also criticized certain people on the island for capitalizing on the unfortunate incident to advance advocation of "Taiwan Independence," an act of self-deceiving "political morphine" that is doomed to fail.
