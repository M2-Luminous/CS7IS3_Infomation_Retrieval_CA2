Negotiating council Chairman Pravin Gordhan said he had received feedback that members of the alliance would appreciate an invitation requesting some kind of a response to the constitutional proposals. Mr. Gordhan said the council expected the alliance to respond to the invitation by early evening. The council is processing a package of constitutional concessions and amendments to secure the Freedom Alliance's participation in the election. The government and the ANC [African National Congress] earlier submitted their proposals to the negotiating council at Kempton Park. The Freedom Alliance did not attend the meeting at the World Trade Center.
