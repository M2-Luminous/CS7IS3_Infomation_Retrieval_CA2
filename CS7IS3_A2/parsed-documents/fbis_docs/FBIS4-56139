"Minister Baudys could not have said this. It is pure nonsense, a lie. If Mr.Baudys did say this then it is absolutely absurd and meaningless sentence," Klaus told journalists here. On Wednesday Baudys told CTK in Brussels that Pinochet's planned visit to the Czech Republic was not an official one, a visit "on a political level and a visit on the purely working and trade level." "It actually ensues from Klaus' visit who in Chile also spoke about mutual trade contacts. It is an exclusively working and commercial matter and it has no political background," he said. Neither the government nor any government official has talked about the visit or organized it," Klaus said. "I cannot therefore speak on behalf of the cabinet. This visit which is more or less a visit aimed at looking for orders for the Chilean army is a matter which does not directly concern the government at all, he added. Klaus pointed out that he did not see any reason for banning the sale of Czech armaments to Chile or Czech private firms' deals with Chile, which currently meets all democratic criteria.
