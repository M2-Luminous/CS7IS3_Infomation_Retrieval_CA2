"Incitement of local authorities not to put into application final court decisions as well as President Iliescu's refusal to give an explanation before Parliament are also violations of the Constitution and of the principles of democracy," according to Emil Constantinescu. As for the censure motion, the CDR front-ranker said that "it first of all aims to bring a normal terming to the dialogue between the government and the country's citizens." Asked about divergent opinions within the alliance, Emil Constantinescu and the representatives of other parties in the alliance admitted that "several divergent opinions are persisting within the convention" which prove, however, the democratic spirit of the alliance. While liberal Dinu Patriciu has drawn attention on the need for the convention "to become a homogeneous political party, a powerful decision-making structure" and a right-wing force, Civic Alliance Party front-ranker Emil Tocaci considered that tensions within the CDR have been magnified, for the convention "will further be a reality of the Romanian political life."
