SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, requires every agency to promulgate regulations implementing certain of its provisions. On October 1, 1989, the Office of Government Ethics, formerly part of the Office of Personnel Management, was established as a separate executive branch agency and is therefore proposing to adopt this rule incorporating many of its existing practices for the implementation of the Freedom of Information Act, as amended by the Freedom of Information Reform Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99&hyph;570). This rule would also implement the Guidelines for a uniform Freedom of Information Act fee schedule published by the Office of Management and Budget on March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) and the Attorney General's Memorandum on the 1986 Amendments to the Freedom of Information Act dated December, 1987. Subpart G of the rule proposes to establish a separate schedule of fees for the reproduction and mailing of public financial disclosure reports requested pursuant to section 105 of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, as amended.
