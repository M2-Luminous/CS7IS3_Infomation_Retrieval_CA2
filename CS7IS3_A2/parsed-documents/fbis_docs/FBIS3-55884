What Does Fate Have in Store for It? What is Best: A Good Council or a Strong Duma?"] [Text] The State Duma deputies who have reached Moscow after overcoming every conceivable obstacle in the fight for seats still do not suspect that the main battle is yet to come. Each of them will have to fit into the unwieldy structure of the Duma and satisfy their own personal ambitions at the same time. According to a plan existing at the Duma each deputy apart from the State Duma chairman, the deputy chairmen, and the chairmen of the factions, must be a member of one of its committees. In all it is planned to create 18 committees. However, this figure changed constantly while the plan was being worked out. Representatives of the president's side actively promoted the idea of forming no more than 10 committees within the Duma each of which would be in charge of several global spheres simultaneously. The present plan for the operation of the State Duma committees exactly reflects the structure of the executive branch of power (in the form of ministries and departments) which is designed to make it as easy as possible for parliament to perform its monitoring functions. Undoubtedly the authors of the plan for the internal organization of the Duma copied much from the parliament disbanded by the president. Let us recall here that in the bicameral Supreme Soviet there were just over 250 deputies working on a permanent basis in 19 committees and eight standing commissions. These committees and commissions performed the functions of a primary filter carrying out the preliminary examination of draft laws. Similar functions will be inherited by the 18 committees of the State Duma. Furthermore, even the names of the committees have been changed only slightly. The really striking innovations are not very important: Now, for example, questions of constitutional legislation and human rights have been transferred to one committee (and not two as in the former Supreme Soviet). On the other hand two new committees have appeared: one on the budget and taxes, the other on banks, credit, and money circulation. The new structure does not have a committee on the mass media but does have a committee on the organization of the work of the State Duma. It is still not clear which principles will determine how deputies will be distributed among the committees. The factions' opinions vary on this score: Some think that the sole guiding principle should be the professional training of Duma members (but what about "Yabloko," for example, which has four specialists in foreign affairs): Others insist that you should only take into account the personal preference of the deputy himself (however, apparatchiks of the former Supreme Soviet still recall that out of the 1041 deputies in the former parliament 700 were registered with the committee for international relations). "Russia's Choice," "Yabloko," and the Party of Russian Unity and Accord have put forward their own approaches: Namely, to form committees on the principle of the proportional representation of the factions and independent deputies. The points system for evaluating posts in the Duma has been constructed according to this plan: The post of State Duma chairman is rated at five points, the deputy chairman at three points, the chairman of the tellers commission at two points, a committee chairman at one point, and his deputy at 0.5 points. According to the author of this plan, each faction and deputies' group will receive a strictly defined number of points depending on the percentage of their representatives in the Duma. The pro-president side is also proposing a voting mechanism based on that idea -- the State Duma approves a list of committee chairmen and up to two deputies. Only after that is the composition of the committees as a whole approved. It is already obvious now that the struggle for the posts of the chairmen of two of the 18 Duma committees -- defense and international relations -- will be the most keenly fought. The activity of these committees, given that the powers conferred on them (the defense policy of the Russian Federation and the ratification and denunciation of Russia's international treaties) will have the greatest impact including for the president. Incidentally, the posts of chairmen of those two committees are being regarded as on a par with the speaker of the lower chamber of parliament. V. Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR], is definitely competing for the post of chairman of the international relations committee and with an ulterior motive. Quite a few lances have been broken over the question of the Duma's leading organ. There have been different suggestions both for the actual title (presidium, conference, or council) and the mechanism for the formation of this organ. (Let me remind you here that the presidium of the former Supreme Soviet was formed from the chairman of the Supreme Soviet, his four deputies, and the chairmen of the two chambers, of the committees, and of the commissions as ex officio members). It is planned to form the Duma council from the speaker, the deputy speakers (ranging in number from two to five), and representatives of the factions on the principle of proportionality. However, it is proposed that the chairmen of the committees will only be given a consultative vote. Many factions tend to see the Duma council as a powerful link in the internal structure of the lower chamber. Deputies have a legitimate interest in the solution of the question of the right to freely change factions within the Duma. The "Russia's Choice" deputies are unambiguously insisting on "feudal law" although they will surely hardly be able to enforce such a "political loyalty" -- the resistance of the communists, agrarians, and the LDPR is too great. Incidentally, it is quite likely that another faction, the ninth so far, will soon appear in the Duma under the leadership of Sergey Baburin, the independent deputy from Omsk. For that to happen he needs to unite at least 14 like-minded deputies around himself. It only remains to be added that all the proposals on the organization of the Duma must unfailingly be approved by the deputies.
