Nobuo Matsunaga, a veteran diplomat with extensive ties in Washington, has arranged several rounds of informal talks with senior officials in the Clinton administration during his stay here throughout the week. The appointments include meetings with trade representative Mickey Kantor, Robert Rubin, head of the White House National Economic Council, and presidential National Security Adviser Tony Lake. Matsunaga began his round of calls after arriving in Washington on Wednesday with a meeting with Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs Joan Spero. He said after emerging from his visit to Spero that they had only a "general discussion" on bilateral relations. There was no discussion on the stalled "framework" trade talks between the two countries, he said. State Department officials also said Matsunaga and Spero had a broad discussion of bilateral ties. Matsunaga "didn't bring any specific message from Japan," a State Department official said. Matsunaga's trip to Washington came after Japan and the United States set up a meeting between Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and Kantor for next week in Morocco. Tokyo has urged Washington to resume the stalled framework talks, which have become a focal point of escalating tension in bilateral trade ties. After the trade talks ruptured on February 11 at a summit between Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton, Washington reinstated the "Super 301" trade law provision which gives the U.S. Government broad authority to impose sanctions on countries accused of practicing unfair trade. The Japanese Government last week offered a new package of market-opening measures, but Kantor rejected the proposals as of "little substance." Earlier this week, the U.S. Government turned up the heat by putting Japan on top of a list of countries accused of maintaining significant trade barriers against U.S. products.
