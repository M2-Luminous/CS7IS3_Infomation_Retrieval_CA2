In an interview with ITAR-TASS, Livshits said that the main task facing the team is to analyse the effects of the economic policy, which was ignored by former First Deputy Prime Minister Yegor Gaydar. Experts will try to anticipate events by analysing possible negative consequences of proposed decisions and measures. Like Gaydar, Livshits is a determined monetarist. His thesis on the theoretical principles of "Reaganomics" won him a degree of doctor of economics. In 1990 he wrote "introduction to a market economy", the first textbook of the kind in Russia. Before his transfer to the presidential analytical centre two years ago, Livshits headed the department of economic theory at the Moscow Machine Tool Engineering Institute. Observers believe that Livshits will become the president's eye to monitor the pace of reform in Russia. Livshits plans to work in close cooperation with Sergey Glazyev who heads the State duma committee for economic policy. He said the deputies welcomed Yeltsin's state-of-the-nation address. This provides a good basis for joint work of two branches of power in the economic sphere, Livshits said.
