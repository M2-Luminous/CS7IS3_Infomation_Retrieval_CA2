Speaking on the topic "foreign policy agenda of Pakistan", at the round-table with the government organised by the economists conferences, at a local hotel, he said, "it is our considered opinion that India will not succeed in crushing the Kashmiri freedom struggle". "This is the lesson of history, even recent history", he said, adding, "India is unlikely to be able to promote a viable internal political process in Kashmir. There is total alienation with Indian rule. The Kashmiri people want only freedom, Azadi", he said. Pakistan, he said, believed that United States and its Western allies, as well as China, Russia and Japan, could play a critical role in promoting peace and security in South Asia. He said, the United States enjoyed considerable influence with both India and Pakistan. "This can be used to convince New Delhi that in the emerging era, the path to greatness does not lie through the accumulation of arms or nuclear weapons or missile capability but through economic and social progress and modernisation", he stated. He said, the past experience indicated that Pakistan and India would be able to resolve their mutual disputes only with the intercession of a third party. "Therefore, we welcome the recent proposal of the United Stated to promote multilateral talks on South Asian security. These talks will deal with the inter-related problems of non-proliferation, conventional arms, and development of weapons of mass destruction", he added. In the emerging era of international relations Sardar Asif said, Pakistan was faced with a series of challenges. But, it was also offered a number of opportunities. "With wisdom, patience, hard work and with the help of our friends, Pakistan can overcome the challenges and seize the opportunities", he said. Elaborating the challenges, he said, these were mostly the legacy of the past of the colonial and cold-war eras. Continuing, Sardar Asif said, "we are now entering into a new phase where Pakistan and the United States have agreed to develop their relationship despite the Pressler law which both governments have recognised as bad law and worse policy". "A new cooperative engagement between Pakistan and the United States was agreed during the recent visit of the Deputy Secretary of Sate Talbott to Islamabad", he said. About Sino-Pak relations, he said, despite strategic changes, "these remain firm and unchangeable". "Both countries are continuing to cooperate in a number of areas, encompassing economic, commercial and defence. Chinese trade and economic cooperation can in future be promoted through Pakistan with other countries in Central Asia, West Asia and South Asia. If peace can be established between Pakistan and India and in Afghanistan, exciting possibilities could be created for economic cooperation among the countries of these adjacent regions. This would open massive markets and unleash enormous potential for production and consumption", he maintained. The emergence of independent states in Central Asia, he said, was a decisive and historic watershed. "It ushered in a new era for a vast region stretching from the Aral to the Arabian Sea. We rejoice at the return to history and at the rich prospects of reviving our common traditional and cultural heritage. But the fundamental fact is that these newly-independent states are all landlocked. Their future progress and prosperity will, in large measure, depend on the exploitation of the shortest access to regions beyond. The ending of their isolation has only heightened their quest for alternative routes to the rest of the world. Central Asia needs to sell its surplus energy including gas and oil to the voracious markets in East Asia. We ourselves can benefit from these resources. Pipelines to our coast can provide the most economical route", he stated. The shortest route to the sea for Central Asia is through Pakistan, he said, adding: "We offer the most convenient transit facilities for their exports to other markets. He said, there existed the requisite road and railway systems that could be extended to Central Asia. "Then, there are port facilities we can share with them. In reverse, our port city of Karachi has a vibrant commercial sector and can provide an ideal launching pad for the commercial operations of multinationals in Central Asia. About Afghanistan, he said, it would always be vital to any strategic access to Central Asia. "In Afghanistan, the fruits of a heroic victory have been lost to parochial ambition. Instability in Afghanistan has direct implications for Pakistan, among other things, in the shape of drug smuggling and banditry on our borders". Pakistan, he said, was engaged in an active process of rebuilding peace in Afghanistan. "A durable solution can only be achieved through compromise among the Afghans themselves. "We hope to present some ideas to the Afghan leaders in the near future", he said, adding, Pakistan remained hopeful of success. [quotation marks as published] "However, as in Kashmir, so also in Afghanistan there is an opportunity waiting to be grasped within a crisis that requires urgent solution. It should be remembered that there is relative peace in many parts of Afghanistan. With some courage and imagination, trade between Pakistan and Central Asia can be commenced through the southern route traversing Kandhar and Herat. New opportunities for trade, and more credible hope of receiving international assistance, can help to convince Afghan leaders that there is a greater premium in commerce than in further fighting", he added.
