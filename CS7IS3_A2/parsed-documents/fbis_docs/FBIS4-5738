It is not that the enforcement of this policy has been carried out without a hitch. Questions have arisen: What is the growing role of the militia force as youths are now allowed to perform their military service locally in militia detachments? Will this policy have any impact on annual military conscription criteria? How will operating funds be guaranteed? These worries and questions have been gradually ironed out and redressed. The cadre-related task must be tackled first. All the comrades selected must be those having a high sense of responsibility and good skills in management and military training. The contingent of instructors is reported to have been reinforced by district military affairs agencies with officers who have good training experience. Thanks to satisfactory didactical propaganda, 100 percent of the local youths of military age have volunteered to apply for joining local militia units. This policy has won sympathy and support from the people and from the families of the youths concerned. After two months of training, trainees will be equipped with political, technical, and combat tactics-related knowledge equivalent to the level required from a new recruit. In addition to their basic training program, trainees will also study local economic development tasks, experiences on the carrying out family economies, and stock-breeding and crop cultivation techniques. In order to ensure room and board facilities and every-day life during the training course, various militia units have successfully carried out the motto "Localities, families, and individuals care together." Apart from the assistance provided by the localities concerned, the families of the youths concerned and their parent militia units have devised plans to do economic businesses for self-sufficiency purposes such as accepting contracts for tree planting, forestry protection, stock-breeding, and farmland irrigation services. After one year of implementation, although there remains a number of newly-arising problems to be resolved, the qualities of the local militia force have improved noticeably. Public security and social order and safety in various localities have been firmly maintained and social vices have been gradually dispelled. Trainees have familiarized themselves with the collective life and have been equipped with a military bearing. Each member of militia detachments has become a positive factor of their relevant localities and families in complying with party policies, state law, and other regulations of the localities concerned.
