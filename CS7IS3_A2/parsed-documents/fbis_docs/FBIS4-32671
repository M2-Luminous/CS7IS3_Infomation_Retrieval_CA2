The local Serb army command reported Moslem troop movements along most lines of separation, which is another proof that forces loyal to Moslem hardliner Alija Izetbegovic do not care for a ceasefire. In the northeast, Moslem troops are keeping up a continuous stream of attacks on the serb positions near Doboj and on Mt Ozren in violation of the latest truce, which came into effect on June 10. Moslem commander Rasim Delic said last week that his troops were waging an offensive war, prompting Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic to warn on Saturday that the Serbs would launch a counter-offensive if the Moslem attacks continued. "I am alarmed that this upsurge in fighting threatens the prospects for reaching a comprehensive cessation of hostilities and undermines efforts already under way to broker an overall political settlement," U.N. Special Envoy to Former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi said in Sarajevo before leaving for a meeting at NATO headquarters in Brussels. U.N. commander for Bosnia-Herzegovina, General Sir Michael Rose, said before leaving for Brussels on Tuesday that the Moslem side "is the one that has been most hostile to the peace process and constantly breaching the ceasefire." "The danger is that they will provoke a massive Serb response," Rose added. Akashi and Rose will discuss with NATO leaders possibilities for coordinated U.N. and NATO action in case of both acceptance and refusal of an international peace offer by the Bosnian belligerents, Reuters said.
