FR940217-1-00020 FR940217-1-00005 5. Other Information Paragraph (b)(4) of the reproposed rule has been added to the identification requirements to assure that the Commission has the authority to obtain, from time to time, other descriptive or clarifying information regarding accounts, or transactions effected through accounts, identified on Form 13H. This new paragraph would provide the Commission with the express authority to obtain other information from large traders that is not otherwise disclosed on Form 13H and may be crucial for understanding or analyzing information collected through the system. The Commission believes that the reproposed rule would not be unduly burdensome and would assure that the Form 13H filing requirements accomplish the objectives of the Market Reform Act. C. Recordkeeping Requirements for Brokers and Dealers Section 13(h)(2) of the Exchange Act authorizes the Commission to prescribe recordkeeping requirements for large trader activity that it deems necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act. 46 The Commission also is authorized to conduct reasonable periodic, special, or other examinations of all records required to be made and kept pursuant to the Rule. 47 Paragraph (d) of the reproposed rule would implement the recordkeeping provisions of section 13(h)(2) of the Exchange Act. 46 See 15 U.S.C. 78m(h)(2) (1990). 47 See 15 U.S.C. 78m(h)(4) (1990). 1. General Requirements The general recordkeeping requirements, which contain minor changes from the proposed rule, 48 would provide that every registered broker-dealer that carries accounts for itself or others shall make and keep records of transactions effected directly or indirectly by or through such broker or dealer for all large traders. In addition, as specifically authorized by the Market Reform Act, the reproposed rule also would require that broker-dealers keep records of transactions for each person such broker or dealer knows or has reason to know is a large trader based on transactions effected by or through such broker or dealer. Further, paragraph (d)(4) of the reproposed rule would provide that such records shall be kept for a period of three years, the first two in an accessible place, in accordance with Rule 17a-4(b) under the Exchange Act. 49 48 See Proposing Release, 56 FR 42560 (proposed text). 49 17 CFR 240.17a-4(b). The reproposed rule would explicitly provide that only registered broker-dealers that carry accounts for themselves or others would be affected. The term ``registered broker-dealer'' is defined in Section 3(a)(48) of the Exchange Act as a broker or dealer registered or required to be registered pursuant to Section 15 or 15B of the Exchange Act. 50 Executing broker-dealers and prime brokers that do not carry large trader accounts would not be subject to the recordkeeping requirements of paragraph (d) of the reproposed rule, notwithstanding that these persons may perform other specific tasks for large traders and may be large traders. The Commission believes that these modifications would clarify the applicability of the general recordkeeping requirements of the reproposed rule. 50 See 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(48) (1988).
