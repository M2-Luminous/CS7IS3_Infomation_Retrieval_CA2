For Palestinians, the agreement on Israeli withdrawal from Gaza Strip and Jericho and self-rule was far less than their minimum aspirations, and it drew mixed reaction from PLO officials. Although people's reaction in general has been cautious, the overall response of many Palestinians was negative. Supporters of the agreement said that when implemented, the initial impact of the harshness of the text would be softened. This was contested by other PLO officials who said that the negative elements of the Cairo agreement would be revealed upon implementation. They said since many issues have been left for further negotiation, as was the case of the Oslo agreement, it meant the door may be left open for Israel to renege on implementation as it sees. Both supporters and opponents of the Cairo deal agreed that like the Oslo agreement, many pitfalls and ambiguities shrouded many of the articles, particularly security issues, despite the immensely detailed security procedures at border crossings. However, supporters said Palestinians had improved many of the Oslo accord's conditions, and Israel has conceded on security issues and on Palestinians' role on border crossings despite the Israeli army's opposition. "We have made many concessions in the Oslo agreement, but since everything is relevant, we believe we have improved many of the conditions stated in the Declaration of Principles," said a PLO negotiator. A Tunis-based PLO official, who negotiated the implementation agreement in Davos, Switzerland, and Cairo said the accord was supposed to have been signed in Davos, but the Israeli army's opposition had dissuaded Israeli Prime Minister Yithzaq Rabin. "The army felt that this agreement penetrated the strong Israeli security wall by giving Palestinians some control on border crossings. Strategically, it means a great deal for the army when they recognise the fact that they have to share security control with the Palestinian authority," he said. He added that the initial Israeli position was to post a Palestinian flag on crossings, but it was changed into accepting the raising the flag on the building itself. "This means recognising Palestinians' authority on the entrances to Palestine." PLO negotiators felt satisfied with most of the agreement despite the fact that many issues remained to be negotiated. They said negotiations with the Israeli delegation were a very difficult battle. "In practice, we were negotiating with three Israeli delegations -- the army who were the hardliners, (Foreign Minister Shimon) Peres the moderate, and (Prime Minister Yithzaq) Rabin, who was less hardline than his army generals," a PLO negotiator said. The PLO leadership was concerned that the delay in the implementation of the Sept. 13 accord was eroding support for it among Palestinians and it would only have drawn more divisions and bloodshed in the occupied territories. Initialing the agreement, they argued, would give internal momentum for the negotiations on implementation of the Oslo accord. Some Palestinians argued that the PLO leadership had conceded a lot to Israel in order to sign the agreement. Executive Committee member Sulayman al-Najjab, however, considered the Cairo agreement "dangerous" saying it included many loopholes and PLO concessions. What has been accepted in Cairo was redeployment of Israeli troops rather than withdrawal since Israel has been given control over areas surrounding Jewish settlements much bigger than the size of settlements, he said. "The agreement has given Israel all its wants regarding security issues, and nothing for Palestinians. Israel has also been given control of a number of roads connecting Jewish settlements which divide the Gaza Strip," Mr. al-Najjab said. "We are very worried about the possibility that Israel might choose to accept only its own reading of the Cairo agreement...we are concerned, over some articles which indicate the continuation of occupation instead of its gradual removal as stated in U.N. Security Council Resolution 242," Mr. al-Najjab said. But chief Palestinian negotiator Faysal al-Husayni, who took part in the negotiations, defended the agreement saying that both the Oslo and Cairo agreements were only a step that would ultimately lead to independence and a Palestinian state. "Unfortunately, people cannot still distinguish between an interim period, which we are negotiating, and the final status," Mr. al-Husayni said. "We are talking about an interim period, during which final status negotiations will start, which means we will be moving from one stage to another, and it also means we will not be able to end occupation completely and at once during the interim stage," he argued. "However, when we reach final status, it will be the period of independence and statehood." "I think this agreement includes elements that would enable us gradually to achieve independence because it paves the way for Israeli withdrawal and redeployment from densely Palestinian populated areas," he said. Other PLO officials called for guarantees that ensure the implementation of the agreement. PLO official Nabil 'Amr, a supporter of the Sept. 13 accord but who calls for democratisation and political reforms in the PLO, said the Cairo agreement offers Israel the upper hand and right to be the effective reference point for all decisions. He said the need to break the deadlock reached in negotiations should not mean ignoring the pitfalls which would challenge the PLO's ability to implement what it signed. "It seems that the need to sign the agreement after the series of unsuccessful attempts since September evidently led to a failure to include the necessary guarantees for a scheduled implementation," Mr. 'Amr said. He said the PLO leadership should start working on securing such guarantees in order to ensure better conditions during the interim and final periods. Some senior members of the Palestine Liberation Army (PLA), who, for months, have been preparing to enter Gaza and Jericho and to control security there, disapproved the Cairo agreement and felt great disappointment. "We have no real role in security affairs or management of Jericho and Gaza Strip," said a senior PLA officer. "We were told we would enter the self-rule areas and be in full control, or at least have a big say in our own security affairs, but it seems Israel will not only maintain overall security but also manage all the details." They were referring to such issues as stated in the text of the accord as having a policeman armed with a handgun at the border crossings and total subordination to Israeli security concerns as mentioned in many of the articles concerning border crossings. Some residents of the West Bank and Gaza Strip visiting Jordan said they were gravely concerned over the possibility that they would be more humiliated and harassed by having to go through three checking areas while crossing rather than just two. "Now we go through the Israeli and Jordanian checking points. According to the new agreement, we will be passing through an additional Palestinian checking point," one West Bank resident said. He said Palestinians feel terrified and humiliated by Israeli measures while crossing the bridge. "Under the excuse of security, Israel will refrain from improving these measures." Palestinians crossing into Jordan have complained of harassment by Israeli security officers at the crossings, and humiliating body searches. The details of crossing procedures in the Cairo agreement have frightened them more. They feel there will be added security measures which will exhaust them instead of preserving their dignity. Both Mr. al-Najjab and Mr. 'Amr criticised the PLO's negotiating strategy which led to the loopholes in the Oslo and Cairo agreements. They called on the PLO leadership to clearly define and reconsider its negotiating strategy in order to improve the Palestinian position in peace talks and to avoid surprises. Mr. al-Najjab, upset that PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat signed the Cairo agreement before presenting it to the Executive Committee for approval, also criticised the PLO leader for downgrading his position and accepting to negotiate with Mr. Peres, the foreign minister, as his equal. 'Arafat has accepted the role of the head of Palestinian delegation in the PLO-Israeli liaison committee instead of Mahmud 'Abbas (Abu-Mazin). This gives Israel the right to demand that Palestinians return to a higher reference than 'Arafat for final decision...this weakens the Palestinians' negotiating position," Mr. al-Najjab said. He said Palestinians were worried that if such concessions were repeated, the PLO leadership would lead the people to further "dangerous pitfalls" because the leadership has been acting without being accountable to any side.
