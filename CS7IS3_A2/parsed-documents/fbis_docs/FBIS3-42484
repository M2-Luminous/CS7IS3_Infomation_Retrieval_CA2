Gromov, Russian Federation Navy Commander-in-Chief; this article is published in its entirety in the first issue of MORSKOY SBORNIK for 1994: "Summarizing the Results of the Past Year and Looking at Next Year"] [Text] Owing to fundamental changes in the domestic and foreign policy of the world's leading countries and expansion of their political and economic cooperation, the modern military-political situation is characterized by a decrease in the probability of nuclear missile war, as well as of a major armed collision involving conventional weapons. At the same time the danger of military conflicts remains in certain regions of the world and on Russia's southern borders, including in territories of former Soviet republics. This danger has economic, social, political and religious roots. With regard for the present trends in the development of the military-political situation, the leading states of the West and the East are reexamining their foreign policy goals, their international obligations and their military doctrine and strategy. Emphasis is being laid in this case mainly on providing for regional security and preventing crises in different regions, with a special role being reserved for naval forces and deep reexamination of the concepts of their development and use. The Russian Navy is fully involved in this process as well. The missions of the fleets in peace and in war have been refined, the effective combat strength and numerical strength of the Navy are being decreased, new forms of manning the fleets with highly professional personnel are being developed, and a complex of measures to improve the organizational structure of large strategic formations and combined units and to create new elements of their basing in the country's territory are being implemented. Much work has been done to substantiate the future development of both the Navy as a whole and its component services. Views on operational use and training of the fleets have changed significantly. The extent of the measures, their succession and their deadlines have been updated. Their actual implementation will depend to a significant degree on stabilization of the economy and of budget appropriations for development of the Navy. Measures of trust between the navies of Russia and other countries continue to strengthen. Evidence of this can be found in reciprocal visits and joint exercises at sea. Last year detachments of our ships visited ports in the United States, Canada, Great Britain, China, France, Norway, Germany, Denmark, Turkey and South Korea. Joint tactical exercises, some involving combat drills employing practice weapons, were conducted with the navies of Canada, the United States and Great Britain. Not only did these cruises have political significance, but they also promoted further improvement of the naval skills of the crews of our ships. The tasks assigned to the Navy for 1993 have generally been completed. In the complex conditions of the Navy's reorganization and limited financing, we were able to preserve the existing combat readiness of the principal large strategic formations and combined units of the fleets, and their capability for promptly switching from a peacetime to a wartime footing in organized fashion, and carrying out their main operational missions within set time. Despite the difficulties associated with manning the crews and maintaining the technical readiness of the ships, the intensity and effectiveness of their combat service and alert duty have risen somewhat. Strategic missile submarines patrolled their designated areas and maintained alert duty at their bases, ready to carry out their missions. General-purpose forces supported their ability to stand up in combat and monitored the reconnaissance activities of foreign navies. Ships of the Pacific Fleet successfully carried out their missions in coordination with multinational forces in the Persian Gulf, demonstrating Russia's support to United Nations sanctions against Iraq, while part of the Black Sea Fleet forces provided assistance to Georgia in stabilizing the situation in Poti. Measures of operational, mobilizational and combat training were conducted more intensively last year. In them, the practical skills of the command and staffs in controlling the forces, and the means of operational use of forces in combined-arms and strategic operations to repel an aerospace invasion by an adversary were honed. Command-and-staff exercises on maps, and joint command-and-staff and staff training exercises conducted without the participation of designated forces were the principal forms of operational and mobilizational training. This made it possible to maintain and improve the practical skills of commanders and staffs at the operational level to control the forces, but at the same time it reduced the number of sea cruises by ships and flights by aviation, which had a negative effect on the proficiency of naval and air units. Combat training in the naval forces went generally according to plan in 1993--intensively and rhythmically. The best results were attained by the Northern Fleet, the large strategic formations and combined units under the command of captains 1st Rank S. Simenenko, V. Shchegolev, V. Krikunov and N. Temerev, and submarines under the command of captains 1st Rank V. Zakharov and A. Yefanov and Captain 2d Rank V. Kvasov. At the same time we were unable to achieve noticeable improvement in combat training. Training and exercises were conducted in certain combined units and units at a low organizational and methodological level, and they failed to provide for full, high-quality work on specific functional responsibilities of maintaining the high combat readiness of subordinated forces and their effective execution of combat training missions. Little attention was devoted to finding and mastering new tactics for the forces. Training was often dominated by passive forms, without the use of shore-based trainers and classrooms. The necessary measures to intensify combat training by improving the procedures of exercises, drills and training were not implemented. Given the acute shortage of fuel and reduction of allocated engine life, stiffer requirements should have been imposed on the planning of tasks carried out by ships at sea. Every ship cruise should have been utilized with maximum effectiveness, with mutual support among different component services in practicing the missions for which they are intended, and with integrated use of weapons. But these requirements have not yet become a mandatory norm in all fleets. Naval Aviation successfully embarked upon mastering the Su-27k deck-landing fighter in 1993, completing its tasks of combat service with high indicators. Air Force units of the Northern Fleet commanded by colonels I. Bokhonko and N. Levchenko may be mentioned as having done well. Reasonable results were attained by ASW [antisubmarine warfare] personnel of the Air Forces of the Pacific Fleet headed by colonels V. Udarov and A. Akhmeddyanov, and of the Baltic Fleet Air Forces commanded by Colonel N. Somov. The Navy's shore-based forces successfully mastered new means of combat and prepared themselves for actions as elements of a combined air and sea attack echelon of an assault force, and for defense of important naval objectives and of portions of the seacoast accessible to assault forces, in coordination with other naval forces and combined ground troop units. Despite objective difficulties associated with having the troops carry out missions atypical of them and the great shortage of personnel, the combat training plans were basically fulfilled in all combined units and units. Combat training proceeded intensively and at a high level of quality in the combined naval infantry unit under the command of Colonel A. Smolyak. Good results were attained by gunners under the leadership of Colonel M. Kumshatskiy and by naval infantry under the command of Major V. Novikov. Missilemen under the leadership of colonels A. Zabavin and S. Kazachukhin successfully completed all combat exercises. Combat training was poorer in the combined unit under the command of Colonel Ye. Kocheshkov, in which mistakes in organizational work by officers were the cause of insufficient preparedness of command and control elements and of poor fire skills of the personnel. On the whole, last year the objectives of operational, mobilizational and combat training were reached with better quality in the Northern Fleet. Unsolved problems in ship repair, in the repair of utilities and communication networks, and in supporting bases with technical resources, some of which are beyond their useful life, obsolete and worn out, also had a negative effect on fleet training progress. Equipment failure still remains high aboard ships and vessels of the fleet. In this case around 60 percent of the total failures are technical ones having the following as their principal causes: poor work organization, weak special training of personnel, and failure to fulfill requirements of the leadership and operating instructions. The quality of technical maintenance and preparation of ships for sea cruises remains low, personnel continue to violate fire and explosion safety requirements during potentially dangerous work, and inspections of ship hulls, fittings and systems by permanent ship commissions are poor in certain combined units. The role of staff specialists in providing for and maintaining the technical readiness of ships has been diminished in the fleets. Requirements on them in carrying out routine scheduled inspections are relaxed, and measures to eliminate faults and raise the level of repair training of the personnel are not being implemented promptly. The internal resources of combined units and ships for carrying out high quality planned preventive repairs and inspections are not being utilized fully. The Pacific Fleet combined unit under the command of Rear Admiral A. Klimenok was the most unfavorable last year in terms of equipment failure. The rate of equipment failures associated with ship control did not decrease. In this case half of the incidents of this sort occurred in the Black Sea Fleet. The morale of naval personnel is evaluated as stable. While the situation aboard ships and in the units is being monitored and is under control, it remains complex. Despite unfavorable trends, most military collectives are distinguished by proper observance of regulations, good organization, and healthy cohesiveness of all categories of servicemen, which is generally making it possible to successfully carry out missions and maintain the fighting capability of fleet forces. This was promoted in many ways by the personal example set by the absolute majority of commanders and chiefs in fulfillment of their official and military duty, by certification of officer personnel, and by initiation of the transition to contract service. A lack of concreteness in efforts to implement measures of social and legal protection of servicemen is a serious shortcoming in the organizational and educational activities of commanders, staffs and elements in work with personnel. This is having a negative effect on the morale, mood and behavior of officers, shore-based and seagoing warrant officers, petty officers and seamen. As a result considerable tension, conflicts and negative trends that undermine the foundation of military service--proper organization and maintenance of law and order--persist in the military collectives, having a deleterious effect on the overall level of military discipline. Last year the Navy was unable to create an integrated system of training and indoctrination of subordinates in which all elements of military command and control and educational elements would participate actively. Contacts with local authorities, veteran and youth organizations, creative unions and cultural institutions are being restored too slowly. Training of commanders and chiefs of all levels and of staff and service specialists in educational work is sporadic, and it is insufficiently focused on solving particular problems of combat training and tightening military discipline. A number of priority measures were planned in order to provide for social protection in the Navy. Thus, given a total of around 30,000 persons without housing, 6,945 apartments were to be built and 344 spaces were to be obtained in dormitories with assets appropriated for capital construction. In addition 1,254 apartments were to be obtained from local agencies on the basis of proportionate participation, and 490 apartments ready for occupancy were to be purchased. We also planned to open a school with a capacity of 534 pupils, two children's nurseries with a capacity of 1,300 children, four dining halls with a capacity of 955 persons, seven boiler plants, three treatment plants and a number of other facilities. However, insufficient and irregular financing permitted us to fulfill our plan by only 72 percent. Consequently the Navy has approved the target of obtaining around 11,500 apartments in 1994 by means of its own construction efforts and through proportionate participation. Summarizing the results of the past year, it should be noted that despite objective and subjective economic, social and legal causes, the Navy was generally able to successfully reach the main goal--maintaining the attained level of combat and mobilizational readiness. The Russian Navy faces complex and important goals in 1994. Regarding combat readiness: The main efforts must be concentrated on maintaining the composition and condition of naval strategic nuclear forces at a level ensuring guaranteed fulfillment of assigned missions in any situation. General-purpose forces need to be kept in a state of readiness permitting them to repel aggression of local or regional scale from the oceans and seas. As before, combat service and alert duty having the purpose of promptly revealing preparations for an armed invasion or development of a threatening situation and taking the necessary steps to raise the combat readiness of the fleets remain the principle forms of maintaining high combat readiness of the forces. All organizational and technical measures must be implemented to preclude a surprise attack, and to ensure effective reconnaissance, prompt augmentation of the readiness of forces and their deployment, and the capability for cutting off aggression quickly. Comprehensive rehearsal in organizing transfer of the fleets from a peacetime to a wartime footing with regard for different scenarios should be considered to be the most important direction of improving combat readiness. In carrying out this task, we need to attain efficient organization of the work of command and control elements and coordinated fulfillment of planned measures at all levels in order to raise the forces to the highest degree of combat readiness, and we need to correct the shortcomings revealed on the basis of the results for 1993. Considering intensive implementation of organizational and staffing measures and reduction of the numerical and effective combat strength of the fleets, we need to constantly account for these changes, and promptly take the appropriate steps to provide for and maintain the prescribed level of combat readiness. Implementing the law of the Russian Federation "On the State Border of the Russian Federation," the Navy needs to work on a system for defending Russia's state borders in the underwater environment with naval forces and resources, and begin its practical check-out. We have to carry out a complex of tasks to qualitatively renew ships, armament and military equipment, reduce their assortment and improve ship basing conditions and all other forms of support. The work of accommodating forces of the Baltic and Black Sea fleets and the Caspian Flotilla at new bases in the Russian Federation, and efforts to withdraw armament, ammunition, materials and equipment from Latvia, Estonia and Belarus will be continued. Quick mastery of new ships, airplanes, helicopters and modern types of armament and military equipment entering the forces is an important task for the fleets. In order to reach the objectives of operational training, the basic efforts must be concentrated on high quality fulfillment of planned measures and on supporting the readiness of commanders and staffs to control the forces during preparation and conduct of operations and combat activities. Special attention should be devoted to rehearsing organization of coordination of fleet forces with combined units and large strategic formations of other armed services, and to studying and analyzing the problems of operational use of fleet forces in armed conflicts, local wars and emergencies. The methods of operational training need to be improved on the basis of wide introduction and intensive use of computers and of systems and resources for automation of the command and control of forces, troops and weapons. We need to actively develop and introduce computer games into the training of command and control elements, upgrade the quality with which exercises, training and lessons are prepared and carried out, and strive to achieve an integrated approach in conducted all training measures. Operational-tactical and command-and-staff exercises need to be conducted simultaneously with several large strategic formations which would pursue joint missions in accordance with their operational purpose and which would operate in a single zone (region). In this case in planning the measures of operational and combat training we need to account for the economic and financial aspects of their implementation, analyze the results, and when necessary, adjust the plans and guidelines according to established procedure. In carrying out the tasks of combat training, we need to continue improving preparation of combined units and units for combat activities within the composition of groupings of heterogeneous forces, and we need to seek and master new, effective tactics of their use. We need to rehearse formation and deployment of groupings, organization of support to their combat stability, all forms of defense, and the tactics of naval combat with the enemy's ship groupings with the support of air forces, fleet shore-based missile and artillery forces and fighter aviation of combined air defense units. Preparation of heterogenous ASW forces should be oriented on improving the means of seeking, tracking and destroying submarines, and on integrated use of all forms of ASW weapons utilizing acoustic and nonacoustic search equipment. In tactical exercises we need to continually practice the actions of ship and aviation reconnaissance and strike groups in conducting reconnaissance and providing targeting information to strike forces, and rehearse integrated use of electronic countermeasures, concealment and other forms of support. Integrated training at sea must become the principal method of combat training. It must be supported by a clearly developed, fully equipped and tightly controlled training base. It should be organized in such a way as to impose a full training load on shore-based trainers, practice ranges and classrooms, and to make maximum possible use of command and control systems and ship weapon and equipment systems in the practical training of the crews. The organization of basic exercises conducted by large strategic formations needs to be improved. All of these measures need to pursue a single goal--keeping the naval, field and flying skills of the personnel from deteriorating. Maintaining ships, airplanes, armament and equipment in constant readiness and mobilizing all personnel to maintain equipment entrusted to them in serviceable and combat ready condition must become a constant concern of commanders and staffs in the course of combat training. In organizing government and social training, we need to concentrate our main efforts on shaping and improving the professional knowledge of the personnel, moral and psychological qualities, the readiness to defend the fatherland, faithfulness to military duty, discipline, and pride in and responsibility for membership in the Russian Navy, with its 300-year heroic history. Fuller use needs to be made of this form of training in order to develop psychological, educational and legal knowledge and skills in regular military personnel. Forms of training that are most active, democratic and demonstrative, and which have the greatest emotional impact, should be constantly introduced into the training process. Educational work should be oriented in the new training year on supporting the moral and psychological stability and discipline of all categories of personnel, on preserving the cohesiveness of military collectives and on reinforcing an aggressive attitude in the servicemen in carrying out their missions. In this case all personnel involved in education must be required to exhibit maximum sensitivity and efficiency in their reactions to fluctuations in the mood of servicemen, and flexibility in their choice of the methods and resources of influencing them, and they must consider the unique features of each category of personnel, of every group and of each separate individual. The primary military collectives--the ship, the company, the battery--must be the focus of application of educational efforts. Ideology oriented chiefly on patriotism and professionalism, faithfulness to constitutional duty, responsibility for assigned work, and the merit and honor of a soldier and citizen must be introduced more boldly into the educational process. All forms of organizational and educational work must be used to attain the highest possible increase in the responsibility of each official for the state of military discipline, for the state of affairs aboard ships and in military units and subunits, and for the effectiveness of measures to prevent incidents, crimes and losses of human life. Eradication of jeering and humiliation, of crimes against chain of command, of evasion of military service, of outrages against the local population, and of misappropriation of state and military property, especially small arms, should be considered to be a priority task, as should preventing death and injury of servicemen, accidents, and disasters involving military equipment and armament. One of the main directions in the activity of the commanders of staffs and personnel departments, and of all officers, must be daily concern for the material and personal needs of the personnel, medical services, cultured leisure time for servicemen and their families, analysis of urgent problems and the of the needs and requests of subordinates, and their timely resolution. Officers should be selected and placed with regard for certification results. Personnel issues must be resolved quickly at all levels, in such a way as to ensure that executive positions are filled by trained, promising officers, admirals and generals, and to maintain continuity of leadership. Work with young officers needs to be improved. Steps must be taken to eliminate causes and conditions compelling young officers to submit applications for discharge from active military duty. This article describes only the most important results of work in 1993 and the objectives of the new training year. I am certain that fleet personnel will carry out their tasks with honor and merit. For this, they will need to work with full effort, study hard, and attain high end results in their work in their assigned areas of activity.
