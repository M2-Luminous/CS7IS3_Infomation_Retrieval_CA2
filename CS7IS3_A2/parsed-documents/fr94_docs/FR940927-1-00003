FR940927-1-00003 FR940927-1-00001 Background In accordance with section 103B of the 1949 Act, an ARP is required to be implemented for the 1995 crop of upland cotton if it is determined that the total supply of upland cotton, in the absence of an ARP, will be excessive, taking into account the need for an adequate carry-over to maintain reasonable and stable supplies and prices and to meet a national emergency. Land diversion payments also may be made to producers of upland cotton, whether or not an ARP for upland cotton is in effect, if needed to assist in adjusting the total national acreage of upland cotton to desirable goals. If, at the time of final announcement of the ARP, the projected carry-over of upland cotton for the crop year is equal to or greater than 8 million bales, a paid land diversion shall be offered to upland cotton producers. A paid land diversion has not been considered because, given the existing supply/use situation, it is not needed. If an ARP is announced, the reduction shall be achieved by applying a uniform percentage reduction (from 0 to 25 percent) to the upland cotton crop acreage base for the crop for each upland cotton-producing farm. In making such a determination, the number of acres placed into the program established under subtitle D of title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended, must be taken into consideration. A number of acres on the farm shall be devoted to conservation uses, in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary. The acres required to be devoted to conservation uses may be reduced, at the request of the producer, if the producer's total estimated deficiency payments which would be received under the feed grain, rice, wheat, upland and ELS cotton programs are estimated to be reduced in order to comply with the payment limitations set forth in section 1001 of the Food Security Act of 1985. The amount of the reduction in the acres required to be devoted to conservation uses is proportional to the estimated reduction in payments, in accordance with 7 CFR 1413.53. Producers who knowingly produce upland cotton in excess of the permitted upland cotton acreage for the farm plus any upland cotton acreage planted in accordance with the flexibility provisions are ineligible for upland cotton loans and payments with respect to that farm. If it is determined that an ARP for the 1995 crop of upland cotton is needed, a preliminary announcement of the ARP uniform percentage requirement (from 0 to 25 percent) must be made not later than November 1 of the calendar year preceding the year in which the crop is harvested. Not later than January 1 of the calendar year in which the crop is harvested, a final announcement of the ARP uniform percentage requirement must be made. Producers in early planting areas may elect to participate in the program on the terms of the ARP first announced for the crop, or as subsequently revised, if the Secretary determines that the producers may be unfairly disadvantaged by the revision. The ARP for the 1995 crop of upland cotton must be set at a level that will result in a ratio of carry-over to total disappearance of 29.5 percent, based on the most recent projection of carry-over and total disappearance at the time of announcement of the ARP. For the purposes of this provision, the term ``total disappearance'' means all upland cotton utilization, including total domestic, total export, and total residual disappearance. Based on August 1994 supply/use estimates, ending stocks for the 1995 marketing year under a 5-percent ARP, a 10-percent ARP, and a 15-percent ARP are 5.35 million bales, 5.10 million bales, and 4.75 million bales, respectively. Such ARP levels would result in ratios of carry-over to total disappearance of 30.6, 29.7, and 28.1 percent, respectively. For the purposes of this proposed rule, these three ARP options will be considered. However, because of changes in the supply/use situation that may develop between now and November 1, the actual announced preliminary ARP may be different from the options discussed in this rule. The estimated impacts of the ARP options are shown in the following table.
