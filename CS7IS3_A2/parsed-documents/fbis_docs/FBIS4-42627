In your opinion, what should be done against it? [Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] I deplore very much that such friendly matches are overshadowed by such acts of violence. Of course, one has to take consistent action against it, as has also been done in Germany. This was partly done by calling in the Public Prosecutor's Office. Of course, it is bad that extreme right-wing motives also played a role in Austria. This makes it clear how important it is that Germany and Austria take joint action against this development. [Foederl-Schmid] What is the joint course of action against right-wing extremists supposed to be like? [Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] It is very important that we cooperate with the police and judicial authorities and exchange information. We have to sit back and watch cross-border contacts developing increasingly frequently, not only with Austria, but also with other European neighbors. We have to pay even more attention to it than before. For me the German EU [European Union] presidency will be an opportunity to try to adjust the different criminal law provisions in the individual European member states, that is, no European criminal law, but the attempt to work toward a more uniform level than at present. [Foederl-Schmid] Can you give an example? [Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] In some European member states, it is currently not forbidden to produce Nazi symbols or to print National Socialist ideas in newspapers. These products enter the German market. In our country this is punishable, but we do reach the people who produced it. They are in countries where production is not punishable. Here one should try to adjust the law among the states. [Foederl-Schmid] Are the Austrian and the German judicial authorities already cooperating now? [Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] We have close contacts. Only a few days ago, talks among my state secretary, my Austrian colleagues, and experts from the Justice Ministry took place. The questions that have just been mentioned were also discussed there. [Foederl-Schmid] Can Austria be an example with its law against right-wing extremism? For example, the Auschwitz lie has been punishable for a relatively long time. [Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] We are also planning to make the denial of the Holocaust punishable. According to my assessment, the provisions in Germany and Austria are similar. It will certainly be good if we also follow a joint course in the EU and try to convince others of it.
