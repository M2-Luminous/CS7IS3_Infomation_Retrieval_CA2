During talks in Bonn with his Syrian counterpart Faruq al-Shar', Kinkel said that an act of terror carried out by one Israeli extremist could not be allowed to bury the prospects for peace and stability in the Middle East in the long term. Syria should resume its bilateral talks with Israel as well as take part in the multilateral negotiations. The German Government was ready to help stabilize the situation by giving reconstruction aid to Palestinian areas and Lebanon as well as to support an international presence if necessary. The German Foreign Ministry says the Syrian foreign minister stressed that his country has taken a constructive position regarding the Middle East peace process.
