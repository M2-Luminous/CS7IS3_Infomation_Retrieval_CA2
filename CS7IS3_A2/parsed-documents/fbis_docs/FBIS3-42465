However, Swiss scientists warn that imperfections in the tips can lead to spurious results. In the 1 June APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS a case of an atomic microscope misrepresenting the topography of a diamond film is described. Examinations with a scanning electron microscope and a scanning tunneling microscope revealed that the film surface consists of sharp facets and edges formed by oriented crystals. The atomic microscope presented this surface in the shape of truncated pyramids, and the microprobe's tip had that same squared-off shape. Microprobe tips are etched in batches from silicon wafers. The scientists found three flawed tips in a batch of 10. Dust or imperfect processing technology could have been the cause of the flaws. Scientists see the solution to the situation in scientists calibrating the tips before beginning experiments. SCIENCE NEWS, 13 June 1992, No. 24, p. 399. VIPER Explosives Detector I. Cambridge (a division of Meggitt Control) is offering the VIPER (Vapor Intensifier for Plastic Explosive Recognition) portable explosives detector that permits the detection of particles and vapors of plastic explosives. Detection of plastic explosives is a difficult task due to the low pressure of the vapors emitted by them. However, a trace of explosive is adequate for the VIPER detector and therefore it can be utilized to detect such explosives as hexogen, PETN, and semtex, and also the more broadly used trinitrotoluene and dynamite. The instrument is easy to use. Collection of samples can be done using a vacuum technique or by wiping a surface with a special cloth. Samples taken for the content of both vapors and also particles of explosives are processed identically and are placed in an analyzer. The VIPER detector has already undergone testing at the Lima Peru airport, where it was used to inspect the baggage of all passengers of three international American airlines for three days. Security forces managed to completely inspect approximately 1,000 items for explosives content thanks to the detector's rapid operation (no more than three seconds) and operation in real time with a low probability of false alarm.
