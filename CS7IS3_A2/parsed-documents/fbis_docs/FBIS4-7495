Sandi Frelih reports: [Frelih] Even before the decision to impeach Defense Minister Janez Jansa, the SKD announced that it would reconsider its further cooperation in the government. At the end of last week, the highest party officials discussed this, however they postponed any decisionmaking until the extraordinary parliamentary session. At the joint session of the party council and executive committee last night, they actually discussed two possibilities -- immediate departure from the government as proposed by Ivan Oman and the proposal of the party leadership to stay in the government, but under certain conditions. For the first time so far, the party council took a secret ballot. By 20 votes to 11 they decided that the LDS and SKD should themselves form a government of speedy and accelerated democratic and economic development of Slovenia, as the conclusion says. They also explain that such a decision in the times of political crisis is dictated by the hitherto cooperation of both parties, the current political situation, and the need to establish a new political balance, which would all help stabilize the political circumstances in divided Slovenia. They put Lojze Peterle in charge of the negotiations with Dr. Janez Drnovsek. They expect the reply of the LDS president by 7 April. SKD Secretary General Edvard Stanic is of the opinion that the political balance in the government after the departure of the Social Democrats is 2 to 1 and should be balanced out. He is also of the opinion that a coalition agreement, which would involve a greater degree of reciprocity and trust, should be drafted. When asked what they will do if the prime minister decides to keep the United List in the government and draws another right-wing party into it, Stanic replied that a new situation would emerge that would have to be discussed anew. They definitely expect Drnovsek's reply by next Thursday when the party council will meet again. Let me also add that Drnovsek has already been announcing changes in the coalition, saying that the coalition will have to be balanced out again.
