He met Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus in the late afternoon. Lucie Weissova has more details. [Weissova] After the meeting, Douglas Hurd told journalists that the talks dealt with Europe's future, with the expansion of European institutions, in particular the European Union and the North Atlantic Alliance. The two politicians agreed that a unified Europe should not become a superstate with Brussels as its capital. Rather, it should be a union of independent states that should be helped by this organization in efficient cooperation. Vaclav Klaus handed the British foreign secretary a personal letter inviting Prime Minister John Major to visit the Czech Republic. Responding to a question as to whether the Czech Republic could become a member of the European Union before the year 2000, Douglas Hurd said: [Begin Hurd recording in English with superimposed Czech translation] That is up to you.
