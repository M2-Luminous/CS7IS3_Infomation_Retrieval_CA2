[Begin Delgado recording] Panama occupied second place for a long time. However, due to our aggressive policy, Panama was able to take first place from Liberia in June 1993. [end recording] Capt. Delgado explained that the flagging of ships dropped considerably when Panama suffered its economic crisis in 1989. [Begin Delgado recording] We lost a bit less than 2 million tons during the crisis. Immediately thereafter, in 1990, however, we started an aggressive program and visited the main ship owners, participated in the main international maritime events, and more importantly, attended events at the International Maritime Organization. This organization is seated in London, and all the international maritime agreements and norms are debated there. Our program prompted ship owners to regain confidence in us, and they have given us their support. [end recording] The principal countries that request Panamanian flagging are Japan, Greece, Hong Kong, and Korea.
