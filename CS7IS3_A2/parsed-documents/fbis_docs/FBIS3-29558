In addition to this, the country must also follow the example of many countries, among them Thailand, who do not allow foreign ownership of land and buildings. There are legal systems which can be put in place which will preserve the interests of this nation and will still be acceptable to foreign investors. In making this call, Son Sann, the Dean of the Members of the National Assembly, said in a statement: "The great misery endured by this nation dates back to 1970. Then, we witnessed the ruthless exploitation of our natural resources without profit or gain for our people." "As such, there is a necessity in establishing an investment code. This code would reflect a reasonable degree of liberalism being based on mutual profit to encourage foreign investments but would also act to preserve our national interests." "When I said the preserving of our national interests, I specifically meant to preserve our present interests which still remain to be preserved, as well as those of future generations," he said. He added that it was within this perspective that he proposed (while waiting for an investment code reflecting a reasonable liberalisation, conceived with good consensus by the Royal Government and the National Assembly, with the present and future interests of our nation at heart) some necessary measures of precaution. "Contracts not approved by the Supreme National Council or by the Royal Government should be cancelled or reviewed again. The occupation of certain economically important regions such as harbours, must be of a limited duration." "We must make provision in these zones for a privileged zone to be reserved for locals and also a zone to be managed primarily by the Royal Government and, therefore, to be kept for future generations." "With new friends and new accords currently being made, the Royal Government will certainly be able to obtain better conditions for our nation," Son Sann pointed out. He added that with regards to oil exploration, fisheries and electricity, it would be desirable in the negotiations to have the collaboration of neutral and competent specialists, in particular well known local specialist residents in France or elsewhere who are current in their respective fields of research.
