The incidents that recently showed the blind points in ROK-Russia relations are, in general, two: One is the 20 May IZVESTIA report that "there is a possibility that Russia will supply weapon parts to North Korea," and the other is Russia's diplomatic rudeness in the postponement of the ROK-Russia joint economic committee meeting--scheduled to be held in Seoul on 20 and 21 May--by unilaterally breaching the agreement with the ROK. These diplomatic blind points were revealed after Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu's visit to Russia from 13 to 15 April and after Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae's visit to Russia from 28 April to 3 May, respectively. Thus, voices raised criticizing the government for problems existing in implementing its foreign policies. One should consider that sale of weapon parts is deeply related to Russia's policy on the Korean peninsula, going beyond a mere happening. To increase the North Korean battle strength, under the circumstances in which North and South Korea have not achieved a peace mechanism, cannot but be defined as a hostile act against us. Russia established diplomatic relations with the ROK and has maintained a friendly atmosphere with us to date while using $1.57 billion of money we offered as a loan. However, heated debates took place between the two nations regarding the method of loan payment, as to whether to pay it with raw materials or weapons. Amid such debate, the issue of supplying weapon parts to North Korea was raised. Russia put forward a logic that by supplying weapon parts to North Korea, it can "exert influence on North Korea." This logic is the same as the response that Russia showed when our Defense Ministry demanded in July 1992 that "the article on military alliance specified in the DPRK-Soviet Union Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance should be amended." Article 1 in the DPRK-Russia treaty stipulates that if North Korea is invaded by outside forces, the Russian Armed Forces shall automatically interfere in this. Although Russia admits that this article, an outcome of the Cold War era, is not appropriate at the present stage, it refused to amend the article. Instead, Russia has informed the North Korean side verbally of the abolition of the article pertaining to its automatic interference. But Russia has not amended the written text of the article. This is the very status of relations between North Korea and Russia. This means that whenever necessary, the validity of this article can be recovered at any time. Our government pointed out the following four issues as major impending problems between the ROK and Russia: First, payment of economic cooperation loans; second, defection of North Korean loggers; third, compensation for downing the Korean Airline passenger plane; and fourth, the land of former Russian mission in Seoul. It seems that Russia's military security policy toward the Korean peninsula should be included in pending issues to be discussed with the Russian side when President Kim Yong-sam visits Russia.
