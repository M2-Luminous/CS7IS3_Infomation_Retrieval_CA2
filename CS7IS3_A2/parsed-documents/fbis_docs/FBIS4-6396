FBIS4-6396 "dreas076_j_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-076 Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 Indonesia ANTARA Says Devaluation of Rupiah Unlikely ANTARA Says Devaluation of Rupiah Unlikely BK1904083794 Jakarta ANTARA in English 0647 GMT 19 Apr 94 BK1904083794 Jakarta ANTARA English BFN [Text] Jakarta, Apr 19 (ANTARA) -- Concern over a drastic drop in the rupiah's value against the US dollar is unfounded, head of money market and checking account affairs at the Central Bank, Bank Indonesia, Dahlan Sutalaksana, said to journalists here Monday. "Therefore, the rush to purchase US dollars in large quantities is only an act of speculation spurred by irresponsible rumours," he said. Economic observers have said that 500 million US dollars worth of rupiahs have been exchanged into US currency recently due to a statement made by a government official saying that although the rupiah will not be devalued, its depreciation will accelerate to 6 percent in 1994/95 as against the expected 3 to 4 percent. In previous years, the depreciation of the rupiah against the US dollar never rose above 6 percent, in 1990 the depreciation was 5.9 percent, in 1991 4.8 percent, in 1992 3.5 percent and in 1993 3.8 percent. Sutalaksana, who is now in charge of the development of the capital market at the Ministry of Finance, said that both domestically and overseas the rupiah's exchange rate against the US dollar has been stable and is likely to remain so. He also pointed out that the domestic real interest rate is stable in comparison with countries like the United States, Western Europe and Japan, ruling out the likelihood of capital flight overseas. It is expected that declining oil prices will not cause an accelerated depreciation of the rupiah against the US dollar, he said. "The role of oil in our state's budget is only 30 percent, so if the oil prices drop the effect is insignificant, unlike in 1986 when the role of oil in the state's budget reached 80 percent," he said. Regarding export value, he said that although the percentage dropped, the nominal value increased. In 1992 export value grew by 23 billion US dollars, an increase of 28 percent over 1991, and in 1993 it rose by 28 billion US dollars, up by 20 percent over 1992. The government has also successfully cut down on imports which grew by 8 percent in 1992 and by only 7 percent in 1993. "Our foreign exchange reserves are sufficient for 5 months worth of imports, so there is no reason for the value of the rupiah to be depreciated against US dollar at present," he added. Sutalaksana attributed the present purchase of large quantities of US dollars to the current hajj pilgrimage. "We have some 157,000 hajj pilgrims. If one hajj pilgrim requires 1,000 US dollars, then the quantities of US dollar purchases will certainly be big," he said.,
