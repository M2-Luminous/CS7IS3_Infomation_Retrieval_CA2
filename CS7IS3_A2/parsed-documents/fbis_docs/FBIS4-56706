[Lombana] Good evening. We had called for a meeting at 2300 today [0400 GMT 9 May], thinking that by then we would have figures for the first circuit -- namely 8-7 -- per Electoral Tribunal plans. Apparently there has been some delay in the electoral district vote count, and it is believed that it will be 0100 [0600 GMT 9 May] before it is ready. This means the National Vote-Counting Board has again gone into recess until that time. Likewise, we have reports that 8-8 and 8-9 will arrive about one hour after 8-7 is received. In other words, we have enough work for all the predawn hours. [Ciniglio] Can you explain the difference between the work of the National Vote-Counting Board and the work in the press room with the unofficial results? [Lombana] It is important to point out that the unofficial results released by the Electoral Tribunal, as the word indicates, are unofficial results. We, at the National Vote-Counting Board will receive the vote tally sheets covering the 40 electoral districts, which collect the results of the 5,310 voting tables throughout the country. In the presence of and together with political party representatives to the National Vote-Counting Board, we will count and certify that what the vote tally sheets say agrees with what the voting tables received. [Ciniglio] In view of the delay, when do you think the National Vote-Counting Board will proclaim the next president of the Republic? [Lombana] We continue with our plan of four to six days. In other words, we hope to do our duty by Thursday or Friday.
