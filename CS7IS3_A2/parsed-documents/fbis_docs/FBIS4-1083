FBIS4-1083 "drafr077_c_94026" FBIS-AFR-94-077 Daily Report 21 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 21 Apr South African Press Review for 21 Apr MB2104144194 MB2104144194 BFN [Editorial Report] THE STAR ANC Agreement With COSATU on Strike Moratorium -- Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 21 April in a page-20 editorial says the Congress of South African Trade Unions' (COSATU) decision to accept a moratorium on strikes until after the election "is part of a quid pro quo, in which COSATU assented to a moratorium in return for an undertaking by the TEC [Transitional Executive Council] to address the fears and grievances of civil servants." The call for a freeze on strikes was made by "top ANC leaders," in "response to a crippling series of strikes by civil servants" which have now spread to "threaten the election process itself." However, if an ANC government is to fulfill its "ambitious programme of reconstruction and development, more than a moratorium on strikes is required. There must be a commitment to general wage restraint in the upper echelons of the civil service -- soon to be filled by ANC appointees -- as well as by workers generally. It will not be enough for the ANC to call on its alliance partner, COSATU, to urge the workers to tighten their belts. The ANC's leaders will have to show the way." BUSINESS DAY COSATU Sets Itself `Coherent Agenda' -- "Though COSATU faces difficult times because of the loss of some of its most capable leadership to politics, it has set itself a coherent agenda," notes a page-14 editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 21 April. "COSATU's agenda is not an unimaginative one. It will require an alert business (and government) effort to ensure that some overly adventurous proposals are moderated. COSATU's primary focus is on strengthening centralised collective bargaining. This is not, as some argue, an inherently flawed approach. If we want an era of industrial governance by consensus, it is probably essential." BUSINESS DAY also sees "a growing awareness in COSATU of the need to encourage small business development and, therefore, a willingness to exempt emerging businesses from the more onerous conditions of industrial council agreements." SOWETAN Buthelezi Brinkmanship -- An editorial in the Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 21 April on page 10 looks at "cold facts" after the "euphoria of the Inkatha Freedom Party's [IFP] participation" in the elections. "Why did the country have to go right up to the brink before State President F W de Klerk, ANC President Nelson Mandela and IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi stopped and turned back?" Was the IFP "playing chicken," as "it was pretty obvious to all that the IFP was preparing itself for the elections" and "were actually able to pull out posters and election material before the ink on the agreement had dried." "What does the death of hundreds in Natal and other provinces mean to the IFP?" "Now that sanity seems to be restored" a "programme to encourage reconciliation has to be pursued, not for the sake of the political parties involved, but for that of the country as a whole."
