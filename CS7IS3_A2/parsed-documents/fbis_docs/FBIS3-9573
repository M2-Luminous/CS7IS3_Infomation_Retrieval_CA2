[Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Deputy Prime Minister, which problems in Slovakia's economy do you regard as being a priority at the present time? [Snegnerova] There are very many of them, and listing them would probably take some time. We would like to focus to a considerable extent on an accelerated continuation of the process in the privatization sphere. We would like to aim in particular at generating, through privatization, private companies capable of creating job opportunities for people and producing goods that could compete abroad. Thus, they would help us solve the situation in our foreign trade and in improving the foreign trade balance. This is linked to another objective of the government's economic policy, which is that much stronger emphasis will be placed on trade policies, in particular on export-promoting policies. [Correspondent] Recently, you had a meeting with the World Bank executive director and IMF representatives, and you visited the United States Department of the Treasury and other important institutions. Have these meetings yielded anything positive for Slovakia? [Snegnerova] I would like to sum up very briefly the conclusions of these meetings. Support for the new Slovak Government was voiced at all of the meetings. They voiced confidence that the new Slovak Government would speed up the transformation of Slovak society, the democratization of Slovak society, and that it would speed up the economic transformation. We agreed with the IMF that, as early as before the final drafting of the economic and political section of the government statement, we would hold several rounds of talks with Mr. Zervudakis, a member of the staff responsible for Slovakia. These talks should make sure that the policy the government will submit to the parliament is acceptable to both sides. This step is significant because the IMF's positive approach to the government economic policy could mean the speeding up of the talks on the standby loan. As you know, the significance of this loan does not lie only in boosting our currency funds; it amounts, above all, to the expression of support for the economic policy of the government, and, at the same time, is an expression of support for the Slovak economy. It will be an important signal for foreign investors, be they institutions or strategic investors. Our efforts will be aimed at attracting these investors. Along with the approval of a standby loan or, rather, when we start drawing this loan, we will get the second (?part of the stand-by) loan. This has already been approved, but there is a condition attached to the drawing of the second stage. [Correspondent] When, in your view, could Slovakia get the standby loan? [Snegnerova] Provided that talks proceed well, it could be within the next few months. [end recording]
