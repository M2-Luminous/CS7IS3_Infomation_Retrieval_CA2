The government presented a bill on this to the Eduskunta today. Finland's territorial waters will extend to 12 nautical miles instead of the current 4 nautical miles. This is an attempt to improve the authorities' ability to control entry and exit in the sea areas. It is proposed that the extension of the territorial waters will be implemented in the Gulf of Finland so that there will always be a east-west open sea corridor measuring 3 nautical miles on the northern side of the median line.
