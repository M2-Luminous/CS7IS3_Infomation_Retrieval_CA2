This was announced by Press Secretary of the Russian Border Defense troop command, Colonel Aleksandr Suvorov today. He suggested that such actions would mark the beginning of the spring-summer attack planned by "the Tajik government in exile." Suvorov stressed that large formations of militants were concentrating on the Pyanj and Shuroabad areas near the border. He did not rule out that the armed opposition in Tajikistan could participate in actions against Russian border guards. Suvorov stated that all actions against Russian border guards would fail. The command of the Russian Border Defense troops in Tajikistan is taking all necessary measures in order to resist possible attacks, Suvorov emphasized. "All responsibility for the attempt to trigger off military actions on the border will lay on those trying to hamper the peace settlement in Tajikistan with their own lives and that of others," Suvorov said.
