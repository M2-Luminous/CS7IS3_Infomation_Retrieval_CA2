An analysis would be necessary." The guideline on Japan's Official Development Assistance (ODA) programs requires the government to consider in deciding on aid to countries whether the recipients' defense outlays are conspicuously large or not. Terada in his remark meant to say that the scale of the defense budget should not immediately become the reason for a review of Japan's ODA programs for China.
