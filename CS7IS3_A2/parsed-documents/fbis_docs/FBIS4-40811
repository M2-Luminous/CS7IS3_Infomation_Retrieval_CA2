"I am critical of the fact that the U.S. Administration has failed to consult more closely with Russia on the subject of the North Korean problem," he stated in an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent. "Russia does not want nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula, nor does it want war to break out as a result of the collapse of the North Korean regime." The expert criticized the aims which the U.S. Administration is pursuing in respect of North Korea. In his view, the application of sanctions prior to presenting the North Koreans with a clearly crafted package of specific proposals would be a mistake.
