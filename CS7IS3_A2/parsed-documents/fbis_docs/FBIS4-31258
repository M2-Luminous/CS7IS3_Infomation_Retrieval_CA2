The delegation will visit the National Guard in South Carolina and will hold special meetings with high-level officials at the Pentagon and U.S. State Department, including U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry. Our correspondent interviewed Mr. Zhulali before his departure: [Dhamo] Mr. Minister, at the invitation of the National Guard of South Carolina you are leading a high-level military delegation on an official visit to the United States. What do you hope to achieve during this visit? [Zhulali] The goal of this visit is to further strengthen the extremely good relations that exist between Albania and the United Sates in the field of defense. There is an infrastructure of political and economic relations between Albania and the United States, and we can now add relations in the field of defense, which were implemented with the signing of a memorandum and other developments between our two armies. In return for the visit paid by the delegation of the National Guard of South Carolina and upon their invitation, we are visiting the United States to aquaint ourselves with their experiences in organization, drills -- mainly with reservists -- the training of noncommissioned officers, and the possibility to profit from them in all the activities they organize, which are of a wide variety. We also want to learn about the fields of organization and legislation. My visit to the United States could be divided into two parts: The first part is in South Carolina and the second part, which constitutes, shall we say, the political part of the program, includes very important meetings at the Pentagon with political and military officials, including Defense Secretary William Perry, and meetings at the State Department with congressional representatives, senators, and various politicians. I plan to inform them about the successful development of reform in Albania, the further consolidation of democracy, the close relations between Albania and the United States, the further support that Albania asks from the United States to consolidate democracy, and the progress of the reform. We will request the same from our military colleagues, who, seeing the good progress of the reform in the Army, have supported it. However, we think they should give more support for the Albanian Army, which, just like all our state structures, plays an important role in the peace and stability in the region.
