The new institution's senior person, the Luxembourger Leon Bollendorf, said in his opening speech that for the first time in European history federal states, regions, departments, provinces and local governments could give shape to their wish to take part in the decisionmaking process within the EU. This "decentralization" is intended to close the gap with European citizens. The Committee should ensure that the EU became a tangible reality for normal citizens, Bollendorf said. The Committee of the Regions should give shape to this new "realpolitik" and involve citizens in its activities, otherwise there was a danger that citizens would regard the new institution as a new European administrative body, he said. The Committee of the Regions has virtually no powers. Member states are only required to consult the Committee about legislative work in five fields: Economic and social subjects related to areas including the cohesion and structural funds, the trans-European networks (in the energy, transport and telecommunications sectors), education, culture and public health. Bollendorf said the committee should also make a contribution toward improving urban living conditions and security. In that field the situation had got completely out of hand, with every conceivable consequence for the stability of our democratic structures, he said. The committee should seek a solution for this painful problem, he said. The Committee of the Regions has 189 members who are chosen for four-year terms. It consists of representatives at regional and local levels. Both groups have an approximately equal share in the number of members and deputy members. The Socialists and Christian Democrats are the two strongest groups in the new institution. On Wednesday afternoon the committee will elect a president and decide on its activities. Flemish Prime Minister Luc van den Brande is one of the candidates for the presidency.
