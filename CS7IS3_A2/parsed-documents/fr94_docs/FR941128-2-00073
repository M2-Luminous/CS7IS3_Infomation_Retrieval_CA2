FR941128-2-00073 FR941128-2-00045 Analysis of Proposed Consent Order to Aid Public Comment The Federal Trade Commission (``Commission'') has accepted provisionally an agreement containing a proposed consent order from Charter Medical Corporation (``Charter''), under which Charter would agree not to acquire certain psychiatric facilities from National Medical Enterprises (``NME''). The proposed Consent Order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission will again review the agreement and the comments received, and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement or make final the agreement's proposed order. Charter has proposed to acquire certain assets and businesses from NME, including 17 psychiatric hospitals, chemical dependency facilities and residential treatment centers. The proposed complaint alleges that the proposed acquisition, if consummated, would constitute a violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 18, and Section 5 of the FTC Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 45, in the market for psychiatric services in several geographic areas in the United States. The proposed Consent Order would remedy the alleged violation by allowing the NME facilities and those geographic areas to remain as viable competitors or be sold to a third party other than Charter. The proposed Consent Order provides that Charter forthwith modify its Asset Sale Agreement with NME, dated March 29, 1994, to rescind Charter's agreement to acquire the following facilities: MidSouth Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee; Psychiatric Institute of Richmond, Richmond, Virginia; Brawner North Medical Health System, Smyrna, Georgia; Crescent Pines Hospital, Stockbridge, Georgia; and Laurel Oaks Hospital and Residential Treatment Center, Orlando, Florida. Under the terms of a letter of understanding from NME, the Commission will receive advance written notification of sale of any of these facilities. The Order also requires Charter, for a ten-year period, to obtain prior approval from the Commission before acquiring any psychiatric facility in any of the following geographic areas, as defined in the Order: The Orlando area; the Atlanta area; the Memphis area; and the Richmond area. The Order also requires Charter to obtain prior approval before permitting any psychiatric facility it operates in the four geographic areas to be acquired by any person that operates, or will operate immediately following such acquisition, any other psychiatric facility in the geographic areas, for a ten-year period. The Order also requires Charter, for a ten-year period to provide advance written notification to the Commission before consummating any joint ventures with any other psychiatric facility in the four geographic areas specified. Under the provisions of the Order, Charter is required to provide to the Commission a report of compliance with the Order within sixty (60) days following the date the Order becomes final, and annually thereafter for period of ten years. The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed Order. and it is not intended to constitute an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed Order or to modify in any way their terms.
