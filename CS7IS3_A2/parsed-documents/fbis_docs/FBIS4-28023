Alatas, 61, has been removed from Medistra Hospital's Intensive Cardiac Care Unit since Saturday to a private room, the hospital's public relations officer said yesterday. Roos Jusuf Razak told THE JAKARTA POST that Alatas needed plenty of rest and was not in a condition to receive any visitors. The minister was admitted to the hospital on May 22. Doctors then said he was suffering from fatigue and had to rest for the next two weeks. "Mrs. Alatas has been trying to limit the number of visitors. Now, only the minister's family has been permitted to see him. The family apologizes for this," Roos said. On Monday, however, President Suharto made a visit and became the only guest allowed in besides his family, she said. Roos said that Mrs. Alatas, who has been accompanying her husband since he entered the hospital, has continually received guests and messages of sympathy from around the world. A security guard at the hospital said Alatas' guests included officials from foreign embassies and government officials. He said Alatas also received "hundreds of bouquets" and more than a guests- book full of visitors. Alatas' spokesman Irawan Abidin told THE JAKARTA POST there had not been any confirmation from the minister's doctors on when Alatas was permitted to leave the hospital. "For now, we will keep to the doctor's initial prescription, in which he was ordered a two-week rest," he said. Dr. Pattiasina of the Gatot Subroto Central Army Hospital who has the authority to give information on Alatas' health, refused to give details. "He is doing fine," he said shortly, adding that he was given strict orders not to say more. "I've been receiving reporters since last week, but I did not tell them anything," he said heroically. "In fact, I got tired of them and threw one out of my office."
