The two sides agreed to make another try Saturday. "There has been progress in mutual understanding," said a Japanese official involved in the negotiations. The negotiations, which lasted five hours Friday, were aimed at breaking a three-month deadlock in the so-called "framework" talks that has badly strained bilateral trade ties. While officials declined to comment on what transpired across the negotiating table, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor underscored the importance of the meeting by personally attending part of the "exploratory talks" between subcabinet officials. Representing the Japanese team were Vice Minister of International Trade and Industry Sozaburo Okamatsu and Deputy Foreign Minister Sadayuki Hayashi. The U.S. delegation consisted of two principal Japan trade negotiators, Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky and Presidential National Economic Council Deputy Director Bowman Cutter. Like their Japanese counterparts, U.S. officials involved in the talks were equally tight-lipped. "You know I can't talk," said a U.S. official when asked for comment. Cutter, however, sought to project an air of conviviality after emerging from the morning session. "We had a good and cordial conversation, and we will meet again," Cutter told reporters. The trade talks, which are closely watched on financial markets as a barometer in the state of relationship between the world's two largest economies, ruptured in February at a meeting in Washington between President Bill Clinton and then Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, who succeeded Hosokawa in late April, and Clinton agreed last week to work out a common "basis" for restarting the framework talks before they meet at the group seven summit in Naples in early July. One major sticking point in the framework talks -- and the primary cause for the rupture of the negotiations at the Feb. 11 U.S.-Japan summit -- is the idea of setting "objective criteria" to measure imports to Japan. In what is known as a "results-oriented" approach, the U.S. has insisted on using "numerical indicators" to ensure that a trade agreement with Japan translates into increased foreign sales in the Japanese market. Tokyo has vehemently objected to the idea, saying it amounts to government-managed trade. Among the industry sectors covered under the "framework" accord are Japanese Government procurement for medical and telecommunications products, trade in autos and auto parts and the Japanese insurance market. The U.S. wants Japan to open its market wider to foreign goods and stimulate domestic demand in order to reduce its vast, and growing, trade surplus. The U.S.-Japan trade imbalance was underscored by fresh U.S. Government data Thursday that showed the U.S. trade deficit with Japan jumped 25 percent in March to 5.80 billion dollars. The U.S. trade gap with Japan came to 15.04 billion dollars in the first three months of this year, well ahead of the comparable period last year which stood at 13.3 billion dollars.
