A shortage of the foreign currency that serves as the dinar's backing and an abundance of dinars, combined with aggressive illegal money markets, are eroding the new dinar's value. The "culprits" are not only illegal street dealers, but also some legitimate businessmen. The government is considering various remedies ranging from a gold-backed dinar to arrests of currency dealers. The paper indicates that the problem is widespread, occurring in numerous cities in Serbia and Montenegro. According to an article entitled "Dinar Being Tested" in the 10 April VECERNJE NOVOSTI, "the inability of the state to fight successfully against the unregulated sale of hard currency is due, first of all, to the fact that hard currency reserves have been depleted and that the stabilization program started with about DM300 million, an amount that was actually insufficient. That much was purchased during the first two months of the program, and since then demand has exceeded supply." The shortage of hard currency, which undermines the new dinar, is not caused by ordinary citizens, states an article in the 9 April VECERNJE NOVOSTI. The main culprits are the private dealers who line up daily at the banks to buy hard currency. "Sales of marks and dollars by banks and exchange offices far surpass purchases. `Agrobanka' of Podgorica, for example, sold 6,000 marks while it bought 800. The situation is similar in other banks." Dealers are playing for larger stakes on the streets, reports VECERNJE NOVOSTI on 5 April: "They don't bother with small change any more. Now they offer 110 dinars for DM100, 1,200 dinars for DM1,000, and 2,500 `super' dinars for DM2,000." Aggravating the erosion of the dinar and the depletion of hard currency, the paper adds, are dealers from Bulgaria and Romania who offer 1.2 to 1.5 dinars for a mark. The greatest damage is done by large-volume dealers who work with tens and hundreds of thousands of marks, according to a 6 April VECERNJE NOVOSTI article, which reports that two groups of dealers were recently arrested in Belgrade for transactions totaling DM750,000. Most of these people are owners of businesses, the paper notes. The article goes on to examine where all the dinars are coming from. Milorad Vlakovic, director of Plevlje Bank, believes that many dealers are buying marks for various businesses, which thus convert their daily dinar profits into hard currency. It notes that while such transactions may be a major source of dinars, they are not the only ones. It cites a TANJUG report that "yesterday morning in Podgorica, several dealers had several thousand new dinars each. These dinars were in their original bank wrappers, stacked according to their serial numbers." The article adds that in Montenegro one type of business takes a direct approach in collecting hard currency. Service stations sell gasoline strictly for hard currency. This is legal in Montenegro, and it forces many people to buy hard currency in order to obtain gasoline. An article entitled "It Costs Less in Marks" in VECERNJE NOVOSTI of 10 April notes that many products sell on the black market for as much as a 30 percent discount if they are paid for in marks rather than dinars. These items include electronics products, clothing, cosmetics, and some imported foods. The article also reports on measures such as cameras in banks and identity checks that are intended to prevent repeated purchases of hard currecny by the same individuals. Such measures are easily defeated, the paper observes; dealers simply send proxies to the banks. The 9 April VECERNJE NOVISTI reports that banks in the city of Zajecar have found a more effective way to avoid depletion of their foreign currency supplies: They sell only as much foreign currency as they buy. The Belgrade Institute of Economy has proposed that the National Bank of Yugoslavia introduce gold coins weighing four grams and valued at 92 dinars as a way of reducing the number of dinars in circulation, states the 10 April VECERNJE NOVOSTI article. The institute has also proposed the introduction of special-product bonds. To deny currency dealers access to dinars intended for the purchase of the wheat crop, for example, bonds redeemable for wheat would be issued. The paper concludes, however, that in spite of the efforts to ensure the stability of the new dinar, "bankers are already talking about devaluation."
