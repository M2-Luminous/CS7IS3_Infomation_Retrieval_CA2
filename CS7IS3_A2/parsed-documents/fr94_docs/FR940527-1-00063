FR940527-1-00063 FR940527-1-00014 •Both a hospital's own wage data and that of other hospitals in its vicinity may contain relevant information about the level of wages in the hospital's true labor market. In particular, a hospital's own data may reflect specific circumstances of the hospital's labor market that we have yet to discover in our analysis of the data, but that reflect geographic variation that Medicare would want to capture in the wage index. •No matter how we determine labor market areas, both a hospital's own wage data and that of other hospitals assigned to its labor market area may contain any number of spurious sources of variation, including data errors, that should not be captured in the wage index. The larger the number of hospitals whose data are averaged, the more the effects of spurious factors are reduced. To address all of these considerations, we have designed for comment and future study an approach that uses the current MSA system but generally gives a hospital's own wages a higher weight than under the current system. (We have assigned each hospital's own wages a weight sufficient to ensure that in no case would the weight of a hospital's own wages be reduced below its current level.) We believe that a hospital's own wages, to some degree, reflect its specific labor market conditions. Hence, a hospital's wage index would be more representative of these labor market conditions if a higher weight was assigned to its own wages than typically occurs in large MSA or statewide rural area labor markets. If this approach results in situations in which a hospital's wage level continues to be significantly higher than the combined average hourly wage used to construct its wage index, we would provide an exceptions mechanism whereby a hospital's wage index would be derived entirely or in part from its ``nearest neighbor'' labor market area. We are considering two alternative wage indexes based on this approach. The first of two wage indexes we considered places a 25 percent (.25) weight on each hospital's own average hourly wage and a 75 percent weight (.75) on the average hourly wage of the other hospitals in each hospital's MSA or statewide rural area. However, if a hospital's data represent more than 25 percent of the hours in the MSA or statewide rural area in which it is located, then, in calculating the hospital's wage index, that higher percent was used instead of the 25 percent weight. The resulting weighted average hourly wage is divided by the national average hourly wage to obtain each hospital's wage index value. For purposes of discussion, this wage index is denoted as ``Minimum 25'' or ``M25''. The second wage index differs from the first alternative only in that a minimum weight of .50 is given the hospital's own average hourly wage, instead of a minimum 25 percent. This wage index is denoted as ``Minimum 50'' or ``M50''. However, we recognize that in some cases a hospital's immediate labor market area as defined under a ``nearest neighbor'' approach may be more representative of its true labor market area than an MSA-based labor market area. To address such situations, we have developed a mechanism that would essentially provide a hospital with an alternative wage index derived entirely or in part from its nearest neighbors labor market. Currently, we are examining two methods for reclassification, a ``simple'' method and a ``refined'' method. Both methods utilize the two wage indexes just introduced, and like the current MGCRB reclassification system, also require a hospital's own wages to exceed certain thresholds to meet eligibility. These thresholds are as follows: The first threshold would be used to identify hospitals whose own wage levels are still aberrant when using the Minimum 25 or Minimum 50 wage indexes. We set this threshold at the mean plus 1.0 standard deviation of the ratio of each hospital's own average hourly wage to the weighted sum of its own average hourly wage plus the average hourly wage of the other hospitals in the MSA or Statewide rural area in which the hospital is located. For the M25 wage index, the threshold would be 1.07. That is, a hospital's average hourly wage would have to equal at least 107 percent of the weighted average hourly wage used to develop its wage index in order to qualify for reclassification. For the M50 wage index, the threshold would be 1.05. •The second threshold, which would be used to identify hospitals whose wages are comparable to the hospitals in the immediate (that is, nearest neighbor) labor market area, was set at 83 percent, which equals the mean minus 1 standard deviation of the ratio of each hospital's average hourly wage to the average hourly wage of its nearest 10 neighbors. Under the ``simple'' reclassification methodology, there would be only a single adjustment available to a hospital that demonstrates that its wages are aberrant within its labor market area (that is, it meets both thresholds discussed above). The basis for the adjustment is evidence that the average hourly wage of the other hospitals in its MSA or statewide rural area is not representative of the average hourly wage in the hospital's actual labor market. A common reason that the MSA's average hourly wage may not be representative of a particular hospital's actual wage costs is that the MSA is too large and comprises multiple labor markets. To qualify for reclassification under this method, a hospital would have to meet a third criterion. The average hourly wage of a hospital's nearest 10 neighbors (with a minimum of at least 2 neighbor hospitals within 20 miles or all hospitals within 35 miles) would have to exceed the average hourly wage of the other hospitals in its MSA or statewide rural area. If this is the case, then the average hourly wage of the hospital's nearest 10 neighbors would be substituted for the MSA or statewide rural average hourly wage in calculating the numerator of the hospital's wage index. Under this reclassification scheme a hospital's own wages would be given the same weight as in the MSA-based alternative wage index (M25 or M50).
