Several shops in the town were petrol-bombed shortly after the blast and police have offered R[rand] 10,000 for information leading to the arrest of the attackers. Police spokesman Maj-Gen Tokkie Nienaber said damage to the ANC office was estimated at R80,000 and several surrounding houses were damaged in the 1.15 AM explosion. The kind of explosives used was still unkown. Elsie Manoe, 46, suffered burn wounds to her hip and Katrien Salabane, 14, was injured in her left thumb, said Gen Nienaber. The interiors of three shops in the predominantly Asian business centre of Koranna Fontein were gutted when unidentified attackers broke the windows and hurled six petrol bombs into the premises at about 1.20 AM. No-one was hurt in the petrol bomb attacks. The ANC's [African National Congress] Western Transvaal branch called on the government to investigate the blast as well as the proliferation of commercial explosives in the Western Transvaal region. Two powerful bomb explosions ripped through the offices of two trade unions in Klerksdorp, also in the Western Transvaal, and one damaged offices in Harrismith in the Orange Free State on Wednesday. The blasts were believed to have been caused by commercial explosives.
