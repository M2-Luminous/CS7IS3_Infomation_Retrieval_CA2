We can ascertain that the conspiratorial plans against the Yemeni people and their unity are formidable. However, the united Yemeni people know very well that the objective is not only to fragment their unity but to ensure that the present and future generations remain preoccupied with fighting and disputes to keep Yemen engaged in futile conflicts. One understands from the Arab and international moves on the current events in our country that there is more to the situation than meets the eye. There are those who support our unity and our people's aspirations. There are those who, surprisingly, adopt ambiguous stands. What is amazing, however, are the underhanded stands adopted by some sides. In spite of all this, our confidence in Almighty God will enable us to settle what is taking place in our country. Our asset and source of sustenance are our faith and our our people's abidance by unity and their eagerness to defend constitutional legitimacy. We also stress that our cause is purely a domestic affair, something which the brothers and friends should understand. Our acceptance of the proposals made by others is not an acceptance of interferences which conflict with the UN Charter and international laws, or harm our right to sovereignty and independence. From this premise, we say that the gang of rebellion and treason, which has sold itself to the devil and sought to destroy the homeland and people's means, and undermine their unity will not succeed in attaining its designs and will not be able to salvage its base goals. Irrespective of the magnitude of the conspiracies and means available to the conspirators, our people will not yield. It goes without saying that thanks to our faith in our unity and respect for constitutional legitimacy, which embodies our will and our insistence to defend it, we will be capable of foiling all the attempts by those who conspire against our unity and who wager on the dirty secessionist clique which was discarded by the entire Yemeni people. It should be understood that our respect for the endeavors that are made by international legitimacy comes from our belief that they stem from sympathy for our causes. This is because we are certain that the entire international community supports Yemeni unity and constitutional legitimacy. There is no excuse for any member of the international community to act otherwise because the entire world, under the new world order, should stand together to support peoples unity and democracy, and protect human rights and freedom. We believe that the entire international community supports Yemeni unity in line with the stands of the UN Security Council permanent members which support Yemeni unity, our democractic course, and our country's approach to a free market economy. While emphasizing the importance for the members of the international community to support Yemeni unity and constitutional legitimacy, we must also remind of the need to respect the bases on which the new international order is being established. We should all work to entrench its concepts and enhance its traditions, far from motives stemming from interests or hegemony. There is no doubt that the international community members, including the brothers, understand that what is taking place in the Republic of Yemen, the internationally recognized united political entity, is a domestic affair, and that the constitutional legitimacy government acts in a reasonable manner and in accordance with what its duties dictate and its sovereign rights, which authorize it to combat rebellion and the secessionist course of a treacherous and agent clique led by the so-called 'Ali Salim al-Bid, who will be arrested and brought to trial soon, God willing, so that he and his clique will receive severe punishment for their crimes against the people and homeland. God supports our people's decision and will make them triumph in their struggle to protect their unity and safeguard their dignity, democracy, and rights.
