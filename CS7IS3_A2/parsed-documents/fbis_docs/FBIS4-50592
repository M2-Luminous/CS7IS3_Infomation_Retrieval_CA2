So far, over 1,000 people back from abroad have lined up for official approval to set up their own companies. These firms, featuring high technology, are involved in the fields of information, advertising, consultancy and tourism. Three-quarters of these returned students have masters' degrees or doctorates obtained abroad. Doctor Ni Xuanzhong, who has initiated a company of "intelligent machines", is trying to develop an innovatory scanner for Chinese characters, which can read 400 characters per second. Another new product developed by the company is capable of linking six pairs of telephone users using just one line, relieving the shortage of lines in the region. Doctor Jiang Qinguo, licensed lawyer who studied in New York, has established a consultancy firm to offer advice and act as agent to Chinese and foreign businessmen, at home and abroad. Luo Yan, nationally-renowned actress who has just finished eight years of studying in the United States, has invested 100,000 U.S. dollars to set up an entertainment firm, prompting program exchanges with television and broadcasting stations in foreign countries. The city has set aside special areas in some development zones, wishing that more and more overseas students will bring in investment and their knowledge and skills.
