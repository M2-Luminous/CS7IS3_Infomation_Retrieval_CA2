He is acting on two fronts, seeking to convince at least some PMDB members. He is openly courting the PMDB's Rio Grande do Sul State wing, while quietly and favorably responding to former [Sao Paulo] Governor Orestes Quercia's overtures for agreement. Brizola's isolation stems from the unfeasibility of an alliance with the PT [Workers Party] -- owing to the absolute leadership of Lula [PT leader Luis Inacio Da Silva] in the polls and the consequent reluctance of the latter -- and with the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], mainly because of his aversion to the party's Ceara State wing. In light of the affinity expressed by PPR [Progressive Renewal Party] leader Paulo Maluf, who is sympathetic toward Brizola, with [Bahia Governor] Antonio Carlos Magalhaes' PFL [Liberal Front Party] -- which is the PDT's worst enemy after entrepreneur Roberto Marinho -- it has been said that the possibility of an alliance has definitely been buried, leaving the PMDB as the only alternative. Brizola has already met with PMDB President Luiz Henrique da Silveira once and will meet him again this week. Brizola proposes using his political clout in Rio Grande do Sul State to help former [Social Security] Minister Antonio Britto become the Rio Grande do Sul governor in exchange for support for his presidential candidacy. Brizola even pledged to overcome old disagreements with Senator Pedro Simon in order to reach an understanding.
