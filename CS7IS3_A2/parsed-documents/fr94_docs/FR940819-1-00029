Under PHS Act section 464J, the Secretary, acting through the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), may designate National Alcohol Research Centers for the purpose of interdisciplinary research relating to alcoholism and other biomedical, behavioral and social issues related to alcoholism and alcohol abuse, and shall make annual grants to the Centers, including a grant to a designated Center for research on the effects of alcohol on the elderly. The NIH proposes to amend the current regulations governing these grants by revising the ``Table of Contents'' section, removing reserved sections 54a.508 and 54a.509, and redesignating section 54a.510 as 54a.508, revising the authority citation and ``Applicability'' section to show the changes necessitated by enactment of the ADAMHA Reorganization Act, providing additional definitions, replacing the language in section 54a.504 with non-specific language which will eliminate the need to seek OMB regulatory review for future changes in the grant application form, and revise section 54a.506(c) by removing the $1 million limitation on grant awards to conform to Public Law 98&hyph;24 which eliminated the $1 million cap. Additionally, NIH proposes to add a new section 54a.509 to the current regulations setting forth other HHS policies and regulations that apply to grants awarded under subpart E. The purpose of this notice is to invite public comment on these proposed changes. The following statements are provided for the information of the public. Regulatory Impact Statement Because this rule merely makes minor changes in grant application practices and conforms grant awards to the current statute, it will have no consequential effects on the economy or small entities. Therefore the Secretary has determined that this rule is not significant within the definition of Executive Order 12866, and the Secretary certifies that this rule will not have a significant impact on a substential number of small entities. Paperwork Reduction Act This proposed rule does not contain any information collection requirements which are subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review and approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35). Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) numbered program affected by the regulations is 93.981.
