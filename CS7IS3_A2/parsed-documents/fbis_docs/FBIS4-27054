Ignacio Pichardo Pagaza, chairman of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), told XINHUA that his party's presidential candidate, Ernesto Zedillo, is giving great importance to the development of trade ties with Asian countries, especially with China, since it feels that China will be a world economic power with its current economic growth rate. The PRI leader said Mexico is very much interested in continuing its economic ties with China as Mexico is a big market for China, and vice versa. Asked about the anti-dumping measures that the current Mexican Government imposed against a series of Chinese products last April, the party leader said it would be better if trade regulations provided fair treatment to both countries. "The products we export to China are those that compete correctly and adequately with others and China's exports to Mexico are based on equal and fair treatment," added Ignacio Pichardo Pagaza. The PRI leader described trade with China as "of great importance" to Mexico, which believes that "China is going to play an increasingly important role in the economic development of Asia and we want to be present in that process." The two countries can do other types of businesses together apart from goods export, such as bilateral cooperation in the petroleum industry sector where each country has its own technology, said the PRI leader. "In this way I see a very brilliant future for relations between Mexico and China," the PRI leader said.
