But Major Rob Annink of the UN Protection Force in former Yugoslavia told reporters that "we don't think that Gorazde is under imminent threat of being taken by the Bosnian Serb army" following Friday's seizure of the highest flank of Mount Gradina. He said he based his conviction on the fact that "the (mainly Moslem) Bosnian army is still strong and that the Serb army does not want to take the town." [passage omitted] Despite the breaking of a 24-hour truce declared on Thursday [7 April], UNPROFOR spokesman Annink said General Rose was "quite optimistic" he could obtain a ceasefire between the warring sides on Saturday. [passage omitted] Annink pointed out here that the Serbs could have bombarded the city from the positions they had captured in recent days but had chosen not to do so. After taking Mount Gradina, the Serbs now hold 7.5 percent of the original Moslem pocket. This includes most of the right bank of the river Drina which the Serbs want to control along all its course and which follows the route between Zvornik-Gorazde-Gacko-Trebinje in southeastern Bosnia. UNPROFOR believes the Serbs are also trying to force the Bosnian government to sign a ceasefire just as it is notching up important military successes against Serb forces in northern Bosnia. Bosnian government troops have widened the Maglaj enclave it controls and threaten the Serb-held town of Doboj. Further north they are exerting pressure the corridor that links Serb-held territory in Bosnia and Croatia with Serbia proper. In the northwestern Bosnian town of Prijedor, the Bosnian Serbs said on Saturday they had arrested several people suspected of murdering some 20 Moslems at the end of March. Drago Vukovic, interior ministry spokesman for the self-proclaimed Serb Republic of Bosnia told AFP that those thought responsible for the killings were behind bars and that their names would be published soon. The killings spread terror among the 6,000 Moslems living in the region and forced the United Nations into negotiating their evacuation.
