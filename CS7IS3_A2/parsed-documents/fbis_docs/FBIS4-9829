The president said he was a close friend of the slain attorney, for whom he had great respect. The president was appalled by this undescribable crime, which has caused him great consternation. Such feelings are most surely shared by the people of Guatemala. We began an investigation as soon as we learned the news, the president added, assigning the case to the best investigative specialists available to the security forces. De Leon Carpio said the investigative teams have instructions to use all resources at their disposal to capture the perpetrators. De Leon added Gonzalez' death means the loss of a model Guatemalan citizen, a jurist of renowned prestige, and a true defender of democracy and peace. De Leon recalled that Justice Gonzalez, as CC president, played a leading role last year by enacting the resolutions that restored constitutional order following the events of 25 May. In condemning this crime, De Leon stated, the government reaffirms its determination to press on with its efforts to establish an atmosphere of security and coexistence in Guatemala. He concluded by expressing his condolences to Gonzalez' family, as well as his fellow justices, CC officials, and administrative personnel, wishing them forbearance in this moment of tragedy.
