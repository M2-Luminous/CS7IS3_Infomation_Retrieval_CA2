FR940527-2-00101 FR940527-2-00085 INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION [Finance Docket No. 32501] Gregory B. Cundiff_Continuance in Control Exemption_Lone Star Railroad, Inc. and Southern Switching Company Gregory B. Cundiff (Cundiff) has filed a notice of exemption to continue in control of Lone Star Railroad, Inc. (Lone Star) and Southern Switching Company (Southern), upon Lone Star and Southern becoming class III rail carriers. Lone Star and Southern, both noncarriers, have concurrently filed a notice of exemption in Lone Star Railroad, Inc. and Southern Switching Company_Acquisition and Operation Exemption_Line of Burlington Northern Railroad Company , Finance Docket No. 32500, for Lone Star to acquire and Southern to operate 143.3 miles of rail line owned by Burlington Northern Railroad Company (BN), between milepost 8.0 near Howard, and milepost 151.3 at Abilene, in Archer, Baylor, Knox, Haskell, Jones and Taylor Counties, TX. The transaction includes 8 miles and 331 feet of incidental trackage rights for Southern over BN between milepost 8.0 in the vicinity of Howard, and milepost 0.0 at Valley Jct., and from Valley Jct. east for 331 feet to point of switch in Sunshine Yard in Wichita Falls, Wichita County, TX. The parties intend to consummate on or after May 18, 1994. Cundiff also controls three class III rail carriers: Railroad Switching Service of Missouri, Inc. (operating approximately 4 miles of rail line in St. Louis, MO); Texas Railroad Switching, Inc. (operating 55 miles of rail line between Gardendale and Carrizo Springs, TX); and Rio Valley Railroad, Inc. (operating 49.12 miles of rail line between Harlingen and Mission, TX and between Mission and Hidalgo, TX). Cundiff indicates that: (1) The properties owned and operated by Lone Star and Southern and the class III rail carriers listed above do not connect with each other; (2) the continuance in control is not part of a series of anticipated transactions that would connect the railroads with each other or any railroad in their corporate family; and (3) the transaction does not involve a class I carrier. The transaction therefore is exempt from the prior approval requirements of 49 U.S.C. 11343. See 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(2). As a condition to use of this exemption, any employees affected by the transaction will be protected by the conditions set forth in New York Dock Ry._Control_Brooklyn Eastern Dist. , 360 I.C.C. 60 (1979). Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke will not automatically stay the transaction. Pleadings must be filed with the Commission and served on: Thomas F. McFarland, Jr., Belnap, Spencer, McFarland & Herman, 20 North Wacker Dr., Suite 3118, Chicago, IL 60606&hyph;3101. Decided: May 23, 1994. By the Commission, Joseph H. Dettmar, Acting Director, Office of Proceedings. Sidney L. Strickland, Jr., Secretary.
