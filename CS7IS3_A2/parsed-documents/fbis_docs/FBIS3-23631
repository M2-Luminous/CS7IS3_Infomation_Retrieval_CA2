This day has now become a holiday for a large number of people who see the entire meaning of their work in the protection of the life and health of people, preventing emergencies and catastrophes, and cleaning up after them. What are their daily tasks like? [Grechaninov] According to that law, for a year we have been living, working, and reforming the civil defense system, fulfilling the requirements and tasks contained in that document for creating a system for defending the life and health of people in Ukraine. During that time we have done a great deal of work for reorganizing the structure of the staff itself, we have published statutes on the civil defense staff of Ukraine and on regional civil defense staffs, and the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine is now considering a draft we submitted of the Statute on Civil Defense and a number of other documents that would make it possible to create the legal base necessary for successful performance of the tasks set for civil defense. And here they are. The main one is to prevent emergencies, and namely accidents and catastrophes of a technical nature. And if they occur anyway--to clean up after them skillfully and quickly, to render aid to the victims, to provide life support systems, etc. From this follows an entire complex of tasks, beginning with prompt notification and ending with aid to the suffering population after the cleanup. This is a long list of jobs which require special forces and means. Therefore, the civil defense forces consist of civil defense troops of specialized formations and nonmilitarized formations. There does not seem to be any need to explain in detail just what civil defense troops are. But their specialized formations are worth discussing. They include highly qualified specialists--rescue workers who provide guaranteed service for various dangerous enterprises. We in Ukraine have 1,693 of these enterprises in the chemical area alone. The country has too many sources of danger: Among them are nuclear power plants and water reservoirs, which in the right circumstances could be the cause of great catastrophes. There are also possible earthquakes. Or, for example, the danger of secondary consequences -- a break in the dam of the sedimentation pond at a chemical enterprise, etc. [Dmitriyev] Do you have a certain kind of specialists or is it possible to teach just any soldier to do the job? [Grechaninov] It is difficult to train the same soldier psychologically for action in extreme situations when, for example, there has been an earthquake or a landslide and it is necessary to look through the heaps of rubble and rescue people, to drag the victims out, etc. And it cannot be ruled out that it will be necessary to deal with the dead, the wounded... This is far from easy. Therefore we have special training aimed at developing in the individual the necessary qualities and psychological stability in the most difficult of situations. We have a very broad scope of training. The main thing is that we must have specialists who are capable of working while wearing the necessary protective clothing, depending on the nature of the production and the accident. They include people capable of working under water, of jumping from the air in a disaster zone; they include specialists capable of evaluating a situation on the spot, making a decision, and correctly carrying out what they have decided, which is very important. Because if a mistake is made in emergency rescue work, the consequences can sometimes be irreparable; for example, if you disturb a pile of rubble and do not manage to save the people. A high level of professionalism is achieved through constant training. And we are now placing our hopes in the idea of having our people work under contract, that is, for several years. Because it is very difficult to train a skilled specialist in a year and a half: His training is long and varied. Further. We have specialized subdivisions--like the Spetsat [expansion not indicated], the Poltava detachment for cleanup after accidents at petroleum deposits, the Dneprodzerzhinsk and Zaporozhye chemical detachments, and others. These people under today's conditions (let me note that they are excellent specialists) must have good wages and proper social protection. Otherwise they will go to commercial structures. And there are truly dedicated people among them... This is one of today's problems. [Dmitriyev] But your people need not only a high level of mastery but, frequently, also courage, heroism... [Grechaninov] Our people never think about whether it is heroism or not. Suffice it to recall that at the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant the first readings of the radiation around the destroyed reactor were taken by our officers, particularly Aleksandr Tomlenov. It was a civil defense specialist who took the first helicopter flight to take readings over the reactor. We have a lot of problems, for example, with the little "presents" left on the land after a war. Most frequently they are large-capacity aerial bombs which are beyond our specialists' range of competency. And, as a rule, all of them have the kind of device and are in a condition that they can be neither lifted nor transported--they must be defused on the spot. Well, you can imagine the difficulties our specialists encounter when they discover explosives in densely populated residential areas of cities or on the site of an industrial enterprise. And in spite of the fact that in such situations it is very dangerous to work with the "rusty death" that has been discovered, our people defuse them, raise them to the surface, and take them to a safe place, where they are exploded. Literally a couple of days ago an ammunition depot from the war was discovered in Kiev. And what is to be done with it? Next door is a residential building. Accompanied by the president's representative in the city and the rayon, we inspected the place. A decision has now been made to clear the mines from the depot without resettling the residents of the nearby buildings. It is possible to give many examples of our people's heroism. Especially in gas rescue work. Let us face it, accidents occur at our chemically dangerous enterprises. And here our brave specialists, as soon as they hear the alarm, boldly go to clean up after the accident and fulfill their mission. Or recall Chernobyl. Very many officers and enlisted men of civil defense units put their best foot forward there. In particular it was our specialists who removed the heavy water from the destroyed reactor. Today our people are working indefatigably in spite of all the objective and subjective difficulties. First among them I would like to note the civil defense chiefs of staff of Lvov Oblast Colonel Damir Shafigulin, Kiev--Colonel Vladimir Zinkin, and Poltava--Colonel Leonid Martyninko, and the leader of the Zaporozhye specialized formation--Boris Udod. I can give the names of many self-sacrificing workers and highly qualified specialists. But even among them there are those who are the best. There are especially many of them among the subordinates of Boris Petrovich Udod. Several days ago this collective had occasion to participate in the cleanup after the collapse of the concrete ceiling of the building of the Zaporozhye Oblast trade union association. No mechanized equipment could be used there. Therefore the specialists did everything by hand. And in three hours the aftermath of the accident had been cleaned up, supports had been placed under the vault of the building, and everything necessary had been done to make sure that it did not collapse completely. This formation has very wide-ranging tasks. It is meant to perform emergency rescue work at metallurgical and chemical facilities. Its specialists perform difficult jobs for prevention, including those that even the personnel of the facility refuse to do--they are so difficult and dangerous. Brigade commander Colonel Aleksandr Yevdin, regiment commander Yevgeniy Konov, chief of the brigade's engineering service Major Vladimir Potapenko, and many other officers enjoy well-deserved respect. [Dmitriyev] Few of our readers understand what the words "civil defense" really mean. What do your formations do, what is the principle of leadership of the country's civil defense? [Grechaninov] The principle of civil defense is territorial-production. The chief of the country's civil defense is the prime minister, and the civil defense chiefs in the oblasts and rayons are representatives of the president of Ukraine. At enterprises they are the managers. Each of them has a commission for emergencies and nonmilitarized formations. Because the volume of work that must be done constitutes a whole complex of measures. If, for example, it is necessary to resettle people to evacuate them somewhere, someone has to provide them with shelter, clothing, food, and medical assistance. Finally, jobs must be found for them. And all this is the responsibility of the civil defense. Therefore it is the task of the civil defense staff and the regional staffs to coordinate the actions of the ministries, departments, various structures, enterprises, and all organs of power for organized work according to a single plan. [Dmitriyev] Well, who is the first to receive the alarm in the localities? How is the mechanism for your reaction engaged? [Grechaninov] The existing civil defense system, which is now being restructured, makes it possible to react rapidly to all cataclysms that arise. We have people on duty in our civil defense staff headquarters. Plus, in a number of regions (in Lvov, Dnepropetrovsk, Odessa, and other oblasts) special groups have been created which, if necessary, go to the site and report on everything to the civil defense staff and then immediately organize the work that is necessary in such situations. Now, according to predictions, the strong winds in Transcarpathia are supposed to get up to 40 meters per second. We too are preparing for this. Instructions have been given to the local areas to reinforce the special repair groups of electricians, communications experts, etc. so that it will be possible to promptly correct any damage caused by the elements. In general, all the work is being done for prevention in Transcarpathia. [Dmitriyev] Transcarpathia now has a difficult situation caused by the mountain rivers overflowing their banks. Large regions have been flooded and many villages have suffered. Assistance is needed in resettling people from the destroyed homes. Are your people participating in the rescue work there? [Grechaninov] Most actively. It is possible to give many examples of self-sacrificing participation of our subdivisions in all the work. It is difficult even to single anybody out. The people let nothing stop them from rescuing the victims, organizing their evacuation, and giving them blood, food, and medical assistance. [Dmitriyev] In other words, they are doing their duty honorably. Many people are in need of their help. In this connection a question arises: What about civil defense itself, does it need help from the state? What problems does your department have? [Grechaninov] During all of 1993 the collective of the staff of the civil defense of Ukraine was working with dedication to improve the country's civil defense system. At the same time objective difficulties, primarily financial ones, are impacting the effectiveness of the measures we are taking. Thus the chief of civil defense is the prime minister. His frequent replacement has a negative impact on the state of affairs... In order to carry out the difficult task in the region that is affected the specialists need special equipment, instruments, means of personal protection, etc. And all this requires the corresponding material expenditures. Unfortunately, financial matters become worse each year. Although one should understand that the more money that is invested in measures for prevention of accidents and emergencies, the lower the cost of cleaning up after them. [Dmitriyev] Nonetheless, your department has a considerable potential of its own. Are any attempts being made to take advantage of internal reserves? [Grechaninov] Understanding the difficulty of the economic situation in the country, of course, we are assessing its capabilities realistically and searching for additional reserves, including in international activity. In particular, civil defense of Russia has received tens of millions of dollars for delivering humanitarian aid cargo through the UN. And this year we too want to become involved in the implementation of the humanitarian aid programs of this international organization. We are now very much in need of money. Because we have conceived and are working on one necessary system. [Dmitriyev] One wonders what it is needed for, if, of course, it is not a secret. [Grechaninov] Our specialists are working on a system of notification which would automatically inform the civil defense staff if an accident occurs at a dangerous enterprise. And then it would not make any difference whether the manager wanted to inform us of this promptly or not--we would have our own information about what happened. Remember how much time they remained silent about the accidents at the Beloyarsk and Chernobyl nuclear power plants?... We have already achieved certain results in this area. We are now automatically receiving information from a number of facilities with chemical and radiation danger. But we must make sure that this is a system that will enable us to monitor completely everything that can present a threat to the life and health of the population. Furthermore, in keeping with the concept of civil defense, each regiment has an emergency rescue battalion on 30-minute alert, and in the brigade there are two. In other words, the personnel of these subdivisions are prepared to move with their technical equipment to the site of the contamination within a half hour. But we are not satisfied with the questions of financing. We need money to buy means of minor mechanization, technical equipment, instruments, etc. The quality of the emergency rescue work depends directly on this. [Dmitriyev] From all that has been said, one can draw the conclusion that your department has concerns 24 hours a day. Just take ecology. What "presents" the elements sometimes throws in your way... [Grechaninov] You are right about that. Just yesterday we had to solve a problem that arose before us: Ice was floating on the rivers on the territory of Belarus. So we can expect it on our territory soon as well, on the Dnieper. The threat is that enormous amounts of water can accumulate, and they are capable of washing away dams in the region of the 30-kilometer zone of Chernobyl... So we are now working in close cooperation with the Ministry of Water Management of Ukraine, the hydrometeorological service, and our Belarusian colleagues. [Dmitriyev] In other words, you have international ties and contacts as well... [Grechaninov] Quite right. One of the tasks of our civil defense system is international activity for rendering humanitarian aid and peace-making efforts. We are working on bilateral agreements with our neighboring states--Poland, Slovakia, and Belarus--so that in the event of a situation on both sides of the border it would be possible to coordinate our actions in matters of civil defense and localize the consequences through joint efforts. Incidentally, in a recent critique of a recent joint strategic staff training session President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk concretized the tasks for the establishment of international contacts of the country's civil defense. This is what I wanted to note. We have a unique center for modeling and predicting catastrophes. There is nothing like it in Europe. Now our specialists can quickly and concretely model one or another situation and its possible consequences. It has already been tested repeatedly. This makes it possible to promptly take correct and timely actions, beginning with removing people, evacuating them, so that they do not end up in the affected zone, and ending with cleaning up the aftermath. The center has been visited by representatives of the UN, and apparently this organization is going to ask us to model for other countries the possible variants of the development of events in the case of the appearance of one emergency situation or another. [Dmitriyev] As I understand it, this order will not be free of charge... [Grechaninov] Of course it will be possible to earn foreign currency for the state this way. [Dmitriyev] But how does the interaction between our civil defense and that of neighboring states occur in practice? Are there examples? [Grechaninov] As one example, I can discuss the following. In Izmail in Odessa Oblast we have a pulp and cardboard combine which has large amounts of chlorine. Last summer there was a fire there which threatened to cause a discharge of a considerable quantity of substances that are dangerous to the health, and not only of city dwellers but also of the population on the territory of the neighboring state--Romania. Within 20 minutes after the signal was received in the civil defense staff headquarters, both the president and the prime minister had on their desks the conclusions and suggestions necessary for making a decision. Our border guards and other departments were promptly notified. The corresponding information was also sent to the Romanian Embassy, for which the government of this state expressed its gratitude to us. [Dmitriyev] On this holiday I want to wish happiness and good health to you and all who work and serve with you in the civil defense of Ukraine. And that you have fewer occasions to go to disaster zones! [Grechaninov] Unfortunately, the number of accidents and catastrophes is not decreasing. Contributions toward the cleanup are immense. And under the conditions of today's economy this is a difficult burden which it has to bear. Therefore, we will do everything we can to protect the country's economy by reducing the number of catastrophes and the difficulty of cleaning up their aftermath. Because there is a certain pattern here. The more powerful and richer the civil defense, the fewer the preconditions for accidents and other emergency situations, and the less it is necessary to spend on cleaning up after them.
