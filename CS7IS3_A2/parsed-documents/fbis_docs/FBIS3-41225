The police report that the members of this organization of alleged money launderers had lived in Quito since 1987, so it is assumed that in the last seven years they have conducted a number of illicit money laundering activities, whose extent will be determined as the investigations progress. In addition to the weapons and communications equipment confiscated by the police, a number of items and real estate properties were seized, including expensive jewelry collections valued at about $500,000 (approximately 1 billion sucres). Seizures Police spokespersons reported yesterday that to date 90 percent of the money launderers' assets have been confiscated. These items include the house at No. 258 Calle Hidalgo de Pinto y De la Alcabalas in the residential area of El Bosque which, the police say, with all its contents, could be worth more than $700,000 (over 1.4 billion sucres). The Montenegro Freire family lived in this three-story house with a penthouse, and from here they ran their illegal businesses, using as a cover the luxury automobile dealership located at Avenida Amazonas and Santa Maria. In this house the police found a collection of 28 paintings by a variety of artists, whose commercial value has not been determined; it will, however, be several billion sucres. The other assets, two apartments in exclusive Quito neighborhoods, are valued at over 1 billion sucres. Bank Accounts According to the police, the persons arrested had numerous accounts in various banks in Ecuador. Huge sums in both foreign and national currency have been deposited in the last two years. The investigations are continuing in order to determine the precise amount of money the Montenegro Freire family had. The police have said that details on the group's financial movements will be released in the next few hours. Only the 8 million sucres seized in the initial raid have now been reported. This amount was found in their residence. Vehicles So far 10 vehicles of different makes and models have been seized, as well as three brand new motorcycles. The automobiles included: a dark red BMW with no license plates valued at 260 million sucres; a red BMW with license plates PLH-058, valued at 100 million sucres; a black Mercedes-Benz with license plates PLH-169, valued at 253 million sucres. The other vehicles were: a Chevy van with license plates OBZ-014, valued at 140 million sucres; another Chevy van with license plates GCN-284 (same price as the first); a Chevrolet Swift, license plates IBL-704; a Chevrolet Vitara jeep, license plates PLT-922; a Lancia PKG-188; a Suzuki Forsa, license plates PHL-107; and another Suzuki Forsa, with plates PHL-706.
