FBIS4-39487 "drsov110_e_94011" FBIS-SOV-94-110 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 UKRAINE International Affairs Turkmen Natural Gas Supplies Lag Behind Schedule Turkmen Natural Gas Supplies Lag Behind Schedule WS0806070994 Kiev UKRINFORM in English 0529 GMT 7 Jun 94 WS0806070994 Kiev UKRINFORM English BFN [From the "Business News Weekly" feature, 30 May-5 Jun 94] [Text] During the 27 May through 1 June period 311.9 million cu. m. of Turkmen natural gas were piped to Ukraine instead of the planned 384.5 million cu. m. amount. According to Ukrgazprom's maintenance-dispatching service, in this way 1,207.6 million cu. m. of natural gas failed to be piped to Ukraine, as of early June. Meanwhile, Russia's natural gas exporter has kept piping extra amounts of natural gas to Ukraine. Thus, within the 27 May-1 June period Russia exported 2,869.9 million cu. m. of natural gas, almost 42 million cu. m. of which were in excess of the agreed amount. All-in-all, 541.5 million cu. m. of extra natural gas amounts were piped to Ukraine, as of early June 1994. According to Yevgeni Sukhin, first deputy chairperson of the Ukrainian State Committee for oil and gas, Russia's stable supplies allowed Ukrgazprom to store about 17 b. cu. m. of natural gas in underground facilities by late May, some portion of which stock will belong to Ukraine. As Yevgeni Sukhin maintains, if Russia and Turkmenistan continue their supplies at present rates, Ukraine will be able to catch up with its gas storaging schedule, currently keeping at an over forthnight's time-lag, which is about 25 per cent lower versus 1993's respective amount, though it will be a hard job. Ukraine's domestic gas consumption has been much lower, than normally with late May's averaged daily consumption rate of 195 million cu. m. versus April's 240 million cu. m. According to Mr. Sukhin, April's gas consumption cost Ukraine $7 million a day with 1,000 cu. m. of natural gas priced at $50, even considering Ukraine's domestic extraction of 50 million cu. m. of the above amount. Gas transit piping charges cost Ukraine additional $50 million. January's daily consumption of natural gas was as high as 320 million cu. m. During the 27 May-1 June period of 1994, Ukrainian domestic consumers utilized 979 million cu. m. of natural gas versus the planned 1,319.5 million cu. m. figure. According to Ukrgazprom, 2,150.1 million cu. m. of natural gas was saved to be piped to reserve stocks, due to suspended gas supplies to debtor- enterprises.
