Toshihiko Tsuruoka, former director general of the Food Agency, told a press conference that farming in Japan will be very different in the future from what it is today. "Creating a stronger farming base is my task. Japan is small but the land has high productivity. So I believe that we can do it if proper measures suited to each region are taken," he said. Asked about criticism that farm ministry officials should take responsibility for Japan's decision to lift its ban on rice imports last year, Tsuruoka said his responsibility "lies in carrying out what I should do, which is to help farmers prepare for the rice market opening." Former vice farm minister Akio Kyoya, also at the press meeting, said he had to make "a painful choice" as a negotiator directly involved in the Uruguay Round of global trade talks, which completed in December. He denied any connection between the rice decision and his retirement.
