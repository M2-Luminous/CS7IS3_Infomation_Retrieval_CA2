Only with a coordinated tax rate can the outflow of German capital to other countries be prevented, a phenomenon that has been observed ever since the introduction of tax on interest rates in Germany. In an interview with this writer, Waigel said the subject will not be finally settled while Germany holds the presidency, "but we will probably reach political decisions that can be implemented. One cannot place excess demands on others. Negotiations on this matter can be continued under France's EU presidency." Waigel spoke out in favor of pursuing the principle of subsidiarity. He said there is a compulsory tax on interest rates in every EU country, but each country applies a different tax system. "Things should remain that way," said Waigel. "All we are concerned with is preventing a citizen of one country from evading this tax by going to another country. Such an evasion would not lie in any country's interests." The finance minister spoke out in favor of including as many OECD countries as possible in a suitable agreement. [passage omitted]
