According to an article in THE NEW HERALD, an increasingly long list of North Americans, perhaps 30, have lost their property in Honduras due to expropriation, embezzlement, or illegal maneuvers to the point that the incidents are irritating Washington and its relations with Honduras. The article includes quotes from statements made by a U.S. Embassy official in our country according to whom investing or buying real estate in Honduras is extremely risky. He adds that North American investors and owners want to do everything correctly, in strict abidance by Honduran laws, but piranhas are eating them alive. Undoubtedly, the article seriously affects Honduras' chances of attracting highly sought foreign investments. [Begin Callejas recording] In my opinion, it is obvious that much of this happens because it is presumed that the law will always favor them because they are North Americans. That is not necessarily the case. [end recording] According to the president, the situation could undermine relations between the two countries, particularly trade relations. [Begin Callejas recording] Remember that the United States makes the introduction of our products under preferential terms contingent upon its foreign policy, so complex situations may arise. [end recording] The president mentioned the case of the United Nations Park, which was erroneously registered in a person's name during General Tiburcio Carias Andino's administration even though the families that owned the land at the time were compensated. [Begin Callejas recording] A North American purchased the land even though he knew about this error, or perhaps he acted in good faith. However, an error in the implementation of the law does not imply that the state is guilty of an illegitimate action. Therefore, the state believes it has the right to purchase the land at El Picacho. That is one of the cases involved. Consequently, we must be fair here and act within the framework of Honduran society. We must accept the fact that the North Americans are not necessarily right all the time. [end recording]
