The text of the agreement in English was forwarded to TANJUG from the office of Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic: "In the spirit of UN Security Council Resolution 913 of 21 April 1994, the UN secretary general's special envoy for the former Yugoslavia and civilian and military authorities of the Bosnian Serbs agreed on the following: 1. Immediate and total cease-fire in the territory of Gorazde and around it. 2. As the first step, the urgent deployment of one UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] battalion in a 3-km radius around the center of Gorazde and on both banks of the river Drina; that battalion will monitor and supervise from close quarters whether both sides are observing the cease-fire and will report on it. Heavy artillery will be immediately handed over to UNPROFOR or will be withdrawn to a distance from which it will not threaten the Gorazde safety zone, and in a way that will not interfere with a procedure, which will be agreed upon later in line with paragraph three of Resolution 913 [as received]. 3. Guarantees for safe conditions for an urgent medical evacuation from Gorazde. 4. Complete freedom of movement for all UNPROFOR personnel and humanitarian organizations. 5. Urgent opening of talks to discuss -- with good intentions -- all military issues to diffuse tensions, separate forces, create safe and peaceful conditions, and meet the humanitarian needs of the civilian population. 6. The intention is that the implementation of the above measures should contribute to reinforcing efforts directed towards reaching an overall political solution all sides would approve."
