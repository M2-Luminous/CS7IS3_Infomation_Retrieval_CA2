The station is the second private radio station, along with the "RMF" radio from Krakow, that will air programmes nationwide. Bender told a press conference that he hopes that the licence for the third non-public radio station, the Catholic "Maryja" radio, will be signed next week. Owner of the Radio "Zet" station Andrzej Wojciechowski said that his radio would change its programmes and start as a completely new station. He also said that on Thursday afternoon his radio will start broadcasting a special signal, inaudible to human ear, that will act as a repellent to mosquitoes. The signal will resemble sounds emitted by bats.
