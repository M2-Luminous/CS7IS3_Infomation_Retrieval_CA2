The Krajina Government demands that UNPROFOR withdraw all combat equipment within 24 hours, upon receipt of this demand, ISKRA reports. To this effect, a meeting between representatives of the Krajina government and UNPROFOR should have been held today -- but UNPROFOR representatives informed through mediators that they would not be coming due to fears for their personal safety. The RSK Government considers the failure of UNPROFOR representatives to show up as extremely frivolous, and the reasons stated as suspicious and provocative, the Krajina Government protest says, adding that the demonstration of force by UNPROFOR causes a feeling of fear among the Krajina population living on the territory of western Slavonia. The people of Krajina know well where the danger comes from and expect UNPROFOR to be deployed there, not on a bridge that connects the Serb people, the protest says in conclusion.
