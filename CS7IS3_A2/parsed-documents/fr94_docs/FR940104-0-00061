FR940104-0-00061 FR940104-0-00015 EPA has adopted a scenario-based regional modeling approach that uses input parameters developed for regions of the U.S. where sawmills are more prevalent. In this approach, EPA uses average and high-end values for estimating model input parameters on a regional basis because information does not exist on the actual means and distributions of these parameters for the regions modeled. The Agency believes that this approach is an appropriate one and, furthermore, that the resulting model estimates bracket or bound the uncertainty associated with the model input parameters. Two commenters questioned the use of cancer as the endpoint of concern for 2,3,7,8-TCDD. EPA disagrees. The cancer endpoint for TCDD was selected because it is the most sensitive endpoint for which qualitative dose response data are available. 2,3,7,8-TCDD has been demonstrated to be a potent carcinogen in animals and has been classified as a B2 (potential human) carcinogen. Recently published epidemiological studies of occupationally exposed individuals report significant increases in cancer mortality. 2,3,7,8-TCDD also has potent reproductive and teratogenic endpoints and enough data exist to estimate a reference dose (RfD) based on these alternative short-term effects. (For a detailed discussion of this information, and for references to studies supporting these conclusions, the reader is referred to the background document of the proposed rule.) However, if health-based levels (HBLs) are calculated using the reproductive effect RfD, the exposure level is an order of magnitude higher than the level calculated using the carcinogen slope factor (CSF). Thus, if the cancer end-point is used as the basis for calculating a permissible exposure level, it also will be protective against short-term exposures such as those associated with reproductive effects. The issue of 2,3,7,8-TCDD toxicity is being reassessed by EPA (outside the framework of this rulemaking) and all endpoints are being considered. TCDD has been observed to express a wide variety of effects including teratogenesis, reproductive effects, and suppression of the immune system function in many species. Mechanistic approaches to understanding and identifying toxic effects levels are also being considered. Until the reassessment process has been completed, the EPA will continue to use the current carcinogenicity endpoint CSF value that has been accepted as the basis for the MCL. Two commenters noted limitations associated with the use of the Toxicity Equivalence Factors (TEF's) methodology. They argued that the TEF methodology should not be used to justify the addition of appendix VIII in the absence of valid toxicological studies that demonstrate actual health effects associated with exposure to these compounds. One commenter questioned the proposal to add Octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (OCDD) and Octachlorodibenzofuran (OCDF) to 40 CFR part 261, appendix VIII. The commenters stated that neither compound has been shown to produce toxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic or teratogenic effects on humans or other life forms. The Agency has decided not to add, at this time, OCDD and OCDF to appendix VIII of 40 CFR part 261. Although the original basis for including these congeners on appendix VIII remains valid (details of which can be found in the background document supporting this final rulemaking), the Agency is investigating further the information submitted by the commenters regarding the effects of OCDD and OCDF reported in the Couture, Elwell, and Birnbaum study used to support the decisions made in the ``Interim Procedures for Estimating Risks Associated with Exposures of Mixtures of Chlorinated Dibenzo-p-dioxins and Dibenzofurans and the 1989 Update''. OCDD and OCDF are the most prevalent of the PCDD and PCDF congeners accounting for approximately 85 percent of the total CDD and CDF present in five of the six storage yard soil samples. OCDD has been shown to exhibit ``dioxin-like'' toxicity in male rats when administered in small doses in a sub-chronic toxicity study. 2 These findings have been confirmed by a second sub-chronic study conducted in female rats. 3 OCDD and OCDF have not exhibited toxicity in short term studies; however, acute exposure is not the only concern of EPA. The Agency is currently re-evaluating its original assessment of risks from dioxin. At this point, the Agency wishes to conclude its on-going reassessment before adding OCDD and OCDF to appendix VIII of 40 CFR part 261. 2 Couture, L.A., M. R. Elwell, and L. S. Birnbaum.

One commenter questioned the conclusion that soil contamination presents no risk to wildlife. The EPA recognizes that concentrations that are protective of human health may not necessarily always be protective of wildlife. However, in view of the relatively small areas occupied by sawmills and the low concentration of TCDD&hyph;TEQ in storage yard soil from cross contamination, the EPA believes the incremental risks to wildlife will be below a level of concern. V. Overview of the Final Rule This final rule makes final the Agency's hazardous waste listing determination for chlorophenolic wastes generated at wood surface protection plants. EPA believes that listing as hazardous chlorophenolic wastes from surface protection operations is unnecessary for reasons described in Part A of this preamble. This document also amends SW&hyph;846 (Test Methods For Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods) by adding Method 4010 (Immunoassay Test for the Presence of Pentachlorophenol). This action is discussed in Section VI of this preamble. This final rule also adds four chemicals to the list of hazardous constituents at 40 CFR part 261, appendix VIII. These four chemicals are: (1) Sodium pentachlorophenate, (2) potassium pentachlorophenate, (3) sodium tetrachlorophenate, and (4) potassium tetrachlorophenate. A discussion of this action is found in part C of this section.
