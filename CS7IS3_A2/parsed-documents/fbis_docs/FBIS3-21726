Orejuela was being held at DIJIN [Judicial Police and Investigations Directorate] headquarters after he was arrested during a narcotics operation in Cali. The alleged drug trafficker developed symptoms of angina, which prompted authorities to take him to a cardiology center. Orejuela was admitted to the Shaio Clinic on the evening of 17 February with severe chest pains, nausea, and fatigue. Specialists performed a catheter exploration and found one artery was 90 percent obstructed. Orejuela also suffers from diabetes, which will affect his present cardiac condition. Doctors will perform surgery to remove the obstruction. Orejuela is now in his room in this clinic under permanent DIJIN and Metropolitan Police guard. The only visitors he is allowed are his wife, father, and attorney.
