The Chinese premier made the announcement at a press conference here this afternoon, a day before ending his tour of Central Asia. Asked about Sino-Russian relations, Li called the growth of such ties normal in the past few years. President Boris Yeltsin paid a fruitful visit to China and bilateral trade has surpassed the level of that with the former Soviet Union, Li said. Touching on the so-called China's intention to "fill in the vacuum" left by the disintegration of the former Soviet Union, Li restated that China seeks no spheres of influence, neither political or economic, in Central Asia. "We have a lot of matters to take care of at home and have no interest or intention to fill in the so-called vacuum," Li said. His visit is meant to develop friendship with the Central Asian nations and not directed against any other countries, Li said.
