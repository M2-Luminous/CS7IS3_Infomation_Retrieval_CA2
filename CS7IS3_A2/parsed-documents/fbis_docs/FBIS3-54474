So far the Majles has researched and investigated at various levels in numerous instances having to do with the performance of organizations, bodies and management, in implementation of Article 67 of the Constitution. However, none have received reactions on the scale of the latest incident. Perhaps this is for the following reasons: A. The performance of the Voice and Vision organization, as the most important pillar of the fourth power, with its effective and fateful role and society, has never been officially examined and supervised in the period since the triumph of the Islamic revolution. Since the revision of the Constitution, the Voice and Vision organization has been under the direct supervision of the vice-regent, and some have thought that a body under the leader's supervision should not be studied and subjected to research and investigation. At the time the research and investigation of the performance of the Voice and Vision organization was proposed, his excellency clearly stated: "Study it carefully, do the research and investigation, and study individuals, too." B. After the research and investigation report was read in the Majles, the supervisor of the Voice and Vision organization, continuing his illegal measures, took an official position against research and investigation on the Voice of the Majles. He drew boundaries and directions for the Majles, and by creating public controversy and intimidating the deputies, he tried to keep the Majles from performing its lawful responsibilities. He threatened that if things were said in the open Majles sessions that he judged to be incorrect, they would be answered in Voice and Vision programming. C. The continuation of the illegal measures involving the personal use of the Voice and Vision and the failure to heed notices given caused the exalted leader to intervene and prevent the radio broadcast of further installments of the answer to the Majles from the supervisor of the Voice and Vision organization. The unworthy acts of the supervisor of the Voice and Vision organization were that in subsequent portions of the answer to the Majles and also on his answer to the statement given to the press from the Majles public relations office, he made inappropriate and distorted use of the Constitution and ordinary laws to try to justify broadcasting his answer over the radio. Instead of apologizing to the leader and the Majles and realizing the illegality of his willful use of the resources of the Voice and Vision organization, he continued to insist on his position. Did any of the Majles deputies, the Friday imams, clergymen or writers who took a position on this matter prevent the supervisor of the Voice and Vision organization from pursuing the issues in the research and investigation through legal channels? No, everyone said and wrote that if he believed his honor had been attacked or if his rights had been violated, he should pursue the matter through lawful authorities, but he cannot violate the Constitution and ordinary laws, including Article 49 of the Law on the General Policies and Principles of the Programs of the Voice and Vision organization, which emphatically prohibit any kind of illegal activity in the country, by laying the groundwork for heresy that distorts to high heaven. Article 6 of the Law on the General Policies and Principles of the Programs of the Voice and Vision Organization, which happens also to have been cited by the manager of the Voice and Vision organization, states: respect the human dignity of individuals and refrain from affronting their honor, in accordance with Islamic regulations." In the answer from the Voice and Vision organization, which was broadcast over the radio, this provision was clearly violated, and the honor of the Majles deputies was affronted. If it is to be established in an Islamic system, which negates selfishness, that individuals can promote their ideas by intimidating the nation's lawful bodies, the edifice will not stand. This is the issue that took the issue of the research and investigation of the performance of the Voice and Vision organization beyond the ordinary course of events, and the controversy will continue as long as there is continued refusal to submit to the law. The philosophy of research and investigation depends on the proper conduct of affairs, the discovery of incorrectness and distortions, and dealing with violators. Its purpose will be defeated if the body or individuals being investigated and researched heedlessly continue with what they were doing. The roots of many problems and violations in some bodies and organizations are to be found in selfishness and the failure to submit to laws. If these roots are not cut off, they will grow again and their branches and leaves will be everywhere.
