According to him, Slovenia has won considerable recognition recently. Brussels supported our country's becoming an associate member of the European Union, while NATO, after the signing of the Partnership for Peace agreement, expressed full readiness for cooperation with us. Praise for the improving economic situation could also be heard from the leading international economists. The prime minister also analyzed the domestic political situation thoroughly. Sandi Frelih reports: [Begin recording] [Frelih] [passage omitted] Regarding the political situation, the prime minister says that, after last night's departure of the Social Democrats from the government, all three major parliamentary parties are analyzing the situation, by which they will try to redefine the relations between the coalition partners in such a way that the coalition could function until the end of its mandate. [Drnovsek] A wider parliamentary support suits me, as prime minister, more--therefore, the support of all three biggest parties, which gives me a certain majority in the parliament. Of course, all this is on the condition that their mutual differences can be settled in such a way that the efficient functioning of the government and parliament would be possible. If this wider option does not materialize--that is, if one of the partners can no longer participate in the tripartite coalition--we will consider the next best option, that is, the option that would secure the most stable work of the government. [Frelih] [passage omitted] When asked about the participation of the Christian Democrats as a government party at the anticorruption rally, Drnovsek replied that the party president, Lojze Peterle, had assured him that the rally was not a meeting directed against the government. [Drnovsek] [words indistinct] the assurances that the president of the Christian Democrat,s Mr. Peterle, gave to me--that is, that if the party takes part it will under no circumstances participate in an antigovernment meeting because it is a government party and bears the responsibility for all the hitherto events, and so does Mr. Jansa, who was a member of this government for four years and who, because of the duration of his mandate and his post, had more scope to influence affairs than I had in my two years of work in this government. Mr. Peterle, too, enjoys a rather long mandate in this government as do other Christian Democrats. [passage omitted] [end recording]
