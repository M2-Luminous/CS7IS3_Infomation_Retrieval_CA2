He pointed out that the state has not treated everyone equally and has failed to make Christians feel that it cares about them as much as other citizens. He noted that except for faith in God, freedom is Lebanon's one and only asset. He pointed out that all complaints reflect violations of the principle of national accord. Patriarch Sfayr's remarks came in his Easter message to the Lebanese today.
