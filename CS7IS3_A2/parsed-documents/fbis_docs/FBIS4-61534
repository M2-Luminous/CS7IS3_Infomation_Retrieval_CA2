Shumeyko, chairman of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly Federation Council, and dated 27 April 1994] [Text] The Federation Council notes that in accordance with the Russian Federation Federal Assembly Federation Council decree dated 26 February 1994 No. 51-I FC "On Legislative Support for the Functioning of the Russian Federation Agro-Industrial Complex," the Federation Council Agrarian Policy Committee, together with the Russian Federation Government, Federation Council and State Duma committees, and federal organs of state power organized parliamentary hearings 18 March and 4 April 1994 on questions connected with conducting agrarian reform in the Russian Federation and reviving and developing agro-industrial production through the year 2000. The majority of participants in the parliamentary hearings recognized that the agrarian reform in the Russian Federation begun in 1991 is being conducted in the absence not just of a state program for transformations in the agro-industrial complex, but also of a scientifically validated concept of it. At the same time, many of the edicts of the Russian Federation president and Russian Federation Government decrees and directives in accordance with which agrarian reform is being conducted are frequently contradictory, and sometimes simply wrong. They are not divided into phases, the measures carried out are not comprehensive, and it has not been determined to what extent they are effective. Decisions by representative organs of power on agrarian questions are frequently not carried out. As a result of the implementation of an ill-considered economic policy, the country's agro-industrial complex is in the grip of a serious crisis. Production of agro-industrial output is falling sharply. The country is becoming increasingly dependent on export purchases of food, which is leading to Russia's dependence on foreign states not only in terms of food and economics, but also politically. Price, credit, taxation, and investment policy has completely wrecked the financial state of the sector and stopped the process of expanded reproduction in the agro-industrial complex. Practically all farms have found themselves insolvent because of the unequal growth in the price of industrial and agricultural output. State programs for the development of land fertility, agricultural machine-building, the construction of housing and public amenities, roads, and gas, electricity, water supply, and telephone communications plants in villages have been wound up. Believing the aforementioned attitudes to reforming the agro-industrial complex to be profoundly wrong, the Federation Council decrees: 1. To instruct the Russian Federation Government: To task the Russian Federation Ministry of Agriculture and Foodstuffs and the Russian Academy of Agricultural Sciences, together with other interested Russian Federation ministries and departments, with doing further work on the state program for conducting agrarian reform in the Russian Federation and the program for reviving and developing agro-industrial production through the year 2000 as quickly as possible. To submit the government program for conducting agrarian reform in the Russian Federation for examination by the State Duma and the Federation Council no later than May 1994, and the program for reviving and developing agro-industrial production through the year 2000 no later than June 1994; To elaborate and ratify concrete measures of protectionist policy for 1994 and 1995, ensuring a solution to the crisis and the stabilization of production in the agro-industrial complex; Together with the Russian Federation Central Bank, to elaborate conditions for the preferential short-term and long-term crediting of the agro-industrial complex. 2. Within the process of work on the draft federal law "On Agricultural Scientific Institutions and Their Science and Production Base," to task the Federation Council Agrarian Policy Committee with conducting parliamentary hearings on the aforesaid draft law in May-June 1994. [Signed] V.F. Shumeyko, chairman of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly Federation Council Moscow 27 April 1994 No. 111-I FC
