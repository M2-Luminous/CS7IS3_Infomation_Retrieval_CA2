The initial consequences have already been seen in the States of Amazonas and Anzoategui, where the recently installed legislatures have rejected the governor's annual report by a two-thirds majority. There are two reasons why this trend is being seen right now. The first is the multiparty coalitions that emerged in most states, where the voters switched from the two-party balance that had prevailed until recently. As a result, in several states the governors ended up without enough executive political clout to block the rejection of the annual report they are supposed to submit to the representative body of their state for consideration. But the other reason is that the regional legislators elected in 1988 were in office for five years, until 1993, while the governors were elected in 1992, a year earlier, when a different balance of power prevailed. The mistake, which the State Public Office Term Act failed to correct, occurred in 1988, when Congress approved the popular election of governors but did not change the law so that the regional legislatures that would control these leaders could be elected at the same time. The instability created by this factor will end in 1995, however, when elections for both levels will be held on the same day. In 12 states, it is the balance of power that has caused the instability of the popularly elected government, because it is a minority government. These states are Amazonas, Anzoategui, Aragua, Carabobo, Falcon, Guarico, Lara, Merida, Miranda, Portuguesa, Sucre, and Zulia. There are four other cases in which the instability is a result of the governor's inability to marshal the support of all the legislators who would normally be allied with him. It is common for a few ruling-party deputies to jump ship, which undermines the governor's political base in the legislature. Right now the governors elected in 1992 are submitting their first annual reports. If a two-thirds majority votes to reject the report, the governor is automatically removed from office, and new elections are called. Although the same thing may happen next year with their second report of the three-year term, however, a rejection by a two-thirds majority will not result in new elections being called, but the legislature will appoint someone to finish out the term. The minority governors can negotiate to remain in office, and in other cases, the opposition itself could be ejected because the governor is extremely popular and might run again in the new elections. Here is the current situation in each state: Amazonas The assembly has just voted Governor Edgar Sayago out of office with seven out of 11 votes, the four deputies of Democratic Action (AD) having joined together with the three deputies of the Movement Toward Socialism (MAS). Sayago had the support of the three deputies of the Social Christian Party (Copei) and Convergence's one deputy. It was decided that seven votes constituted two-thirds of the legislature. A lot of political shifting has taken place in this state. Sayago used to be a member of AD until 1992, when he was expelled. He ran as a MAS candidate, and won the governorship in a coalition with Unity for Advancement (UPA) and ORA [expansion not given]. But then he lost MAS's support and won over Copei, and more recently Convergence. The elections to decide who will be governor are set for 24 April. Anzoategui This is another state where the annual report has been rejected by a two-thirds majority. Governor Ovidio Gonzalez was reelected in December 1992 with 51.70 percent of the valid votes in a self-described "ethical alliance" of 17 political groups, headed by Copei, MAS, the People's Electoral Movement (MEP), and ORA. The balance of power in the legislative assembly was changed by the 1993 elections, resulting in the instability that has brought down Gonzalez's government. There are 19 deputies altogether, with six for AD, six for Cause R, four for Copei, two for Convergence, and one for MAS, the latter being the only one who voted in favor of the annual report. Apure The governor is Marcelo Oquendo (AD), elected with 53.24 percent of the vote in December 1992. AD has seven of the 13 members of the assembly, which would allow it to block the formation of a two-thirds majority of nine regional legislators. Copei has five, Convergence one. Nevertheless, problems could arise here because Governor Oquendo has disagreements with the party's local chapter, which took him to the disciplinary tribunal recently. The instability has resulted from these problems. Aragua Carlos Tablante has been governor since 1989, having been reelected in 1992 with 62.73 percent of the vote. There are instability problems because the new balance of political power in the legislature means that the governor has to depend on the support of the MAS-Convergence axis. There are 21 deputies, of which six represent MAS and three Convergence. These nine deputies can block a two-thirds majority vote to reject the annual report, which requires 14 votes. Cause R has six deputies, AD three, and Copei three, adding up to 12 opposition votes, not enough to muster the majority vote needed to bring about the immediate removal of the governor. It should be noted that Tablante was a minority governor when he took office in 1989. But by entering into personal agreements with deputies who had deserted AD and Copei, he managed to forge a solid base of support that enabled him to govern without legislative hindrance. Barinas Problems arose here in the 1989 election, causing repeat elections to be held in May 1993. Gehard Cartay is governor, having won 52 percent of the vote in an alliance headed by Copei and MAS. The new balance of power, in which Copei has five of the 13 legislative votes, gives him a certain margin of safety. His government has encountered a variety of problems, but Cartay has very good relations with President Caldera. AD has five deputies in the legislature, and the other three belong to Convergence, MAS, and Cause R, with one each. Bolivar Andres Velasquez (Cause R) was elected in December 1992 to serve his last term as governor of this state with 63 percent of the valid votes for his party. Cause R has 12 of the 19 deputies in the legislature, which assures it of approval of the annual report. During his last term he was a minority governor, but although AD and Copei voted against his annual report, they did not have enough votes for the two-thirds majority necessary to force new elections. Now Velasquez enjoys strong support in the legislature. AD has four of the 19 seats, Copei two, and MAS one. Carabobo Henrique Salas Romer was reelected in December 1992 with 73 percent of the vote in an alliance headed by Copei and MAS. Last December's elections, however, changed the balance of power in the legislature compared to the 1988 elections. In this state, as in almost all the others in the central part of the country, AD and Copei lost power to Cause R, MAS and Convergence. AD and Copei now have only three deputies each, accounting for six of the 22. The other deputies belong to Cause R (eight), Convergence (four), and MAS (four). A two-thirds majority requires 15 votes, and can be blocked with eight votes. Governor Salas Romer, a politician whom President Caldera regards very highly, has good relations with Convergence. He did not take a stand in favor of the Copei candidate during the election campaign, in contrast to Ovidio Gonzalez, who not only favored the Copei candidate but also attacked Caldera's candidacy. Despite Copei's fall in Carabobo, one good sign for Governor Salas is the fact that in the only district where Copei won, the candidate was his son. There were problems with the installation of the legislature in this state, and ultimately the executive board of the legislature ended up in the hands of Cause R and AD. The governor's stability will depend on his skill in negotiating with Convergence and neutralizing AD. In this state, most of the party votes went to Cause R. Cojedes Governor Jose Felipe Machado won in 1992 with 44 percent of the vote, basically the vote garnered by his party, Copei. This government is somewhat stable, since Copei won the state elections in December. Six of the 12 seats in the legislature are held by Copei, four by AD, and one each by Convergence and Cause R. It takes eight votes to get a two-thirds majority, which can be blocked with five votes. Delta Amacuro Partial elections have already been called in this state for 10 April to decide who was elected governor on 6 December 1992, given that the Supreme Court of Justice has annulled a group of official vote tallies. In this case, the new legislative assembly elected on 5 December 1993 has nothing to do with the instability; it was caused by irregularities in the 1992 elections. The balance of power in the legislature of this new state involves minority factions of AD, Copei, MAS, and Convergence. The Supreme Electoral Council (CSE) decided to call elections, but it left in power Governor Emery Mata Millan, whose election has been called into question. Mr. Mata Millan was elected with the support of Copei, which has only three deputies in the 11-member legislature; but he has another group, MERI [expansion not given], with two deputies. MAS, whose leader, Armando Salazar, has gubernatorial aspirations, also has only three deputies. AD, Cause R, and Convergence have one deputy each. Falcon Another state whose government was left in a difficult position, without sufficient support in the legislature, is Falcon, where Aldo Cermeno has been governor since 1989. He was reelected in 1992 with 51 percent of the vote in an alliance involving Copei, MAS, and other groups. MAS has already abandoned him, and with the results of last December's elections, the balance of power in the legislature has left him in a precarious position. Copei ended up with five of the 15 deputy seats. But the other 10, which constitute a two-thirds majority, are against it: Convergence with five, AD with four, and Cause R with one. Aldo Cermeno is on notice that he may be the next governor whose annual report is challenged. Guarico Governor Jose Malave Risso, Copei's 1992 candidate, won with 45.25 percent of the vote. Copei, however, won only three of the 15 seats in the legislature elected last December, leaving its governor without sufficient backing in the state's legislative body. He is another governor who may soon be ousted by a two-thirds majority vote rejecting his report. AD controls the assembly with eight votes, Cause R has two, and MAS and Convergence have one each. Malave Risso became Guarico's governor with Caldera's backing in 1992, but later he publicly supported Alvarez Paz. Even if he could win MAS's and Convergence's support in the legislature, the 10 votes belonging to AD and Cause R would be enough to unseat him. AD is the majority party in this state. Lara This is another state that is having problems, although not exactly caused by the new balance of power. The CSE called partial elections for governor under an order from the Supreme Court, which annulled vote tallies. Mariano Navarro (AD) is still governor, but the MAS-Convergence axis swept the December elections and is now predominant with 12 of the 23 seats in the assembly. AD has five, Copei four, and Cause R two. Even if Mariano Navarro is retained as governor in the 10 April elections, his annual report could be rejected by a two-thirds majority if Copei decided to vote with Convergence, Cause R, and MAS. This state government is unstable as long as AD is in power. Merida Governor Jesus Rondon Nucete (Copei) was reelected in 1992 with 49 percent of the vote. The balance of power resulting from the December elections left him in a difficult position, however, as his party won only four of the 15 seats. The other 11, which constitute a two-thirds majority, are held by Convergence (six), AD (four), and Cause R (one). Miranda Copei Governor Arnaldo Arocha Vargas was reelected in December 1992, running basically as a Copei-MAS candidate in an alliance of 17 groups. He won with 62.3 percent of the vote. The balance of power in the assembly is now even, with Cause R holding eight as the primary party, Copei holding six, AD and Convergence each holding four, and MAS holding one. Fifteen votes are needed to remove the governor by rejecting his annual report. Arocha Vargas was a Caldera governor during his first term, and he is thought to have good relations with the president. During the campaign, he gave tepid support to Alvarez Paz. Monagas Guillermo Call (AD) is governor. His party took first place in the recent 1993 elections and now has seven of the 15 deputy seats, giving it a wide margin of stability. It does not have a majority in the legislature, so the governor's report may be voted down, but his stay in office would not be threatened. Call was reelected in 1992 with 52.4 percent of the vote. Cause R has three deputies in the legislature, Copei three, and Convergence two, constituting a simple majority. Nueva Esparta Morel Rodriguez (AD) has been governor of this island state since 1989. He was reelected in 1992 with 48.81 percent of the vote, giving him a slight lead over Rafael Tovar (Copei). The elections are being challenged in court. AD controls six of the 13 seats in the legislature. Copei has four, and Cause R, Convergence, and MAS have one each. The opposition to this governor now has a simple majority to vote against his report, but it does not have the nine votes required for a two-thirds majority. Portuguesa Governor Elias D'Ongia has been in office since 1989. He was reelected in 1992 with just 36.8 percent of the vote, and the results are being challenged in the Supreme Court. The new balance of power left him in a precarious position, although his party still has the largest minority share. There are five groups: AD has five of the 15 legislators, and the other 10, who make up a two-thirds majority, are divided among Copei (four), Convergence (three), MAS (two), and Cause R (one). The balance of power is unstable. Sucre The elections in this state were repeated in May 1993. The governor is Ramon Martinez (MAS). The balance of power in the legislature is unstable. AD has six of the 17 deputies, MAS five, Copei three, Cause R two, and Convergence one. With 11 votes against his annual report, the governor will be out of office. The government can block the removal with seven votes. Tachira Governor Ron Sandoval (AD) was reelected in 1992 with 45 percent of the vote. The new balance of power in the Tachira legislature gives AD six of the 19 votes. Thirteen votes are needed to oust the governor by rejecting the report. The opposition has exactly 13 votes, divided as follows: Copei six, Convergence three, Cause R and MAS two each. Trujillo Governor Jose Mendez Quijada (AD) was reelected in 1992 with 48.4 percent of the vote. AD kept enough power in the regional legislature after last year's elections to block rejection of the annual report by two-thirds majority. AD won six of the 15 legislative seats, leaving nine for the opposition. Ten votes are necessary to remove Governor Trujillo: Copei has five, Convergence three, and Cause R one. Yaracuy Nelson Suarez Montiel (Copei) is governor of this state, having been reelected in 1992 in an alliance of 24 parties, led by Copei. At that time he won 66 percent of the vote. After the December elections, however, his government became unstable. Nine votes are needed to remove him, and eight of them are held by the opposition: Convergence four, AD two, and MAS and Cause R one each. Copei has five deputies who, if they all continue to support the governor, can block a two-thirds majority vote to reject the report. Zulia Lolita Aniyar de Castro (MAS-Convergence) is governor. This is the only one of the 22 states where the governor was elected at the same time as the legislative assembly. The balance of power ended up unfavorable to the elected leader, however: MAS, Convergence, and Cause R, which supported Governor Aniyar, have eight of the 24 votes in the legislature; Copei has 10 and AD six. AD and Copei between them constitute a two-thirds majority. The report to be submitted this year is not about the work of the current governor, however, since Aniyar just started her term.
