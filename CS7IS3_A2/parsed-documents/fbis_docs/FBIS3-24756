Dhlakama explained that the trip has been postponed because contacts "with some South African businessmen," whom he did not identify, have not been confirmed. The Renamo leader also said he does not have confirmation on his meeting with the National Party, but his supporters in South Africa "are making sure that the meeting takes place." He stated that the visit is aimed at establishing friendship ties between Renamo and South African parties, including Nelson Mandela's African National Congress [ANC]. "The planned visit to Portugal and Spain will still take place in February," but the dates have not yet been set. Meanwhile, Afonso Dhlakama said that he met with U.S. Ambassador to Mozambique Dennis Jets in Maputo on 27 January, with whom he discussed issues linked to the implementation of the peace process. Afonso Dhlakama said "I am the one who requested the meeting with the U.S. ambassador to discuss the peace process, and for me to explain my concerns with the Social Economic Council," adding that he discussed the same issue with UN Special Representative Aldo Ajello. Dhlakama said "both the U.S. ambassador and Dr. Ajello found Renamo to be right and said that it is up to Renamo to convince the Mozambican Government on this issue". The Renamo leader reiterated that he will continue "fighting for Renamo's right to know how the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] is managing state funds, because, in South Africa for instance, the ANC does not allow the government to use a cent without its knowledge." Some observers noted, however, that the South African Government and the ANC "guide themselves through an agreement, and that the Mozambican Government and Renamo also guide themselves, or should guide themselves, through the agreement signed by both--that is, the situations are completely different, as there are differences between ANC and Renamo."
