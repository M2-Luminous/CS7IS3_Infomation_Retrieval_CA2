FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Duane Winters, RMP Team Leader, Jackson District, (601) 977&hyph;5400. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The PRMP/FEIS presents and analyzes alternatives for managing BLM-administered public lands throughout the State of Florida. These lands include approximately 395,000 acres of split-estate federal mineral ownership (where federal ownership is limited to mineral interests and the surface estate is owned by either the State of Florida or private interests) and several hundred acres of public land, comprised of small tracts, located in seven counties throughout the State. Under the PRMP, federally-owned minerals underlying state-owned lands would be available to the State of Florida in exchange for lands identified for acquisition by the U.S. Department of the Interior and/or the U.S. Forest Service. A portion (approximately 60 acres) of the Jupiter Inlet tract, located in Palm Beach County, is proposed to be designated an Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC). The ACEC would be managed to maintain a viable scrub vegetation community and improve habitat conditions for Florida scrub jay, gopher tortoise, and other endemic scrub species, and to interpret natural and cultural resources to provide recreation opportunities. Motorized vehicle use would be limited to designated routes. The ACEC would be withdrawn from entry under the 1872 mining law, closed to mineral material sales and mineral lease, and would be an avoidance area for rights-of-way. The ACEC would be available for cooperative management with other government agencies and/or private organizations, or for conveyance under the Recreation and Public Purposes Act, provided that the proposed use would follow the stated management objectives and land-use allocations.
