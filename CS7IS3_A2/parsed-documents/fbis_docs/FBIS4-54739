"I cannot understand why it is necessary to insist on the demand for the recognition of the border," Duray said in an interview with CTK. He stressed that Slovakia was a successor to the former Czechoslovakia, and therefore all post-war agreements concluded by Czechoslovakia were valid. Duray said the fact that Hungary had confirmed the present border in its international agreement with Ukraine was due to the difference between Slovakia and Ukraine. The latter is not successor to a defunct state. Duray welcomed the Sunday meeting between the Slovak and Hungarian premiers, Jozef Moravcik and Peter Boross, in Komarno-Komarom, a city located on both sides of the two countries' common border. "It is correct that bilateral problems can be solved even without an international agreement," Duray said. He also said it was important that the new Slovak government, unlike the cabinet of Vladimir Meciar, did not make the opening of new border crossings conditional on the signing by Budapest of a readmission agreement on the return of illegal immigrants. "Although it is impossible to know the result of the second round of the parliamentary elections in Hungary beforehand, Boross's government will remain in power by the end of May," Duray said. Moravcik and Boross have concluded only a verbal agreement, he said, but added that he believed that the Hungarian foreign political line would be preserved after the elections. He said he saw the signing of an agreement on the prevention of double taxation and creation of a mixed governmental commission for ethnic minorities as the most urgent goals in Slovak-Hungarian relations.
