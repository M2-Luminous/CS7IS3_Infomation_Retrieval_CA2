FBIS3-32871 "drlat030__a94004" FBIS-LAT-94-030-A Document Type:Daily Report 14 February 1994 ANNEX Argentina _o_ `Secret Memo' on Labor Flexibility 94P20327 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 94P20327 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Article Type:CSO [Editorial Report] Against a backdrop of ongoing tripartite labor-management-government negotiations on labor reform, a "secret memo" on labor "flexibility," giving employers more freedom to determine work schedules and more control over hiring and firing, is reportedly being circulated among prominent leaders of industry and a handful of labor leaders. According to a report by Marcelo Bonelli in the column Business Panorama published in the 14 January Buenos Aires daily CLARIN, the points detailed in the memo are soon to be promoted by the Menem administration. Bonelli notes that although many of these points "irritate" the unions, what really makes them "scream bloody murder" is the insistence throughout the memo that these changes could be agreed upon either through collective bargaining or through shop-level negotiations. This would, he explains, "categorically end the unions' hegemonic control over labor negotiations." The unions are questioning whether yielding on these "labor conquests" would actually increase employment as promised by the government, writes Bonelli. He adds that labor leaders plan to offer the government a counterproposal, which would move toward a pact not restricted solely to labor issues. "Large businesses are waiting for (labor) flexibility in order to lay off personnel, not to create more jobs," asserts Peronist economist Eduardo Curia, advisor to labor leaders Armando Cavalieri of the Commercial Workers Union and Health Workers leader Carlos West Ocampo. According to West Ocampo, the unions are willing to discuss labor "flexibility," but only in exchange for guarantees of more jobs and other cost-cutting measures. Some of the 18 points detailed in the memo are as follows: - Shift changes, determined by either labor unions or employers, would be set for periods no longer than one year. - The average eight-hour workday could be "extended to 12 hours," depending upon the needs of each employer. Employees would not be paid overtime, but would be given compensatory time during periods of slack production. - Weekly time off could be "postponed" for as long as one month. - The existing vacation system--specifically regulations on qualifying requirements, restrictions on timing and duration, advance notice to employers, and remuneration for time off--could be changed in any way. - A special set of rules governing temporary employment would "totally deregulate" current labor relations and be used by employers in hiring. - This special system would be applied for a period of six months, but could be renewed every six months. - Employers would benefit from a 50-percent exemption from labor taxes for temporary workers and from the elimination of severance pay.
