France, Spain, Great Britain, and Canada, the principal suppliers of men to Bosnia, have begun to reexamine the mission of their Blue Helmets. Lord David Owen, the European mediator for the former Yugoslavia, believes the UN forces may withdraw next spring if no apparent progress is made in the peace talks within the next two months. Interviewed on Wednesday evening by RTBF [French-language Belgian broadcast media] Television, Mr. Delcroix also spoke of the possibility of withdrawing Belgian forces from Bosnia in the absence of a "political solution" to the civil war between the Serbs, Croats, and Muslims. "We must wait until the end of the winter," the defense minister added. In March or April, we will have to "think of new means (of continuing the UNPROFOR mission) or withdraw," he stated.
