First the press provided information on the upcoming joint exercise by the U.S. 3d Infantry Division and the Russian 27th Motorized Rifle Division for the purpose of rehearsing cooperation in peacemaking actions. A little later we learned of the bombing strikes by U.S. peacemakers in the south of Bosnia. The southern Urals and southern Bosnia are separated by many thousands of kilometers, but the upcoming event and the past one are tied up in a tight and intricate logical knot. Our own correspondent Ivan Gavrilenko reports that the news of the military maneuvers on the Totskiy range elicited a sharply negative reaction from the peasants of Orenburg Oblast, which was singed by the flash from the first atomic explosion conducted in the Soviet Union. Until recently the Totskiy range, where the exercise is planned, was top-secret. This region also has other military installations which are of undoubted interest to foreign specialists, and it has to be thought that the Pentagon will certainly not be sending new recruits to Russia. We have managed to ascertain from the Ground Forces Main Staff that the measure is being conducted in accordance with the plan of contacts between the armed forces of Russia and the United States. No more than 250 servicemen will be involved on each side. The Americans will land up to 50 units of wheeled equipment at the Totskiy Training Center, where they have already been to reconnoiter. Joint actions will be rehearsed as part of a peacemaking force from 6 through 14 July. A detail of some importance: In the opinion of the military, this measure will not require of us any unplanned expenditure, since one of the 27th Division's regiments is due to hold a planned exercise at precisely that time. But the Americans will have to fork out $2 million. They will pay our military to operate engineer equipment and for fuel, lubricants, water, food, and all the services provided. So there is even an opportunity to earn a little currency. In general, the Russian military leaders have, at first sight, undertaken a good and profitable thing. It is undoubtedly necessary to strengthen and develop contacts between the two countries' armies. But how are we to avoid the importunate questions of fellow citizens? Why do the Americans need to send over their aircraft together with servicemen and hardware from the German city of Wuerzburg, where the 3d Infantry Division is stationed, right over to the Urals, deep inside Russia? Would it not be simpler to hold exercises of a very simple nature at Khodynskoye Pole, for example, or somewhere in Moscow Oblast? Interest is also aroused by the NATO division's highly original service record. It performed "peacemaking" combat operations in Korea and Iraq. Where will future itineraries take it? To the former Yugoslavia, maybe. General M. Rose, commander of the UN troops, needs just such decisive combined units. The whole world shuddered at the blasts of the bombs dropped by NATO aircraft in southern Bosnia, but the general is insisting on new strikes. The U.S. President has pronounced a sentence which sounded roughly as follows: We work closely with Gen. Rose, and I believe that his aggressiveness is a good thing. Here are peacemakers for you! Our newspaper has already written about the political aspects of the recent NATO action. Let us touch on the military aspects. We are seeing for the umpteenth time that NATO has very mediocre airmen in its ranks. Obviously embarrassed, a White House official spokesperson recently declared on television that one of the U.S. pilots tried to drop four bombs on the Serbs, but succeeded in releasing just three, and two of them did not explode. It also is not entirely clear what was destroyed as a result of the bombing strikes -- a tank or a medical vehicle. It is perfectly clear that peaceful people died as a result of those raids. It is worth recalling that U.S. pilots were also distinguished by similar results in Iraq three years ago: They aimed at military targets but hit peaceful houses and even their own positions. Incidentally, they have also distinguished themselves during these days: They downed two of their own helicopters with accurate rocket fire and dispatched 26 officers to the next world. The punitive actions undertaken by the United Nations without coordination with Russia have sharply exacerbated the situation and galvanized combat operations by the opposing sides. But maybe the politicians will realize that neither bombs nor missiles can bring the Serbs to their knees. Only a peaceful way out of the crisis will be productive.
