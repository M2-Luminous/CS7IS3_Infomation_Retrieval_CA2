It has brought no good nor benefit to our motherland. On the contrary, this war has brought only destruction, losses, suffering, pain, shame, and desperation for Cambodia, for the nation, and especially for its innocent poor people. In my capacity as the father of the nation and the king father of the entire Cambodian people, whether they are men or women, belonging to whichever political parties and living wherever in the country, I appeal on the one hand to the Royal Government [RCG] and the KRAF and on the other to the party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] and the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] to immediately agree to a general cease-fire on all battlefields throughout Cambodia. I appeal to all of you, my children, to accept a total and unconditional reconciliation and concord. I appeal to all of you to join hands in building peace and to coexist peacefully now, in the future, and forever. Peace in Cambodia is the life, happiness, prosperity, and glory of our nation and motherland. War is death for Cambodia and our race. All problems remaining between the RCG and the PDK must be settled through only one means, a peaceful means. I appeal to the RCG and the PDK to give our motherland total peace, because only in this total peace can our motherland engage in the reconstruction process for the sake of our people and thereby enable our people to live happily in dignity and with freedom, bereft of all suffering. I appeal to the NADK and the PDK to restore and rebuild all bridges, roads, and trails that this army and party have damaged and destroyed, and to help clear all mines from places that they have been laid. I appeal to the KRAF to uphold the good traditions of the KRAF of the Sangkum Reas Niyum's era by, starting from now, paying attention to helping our poor people improve their living conditions. The KRAF must dedicate themselves to peaceful tasks for national reconstruction as in the time of Sangkum Reas Niyum. I ask all of you, my beloved children and compatriots, to accept the expressions of my warmest and deepest love for you and may you all enjoy the four blessings of Lord Buddha, namely: long life, social prestige, happiness, and good health. P.S. I would like to make it clear that I will not tolerate any parity between the RCG and the PDK, because DK is only a party whereas the RCG is a national government of the Kingdom of Cambodia. One day, through peaceful negotiations, the PDK will have to return to the Kingdom of Cambodia all the zones that they are controlling, including Pailin and the Preah Vihear temple, because the Kingdom of Cambodia has only one government, that is, the RCG, and only one army, that is, the KRAF.
