FR941007-2-00018 FR941007-2-00006 DOC Position We agree with respondents that each participating exporter in this investigation ( i.e., ZMEC, ZLIP and Lansheng) is entitled to its company-specific separate rate regardless of whether other potential PRC exporters and sellers of subject merchandise participated in this investigation. Petitioners' concern that all firms that produced paper clips during the POI did not participate in the investigation is misplaced. Each of the three exporters investigated established that they were independent of any central government control and, therefore, received a company-specific separate rate. The ``all other'' exporters are presumed to be under central government control and, therefore, received a single rate, which, in this case, was based on BIA due to Abel's failure to respond to the questionnaire ( see ``Best Information Available'' section of this notice, above). Because the ``all other'' exporters are presumed to be under central government control and the three responding companies have established that they are not under central government control, the responding firms and the ``all other'' exporters are not within a common sphere of control. Comment 3: Choice of ``All-Others'' Rate Petitioners assert that the Department incorrectly calculated the margin to be used as the ``all-others'' rate in the preliminary determination by using the information set forth in the October 13, 1993, petition. Petitioners assert that the Department should have chosen the highest margin (150.00 percent) set forth in the petition, as amended on January 26, 1994. According to petitioners, the margin resulting from the amended petition is based on Petitioners' updated values for certain chemicals used to plate paper clips. Petitioners claim that the January 26, 1994, submission clarified that the values which the Department had disregarded in adjusting the petition for initiation purposes were not being used as ``surrogate values'' in the manner in which the Department might apply Indian and Pakistani values. Petitioners state that the values set forth in the amended petition's exhibits reflect the actual experience of an affiliate of one of the petitioners in producing wire paper clips in Mexico. Those values were provided because, given the specialized nature of the particular inputs, petitioners were unable to obtain publicly available published information from an appropriate surrogate country. By basing these values on the actual experience of petitioners' affiliate, petitioners claim to have followed the established practice of the Department to permit a petitioner in an antidumping case to base certain values and costs on petitioners' own experience. Petitioners cited to several past cases to support this argument (e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Sebacic Acid from the People's Republic of China (Sebacic Acid) (58 FR 37908, May 31, 1994)). Respondents request that the Department continue to reject petitioners' unsubstantiated and untimely petition amendments for purposes of determining the ``all others'' rate. According to respondents, the amended data submitted by petitioners should not be accepted by the Department since the data is from a Mexican affiliate and this does not satisfy the requirement that costs submitted under the rubric of ``petitioners' data'' be based on U.S. cost. Second, respondents contend that the amended data should not be considered for the final determination since petitioners did not demonstrate that Mexico qualifies as a reasonable surrogate country for the PRC. Finally, respondents claim that petitioners' amendments to the petition were filed in an untimely fashion. DOC Position We agree with respondents and will continue to use the highest margin in the petition, as recalculated by the Department in the initiation notice (126.94 percent). Petitioners failed to provide any explanation or documentation of their efforts to find surrogate country value information. Moreover, petitioners' use of Mexican values is tantamount to selecting Mexico as a surrogate country, regardless of how petitioners choose to characterize their intentions. Petitioners never explicitly stated why their use of Mexican values is appropriate in light of the Department's hierarchy for selecting surrogate country economies.
