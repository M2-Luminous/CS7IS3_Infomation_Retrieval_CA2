So goes a saying along the Huaihe River flowing through east China's Anhui Province. However, the reality proves that the saying is getting old. Just days after the Spring Festival, which fell on February 10 this year, this correspondent paid a visit to Fengyang County in Anhui. In 1978, 19 households of farmers of Xiaogang Village in southeastern Fengyang divided the farmland between themselves and initiated the now-renowned household contract system in China. That pioneering contract, which carried the finger-prints of the villagers, is now kept in the Chinese Revolutionary Military Museum. The mist of firecrackers still hung over the county. Farmers could be seen watering and spreading fertilizers in the fields which were turning green. Now and then vehicles carrying fertilizer moved past on country roads. Farmers went to the county for buying seeds and farm tools. Early in the morning this correspondent arrived at Guangou Township of the county. It has just dug seven pools and transformed more than 100 ha of low-yield farmland. More than 60 young men were studying at "green certificate" classes, which teach agricultural knowledge. Party Secretary Jin Xuejin and township Magistrate Hu Baoping were busy distributing seeds imported from Japan and Taiwan. In a village called Chenyu Village, old men and children were sitting in sunlight and few grown-ups were to be seen on the streets. This correspondent met 40-year-old villager Zhang Qiliang near a school. He said excitedly that farmers of Fengyang had tasted the sweetness of the market last year. Quality rice was sold for a yuan per jin (500 g), which meant that every family in the village earned some 1,000 yuan more last year. With a few words, he said goodbye and went to plant vegetables. In Linhuai Township, a lad squatted by the roadside studying a brand-new two-wheel tractor which he had just bought for 3,600 yuan. He contracted some land from those who have left the village to work in larger cities and his cattle could not cope with all the field work. In Xiaogang Village, which was lauded as the birthplace of the rural reform in China, party Secretary Yan Junchang said that the majority of the villagers still cling to the land and the market reform of agriculture and grain price increases greatly heightened the people's initiatives. In 1993, the village saw a per capita added income of over 300 yuan. The secretary's family collected some 25 tons of grain last year. Fengyang County was well-known as a poor place in history and it is now among the top 100 grain producing counties of China. In 1993, the per capita income of farmers increased by 55 percent over the previous year.
