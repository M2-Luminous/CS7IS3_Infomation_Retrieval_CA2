NATO ambassadors were to meet here Wednesday [9 February] and, barring a veto by pro-Serb Greece, were likely to authorise use of the alliance's warplanes in a punitive action following Saturday's bloody mortar attack in Sarajevo. NATO officials said intense consultations on the issue continued Tuesday after an informal meeting on Monday. The meeting is in response to a request by UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali for NATO backing to deter any repetition of the massacre in Sarajevo's central market that left 68 people dead and some 200 wounded. British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd called the carnage a "turning point" in Western atitudes towards military action in Bosnia-Herzegovina. But the prospect of airstrikes was still clouded by uncertainty over several points. UN officials who must give the green light for the air raids insist they first have to clearly determine who was responsible for Saturday's carnage, a judgement experts said was virtually impossible. But the bloodiest incident of the 22-month-old war appears to have stung Western nations into moving ahead with a broader purpose: to finally end the siege of the predominantly Moslem Bosnian capital. European Community foreign ministers on Monday called for the immediate lifting of the siege "using all the means necessary, including the use of air power." The United States seemed to be of the same mind. "We will respond to the specific, rather narrow request of Butrus-Ghali but we will not be limited by that," U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Monday. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation has already offered its warplanes to end the strangulation of Moslem communities, provide "close air support" to endangered UN troops and reopen Tuzla airport in northeastern Bosnia. But Butrus-Ghali has so far refused to give clearance for such operations amid fears they could provoke reprisals against the 10,000-strong UN force on the ground and bring the humanitarian effort to a halt. Beyond such considerations is the question of how effective bombing the Serbs would be. Military experts say that close air support for ground troops is feasible, offensive bombing raids is another matter. They say air power could take out stationary artillery positions but would be unable to eliminate the big guns or the highly mobile mortars if the Serbs moved them around in the hills surrounding Sarajevo. A NATO military source said ground troops and weapons would be needed to secure the hills but the 16-member alliance has done no planning for such an eventuality. He saw little likelihood of adding more troops to the 2,900 currently in the capital, most of them French. France has been the only nation willing to up its contribution significantly to protect the UN-designated "safe area." No country has shown the stomach for a full-scale military action to bring peace which German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said would require hundreds of thousands of troops with no guarantee of success. NATO leaders, seeking to restore their battered credibility, renewed their airstrike threats last month and U.S. President Bill Clinton and French President Francois Mitterrand said that this time they better be ready for action. France proposed this week giving the Serbs an ultimatum to distance their big guns from Sarajevo. Britain, the other major contributor to UN troops in Bosnia, appeared to shed some its earlier reluctance to call in air raids. But differences remained among the allies, with little enthusiasm apparent at the EC meeting for setting a deadline for the Serbs. Countries such as Spain and Denmark stressed the need to keep peace negotiations on track. Greece, the current president of the 12-member community, warned that airstrikes could unleash a wider war throughout the Balkans and threatened to veto the move at the NATO meeting, which works on consensus. Under the new threat of airstrikes, the Serbs are now willing to discuss demilitarisation of Sarajevo even before a global settlement. But analysts said the Serbs have appeared to give ground before, only to harden once the danger has receded.
