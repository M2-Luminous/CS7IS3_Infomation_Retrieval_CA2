FR940607-2-00111 FR940607-2-00068 6. The Account has seven subaccounts, each of which invest in shares of an investment portfolio of either The IFS Variable Insurance Trust (the ``IFS Trust'') or The Select Advisers Portfolio (the ``SA Trust''). The IFS Trust, a no load open-end diversified investment management company organized as a Massachusetts business trust, consists of five portfolios available through the subaccounts for investment of funds allocated by Contract owners to the Account. The SA Trust, a no load open-end diversified investment management company organized as a business trust, has two portfolios available for investment by Contract owners. 7. The Contracts permit transfers among the subaccounts of the Account and between the Account and the Fixed Account. There is currently no charge for transfers although Western Southern reserves the right to impose such a charge in the future. 8. Western Southern reserves the right to impose a deduction for premium taxes when the applicable jurisdiction imposes the tax liability. The application states that the applicable premium taxes depend upon the Contract owner's then current place of residence and generally range from 0 to 3% of purchase payments or of the amount annuitized. Applicants state that Western Southern will not make a profit on premium taxes. 9. Applicants impose an annual Contract maintenance charge of $35 per Contract and this charge is deducted from the Contract value. A Contract administration charge is also deducted and this charge is deducted as a percentage of and from the assets of the Account of an annual effective rate of .15%. Western Southern represents that the administrative charges will not increase for the life of the Contracts. Western Southern represents that it does not expect that the total revenues from the administrative charges will exceed the expected costs of administering the Contracts. Further, Applicants state that Western Southern will monitor the relationship of the administrative expenses and the proceeds collected from the administrative expenses and the proceeds collected from the administrative charges for compliance with Rule 26a&hyph;1 under the 1940 Act. 10. A contingent deferred sales charge (the ``Sales Charge'') of up to 7% of the amount withdrawn is imposed upon total surrender, partial withdrawal or commencement of an annuity payment option within the first seven years of the Contract. The Sales Charge is a percentage of the amount of each purchase payment that is withdrawn. The percentage declines depending upon how many years have passed since the withdrawn purchase payment was originally credited to a Contract owner. 11. Western Southern will impose a daily charge equal to an annual effective rate of 1.20% of the value of the net assets of the Account to compensate for Western Southern bearing certain mortality and expense risks in connection with the Contracts. Approximately .80% of the 1.20% charge is attributable to mortality risk, and approximately .40% is attributable to expense risk. Applicants represent that the charge for mortality and expense risks will not increase. If the mortality and expense risk charge is insufficient to cover assumed costs and expenses, Western Southern will bear the loss. Conversely, if the charge exceeds costs, this excess will be profit to Western Southern. If Western Southern realizes a gain from the charge for mortality and expense risks, the amount of such gain will be placed in the general account of Western Southern and may be used in its discretion, including for payment of a portion of the costs relating to the distribution of the Contracts. 12. Applicants state that the mortality risk borne by Western Southern is threefold. First, Western Southern assumes a mortality risk because of its contractual obligation to pay a death benefit in a lump sum (which sum may also be taken in the form of an annuity payment option) upon the death of an annuitant prior to the date on which annuity payments are scheduled to begin. Second, Western Southern assumes a mortality risk because of its agreement not to impose any surrender charge or any other charge on the death benefit. Finally, Western Southern assumes a mortality risk because of its contractual obligation to continue to make annuity payments for the entire life of the annuitant under annuity payment options involving life contingencies, thereby assuring each annuitant that neither the annuitant's longevity nor an improvement in life expectancy generally will have an adverse effect on annuity payments received under the Contract. 13. Applicants state that the expense risk assumed by Western Southern is the risk that the administrative charges, which are guaranteed not to increase under outstanding Contracts, will be insufficient to cover actual administrative expenses. Applicants' Legal Analysis and Conditions 1. Applicants request that the Commission, pursuant to Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act, grant the exemptions from sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act in connection with Applicants' assessment of the daily charge for the mortality and expense risks. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act, in pertinent part, prohibit a registered unit investment trust and any depositor thereof or underwriter therefor from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of all payments (other than sales load) are deposited with a qualified bank as trustee or custodian and held under arrangements which prohibit any payment to the depositor or principal underwriter except a fee, not exceeding such reasonable amount as the Commission may prescribe, for performing bookkeeping and other administrative services of a character normally performed by the bank itself.
