Officials said that although Guangzhou has succeeded in attracting overseas investment, it has filed to maintain proper oversight of overseas-invested firms. Over the past few months, more than 100 such enterprises in Guangzhou that failed to meet their financial commitments have been closed down. Of $80 billion in investments called for in contracts, only $29.5 billion has actually been provided. Yan Guanghua, joint venture boss for the local trade commission said the regulation and crackdown willing overseas-funded firms into line and protect their interests. "The majority of overseas-funded firms are following the laws and regulations, and their legal rights and interests are protected by the government," Yan said. Guangzhou has nearly 5,000 overseas-funded firms. Last year their total industrial output was 30.2 billion yuan ($3.5 billion) and their exports were worth $1.4 billion. However, Yan complained that some foreign partners are not honest when doing business with Chinese in Guangzhou. Some fail to meet their financial commitments or escape abroad with bundles of money. Others intentionally quote higher prices for imported equipment while deflating their export prices. The new regulation authorizes the withdrawal of licenses for unfunded or suspended firms. It also specifies that export products listed among foreign country's anti-dumping items should be reported to the local trade organization as soon as possible and be subject to investigation. In addition, workers are allowed to organize legitimate labour associations, and firms should respond to that effect. Finally, firms should not be managed on contractual terms without government approval.
