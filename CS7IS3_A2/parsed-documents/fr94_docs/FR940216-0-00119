FR940216-0-00119 FR940216-0-00010 F. Survey Issues 1. Ratchets of Simple and Complex Standards on Survey Failure Under the 1992 and 1993 proposals, and under the final rule, refiners, importers, and oxygenate blenders that meet standards on average must conduct gasoline quality surveys in reformulated gasoline covered areas; in the event of a survey failure for a parameter, the standards for that parameter are ``ratcheted'' to be more rigorous. Under the 1993 proposal, and under the final rule, VOC and toxics surveys consist of a simple model portion and a complex model portion. Also under the 1993 proposal, EPA proposed that in the event of a failure of either the simple or the complex model portions of a VOC or toxics survey, that both simple and complex model VOC and toxics standards would be ratcheted. 59 59 Surveys for benzene and oxygen include both simple and complex model samples, because the measurements for these fuel parameters are not dependent on the simple or the complex models. As a result, failure of a benzene survey results in ratchets of the benzene standard under both the simple and the complex models; and the failure of an oxygen survey results in ratchets of the oxygen standard under both the simple and the complex models. One industry group commented on this proposal to ratchet both simple and complex standards, stating that instead of EPA's proposed approach, a failure of the simple model portion of a survey should result only in a ratchet of simple model standards, and vice versa. The commenter's concern was that ratchets of both the simple and complex standards, when only one survey type is violated, would be unnecessary to achieve the surveys' purpose_to ensure gasoline quality fluctuations due to averaging do not result in gasoline quality in any covered area that is ``dirtier'' than it would be if all gasoline was certified to the per-gallon standards. With the exception of simple model VOC and toxics survey failures that occur in 1997, discussed below, EPA generally agrees with this comment. Deficiencies in gasoline quality that are identified by the surveys are corrected (prospectively) through ratchets of average and maximum standards that occur only for the class of gasoline (simple or complex) for which a survey is failed. Survey failures also are prevented through quality assurance measures implemented by refiners and importers intended to prevent survey failures and ratchets, and such measures probably would not be different if ratchets occur only for the class of gasoline for which a survey is failed. The exception to this ratchet approach in the case of simple model VOC and toxics survey failures in 1997 occurs because a ratchet of the simple model standard in such a case would not constitute an incentive to refiners or importers to prevent survey failures of this type. Use of the complex model is mandatory beginning on January 1, 1998; subsequent to this date, the simple model standards may no longer be used. As a result of this timing, any failure of a simple model VOC or toxics survey in 1997 would have no consequence if only the simple model standards are ratcheted, because ratcheted standards become applicable only in the year subsequent to the year of the survey failure. Therefore, unless both the simple and complex model standards ratchet in the event of a simple model VOC or toxics survey failure in 1997, refiners and importers will have no incentive to take steps to avoid simple model survey failures in the year before the complex model becomes mandatory. The final rule has been modified to reflect this approach to survey ratchets. 2. The (Limited) Intra-Covered Area Averaging Alternative to Surveys Section 211(k)(7) of the Act states that the reformulated gasoline regulations shall provide for granting oxygen and benzene credits to persons who produce gasoline that exceed the standards for these parameters, providing for certification of gasoline based on such credits where they are used within the same covered area as they are generated, and requiring that the use of credits not result in average oxygen or benzene levels that are worse than would occur if no credit provisions were allowed. This is the statutory basis for including benzene and oxygen credits in the proposals and in the final rule. EPA believes these provisions are satisfied by refinery-based averaging combined with compliance surveys, but also believes they would allow a refiner or importer to meet the reformulated gasoline standards for oxygen and/or benzene (but not for other parameters) on average if the party is able to demonstrate the gasoline it produces or imports, and uses within a single covered area, meets the oxygen or benzene standards on average. To the extent section 211(k)(7) provides for such intra-covered area averaging, it would be allowed without the need for the gasoline quality surveys that are the general prerequisite for averaging. In order to give regulatory effect to this averaging aspect of section 211(k)(7) of the Act, EPA proposed regulations that would allow intra-covered area averaging without meeting the survey requirements. The proposal would have allowed this averaging approach for all parameters that may be averaged. The proposal did not, however, include enforcement mechanisms intended to ensure a party choosing this option does so properly, such as mechanisms to ensure, and document, the gasoline in question is used only in a single covered area, such as recordkeeping, reporting, or quality assurance requirements. EPA generally has retained this averaging option in the final rule in section 80.67(a)(2), but with several modifications. The final rule restricts the non-survey averaging option to oxygen and benzene only. This restriction is included because EPA intends to limit its application only to those parameters included in section 211(k)(7) of the Act. In addition, EPA has included in the final rule the requirement that any party intending to use the non-survey averaging option must first obtain approval from EPA through a petition process. The final rule specifies that the petition must describe in detail the mechanisms the refiner or importer will use to ensure that the gasoline in question is in fact produced by the refiner or imported by the importer, and is used only within the covered area and in no other attainment area or covered area. The petition also must describe the recordkeeping, reporting, auditing, and other quality assurance measures the party will use to document and report the quality of the gasoline used in the covered area.
