He said if Ukraine had to share with somebody military bases and a part of the fleet this must be carried out under generally recognized international principles. Chornovil estimated the Ukrainian position at the talks as "the only right one." He considered the conduct of Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev as improper. Chornovil said this had once again manifested the "boorishness of a superpower." He suggested that Russia's position at the talks had reflected its gradual pro-imperial policy. Given that the U.S. possess "certain influence" and are interested in normalization of Russian-Ukrainian relations the U.S. mediation in settlement of the Black Sea Fleet issue could be useful, Chornovil said. "Grachev would hardly slam the door if there were a U.S. representative at the talks," Chornovil suggested. He said in Kravchuk's place he would have addressed the Russian president to make him show "his ministers their place." "A kind of demarche is definitely needed. Such an offense should not be ignored," Chornovil added.
