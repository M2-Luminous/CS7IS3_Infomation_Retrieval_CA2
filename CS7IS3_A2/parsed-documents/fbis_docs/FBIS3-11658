This reserve total showed an increase of $155 million over the figure at the end of 1992, the public relations department of the bank reported. With reserves at this level, the institution will be able to cover any unusual increase in foreign exchange, thus avoiding the creation of distortions in the exchange rate. It will also be able to cover the payment obligations to be met on the basis of the plans for this year. Concerning the sales of foreign exchange to the commercial banks, it was reported that in the last two days of the week, the Central Bank sold $25 million at the exchange rate of 12.50 Dominican pesos, plus the bank commission of 2 percent. The result of this injection of dollars into the foreign exchange market was the demonetization of 319 million pesos. The exchange rate of 12.50 pesos becomes 12.75 with the addition of the bank commission of 2 percent, the official rate being multiplied by a factor of 1.02. The volume of dollars injected into the market at the effective exchange rate of 12.75 pesos generated the 19 million pesos that were demonetized, the public relations department reported. With the participation of the Central Bank on the market through the purchase and sale of foreign exchange, it will be able to maintain a liquidity volume in Dominican pesos that is sufficient for a healthy level of growth in the economy, the report said. It added that this will be done without affecting price stability, the real rate of exchange, or the macroeconomic aggregates achieved beginning in 1991. The injections of foreign exchange into the market may serve various purposes. One of these would be to obtain Dominican pesos with a view to demonetization, in order to continue the restriction of the means of payment in general and to control the currency in circulation. Another choice would be to inject dollars into the market for the purpose of keeping the exchange rate stable and avoiding a certain increase therein. The injection of foreign exchange has been effected by the Central Bank at the official exchange rate, without regard to the existing rate on the free foreignexchange market. The bank added that in its view, the economic development of the nation, in terms of economic growth with price and foreign exchange stability, has been "the outstanding characteristic of the Dominican economy." This is how it has described the situation in its reports to international bodies, the source added.
