FR940323-0-00069 FR940323-0-00020 ยง2522.540 How will the Corporation evaluate individual AmeriCorps programs? The Corporation will evaluate programs based on the following: (a) The extent to which the program meets the objectives established and agreed to by the grantee and the Corporation before the grant award; (b) The extent to which the program is cost-effective; and (c) The effectiveness of the program in meeting the following legislative objectives: (1) Providing direct and demonstrable services and projects that benefit the community by addressing educational, public safety, human, or environmental needs; (2) Recruiting and enrolling diverse participants consistent with the requirements of part 2540 of this chapter, based on economic background, race, ethnicity, age, gender, marital status, education levels, and disability; (3) Promoting the educational achievement of each participant based on earning a high school diploma or its equivalent and future enrollment in and completion of increasingly higher levels of education; (4) Encouraging each participant to engage in public and community service after completion of the program based on career choices and participation in other service programs; (5) Promoting an ethic of active and productive citizenship among participants; (6) Supplying additional volunteer assistance to community agencies without providing more volunteers than can be effectively utilized; (7) Providing services and activities that could not otherwise be performed by employed workers and that will not supplant the hiring of, or result in the displacement of, employed workers; and (8) Other criteria determined and published by the Corporation. ยง2522.550 What will the Corporation do to evaluate the overall success of the AmeriCorps programs? (a) The Corporation will conduct independent evaluations of programs, including in-depth studies of selected programs. These evaluations will consider the opinions of participants and members of the community where services are delivered. Where appropriate these studies will compare participants with individuals who have not participated in service programs. These evaluations will: (1) Study the extent to which the national service impacts involved communities; (2) Study the extent to which national service increases positive attitudes among participants regarding the responsibilities of citizens and their role in solving community problems; (3) Study the extent to which national service enables participants to afford post-secondary education with fewer student loans; (4) Determine the costs and effectiveness of different program models in meeting program objectives including full- and part-time programs, programs involving different types of national service, programs using different recruitment methods, programs offering alternative non-federally funded vouchers or post-service benefits, and programs utilizing individual placements and teams; (5) Determine the impact of programs in each State on the ability of VISTA and National Senior Volunteer Corps, each regular and reserve component of the Armed Forces, and the Peace Corps to recruit individuals residing in that State; and (6) Determine the levels of living allowances paid in all AmeriCorps programs and American Conservation and Youth Corps, individually, by State, and by region and determine the effects that such living allowances have had on the ability of individuals to participate in such programs. (b) The Corporation will also determine by June 30, 1995: (1) Whether the State and national priorities designed to meet educational, public safety, human, or environmental needs are being addressed; (2) Whether the outcomes of both stipended and nonstipended service programs are defined and measured appropriately; (3) Whether stipended service programs, and service programs providing educational benefits in return for service, should focus on economically disadvantaged individuals or at risk youth, or whether such programs should include a mix of individuals, including individuals from middle and upper income families; (4) The role and importance of stipends and educational benefits in achieving desired outcomes in the service programs; (5) The income distribution of AmeriCorps participants, to determine the level of participation of economically disadvantaged individuals. The total income of participants will be determined as of the date the participant was first selected to participate in a program and will include family total income unless the evaluating entity determines that the participant was independent at the time of selection. Definitions for ``independent'' and ``total income'' are those used in section 480(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965; (6) The amount of assistance provided under the AmeriCorps programs that has been expended for projects conducted in areas classified as empowerment zones (or redevelopment areas), in areas that are targeted for special economic incentives or are otherwise identifiable as having high concentrations of low-income people, in areas that are environmentally distressed or adversely affected by Federal actions related to the management of Federal lands, in areas that are adversely affected by reductions in defense spending, or in areas that have an unemployment rate greater than the national average unemployment rate for the most recent 12 months for which satisfactory data are available; and (7) The implications of the results of these studies as appropriate for authorized funding levels. ยง2522.560 Will information on individual participants be kept confidential? (a) Yes. The Corporation will maintain the confidentiality of information regarding individual participants that is acquired for the purpose of the evaluations described in ยง2522.540. The Corporation will disclose individual participant information only with the prior written consent of the participant. However, the Corporation may disclose aggregate participant information. (b) Grantees and subgrantees that receive assistance under this chapter must comply with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section.
