The house index price only increased by 0.40 percent while garments only 0.29 percent far below from the 1.41 in March. But the supply and demand for strategic commodities is balanced, Harmoko said. President Suharto, on the same occasion, had also specially asked to give attention to cocoa marketing and quality control, knowing that this commodity is being produced mostly by smallholders, he added.
