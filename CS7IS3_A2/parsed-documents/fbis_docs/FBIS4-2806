Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali said here today that he supports in principle Germany's request for a permanent seat in a reformed UN Security Council. He made the statement at a press conference at the end of his two-day visit, his third to Germany. Under the UN Charter, the decision on expanding the 15-seat council has to be taken by the UN General Assembly and he is not responsible for the issue, said Butrus-Ghali. But the UN chief promised to appoint a German as an under- secretary-general. He said he welcomes any role Germany can play in the UN. The Security Council has five permanent members and some countries, including Germany and Japan, have tried to obtain permanent seats in the body.
