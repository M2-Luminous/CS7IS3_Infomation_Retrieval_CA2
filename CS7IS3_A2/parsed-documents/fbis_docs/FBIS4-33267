How do you feel about Colombia hosting the forthcoming summit? [Robaina] I am glad to have this exclusive opportunity, through the "Exclusive" program, to tell our people about this summit, which ended just a few hours ago. It has been a great opportunity to hold meetings. Practically every Cuban economic and political proposal was included in the final resolution, following many hours of extensive analysis. The 120 NAM members meeting in Cairo clearly shows everyone's will and commitment to strengthen its role and to ensure it plays the role it deserves. The meeting was significant for Cuba, in particular, not only because of what was discussed in every sphere but also because Cuba's just position on the blockade was praised in bilateral meetings. We have received the Movement's unanimous support not only reaffirming what was approved in Jakarta three years ago but also bolstering what the United Nations also recently approved and demanding, on behalf of the NAM and the poor of the Earth, the immediate cessation of such a hostile policy against Cuba. [Mejia] Colombia will host the next summit. How was this decided? [Robaina] The Movement has a regional rotation mechanism. Latin America had the right to host the next NAM summit, which should take place in September 1995. Colombia is one of the countries which the Latin American group believes are in a position to assume such a responsibility. Colombia presented its candidacy. The responsibility originally fell on Nicaragua, but Nicaragua announced that it was in no position to assume this responsibility. We all have confidence in the Colombian Government's organizational capacity. America, in general, and Colombia, in particular, are preparing to host the event at a very special time. Indonesia started strengthening the Movement, and Latin America and Colombia now have the duty to continue to do so. [Mejia] Please tell us about the fourth Ibero-American summit, in Cartagena de Indias. What will Cuba propose at this summit? [Robaina] The Ibero-American summit offers the nations of the continent and the region the chance to meet without being summoned by the empire. This has been expressed even more since the first meeting -- in Guadalajara -- since Madrid, and since Bahia. The Ibero-American forum and its very special characteristics give this summit a special importance. The organizers and the Bahia summit called for this meeting to focus primarily on economic integration and to replace protocol speeches with debates among the regional heads of state. Cuba is involved in all summit preparations. Our personnel have been working on this in Cartagena, Bogota, and several other Colombian cities. We will attend with many hopes and wishes for the summit not to be a summit of intentions but a summit of specific action that begins to yield something for the peoples, specific results regarding integration, development, exchanges. This is what we want from Cartagena. We are on its doorstep. This is a good time for our country and for the region, in particular. [Mejia] Certain international news agencies have said that the NAM summit focused on the Latin American countries since they believe that the NAM has lost its strength. What is your opinion? [Robaina] There might have been a trend regarding the Movement's strength or lack of strength, but today, more than ever, the reasons which gave rise to this important force still exist. I believe that as long as there is a strictly unilateral [unipolar] world politically and militarily and that as a long as the economic might is concentrated in the north, the other two-thirds of mankind, represented by the NAM, more than ever, have reason to pull together to have an authoritarian and forceful enough voice to fight on behalf of all. This is what the Cairo meeting has shown, the need for the Movement to become that forum of which we, the poor of the Earth, are so much in need.
