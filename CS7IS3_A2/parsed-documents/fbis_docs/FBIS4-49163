After a brief appearance at the Bank of China reception to celebrate the issue of new Hong Kong banknotes at 8 am, Lu Ping returned to the villa at No 6 Stanley Beach Road owned by XINHUA (the New China News Agency). In a basement-level room with heavy red curtains, Mr Lu chaired the meeting of the political sub-group of the Preliminary Working Committee, the organization charged with speeding up preparations for Beijing's takeover of Hong Kong. While Governor Chris Patten has ridiculed the committee as inconsequential, people within and outside the British administration have voiced their concern that it would appear to be China's power base in the territory. Mr Lu, the Director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office and secretary-general of the committee, only smiled when asked whether it would be a violation of the Memorandum of Understanding with Britain if he continued to dodge Mr Patten. The memorandum, which dealt with the airport project, stipulated that there should be regular contact between the two sides. One opportunity would have been at the Bank of China function, but bank director Wang Qiren said Mr Patten had not been invited because the organizers thought he was too busy. "Mr Patten has such an important job to do as the Governor, we would not bother him with an invitation to the ceremony," said Mr Wang, former deputy of Mr Lu. Mr Lu's meetings on political matters relating to the handover ended at 5.30 pm, and the whole group dashed off to Central to join their colleagues from the economic sub-group at a dinner hosted by the Bank of China. Mr Patten was again missing from the guests, but two members of his Executive Council, Raymond Chien Kuo-fung and Tung Chee-hwa, were there.
