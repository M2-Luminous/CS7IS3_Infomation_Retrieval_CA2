New crisis in southern Ukraine, new crisis in Russian-Ukrainian relations. And no matter that the sources of the information--the Crimean administration and the press center of the Black Sea Fleet--are all too often regaling us with defective news, they are achieving their purposes: The exposures have an indistinct ring, and a new image of the enemy--a perfidious and aggressive Ukraine encroaching on Russian land, Russian property, and Russian honor and glory--is being shaped and is strengthening. The psychological preparation of the general consciousness for the perception of such a position was manifested distinctly at the time of the recent Crimean crisis, when the notion that the conflict between Kiev and Simferopol was needed by the forces in Ukraine that, playing the "Crimea card," are endeavoring to postpone the presidential elections and remain in power for as long as possible was prevalent in Russian public opinion. An effective version, but improbable, nonetheless. And it is not only that practically nowhere in the post-Soviet world that has rejected totalitarianism does policy resemble a well-calculated chess match but is reminiscent almost everywhere of the patching of holes in one part of a caftan by creating them in another. The abundance of diverse (but always most acute) problems and life's ineradicable trivia physically prevent the administration from switching from the level of tactical tasks to a higher strategic level. The disruption of the traditional patterns of decisionmaking and the malfunction in the mechanisms of their realization are more often than not permitting the authorities merely to respond in haste to the rapidly changing situation. What time does the new elite have here for calculated multi-move maneuvers! And Ukraine is no exception in this respect. But even were this not the case and were Kravchuk's team really attempting to play the "Crimea card," it is hard, all the same, to agree that such a pragmatist as Kravchuk (and he is undoubtedly in this category of politicians) has deliberately moved toward an open conflict with Crimea for the sake of preservation of his power and the cohesion of his nation. Regardless of his personal affections, the president of Ukraine cannot fail to take account of the fact that Meshkov is today backed by a majority of the Crimean electorate and that the Crimean administration is supported by a significant part of the command of the Black Sea Fleet and that, given certain circumstances, the entire might and authority of the Russian Federation could be behind him. With this alignment of forces, Kiev would find itself in an obviously losing situation in a confrontation with Simferopol and could not realistically hope to win a conflict and retain control of the peninsula. In addition, an unpleasant outcome of the Crimean crisis for Kiev would threaten a sharp exacerbation of the internal political situation. It would inevitably entail an increase in the influence of extremist and the radicalization of moderate political forces and a growth of the separatist mood in a number of southern and eastern oblasts, which is fraught with the danger of a split of all of Ukrainian society and could put to rest the very idea of an independent unified Ukrainian state within its present borders. The example of Georgia, which was pulled into a conflict, is all too fresh and graphic for the leadership of Ukraine not to draw conclusions from the sorry Georgian experience. And it hardly needs to be recalled how lamentable is the lot of the presidents of ruined countries--power is no joy to them. The risk of such a development of events is too great for Kravchuk to attempt to hold on to power by provoking a large-scale conflict in Crimea. All Kiev's actions are, meanwhile, reminiscent more of attempts to curb what could be for itself an unpropitious development of events and to return processes on the peninsula to the framework of the Ukrainian Constitution. It is essential here to make an allowance for the fact that Ukraine has encountered a crisis of such a scale for the first time and that the machinery of state, which is largely in the grip of old ideas, was hardly prepared to respond in skilled and appropriate fashion to this challenge ahead of time. On the other hand, it has to be noted that the crisis is to the benefit of the forces that have come to power in Crimea, inasmuch as only via confrontation can they realize their program goals and, if not separate, then, availing themselves of the tension, "push" the peninsula as far away from Ukraine as possible. In a stable and calm atmosphere, however, they would hardly succeed in persuading the authorities of Ukraine to renounce its internationally recognized borders and to recognize the self-proclaimed republic as a full-fledged subject of international relations. A particular danger for peace and security in the region in this connection emanates from the attempts of the Crimean administration to portray Ukraine in the form of an aggressor and to pull Russia into the conflict in order, at a minimum, to conduct a further conversation with Kiev with Russia behind its back. The appeal of six weeks ago of the Office of the President of the Republic of Crimea to Moscow requesting that it stop a Ukrainian assault landing in Simferopol that was allegedly under way, the present appeals to the news media with reports of the arrival on the peninsula of appreciable contingents of Ukrainian national guardsmen (not confirmed, for that matter), the assurances of Kuznetsov, the Crimean minister of internal affairs, of Kiev's intention of transporting to the peninsula overnight 60,000 Ukrainian servicemen (the technical feasibility of which under the present conditions military experts seriously doubt), the disinformation concerning the Ukrainian Spetsnaz's storming of the Crimean Ministry of Internal Affairs, and much else may be recalled here. Any rash reaction on the part of Russia to the calls for help coming from Simferopol would have irreversibly transferred the conflict to a new, practically uncontrollable level, which, thank God, did not happen. The recent crisis in Crimea has shown that a further escalation of tension could result in a serious regional conflict, in which there would be no winners. This, by all accounts, is clearly understood in Kiev, of which the readiness with which the Ukrainian leadership agreed to negotiations with Moscow and to consultations with Simferopol may serve as evidence. What, then, can be done today for a peaceful settlement of the situation that has taken shape in connection with Crimea? Efforts should be made first and foremost to localize the conflict and prevent its further escalation, and Kiev's attempts to resort to simple solutions and put power pressure on its opponents would seem to be ineffective in this connection. The result could be the direct opposite of that expected, especially since the Crimean administration is trying to appear the victim of its "northern neighbor" as it is. As the experience of other conflicts on the territory of the former Soviet Union shows, a balanced, wait-and-see position and a shift of the emphases from ideological opposition to the economic sphere and the sphere of actual policy could prove more productive at this phase of development of the crisis situation. And recent information testifies that Kiev is opting for this path in relations with Simferopol. Inasmuch as the military are frequently an independent force in zones of ethno-political tension and conflicts, a lowering of the level of confrontation and the further resolution of the conflict will depend to a large extent on the surmounting of the uncertainty of the status of the units and subunits of the Black Sea Fleet stationed on the peninsula and in the south of the Ukrainian mainland. Having agreed with Kazakhstan on the leasing of Baykonur and having found mutual understanding with Latvia on the use on the radar-tracking station in Skrunda, Russia simply cannot share the naval legacy of the USSR with Ukraine by laying claim to the infrastructure even in Izmail, which is remote from the Russian Federation. The result would be the spread of tension not only at the locations where the Black Sea Fleet is based on the peninsula, but also in practically all the Black Sea ports of Ukraine. I would like to hope that the continuation of negotiations on a division of the Black Sea Fleet and its infrastructure begun by the prime ministers of the two countries will reduce the danger of the involvement of regulation military units in the confrontation. Special attention should be paid simultaneously to the prevention of the interference in the conflict of extremist formations--illegal groups of militants of political movements, Cossacks, and volunteers. Considering Russia's special role in this region, it would be no great exaggeration to say that Moscow bears the responsibility at this time for the further development of events. And its mission in the localization and minimization of the conflict could be, despite the pressure of the imperial opposition and despite the emotional pressure of Crimea, to prevent itself from becoming involved in a direct confrontation with Ukraine, to remain within the framework of international and bilateral agreements, and, in the event of an appeal by the interested parties, to make every effort for the development of dialogue between Simferopol and Kiev.
