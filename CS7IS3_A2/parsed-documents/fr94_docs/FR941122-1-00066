FR941122-1-00066 FR941122-1-00016 On July 6, 1989, the Service received a petition from Dr. Thomas Briggs of the California Academy of Sciences to list the Marin blind harvestman ( Calicina diminua ) as an endangered species. The letter, dated July 6, 1989, was clearly identified as a petition and contained the name, signature, institutional affiliation, and address of the petitioner. The petition stated that the Marin blind harvestman is known only from a portion of Burdell Mountain in Marin County, California. This species was described from 18 specimens collected under rocks in serpentine grassland at this location (Ubick and Briggs 1989). The threat cited by the petitioner is the construction of the Buck Center for Research on Aging. The proposed project includes the designation of a 300-acre conservation area and a 188-acre development area. The proposed activities include a research center, a residential area, parking lots, and roadways. The Marin blind harvestman is only known from three locations, two occurring on the proposed Buck Center for Research on Aging site (EIP Associates 1992). Based on an analysis of the draft environmental impact report for the proposed project, one of two serpentine rock outcrops containing the species would be damaged or lost (EIP Associates 1992, Western Ecological Services Company 1990). The extent of adequate surveys for this species that have been conducted in suitable habitats in Marin County is not clear. A map displaying the geological features of Burdell Mountain and adjacent areas was also examined in conjunction with this review. The 1:250,000 geological base map for the Santa Rosa Quadrangle (California Division of Mines and Geology 1980) reveals other serpentine outcrops within the general vicinity of Burdell Mountain. Some of these outcrops appear to provide approximately the same combination of geographic features as the known habitats on Burdell Mountain. The petition and supporting documentation indicate that adequate surveys of these other potential habitats were not conducted for the Marin blind harvestman. Moreover, because the petition did not present information on whether the Marin blind harvestman may be declining, additional adequate surveys are needed to assess its distribution and population status. Beyond the information described above, the petitioner presented few data on the status of the animal. Therefore, the Service determines that the petitioner did not present substantial information that the requested action may be warranted. On July 17, 1990, the Service received a petition from Briggs and Mr. Darrell Ubick of the California Academy of Sciences to list the Anza Borrego blind harvestman ( Sitalcina borregoensis ) as an endangered or threatened species. The letter, dated July 14, 1990, was clearly identified as a petition and contained the names, signatures, institutional affiliation, and address of the petitioners. According to the petition, the Anza Borrego blind harvestman is known only from an isolated palm grove at Mountain Palm Springs, a canyon in Anza Borrego State Park in San Diego County, California. Within this site, the petitioners reported that harvestmen have been found only at a ``few moist spots near the palm trees.'' They stated the animal could be harmed by any development at this location. Mountain Palm Springs is an unimproved campground that is regularly patrolled by park rangers (Bill Tippets and Mark Jorgensen, California Department of Parks and Recreation, pers. comm., November 16, 1990). Off-road vehicle use, which has caused extensive habitat destruction in other areas of the southwestern United States, is not a problem at this location (Mark Jorgensen, ibid. ). Six palm ( Washingtonia filifera ) groves occur in the immediate vicinity of the campground and 25 palm groves exist in Anza Borrego State Park, of which, five are located within 10 miles of Mountain Palm Springs. The petitioners did not indicate if surveys had been conducted at any of these other similar habitats. Moreover, because the petition did not present information on whether the Anza Borrego blind harvestman may be declining, additional adequate surveys are needed to assess its distribution and population status. Beyond the information described above, the petitioner presented few data on the status of the animal. Therefore, the Service determines that the petitioners did not present substantial information that the requested action may be warranted.
