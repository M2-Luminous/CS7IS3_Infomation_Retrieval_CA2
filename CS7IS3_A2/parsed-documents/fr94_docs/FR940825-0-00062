FR940825-0-00062 FR940825-0-00014 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [ID2&hyph;1&hyph;5552a; FRL&hyph;5012&hyph;8] Approval and Promulgation of State Implementation Plans: Idaho AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approves the State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted by the State of Idaho for the purpose of bringing about the attainment of the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM&hyph;10). The implementation plan was submitted by the State and satisfied certain Federal requirements for an acceptable moderate nonattainment area PM&hyph;10 SIP for Pinehurst, Idaho. DATES: This final rule will be effective on October 24, 1994 unless adverse or critical comments are received by September 26, 1994. If the effective date is delayed, timely notice will be published in the Federal Register . ADDRESSES: Written comments should be addressed to: Montel Livingston, Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Sixth Avenue, AT&hyph;082, Seattle, Washington 98101. Documents which are incorporated by reference are available for inspection during normal business hours at the Air and Radiation Docket and Information Center, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460. Copies of material submitted to EPA may be examined during normal business hours at the following locations: Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Sixth Avenue, Seattle, WA 98101, and the State of Idaho Division of Environmental Quality, 1410 N. Hilton, Boise, ID 83720. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Stephen Fry, Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Sixth Avenue, AT&hyph;082, Seattle, Washington 98101, (206) 553&hyph;2575. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background The Shoshone County, Pinehurst, Idaho area was designated nonattainment for PM&hyph;10 and classified as moderate under sections 107(d)(4)(B) and 188(a) of the Clean Air Act, upon enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 1 (see 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991) and 40 CFR 81.313 (codified air quality designation for the Pinehurst area)). The air quality planning requirements for moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas are set out in subparts 1 and 4 of title I of the Act. 2 EPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing EPA's preliminary views on how EPA intends to review SIP's and SIP revisions submitted under title I of the Act, including those State submittals containing moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area SIP requirements (see generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992)). Because EPA is describing its interpretations here only in broad terms, the reader should refer to the General Preamble for a more detailed discussion of the interpretations of title I advanced in this proposal and the supporting rationale. In this rulemaking action on the State of Idaho's moderate PM&hyph;10 SIP for the Pinehurst nonattainment area, EPA is applying its interpretations taking into consideration the specific factual issues presented. Additional information supporting EPA's action on this particular area is available for inspection at the address indicated above. 1 The 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act made significant changes to the Act. See Public Law No. 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399. References herein are to the Clean Air Act, as amended (``the Act'' or ``CAA''). The Clean Air Act is codified, as amended, in the U.S. Code at 42 U.S.C. 7401, et seq. 2 Subpart 1 contains provisions applicable to nonattainment areas generally and subpart 4 contains provisions specifically applicable to PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas. At times, subpart 1 and subpart 4 overlap or conflict. EPA has attempted to clarify the relationship among these provisions in the ``General Preamble'' and, as appropriate, in today's notice and supporting information. Those states containing initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas (those areas designated nonattainment under section 107(d)(4)(B)) were required to submit, among other things, the following provisions by November 15, 1991: 1. Provisions to assure that reasonably available control measures (RACM) (including such reductions in emissions from existing sources in the area as may be obtained through the adoption, at a minimum, of reasonably available control technology (RACT)) shall be implemented no later than December 10, 1993; 2. Either a demonstration (including air quality modeling) that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously as practicable but no later than December 31, 1994, or a demonstration that attainment by that date is impracticable; 3. Quantitative milestones which are to be achieved every three years and which demonstrate reasonable further progress (RFP) toward attainment by December 31, 1994; and
