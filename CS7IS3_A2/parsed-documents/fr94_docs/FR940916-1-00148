FR940916-1-00148 FR940916-1-00016 (f) When cars which have not been previously charged and tested as prescribed by paragraph (a) (1) through (14) of this section are added to a train, such cars shall either be given inspection and tests in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) through (14) or tested as prescribed by paragraph (a) (1) through (4) of this section prior to departure in which case these cars must be inspected and tested in accordance with paragraph (a) (1) through (14) at the next terminal where facilities are available for such attention. §232.311 Distance between required Class 1 train brake system tests. (a) 500-mile train movement. A train shall not be operated for more than 500 miles from a point where it receives a Class 1 brake test if any one or more of the following conditions exist: (1) The Class 1 brake test is performed by a qualified train crew member who meets the qualifications given in §232.211. This option is available only for conventional freight trains. Class 1 brake tests on all other types of trains shall be performed by fully qualified brake system inspectors who meet the qualification requirements of §232.207 and §232.209, as applicable. (2) Spot checks, meeting the frequency requirements of §232.15(i), of the Class 1 test are not performed by qualified train brake system supervisor who meets the qualification requirements of §232.205. (3) The railroad, system wide, has a quarterly power brake defect ratio, as defined in §232.5, for the most recently completed calendar quarter, of greater than five percent. (4) The train picks up individual cars enroute or more than one block of previously tested cars is added to the train. (5) The train contains a block of cars whose previous Class 1 brake system test was performed by a qualified train crew member. (6) The railroad does not have a periodic freight brake and single car test program in place that meets all the requirements of this part. (b) 1,500-mile train movements. A train may be operated up to 1,500 miles from a point where it receives a Class 1 brake test if all of the following conditions are met: (1) The Class 1 brake test on that train is performed by a qualified train brake system inspector who meets the requirements of §232.207 (for mechanical inspectors) or §232.209 (when an electronic inspector is required). (2) For freight trains only, a pre-departure freight car safety inspection is performed in accordance with §215.13(b) of this chapter by an inspector meeting the qualifications of §215.11 of this chapter. This inspection shall be performed on all cars. (3) A record of all brake tests performed on the train is available to the train crew. (4) A Qualified Train Brake System Supervisor, meeting the qualification requirements of §232.205, performs frequent spot checks of the Class 1 tests in accordance with §232.15(i). (5) The railroad, system wide, has a quarterly power brake defect ratio, as defined in §232.5, for the most recently completed calendar quarter of less than five percent on outbound trains. (6) The train configuration remains unchanged for the entire trip except for: (i) At most, the addition of a single block of previously tested cars (where the previous Class 1 test was performed by qualified brake system inspector) that has been disconnected from a charging device for less than four hours. The block of cars added shall not have travelled a distance from the point of its last Class 1 inspection that, when added to the remaining distance of haul for the train picking it up, exceeds 1,500 miles; or (ii) The removal of defective cars in accordance with §232.17. (7) The railroad can demonstrate a quality periodic freight brake and single car test program according with §232.319 which meets all the requirements of this part. Each car in the train shall be stencilled with the date that the next periodic freight brake test is due, in accordance with subpart G of this part, and no car shall be past due for a periodic freight brake test. (8) If the train is to proceed beyond 1,500 miles, a new Class 1 brake test shall be performed. (c) 2,500-mile train movements. A train may be operated up to 2,500 miles from a point where it receives a Class 1 brake test if all of the following conditions are met: (1) All the requirements stated in paragraph (b) of this section necessary to qualify the train to travel 1,500 miles between required train brake system tests are met. (2) The train configuration remains unchanged for the entire trip except for, at most, the changing of motive power and the removal of defective cars in accordance with §232.17. (3) The railroad informs FRA in writing, prior to movement of the train, of its intention to operate a train up to 2,500 miles between required Class 1 train brake systems tests. For each train, the information provided to FRA Office of Safety Enforcement shall include: (i) The nature of the service to be provided; (ii) The type of equipment to be used; (iii) The frequency of the service and estimated annual mileage for the equipment used; and (iv) A description of how the criteria to qualify the train will be met. (4) If the train is to proceed beyond 2,500 miles, a new Class 1 brake test shall be performed. (d) 3,500-mile train movements. A train may be operated up to 3,500 miles from a point where it receives a Class 1 brake test if all of the following conditions are met: (1) All the requirements stated in paragraph (c) of this section necessary to qualify the train to travel 2,500 miles between required train brake system tests are met. (2) The train is equipped with reliable brake-pad thickness sensors that are in current calibration, that are operational, and that provide a warning to the train brake control system when brake pads reach the wear limit. (3) The train is equipped with reliable brake-application force sensors that are in current calibration, that are operational, and that provide a warning to the train brake control system when brake application force is not adequate for effective brakes. (4) The train brake system is computer controlled, and the computer is capable of conducting automated tests and monitoring of the train brake system. See §232.113.
