Yahya, 37 years old and who had worked for the FELDA office in Lok Heng Timur in the State of Johor, was sentenced to death under Section 39B of the Dangerous Substances Act of 1952, as amended in 1983. He was arrested by police in possession of the marijuana, which was discovered in a car in Kampung Tok Kamis, District of Pasir Puteh [State of Kelantan], 40 kilometers from Kota Bharu at about 1150 on 25 December 1989. During the hearing of the case Yahya was represented by Attorney Lua Kok Hiyong, and the prosecution was conducted by Amiruddin Abdul Rahman, deputy public prosecutor (DPP). When Ariffin Zakaria, the judge in the case, announced his decision on the matter, he said: "The accused is found guilty as charged and as proved, and the punishment for you is death." Ariffin also ordered that the marijuana involved in this case should be destroyed. When the sentence was handed down, Za'bah Hussein, Yahya's 33-year-old wife who was in the court at the time, screamed continuously. When Yahya was led away from the bench of the accused, Za'bah rushed forward and threw her arms around her husband's neck, while continuing to sob. However, Yahya, the father of three children, appeared calm. He only looked downcast after he was led out of the courtroom when he saw one of his children sitting on a bench outside.
