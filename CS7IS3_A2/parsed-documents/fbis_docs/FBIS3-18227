According to the Union of Public Services, Transport, and Communications Workers (OeTV), in Berlin alone some 100,000 employees participated in the protest actions. According to OeTV's headquarters in Stuttgart, some 50,000 employees in the public services participated in the token strikes on the previous day. The warning strikes are intended to exert pressure on employers to present an offer in the next round of talks on 9 March. In Berlin and the Brandenburg capital Potsdam the warning strikes widely paralyzed public transport on Monday morning. [passage omitted] In Lower Saxony, the trade unions appealed to some 10,000 employees in the public service to down tools. In the metal and engineering industry of the land, the ballot whether to stage a regular strike started with the early shift. Almost 50,000 organized metal workers in 230 enterprises will be asked to cast their vote by Thursday. A possible job action has to be supported by 75 percent. Representatives of the IG Metall trade union once more said that they expected an "overwhelming" majority to vote in favor of a strike. The employers have meanwhile emphasized their readiness to return to the negotiating table immediately. Klaus Murmann, president of the Federal Association of German Employers' Association, has warned that a strike would destroy the basis for economic recovery. Those who now go on strike do not only put their own jobs at risk but make the creation of new jobs in the new laender more difficult, Murmann said.
