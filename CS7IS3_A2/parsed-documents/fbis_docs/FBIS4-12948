Neither would Rabin have done as he pleased when he refrained from transferring 400 settlers from within the town of Hebron to where they should be transferred one day with other settlers. The issue of the settlers and the settlements needs to be resolved in order to ensure a successful settlement. Since the settlers perpetrated the massacre, although they are not alone in this, this issue has become urgent and the transfer of the settlers should now be deemed more important than anything else, in order to give peace a better chance. The number of settlers in the heart of the town of Hebron is inferior to the number of victims who were killed or injured during [the massacre]. This means that Rabin was not serious when dealing with the causes, effects, and consequences of this massacre. Consequently, the violence that is now continuing is natural and will remain so, because its causes and justifications can be easily found in this official Israeli violence and in the violence of the settlers towards the [West] Bank and the [Gaza] Strip, particularly towards Jerusalem and Hebron. Sadness and anger are useless and they do not mean anything it. The expression of this sadness and anger is a cajolery [as heard] which is of no use to the Israelis in the same way as it does not console the Palestinians. The occupation is continuing and the defense of 400 settlers in the town of Hebron allows Rabin to think that the Bank and the Strip and the Palestinian people can be appropriated. Therefore, he goes ahead and closes Hebron, seals off the Bank and lays siege to and starves these Palestinian people to whom the negotiations offer no bread, no security, and not even tranquillity. Nobody supports terrorism, but it is unacceptable to everyone and to human conscience that our people remain subjected to terrorism and that the experiments of violence and racism are carried out against them. It is also unacceptable to expect them to remain silent and calm. Our people have the right to resist. The U.S. Administration should clearly realize that any mishandling can only result in violence. The U.S. Administration and Rabin now have to handle matters on the basis of the principles and good intentions required by the peace process. The first of which being the removal of all the explosive fuses every time a fuse appears to be endangering this process in its entirety.
