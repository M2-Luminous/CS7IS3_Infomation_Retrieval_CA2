Markovski: "Sentences From Five to Eight Years"] [Text] More than seven and a half months since the beginning of the court trial in the so-called "Albanian paramilitary army," in the big hall of Skopje District Court, a council of three presided over by Ljubomir Jovevski, a judge in Skopje Communal Court II, stated its verdict yesterday. The 10 defendants were given prison sentences of a total of 65 years. Judging by the first reactions, all the defendants except the seventh, Burim Murtezani, received their verdicts calmly, without any emotion. However, their lawyers expressed dissatisfaction with the harsh punishment and they said they would appeal against the first decision. The families of the defendants expressed even greater dissatisfaction because they obviously had expected them to be released. Only the deputy of the district attorney Stevan Pavlovski showed neither satisfaction or dissatisfaction. He said he would express his satisfaction or discontent depending on the written explanation, that is, after the lawyers and defendants have lodged their appeal. After the verdict was read, and was also amplified by an explanation, taking into account the defendants' statements in the investigation and the main court proceedings, evaluating the verbal evidence (statements of witnesses, mainly of the defense) and comparing this to the material evidence, we can conclude that the court council fully accepted the accusation. In other words, it was concluded to be true that in October and November of 1991, by mutual consent, Mithat Emini, Hasan Agusi, Resmi Ejupi, Selam Elmazi, and Redjep Sinazi created a hostile association under the name of "National Defense Headquarters," and that until November 1993 they engaged in a number of hostile activities with the aim of a violent change of the Constitutional order of the Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia]. The Court concluded as true the undoubted association, the provision of currency and arms from abroad, the assembling of a computer center, the formation of a Headquarters led by Mithat Emini together with others who were responsible for various military, strategic, and political functions, the formation of paramilitary units for the whole of western Macedonia, as well as for Skopje and Kumanovo, the preparation of an analysis on the political and security situation in the state, as well as on the activity and power of the enemy (The Macedonian Army, the Interior Ministry, and all the non-Muslim population), the formation of a messenger service, all as a function of the so-called "Ilirida" republic, as well as the issuing of a slogan according to which Albanians could speak to Slavs only via arms. Having evaluated the whole event, the Court found all 10 defendants guilty and passed the following sentences: Mithat Emini (49) from Tetovo was given eight years imprisonment. The same sentence was given to Hasan Agusi (34) from Gorni Lipljan, Kosovo, present Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Resmi Ejupi (46) from Gostivar, also citizen of the United States, Selam Elmazi (46) from Gostivar, and Redjepi Sinazi (40) from Tetovo were sentenced to seven years imprisonment. Husein Haskaj (43) from Djakovica, former Macedonian deputy defense minister, living in Skopje, Akif Demiri (53) from Cegrane, Gostivar district, and Abdiselam Arslani (48) from Poroj, Tetovo district, were sentenced to six years. Burim Murtezani (30) from Tetovo and Eugen Cami (53) from Debar were sentenced to five years in prison. The time they spent in prison during the investigation will also be taken into account. The court also issued protective measures. Thus, Hasan Agusi will be expelled from Macedonia for good after he has served his sentence. All objects were confiscated by the state (guns, computers, vehicles, and so on). Savo Kocarov, the defense lawyer of Mithat Emini announced that he would appeal and asked why a court proceeding was necessary when the Court reached its verdict on the grounds of an investigation that was mainly denied by the defendants at the main trial. The defense lawyer of Husein Haskaj, Burim Murtezani, and Eugen Cami also announced their intention to appeal, saying that the Court had not accepted any arguments presented by the defendants and the defense. Contrary to this, the explanation of the verdict specified that all extenuating circumstances had been taken into account (the defendants had no previous convictions, they had no significant possessions, and some of them are in bad health).
