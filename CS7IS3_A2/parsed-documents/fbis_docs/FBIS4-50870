But, compared with March, export orders declined by U.S.$11 million, the ministry said. Orders for telecommunications and information processing equipment, metal products and textiles increased in April, but purchase contracts for plastic and rubber products, electric appliances and transport equipment dropped. Hong Kong remained the largest source of export orders, up 12.74 percent from March. Compared with last April, orders from the British colony, a conduit for indirect Taiwan-Mainland China trade rose 39.55 percent. Export orders from the United States and Japan increased 7.5 percent and 3.67 percent, respectively, from the year-earlier levels. Aggregate export orders placed with local manufacturers amounted to U.S.$29.09 billion in the first four months of this year, up 4.43 percent from the year before. Economics Ministry officials said Taiwan's exports will gradually regain momentum in the coming months, judging from steady growth in export orders. Exports grew a modest 2.3 percent in the January-April period, far lower than the originally targeted 7 percent growth. The lackluster export growth has prompted the government to adjust this year's economic growth target downward to 5.94 percent from the previously-set 6.17 percent. The officials attributed the slow export growth mainly to a rapid shrinking of labor-intensive industries here. For example, furniture, textile and footwear exports registered substantial declines during the four-month period. The officials noted that as Taiwan has lost its competitive edge in such labor-intensive industries, the country should accelerate its development of capital and technology-intensive industries in order to maintain its niches in the world market.
