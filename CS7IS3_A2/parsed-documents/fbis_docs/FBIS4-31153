Let us recall that the IMF delegation has been in Poland on a two-week visit. The aim of the mission is to work out a new annual agreement with the fund. Following the meeting, Deputy Prime Minister Grzegorz Kolodko said: [Begin recording] [Kolodko] We have complete unanimity here that such a strategy was missing in the past few years, and the fund will, I believe, accept what we propose. But we would like to agree on a number of subjects, first and foremost on the reconstruction of the financial sector, as well as further progress toward macroeconomic stabilization. [Correspondent Krystyna Koziol] Sir, as new minister of finance, will you want to introduce any changes in agreements that we occasionally sign with the IMF? [Kolodko] No. At the moment, we want to work out an agreement; we are hoping that the IMF board will accept them at the end of July or in early August. It will be the agreement establishing certain proportions for the nearest period. We have our own plans, and there is a question whether the fund shares the same opinion. We have established that essentially there is a far-reaching convergence of views. Therefore, there is no need to introduce any changes--just to work out an agreement the fund will accept. We will generally follow that line, which has been marked out in the strategy for Poland and which will be the subject of parliamentary debate on Thursday. [Koziol] What significance will the conclusion of this new agreement with the IMF have for Poland? [Kolodko] First and foremost, it will put our activities in order. It will also be confirmation by the outside world that our line of the economic policy that Prime Minister Pawlak's government, the Democratic Left Alliance, and the Polish Peasant Party coalition government has been implementing is accepted by international financial circles. It will also be an extra encouragement for additional influx of investment from private sources, which we are keen to obtain because our strategy envisages that we obtain a maximum of these resources. Finally, it will have a concrete meaning in the sense that we will obtain more resources from the IMF, which will help us finance certain plans, especially those connected with the balancing of our balance of payments in the coming period. [Koziol] If I remember correctly, the resources we obtained came to about $600 million. Will the new agreement--that is, if we manage to sign it--promise a similar amount? [Kolodko] No, the amount will be smaller, but we are already in a different phase. Today, we do not borrow money left, right, and center. As a result of our policies and strategies, our economy is on a growth path, and we will borrow money abroad only when it is really needed. [end recording]
