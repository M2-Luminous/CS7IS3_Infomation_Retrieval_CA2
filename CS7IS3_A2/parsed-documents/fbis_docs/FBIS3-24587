N. Pankov; UDC 537.228:621.3.049.77] [Abstract] Problems of organizing and selecting the structure and circuit of elementary cells of a controlled transparency of an opto-electronic memory device based on thin ferro-electric films are examined. The feasibility and advantages are demonstrated of combining the complimentary metal oxide semiconductor, silicon on sapphire or silicon on insulated substrate with the technology of thin ferroelectric films. A structural diagram of a transparency cell with electronic recording of information is provided and its functioning is discussed. The cell contains an electronic memory element - a static flip-flop - and four identical light modulators. Two of these modulators are switchable and have a paraphase control. Two other, reference modulators, are not switchable and are controlled by a dc voltage from an external source. An other cell is also described, which contains a differential converter with two photo-receivers at the input. For a group parallel optical information recording on the transparency, it is best to employ in the cell a differential photo-electric converter with two photo-detectors at the output operating in the optical signal integration mode and a latch flip-flop at the output.
