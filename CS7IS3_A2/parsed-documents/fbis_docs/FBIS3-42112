Anyone who has worked for decades in this mysterious field feels, together with relief and a feeling of bitterness, that too many years have been spent in a routine of prohibitions and inflexible restrictions. I will not undertake to judge the advisability of the decisions made a half century ago--the all-embracing classification of that vast body of human and physical resources which was put into effect at the dawn of the atomic problem. I know only that not one of the countries outside the socialist camp has taken such a step. We must think that we are not the last ones for purely economic reasons, in order to avoid the huge unproductive expenditures, to maintain an army of protectors and the inevitable informers in secret matters. All the same, the leak of information is already substantial when there are two who bring it instead of one, unless they are truly isolated from the outside world, of course. But hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people, have been counted here. In 1954, when a program of searches for uranium was undertaken on a wide scale, a geological technician with a radiation meter joined our coal geological exploration party in Ryazan Oblast. And in the core sample of one of the boreholes selected for measurement, in a plain layer of clay on the side of the coal-bearing area, a high concentration of uranium was suddenly discovered. Soon after, controlled drilling was begun under conditions of strict secrecy. The trust employees stood watch at the drills and collected and documented the cores, and we just provided the drilling process. To the puzzled questions why we were drilling where there is obviously no coal and in a system that was unprecedentedly dense, the response was for the needs of the trust, "but I do not know what kind." While the slyly smiling drilling foreman once revealed that his mother had brought home a tale from the market that geologists had found an "atom" under the village of Zheltukhino. How can we help but remember the immortal adage, over 200 years old, uttered by the observant Madam de (Stal) after a trip to our country: "In Russia everything is a mystery and nothing is a secret." The instructional song of the miner leaving for a health resort could also have been included in the Vysotskiy repertoire by the head of the first division of the uranium mine. Quiet Yakov Davidovich Gotman, an honored figure in science and technology, one of the pioneers of Soviet uranium geology and discoverer of the unique Aldan uranium mining area in southern Yakutia, has recounted the absolutely fantastic story about the information leak. In the late 1940's, he was sent along with S. Yershov, the deputy minister of geology, and his colleague B. Petrushevskiy, to Central Asia on assignment. On the next day, the "Voice of America" reported the departure of three specialists from Moscow for the Central Asian uranium deposits. After the country acquired its atomic and thermonuclear weapons, through the selfless labor of its specialists and with a little help from the prospectors who were just as selfless, and was able to stockpile enough of them to annihilate all life on the planet, secrecy in the geology of atomic raw material was turned into an indisputable absurdity. But the screws were tightened even more. In the first decades of the uranium boom a researcher working in the atomic energy field could publish scientific works which did not deal with uranium with all the publication data, including the name of the organization in which he was working. But if reference was made to articles on uranium geology, mention of the subject of one's research and its geographical location, as well as one's place of work, was prohibited. The routine of a scientific institution was also considered a big state secret, and Anatoliy Shcheranskiy, as we know, paid with a 13-year sentence in the camps at the end of the Brezhnev era for allegedly divulging such information. From the mid-1970's, after achieving parity with the United States, the ban on indicating one's place of work was extended to all scientists who were working with uranium. Even if the author of a completely harmless article did not mention uranium in previously published works. Even when secrets which they endeavored to safeguard were lost because of circumstances, this did not stop those in control of universal secrecy. After the Prague spring was smothered, the head of uranium geology in Czechoslovakia, Vladimir Ruzhechka, did not return home. In a book published in Canada in the mid-1970's, he revealed the uranium resources not only of Eastern Europe, but the Soviet Union as well. But like a mosquito which continues sucking blood by inertia when its belly has been cut off, so the illuminated skyscraper of domestic secrecy has continued to increase the number of its stories. The closed nature of the sector was convenient for the uranium barons to a large extent, making it easier to pump huge budget appropriations into it. The overexploration of deposits, linked chiefly with the faulty planning system, which is inconceivable in other countries, is typical for Soviet geology as a classic cost-based branch of the economy of socialism. Wages and bonuses depended not on specific results, but the running meters of drilling, the cubic meters penetrated, and so forth. Thus the effectiveness of geological exploration operations turned out to be less advantageous for collectives than increasing their volumes. It is unlikely that the almost unknown venture involving the mobilization of vast sums and numbers of people in completely unprepared searches for uranium in the Kodar Range in northeastern Chita Oblast would have been possible without absolute secrecy. Based only on a highly radioactive piece of rock with absolutely no geographical connection (such specimens are called "sobakity" in geological terminology) which was sent to Moscow, they quickly sent out two camps of prisoners into the unpopulated high mountains under severe conditions in the late 1940's, and urgently put together a specialized geological exploration expedition and a second expedition to conduct scientific support for the operations, organized from scientific associates of the Leningrad Geological Institute, who were to remain at the site the year round. At the same time, they shipped out heavy equipment and began drilling, tunneling, and so forth in an area that had been given absolutely no geological study. In the wilderness of the mountainous taiga, out of touch with communications, the prisoners immediately began erecting the buildings of a new town. The materials needed were taken in by a winter road, and by aircraft the remainder of the year. The results turned out to be poor--at the cost of much effort and many lives, they found only a number of small signs of ore, unsuitable for industrial exploitation. The army of specialists who provided their intellect and hard labor and often lost their health to develop the country's uranium base were the victims of this secrecy. They were prohibited from traveling abroad, even to "fraternal countries," and from contacts and correspondence with foreign colleagues, which scientists need like a person needs air. Without convincing explanations, authorization to participate in international conferences could be refused, even when they took place in the USSR, and even when personally invited with a paper which did not lead to complaints. When my article on important aspects of the theory of ore formation, whose conclusions were based on Ilya Prigozhin's assumptions about the lack of equilibrium in thermodynamics, appeared in one of the scientific journals, I decided to send a reprint to the Nobel laureate and soon after received a warm letter from him, a copy of his last monograph, and an invitation to visit him at the institute in Brussels. Dreams about a trip were obviously illusory at that time. But it would really be up-to-date for an outstanding scientist of modern times to publish support for his scientific ideas. It was during those very years of exhausting opposition from the powerful (not in number, but opportunities) group of scientific opponents headed by V. A. Zharikov, the current academician-secretary of the RAN [Russian Academy of Sciences], who was no less omnipotent then as the chairman of the VAK [Higher Degree Commission] and who successfully blocked my certification for the doctor of sciences degree for almost 20 years. Nevertheless, I preferred to remain silent, for the fact that I had exchanged letters with a foreign scientist could have been harmful. The restrictions on movement and contacts were imposed on participants in the American atomic project as well. But unlike our bureaucracy, these restrictions were extended equally to everyone, from Robert Oppenheimer, the head of the project, to the ordinary technician. But our uranium "generals," who possessed incomparably greater information under the "secret" classification, very calmly traveled throughout the world. The wives of the high officials working in the uranium field also had the same privileges. The Americans were generously compensated with additional payments for the inconveniences related to the restrictions. Additional payment "for secrecy" was also stipulated for Soviet uranium employees by some ancient classified government decrees. But in accordance with the classicial laws of the Kingdom of Distorting Mirrors, the payments were received by the directors, their deputies, chief accountants, and employees of the first divisions, that is, the ones who forgot long ago how to hold a geologist's hammer--or never did know how, or how to walk the hills and dales with a radiation meter and through mine workings, or to study the radioactive rocks under a microscope. The farfetched secrecy, in accordance with the laws of feedback, has hit the system which gave rise to it as well. There is a wide conviction that the criminals sentenced to death are not shot but sent to the uranium mines, where they soon die. This is all a fantasy. Throughout my working life I have spent innumerable shifts underground not only in uranium mines, but coal, cobalt, molybdenum, and gold workings as well. I am prepared to attest to the fact that I never encountered more comfortable conditions than in uranium mines. A well organized and strictly controlled ventilation system that provides for work safety, workings at one's full height, not manholes for "abdominal movement," and a large number of showers on the surface, maintained in model sanitary condition... Of course, the all-powerful Minsredmash [Ministry of Medium Machine Building] was not ashamed to make use of the convicts' forced labor on a wide scale. But just in construction and auxiliary operations. The prisoners were not underground. They were not needed there, and the uranium mines did not experience a shortage of a mining work force. Many were attracted there by the exemplary work conditions, the higher earnings, and the well-equipped housing with which the ministry's towns and settlements were always provided. In addition, the radioactivity of even the rich natural ores is incomparable with the enriched uranium from the reactors of nuclear power stations, the deadly radiation which is erroneously attributed to the mines. If one is looking for places suitable for prisoners condemned to death, one should look in the coal mines, with their unacceptably low level of safety equipment. But what comes with the declassification of uranium, aside from a belated quiet satisfaction? Its features as a more "cosmopolitan" environment than other ores help to "get into" the general natural laws of ore formation. So the tens of thousands of volumes of handwritten reports by Soviet uranium workers with the most extensive information, which continue to remain behind the steel doors of the geological funds, are truly the property of world science. The titanic intellectual labor of several generations of specialists, which is capable of standing up to the competition in any market of scientific knowledge, is concentrated in them. The only question is whether we are really able to enter these steel doors.
