According to a report from the Thai Commercial Counsellor in Washington to the Commerce Permanent Secretary, the nine textile and garment exporters targetted for US action are Indonesia, Egypt, Pakistan, India, Thailand, Korea, Hong Kong, Turkey and the Philippines. The report maintained that the US textile group cast doubt on whether the US government could achieve success in its market-opening talks with other countries under the Uruguay Round negotiations, which is scheduled to be endorsed on April 15. The group was disappointed as the US could not negotiate to prolong the textile agreement. It demanded the government do what it had promised: open foreign markets for US products like the US market is opened for foreign imports. The group has proposed the US government impose retaliatory measures against countries failing to satisfactorily open their markets for US products. The measures proposed include: -- Increasing customs duties on major textile products. -- Opposing membership applications to the World Trade Organisation. -- Cancelling the generalised system of preference privileges.
