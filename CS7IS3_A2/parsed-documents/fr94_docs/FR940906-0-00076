FR940906-0-00076 FR940906-0-00020 Conclusion In view of the little or no cost of compliance versus enhancements to aviation safety and efficiency, the FAA has determined that the rule will be cost-beneficial. International Trade Impact Statement This rule will not constitute a barrier to international trade, including the export of American goods and services to foreign countries and the import of foreign goods and services into the United States. This assessment is based on the fact that the rule will impose little or no costs on aircraft operators or aircraft manufacturers (U.S. or foreign). Regulatory Flexibility Determination In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, the FAA has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities. This assessment is based on the fact that the rule will impose little or no cost on small entities. Federalism Implications The regulations proposed herein will not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between the national government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule will not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. International Civil Aviation Organization and Joint Aviation Regulations In keeping with the U.S. obligations under the Convention on International Civil Aviation, it is FAA policy to comply with ICAO Standards and Practices (SARP) to the maximum extent practicable. The FAA has determined that this rule will not present any differences. Paperwork Reduction Act In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub L. 96&hyph;511), there are no requirements for information collection associated with this rule. Conclusion For the reasons discussed in the preamble, and based on the findings in the Regulatory Flexibility Determination and the International Trade Impact Analysis, the FAA has determined that this regulation is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. In addition, the FAA certifies that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This proposal is not considered significant under DOT order 2100.5, Policies and Procedures for Simplification, Analysis, and Review of Regulations. This rule is cost effective as evidenced by the cost/benefits review statement, included in this Final Rule.
