SUMMARY: This action adds to the Procurement List military resale commodities and services to be furnished by nonprofit agencies employing persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 3, 1994. ADDRESSES: Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled, Crystal Square 3, Suite 403, 1735 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, Virginia 22202&hyph;3461. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Beverly Milkman (703) 603&hyph;7740. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On June 24, July 8 and 15, 1994, the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled published notices (59 FR 32686, 35112 and 36168) of proposed additions to the Procurement List. After consideration of the material presented to it concerning capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide the military resale commodities and services, fair market price, and impact of the additions on the current or most recent contractors, the Committee has determined that the military resale commodities and services listed below are suitable for procurement by the Federal Government under 41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c and 41 CFR 51&hyph;2.4. I certify that the following action will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major factors considered for this certification were: 1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities other than the small organizations that will furnish the military resale commodities and services to the Government. 2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on current contractors for the military resale commodities and services. 3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish the military resale commodities and services to the Government. 4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c) in connection with the military resale commodities and services proposed for addition to the Procurement List. Accordingly, the following military resale commodities and services are hereby added to the Procurement List: Military Resale Commodities Bag, Tote, Canvas M.R. 511 M.R. 512 M.R. 513 M.R. 595 Cloth, Sponge M.R. 580 Cloth, Dish M.R. 942 Services Grounds Maintenance Naval Ordnance Center, Pacific Division Detachment Port Hadlock Port Hadlock, Washington Janitorial/Custodial Naval Station Commissary San Diego, California Janitorial/Custodial U.S. Customhouse Savannah, Georgia Janitorial/Custodial Federal Building, U.S. Post Office and Courthouse Valdosta, Georgia Janitorial/Custodial Red Rock Canyon Visitor Center Red Rock National Conservation Area Las Vegas, Nevada Janitorial/Custodial Charles E.
