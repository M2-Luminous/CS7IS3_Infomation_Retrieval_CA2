SHIHAN has obtained the text of the letter, which urges the Jordanian House of Representatives to adopt appropriate measures to nullify the Gaza-Jericho agreement, dubbed by the letter as a disgraceful treaty. The letter asserted that a practical approach to nullify the agreement is to emphasize armed jihad as the only and best way to face Zionist schemes and colonialism. The letter explained Iran's view toward threats to the al-Aqsa Mosque in holy Jerusalem. The letter denounced the Islamic nations' silence toward the serious, false decisions made by what it termed the demonic Zionist movement against the al-Aqsa Mosque.
