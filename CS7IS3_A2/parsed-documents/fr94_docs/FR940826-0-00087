(14) CFC&hyph;12 and R&hyph;502 Vending Machines, Retrofit (a) R&hyph;404A._R&hyph;404A, which consists of HFC&hyph;125, HFC&hyph;143a, and HFC&hyph;134a, is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 and R&hyph;502 in retrofitted vending machines. None of this blend's constituents contains chlorine, and thus this blend poses no threat to stratospheric ozone. However, HFC&hyph;125 and HFC&hyph;143a have very high GWPs, and the GWP of HFC&hyph;134a is somewhat high. EPA strongly encourages recycling and reclamation of this blend to reduce its direct global warming impact. Although HFC&hyph;134a is flammable, the blend is not. Leak testing has demonstrated that its composition never becomes flammable.
