This was stated in a letter sent to UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali by Dragomir Djokic, head of the Yugoslav mission in the United Nations, on behalf of the Yugoslav Government. The assertion by the authors of the resolution that Bosnia-Herzegovina is the victim of Serbian aggression has been refuted in practice with fierce fighting between the Bosnian Croats and Muslims. The authors of the resolution, the letter states, ignore the fact that it is the Bosnian Muslims who have been persistently obstructing the peace process in the past few months and refusing to accept and implement the agreements that the cochairmen of the conference on the former Yugoslavia consider realistic and just. The Yugoslav Government rejects the accusations about concentration camps throughout the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and stresses that such camps are run by the Bosnian Muslims and the Bosnian Croats. The resolution also mentions the violation of human rights of ethnic Albanians, Bosnians, Hungarians, Croats, and others in Kosmet [Kosovo-Metohija] and Vojvodina, which is not only something that the resolution should not be dealing with but also represents an unprecedented fabrication and distortion of the truth, the letter states. Particularly unacceptable is the fact that Security Council Resolution 820, which was imposed on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia because the Bosnian Serbs rejected the Vance-Owen plan, is still in force, even though cochairmen David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg have abandoned the plan themselves. This was pointed out by Ambassador Djokic in the letter to Butrus-Ghali.
