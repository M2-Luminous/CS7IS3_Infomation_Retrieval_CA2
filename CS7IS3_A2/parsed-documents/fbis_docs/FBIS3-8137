Meciar was justifying his decision not to sign the law on large privatization, which will be returned to parliament. He said the law on large privatization had to ensure the connection between the FNM and the government, although it was not necessary that the finance minister be also chairman of the Inspection Body of the FNM. It was in the interest of parliament that a member of the government, possibly a state secretary, should be a member of the FNM board, Meciar said. As well as being premier, Meciar is at present privatization minister and chairman of the FNM board. However, the amendment to the law on privatization forbids this. If the government is not connected to the FNM, which will also be the holder of the disposable resources, the cabinet will not be capable of giving companies further guarantees for loans and credits abroad, because it will not be able to cover possible losses, Meciar warned. "If we knew what sort of situation we might get into we would propose a state budget without a deficit. The deficit we would shift on to the FNM, as Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus has done," Meciar said.
