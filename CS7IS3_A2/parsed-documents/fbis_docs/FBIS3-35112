FBIS3-35112 "drnes034_n_94011" FBIS-NES-94-034 Document Type:Daily Report 18 Feb 1994 LEBANON Hizballah's `Crime' Against Family, State Viewed NC1702131894 NC1702131894 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Beirut AL-SHIRA' in Arabic in its issue of 14 February carries on pages 3-5 an approximately 3,000-word article by Chief Editor Hasan Sabra, entitled "A Compound Crime in Ba'labakk--the Assassination of a Family and a State", commenting on a recent incident in al-Biqa' where local clansmen took the law into their hands and put to death a youth of 16 who had killed three people -- a mother and her two children -- in the course of an armed burglary. After analyzing the factors leading to the current economic hardships in that area, the slowness of the judicial process, and the enfeebled sense of national identity, the writer discusses Hizballah's plans to replace or nullify the state in various Lebanese areas. He remarks that Ba'labakk's double crime "did not come from a vacuum." Sabra points out that when the narcotic crops in al-Biqa', a former mainstay of that area's economy, particularly in northern al-Biqa', were eliminated in line with new "regional circumstances and U.S. conditions," no lawful alternative to making a living was offered, thus encouraging theft. He then discusses some people's weak affiliation to the homeland and their inclination to accept tribal justice. He says this is encouraged by the condition of the Lebanese courts, which are plagued by delays and interventions by politicians. The result, he says, is that people despair of getting justice from the courts. He notes that "thousands of cases have piled up in the Lebanese courts, some never get to court, some remain in the investigators' hands, and some are buried under the debate among lawyers and judges." He calls for improving judges' living conditions and urges politicians to keep their hands off the judiciary, declaring: "We place the chief responsibility for the judicial crisis in our country on the shoulders of the majority of politicians, their wishes, greed, circumvention of the law, their pressure on judges, and their alternate threats and bribes to them." On the significance of the Ba'labakk incident, he says: "While we denounce the rejection of society's laws, weak sense of national belonging, and recourse to tribal law, we also share the feeling of those who believe in one homeland that there is a party that does not want the state to exist and indeed believes that the state's very existence is at the expense of its own. "Who does not know Hizballah's plans to abolish the state in Ba'labakk-al-Hirmil, Beirut's southern suburb, and every other place where it can forfeit the state's institutions, flout its laws, and reject society's norms, using pretexts to resort to armed force, sometimes trying to bribe and at others making threats? It always has ready rulings [fatwas] to twist the arm of religion, distort it, and use it to intimidate the public. "The state is absent in Ba'labakk-al-Hirmil just as it is absent in the southern suburb and Jabal 'Amil. "In Ba'labakk, Hizballah nullifies the courts, in the southern suburb it nullifies public services, and in the south it nullifies the state's sovereignty. In all these cases it tries to impose its laws at the public's, society's, and the homeland's expense. "An opportunity offered itself in Ba'labakk to implement Hizballah's Islamic republic slogan, in practice not in theory. It was offered on a blood-soaked pillow. Hizballah did not let the opportunity slip. The party that prevents the building of a general hospital in the Southern Suburb and opposes new roads, electricity supplies, and telephone services to the people will have no scruples about exploiting the murder of a whole family. "And now what? "What happened in Ba'labakk is a compound crime in which a family was murdered and a state was assassinated. State officials and the public must respond to this assassination. They must go by the book and use the state's prestige. The crucial component of prestige is justice and the retrieval of outlaws... by the law."
