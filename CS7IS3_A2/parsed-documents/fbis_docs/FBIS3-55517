In accordance with the Russian Federation Constitution, the Chechen Republic was and still is a fully equal component [subyekt] of Russia and must by rights be worthily represented in the Russian Federation Federal Assembly. By means of their active stance and their daily dialogue with colleagues from other parts of Russia the newly elected Federal Assembly deputies from the Chechen Republic could make an appreciable contribution to eliminating the problems that exist today. For its part the Russian Federation Central Electoral Commission is ready to provide organizational and financial backup in holding the elections to the Federal Assembly from the Chechen Republic. We are convinced that, given good will and the desire for happiness and prosperity for the peoples of our common multinational motherland -- Russia -- a second appeal on this question will elicit understanding and a positive decision from the people and the leadership of the Chechen Republic. With very best wishes, [Signed] N.T.
