Speaking about how the Sino-Japanese relationship would develop in 1994, the official said: "We hope Prime Minister Hosokawa can visit China as early as possible next year." He described a visit by Hosokawa to the PRC as "important for China." However, considering the current fluid political situation in Japan, he added that the prime minister could visit here "at any time that is convenience to him." His remarks expressed the hope that Hosokawa would make a visit, even if only short, whenever he found time during the Diet session. Touching on the subject of Japan's bid for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council [UNSC], he said: "In principle, China also supports the idea of expanding and reforming the structure of the UNSC when time is ripe." However, he reiterated China's cautious stance, saying: "It is necessary to listen to the opinions of member nations to form a consensus." The official expressed opposition to a view supported by some members of the Japanese ruling coalition that Japan should start government-level exchanges with Taiwan. He said: "Naturally, China is interested in moves in Japan to send its ministers to Taiwan." He called on Tokyo to stick to its policy of normalizing relations with China while limiting exchanges with Taiwan to those at the private level. The official also commented on the proposal to establish a council of representatives from the Chinese National Defense Ministry and the Japanese Defense Ministry which would be a separate body from the security council formed by the foreign ministries of each country. He said: "I agree to promote dialogue between the defense authorities." He also made a point about the Sino-Japanese security council. "Although Japan calls it the security council, China refers to the dialogue on regional security between the foreign ministries, so other countries will not mistake for a forum similar to the Japanese-U.S. security committee." His remark indicated there is a slight difference between Tokyo and Beijing in their views on the nature of the council.
