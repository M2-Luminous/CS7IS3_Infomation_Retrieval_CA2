M'Hamed Boucetta, leader of Istiqlal, talks about political blockages, Driss Basri, Youssoufi, and his own successor. He also has some things to say, especially about religion, that will be of interest beyond Morocco's borders.... Since Morocco's political alternation derailed, the country has been in a bizarre political situation characterized by a twofold anomaly: an all-powerful opposition cheated of the chance to govern in the foreseeable future; and a "temporary" technocratic government that has every prospect of staying on indefinitely. This situation, although detrimental for an embryonic democracy, probably is not so very unwelcome to the champions of a strong state, the eternal "Makhzen." But how are the major opposition parties coping with it? Are they not victimized by their own refusal to enter the government last November? This question, which was at the heart of the interview with Mohamed Elyazghi, leader of the USFP [Socialist Union of Popular Forces] (JA No. 1728), is also of concern to M'Hamed Boucetta, head of the Istiqlal party. Interesting comparisons can be made between their respective responses and the different tones they take. The former carries on his shoulders, for better or for worse, the ponderous legacy of Abderrahim and Abderrahmane (Bouabid and Youssoufi) and takes refuge in wooden rhetoric. The latter radiates the pugnacious serenity of someone whose political career is all behind him. Jumping ahead of the question about his retirement, he confirmed his intention to pass the baton of leadership in April. To whom? To M'Hamed Diouri. A figure of some public notoriety, the heir apparent is not to everyone's liking. But what counts, says the secretary general, is whether he's to his own party's liking! More important are M'Hamed Boucetta's observations about Islam and Islamism. If Morocco has been immunized against the "fundamentalist virus," he never tires of saying, it is because of the monarchy, which dominates the religious landscape. Of course. But it is another question whether Istiqlal's writ extends equally far. The party of Allal el-Fassi has always taken to heart its hortatory mission, "praising Good and denouncing Evil." Istiqlal's message, the fruit of half a century of struggle for freedom, is thought provoking and even applicable beyond Morocco's borders. It can be summarized as follows: Islam and democracy are not incompatible, so long as the citizens are also believers. The corollary, adapted to the current turbulent winds of change, is that Islam is too serious to be left to the Islamists. [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Three months after the fact, don't you regret not participating in the government? [Boucetta] Absolutely not. Even those in our party and elsewhere in the country who had misgivings are convinced now that we were right. Everyone realizes it would have been a major blunder to accept bad implementation of a constitution that had only just been revised, especially in a climate of insecurity. [JEUNE AFRIQUE] But now? [Boucetta] One of the main provisions of the new constitution stipulates that the government must obtain its investiture from parliament before it goes to work. Well, what exactly were we offered? "Participation" in the government, but without a word to say about its composition, the king reserving to himself the right to choose a prime minister from outside the ranks of the majority. Moreover, participation in the government under these conditions would have signified our endorsement of the outcome of the elections, and in particular the 17 September indirect elections for one-third of the deputies. Unacceptable things happened on that occasion, things we could not swallow. [JEUNE AFRIQUE] But you realize, at all events, that you would not have been able to get a ministry as strategic as Interior. [Boucetta] But why not? There's nothing preordained about it. Every ministry should be put on the table, discussed among the responsible leaders, and I can very easily imagine it being headed by one of our people. That said, it is not a question of individuals or portfolios. The whole question is whether or not we in Morocco really want to have a government responsible to parliament. [JEUNE AFRIQUE] If you had formed the government, would Driss Basri have kept Interior? [Boucetta] At this time, I do not think so. Because it is that very ministry and its head who by their action or inaction were responsible for the recent elections being tainted with numerous irregularities. Thus it would have been difficult to keep the same man in the same position. [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Is the interior minister only the meticulous implementer of what he is told to do, or does he have discretion to act? [Boucetta] Listen, I am not putting anyone on trial here. Driss Basri in the past has shown himself to be a very responsible person; he ably managed and directed his ministry, and even succeeded in coming to terms with his adversaries. But it also happened that he took initiatives contrary to the spirit of democracy and covered up for the unscrupulous actions of governors at the time of the elections. [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Are you personally one of those who thinks there exists in Morocco a "clandestine single party"--to wit, that of the regime? [Boucetta] But it is not clandestine at all! It does its work in broad daylight. In certain sectors, the apparatus of the Interior Ministry operates directly, not through intermediaries. [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Isn't it too easy to blame all Morocco's problems on Driss Basri? [Boucetta] At bottom, we are not challenging the minister but rather the government as a whole. At the same time, Driss Basri has such great influence on his colleagues that in the last analysis everything starts and ends with him. He is omnipresent and omnipotent. [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Wasn't the Interior Ministry equally powerful even back when you were in government? [Boucetta] Not to this extent. Since 1984, the last year we were part of the government, Interior has brought under its control the sectors of housing, infrastructure, and information, just to name a few. Quite a lot, really. [JEUNE AFRIQUE] One sometimes has the feeling that the parliamentary opposition is creating a great deal of stir without getting much in the way of results. After all, the government is running things, and your criticisms, confined to the legislative chamber, carry hardly any political weight. There is something unhealthy in this situation. [Boucetta] It would have been even more unhealthy if we had participated in the government and turned parliament into an echo chamber! [JEUNE AFRIQUE] What are your current objectives? [Boucetta] We must repair the damage done by the legislative elections: in other words, start back at square one and hold new elections. Dissolve the chamber, then proceed to a new vote, but this time hold transparent and honest elections. [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Is that realistic? [Boucetta] Of course. The dissolution could be only partial and cover, for example, just the seats filled in the 17 September indirect elections. It can be argued that such a decision would be politically wise... At all events, we have filed so many appeals for annulment of results that if they were all granted the entire composition of the chamber would be changed. Certainly the situation is blocked, unhealthy. But this can be remedied, if people will just listen to what we are saying. [JEUNE AFRIQUE] How are your relations with the USFP? Still idyllic? [Boucetta] Let us say they are agreeable and cordial. [JEUNE AFRIQUE] To the point of marriage, or just a return to living together, as in the past? [Boucetta] Nothing is ruled out. But before we think about merger, it would be better to increase our joint endeavors in every domain. [JEUNE AFRIQUE] How did you feel about the resignation of Abderrahmane Youssoufi last September? [Boucetta] I was unhappy about it, if only because I had become accustomed to working with him on a daily basis for two years. While visiting France I took the opportunity to visit him, and I think I can say that he has not totally dropped out of the political struggle. But it does appear to me that his decision not to return to his position as first secretary of the USFP is irreversible. [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Beyond what his friends are saying for the record, what in your opinion led him to resign? [Boucetta] I think I know Si Abderrahmane pretty well. We first met back in 1939, when we were attending Marrakech college. It is in his character: He reached the point where he could not stand the game and its constraints any longer, and he disengaged. I did not expect his resignation, but in retrospect it was hardly surprising: His reactions in the days just preceding his decision should have tipped me off. Several times, in the course of meetings with members of the government in the national electoral commission, he literally exploded: He found the behavior of the regime vis-a-vis USFP, Istiqlal, and even the National Rally of Independents [RNI] inadmissible and intolerable. [JEUNE AFRIQUE] You are not the sort to quit... [Boucetta] That is right. It is neither in my character nor in...my culture. I can resign from a government or from a football team, but not from Istiqlal. The party is like a second skin to me. I cannot see myself for one second writing the kind of letter Si Abderrahmane wrote. [JEUNE AFRIQUE] What do you think about the creation of a human rights affairs ministry? [Boucetta] It is a good thing. A week before the formation of the government, we had asked for establishment of a parliamentary commission on human rights. The idea was rejected, on grounds there was no ministry responsible for human rights policy! Now there is. [JEUNE AFRIQUE] What about the naming of a Jewish cabinet minister? [Boucetta] It is not a first. Shortly after independence, I myself was a member of the government in which Dr. Benzaken also served. No problem. [JEUNE AFRIQUE] What about Serge Berdugo in Tourism? [Boucetta] We know the lad well. We have nothing against him. He is serious and competent. [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Istiqlal's next congress will be held in April... [Boucetta] 21-23 April. Let me jump ahead of your question: I am still determined to step down as secretary-general. [JEUNE AFRIQUE] And will your friends let you? [Boucetta] They still refuse to believe it. But I have been in the job for 20 years now, and sometimes you have to know when to quit. My decision is unalterable. [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Who will succeed you? [Boucetta] Mohamed Douiri will certainly stand for the position. More precisely, I will support him. [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Will everyone support him? [Boucetta] I think so. [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Even outside the party? [Boucetta] It's the party militants that matter to us! [JEUNE AFRIQUE] And what about you? What will you do? [Boucetta] I will continue to be a party militant, of course. We have a presidency council composed of Istiqlal veterans such as Si Boubeker Kadiri and Hachemi Filali. I will sit beside them, if the militants agree. [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Would you say that Istiqlal is an Islamic party? [Boucetta] Absolutely. Istiqlal is totally Islamic. Islam is its primary foundation and inspiration. If you reflect on it, the question should never even arise in Morocco--and in fact it does not. No party can contradict me on this, not even the (communist) PPS [Party of Progress and Socialism]. [JEUNE AFRIQUE] What is your opinion of the Islamists? [Boucetta] I do not understand how they can say that they are Muslims while others are not--and I do not accept it. Neither do I accept the idea of them establishing a party to defend Islam against others. No one has a monopoly on religion. [JEUNE AFRIQUE] So you are against legalization of an Islamist party in Morocco? [Boucetta] If Abdesselam Yassine, for example, wants to establish a party, I will be the first to support him. But on one condition: that it not claim, in its name or program, any exclusive monopoly on Islam. The Islamic label belongs to all, and thus to no one in particular. [JEUNE AFRIQUE] What about the Algerian FIS [Islamic Salvation Front]? [Boucetta] Our Algerian brothers have committed the sin of inconsistency. One day they legalize the FIS, the next they ban it. Once they had legalized it, they should not have banned it. But it would have been better to give the party a different name: Algerian Salvation Front, for example... [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Are the Islamists democrats? [Boucetta] With this type of question, it is best to respond on the basis of the specific program of the party concerned, not on assumptions or suspicions. We in Istiqlal know something about that: For a long time, we were accused of planning to establish a one-party system in Morocco. [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Your newspapers do not disguise their sympathy for Algeria's FIS. [Boucetta] We have been in contact for a long time with the FIS, and with the Tunisian Islamists. We have sent lawyers to each other's trials, because the most important thing was to defend human rights. This position of principle does not mean we agree with everything the Maghrebian Islamists say or do. [JEUNE AFRIQUE] And what if the FIS came to power in Algiers? [Boucetta] It would not bother me. It represents the electoral majority in Algeria. It also defends a return to certain values. [JEUNE AFRIQUE] What about the assassinations of intellectuals and foreigners? [Boucetta] We have told our Algerian comrades in the FIS we are against all violence, from whatever source. [JEUNE AFRIQUE] What is Morocco's position on the events in Algeria? [Boucetta] That is very difficult to define. I am not sure I can tell. Let us just say that we certainly are not taking a dynamic position. [JEUNE AFRIQUE] With the FIS in power, would Algeria modify its position on the Sahara? [Boucetta] Who can say? Some time ago, I put the question to Madani and Benhadj. Their response was evasive. [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Is the coming to power of Liamine Zeroual a good thing? [Boucetta] I hope so. But we will have to see how he does before we can tell. [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Will there be a referendum this year in [Western] Sahara? [Boucetta] The UN Security Council is wasting enough time and money on it, it seems. There is talk of setting the referendum for the end of June, or even as early as May. Why not? One thing is sure: As far as Moroccans are concerned, at this point there's no question of leaving Sahara. [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Regardless of the results of the referendum? [Boucetta] Regardless of anything that may happen. [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Are Moroccans upset about Bosnia? [Boucetta] We are very sensitive on the subject. Much more so than one might think. The imams speak out about this tragedy on Fridays in the mosques, and afterwards the faithful are angry and upset. I could add that many young people are going as volunteers to Sarajevo. [JEUNE AFRIQUE] As they did during the Gulf war? [Boucetta] Yes, there is some parallel. But the war against Iraq also had the character of an intra-Arab conflict; in the case of Bosnia, there is nothing to offset the powerful feelings of indignation and rebellion. [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Meaning? [Boucetta] All Moroccans think the reason that the West--of which they are a part--and Europe in particular--does not come to the rescue of the Bosnians is because they are Muslims. It is just as if they were unable to tolerate the existence of this Muslim enclave in the heart of Europe, as if the war served as a pretext for annihilating this outpost of Islam. [JEUNE AFRIQUE] It seems you are campaigning for the prohibition of alcoholic consumption in Morocco. [Boucetta] That is nothing new. In 1977, we offered a bill that would accomplish this. Recently we decided to move forward with this legislation, and we will present it again to parliament before the end of session. The aim is to prohibit the production, marketing, and consumption of alcoholic beverages. [JEUNE AFRIQUE] In short, an Islamic state law. [Boucetta] Exactly. An Islamic law. [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Some might consider the debate on such questions to be sterile, of secondary importance. [Boucetta] Not at all. It is essential. It is precisely when one compromises on such social problems that one paves the way for the most extremist forms of Islamism. In our view, prohibition of alcohol is as essential as defense of the Arabic language or respect for the "zakat." [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Do you consider yourselves a bulwark against Islamism? [Boucetta] You could say that. [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Banning alcohol might hurt tourism... [Boucetta] Non-Muslims will not be affected by this law: neither tourists nor our Jewish compatriots. It is just a matter of how the regulations are drawn up. [JEUNE AFRIQUE] In the eyes of many sub-Saharan Africans, Istiqlal is still regarded as the party that champions a "Greater Morocco." Do you still aspire to realize the cartographic vision of Allal El-Fassi? [Boucetta] The official maps do not represent historical Morocco. Our country has been dismembered, carved up by colonialism. For example, Mauritania was split off from the kingdom: That is the historical truth, even if the issue has been more or less resolved by making it an independent state. More important, vast territories south of Tindouf were torn away from us and given to Algeria when it was a French department. The Algerians actually acknowledged this in 1961, when they officially requested that discussions on the problem be postponed until after independence. Subsequently they reneged, and 30 years later the issue is still there. [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Are you still standing by these claims? [Boucetta] That is not a problem anymore. It is 1994. Our task is to build the Maghreb, and in that context, borders will be of no importance.
