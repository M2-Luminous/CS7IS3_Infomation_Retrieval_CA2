The opposition prophesies doom: "He can't even pay the branch office's phone bill with that." In spite of the budget cuts announced across the board, the Environment Minister can still show an increase of about DM90 million on paper. According to the present draft, the Environment Ministry's budget includes a total of DM626.9 million in individual budget 16 solely for the Federal Radiological Safety Office in Salzgitter, the major item -- around DM549 million -- being the neutralization and permanent storage of radioactive waste. Over DM151 million have been earmarked for reactor safety and radiological safety, including DM21 million for improving plant safety at Soviet-design nuclear power stations. About DM52 million have been injected into the budget for nuclear safety purposes. Other major budget items are the ministry itself, with about DM100 million, and the Federal Environment Agency with around DM93 million. The Federal Research Station for Nature Conservation and Rural Ecology has DM20.3 million, nature conservation in general receiving DM67.4 million. Job Cuts The Federal Environment Ministry as such shows a total of 806 established posts for 1994 -- 34 less than this year. Posts at the Federal Environment Agency have fallen from 839 to 824, whereas jobs with the Federal Research Station have increased from 189 to 195. The Federal Radiological Safety Office is reducing posts from 580 to 574. This means a cutback from 2,448 to 2,399 -- an overall loss of 49 posts. The Environment Minister was shown no pity by his political competitors in the battle for cash. The costly "dynosaurian technology" that nuclear power entailed was held up as the main culprit for the financial imbalance within the environment budget. "We deplore the fact that, yet again, you have emerged from this year's budget savings round stripped bare. You owe your budget increase to crafty accounting. Permanent items in the radiological safety and reactor safety section artificially inflate the budget, but the room for maneuver in your appropriation is becoming smaller and smaller. More and more money is being spent as a result of the Federal Government's failed nuclear policy, and at the same time less is going to pioneering environment technologies, environment research, and traditional nature conservation, not to mention investment in the environment in the new laender," said SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] deputy Marion Caspers-Merk, criticizing the new budget in the Bundestag. To rub salt into the wound, she accused the Federal Environment Minister of "incompetence in environment policy," referred to Toepfer's statements in the media as "a mixture of attempts at self-justification, buck-passing, and juggling with words," criticized his "passive stance," and opined that, "Toepfer, the environment policymaker, has no fight left in him." Klaus-Dieter Feige (Alliance 90/Greens) said, "The emptiness of environment policy also finds expression in the federal budget for 1994. Once funds for radiological safety have been deducted, all that remains to the Federal Environment Minister is a risible DM200 million, about DM80 million less than in 1993." Dagmar Enkelmann (PDS [Party of Democratic Socialism]/Leftwing List) described the Bonn Environment Ministry's new budget as a "hoax package or an atomic waste budget." "With over DM1.3 billion, the 1994 draft budget shows an increase of 7.1 percent over 1993. However, viewed realistically, the environment budget remains stationary at 0.3 percent of the overall budget." Hans Georg Wagner of the SPD said, "It is not hard to see that the environment minister is once again the great loser. The actual environment and nature conservation sector has suffered a DM64 million or 3.3 percent cut in real terms. If we add the cuts suffered in the 1993 budget, the environment's share in the budget has taken a 17 percent cut since 1992. Since 1992, when the situation in the new laender caused an explosive growth in environmental problems for us all, the budget has shrunk by nearly one-fifth. We no longer have an environment policy in the true sense of the term. The federal environment minister is a loudspeaker for environment policy." "Looks" Do not Matter In his 10-minute speech, the federal environment minister barely referred to the massive objections voiced by the opposition. Instead, Toepfer trotted out a series of well-worn statements, brandishing a sort of balance sheet as his contribution to the budget debate. "Our environment policy in Germany has created jobs. Environment policy currently provides employment for 680,000 people in Germany. About 50,000 people are directly employed in environmental reclamation as a labor market policy measure. In recent times we have employed 120,000 people under job creation schemes. About 15,000 people are usefully employed on reclamation work in the lignite mining industry. The federal and land governments spend DM2-3 billion a year on this item; this spending does not appear in my budget, but 75 percent of it is borne by the Federal Government. What matters is that we get the environmental reclamation done, not whether I would like a better-looking budget." Toepfer pronounced himself in favor of the creation of a disposal infrastructure involving private industry. "We need an environmental infrastructure for sewage treatment and waste disposal facilities, and for reclaiming contaminated land that we have inherited from the centrally planned economy of the former GDR. We want to attract private capital as well for this purpose. In the new federal laender, 46 sewage treatment plants are currently being planned or built, or have already been completed, with private capital -- DM4.3 billion are being mobilized. I should be happy if as many private sewage works had been built in the original federal laender in the whole 40-year history of the Federal Republic. Hats off to those who have assumed responsibility there and achieved this. This is growth policy and environment policy rolled into one. We shall pursue it to the best effect." Morsleben Can Still Be Used Referring to the dispute over nuclear waste disposal, Toepfer stressed that all forces in the Federal Republic, regardless of their ideas as to the duration and exploitation of nuclear power, had to reach a consensus on disposal. Referring to the controversial Morsleben permanent disposal store, Toepfer said: "Morsleben can legally be operated until the year 2000. The Nuclear Safety Commission has pronounced the Morsleben store still usable. The storage quality will be changed, and the waste will not be stored at the taxpayers' expense; the cost will be passed on in the form of fees to those who store material there." Toepfer said that he aimed to abolish ecological subsidies. This meant altering prices, as prices changed behavior and brought about technological developments. This road toward an ecological market economy was more successful than ecological regulations imposed from above or planned economy considerations. The Federal Republic already enjoyed a worldwide reputation for environment engineering. Individual budget 16 also features a couple of interesting items. For instance, the federal minister receives an annual salary of DM275,000 inclusive of local weighting, plus an annual official expenses allowance of DM7,200 and a per diem allowance, albeit reduced to take account of the per diem etc. to which he is entitled as a Bundestag deputy. The parliamentary secretaries of state receive annual salaries of approximately DM65,000 less. The "secret fund" at the minister's disposal for extraordinary service-related expense in special cases contains another DM60,000 for 1994, and there are DM380,000 more for public relations work. Another DM14.7 million are earmarked for work designed to raise public awareness (pamphlets, films, informative material), inclusive of DM69,000 for technical publications. DM325,000 are budgeted for the official vehicle fleet, and an approximate total of DM3.8 million for traveling expenses, DM3.5 million for the ministry's telecommunications bill, and just DM2.6 million for data processing. Long-distance data transmission alone costs around DM300,000. The books and periodicals budget amounts to DM995,000. The German Nature Conservation Circle receives DM485,000 and the German Council for the Care of the Countryside DM321,000 in subsidies. Further subsidies to the tune of DM450,000 are awarded for schemes run by various nature conservation groups and associations. DM3.6 million are earmarked for dues payable to international organizations, and the United Nations Environment Fund due amounts to DM10.8 million. Dues to smaller international organizations (waterfowl research, lesser whales) come to about DM1.75 million. The Association of German Engineers receives about DM3 million for the "clean air" program, and a similar sum goes to the Environmental Standards Institute. Operating expenses for the Environmental Sample Bank, which will gradually begin to cover the whole federal area from 1994, rise from the current DM5.5 million to DM6.86 million. Party disputes notwithstanding, as far as alternative figures in the Bonn government camp are concerned, SPD environment spokesman Michael Mueller said, "If Toepfer were to go, it would be even worse." Brief Interview: Grave Error The interview with Federal Environment Minister Toepfer was conducted by our colleagues from the French periodical L'ENVIRONNEMENT MAGAZINE [EM], which publishes the original version in full and which has kindly allowed UMWELTMAGAZIN to print the following extract. [EM] Do you really believe it is possible to reconcile the market economy with ecology? [Toepfer] To be perfectly honest, yes. But the market economy can only solve its problems if it absorbs its environment protection costs. In a market economy, everyone tries to cut costs or offload them on to others or onto nature. This is one of its basic principles. My motive for introducing environment taxes is not to take more money from the taxpayer but to induce polluters to mend their ways. German industry complains about an excess of environment protection charges and claims that this is detrimental to competitiveness. The professional associations echo this cry. I have never tired of repeating that a proper environment policy creates new jobs, but in the current time of crisis the first item to be deleted from the budget is environment protection. In my opinion, this is a grave error that will create enormous problems in the future. [EM] Are GATT and environment protection compatible? [Toepfer] Of course. I have recently discussed this with Brice Lalonde, who is currently drafting a report on this very issue. In any case, I believe that environment protection as a concept must gradually find its way in so as not to halt the GATT machinery, by which I mean not leaving those countries that practise ecological dumping a free hand.
