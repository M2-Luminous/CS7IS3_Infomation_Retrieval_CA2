Researchers used data processing and research methods to create models for the prospecting of minerals involving geophysics, geology and geochemistry based on earlier information in these fields. Different indicators were set for the various models. Sophisticated technology was introduced into the prospecting of gold mines in the region. The process of forming minerals was projected in four areas within the 7,800 sq.-kilometre Jiaodong Peninsula, leading to the discovery of 26 potential mineral resources, five of them of great significance. Experts in gold prospecting were convinced that the technology involved in research into gold prospecting was totally practical and played a leading role in such endeavours.
