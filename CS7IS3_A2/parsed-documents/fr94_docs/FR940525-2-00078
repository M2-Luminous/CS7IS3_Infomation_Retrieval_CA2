EFFECTIVE DATE: If granted, this proposed exemption will be effective December 27, 1990. Summary of Facts and Representations 1. The Plan is a profit sharing plan with section 401(k) features. As of December 31, 1990, the Plan had net assets available for benefits of $13,393,318 and 709 participants. The trustees of the Plan (the Trustees) and the decisionmakers with respect to Plan investments as of December 31, 1990 were David G. Brewick, Robert P. Easterly, James C. Ford, Robert B. Stailey and Deloris P. Wolf. 4 4 The Plan's current trustee and decisionmaker with respect to Plan investments is First Trust National Association. 2. The Plan was formerly sponsored by Western Capital Investment Corporation (WCIC) of Denver, Colorado and its affiliated companies. WCIC was a unitary savings and loan holding company whose primary asset was the sole ownership of Bank Western. On December 18, 1992, WCIC was merged into CNB, a wholly owned subsidiary of First Bank System, Inc. (First Bank System) of Minneapolis, Minnesota. As a result of the merger, the employees of Bank Western currently participate in the First Bank System employee benefit plans, including its retirement plans. It is anticipated that when First Bank System receives a favorable determination letter with respect to amendments to the Plan, it will be merged into the First Bank System 401(k) Plan. 3. Formerly included in the investment portfolio of the Plan were the following Assets having an aggregate cost in excess of $5.7 million: a. A $2,537,594 Investment in Government National Mortgage Association Pools (the GNMA Pools). ␣ 1Pool No. 1Amount of Investment 1Income received 1Servicing fees 1Sellers A 058683 $53,063 126677 13,512 128606 44,280 $22,213 $0 Merrill Lynch Govt.

Each of the GNMA Pool certificates featured monthly pass-throughs of principal and interest. Such investments had interest rates ranging from 61/2 percent to 12 percent and were to mature between January 1, 2002 and December 20, 2019. Through December 31, 1990, the Plan received total income of $685,417 with respect to its interests in the GNMA Pools. In addition, the Plan paid no servicing fees in connection with these investments nor were any restrictions placed on their sale or transfer. b. A $75,000 Investment in a Merrill Lynch Collateralized Mortgage Obligation III-A (the CMO). ␣ 1Amount of investment 1Income received 1Servicing fees $75,000 $7,688 $0 In January 1987, the Plan acquired an interest in the CMO for $75,000. The CMO was secured by single family residential mortgage loans, carried a stated interest rate of 7 percent per annum and had a maturity date of September 20, 2016. Through December 31, 1990, the Plan received total income of $7,688 with respect to the CMO investment. In addition, the Plan paid no servicing fees in connection with this investment nor were there any restrictions placed on the sale or transfer of the CMO. c. A $29,027 Investment in Two Mobile Home Loans (the Mobile Home Loans). ␣ 1Loan 1Investment 1Income received 1Servicing fees Lorenzo $11,067 Gruber 17,960 n,s Total $29,027 $14,423 $1,571 The Plan acquired its first Mobile Home Loan from Shelter America Corporation (SAC), a party in interest, on April 25, 1985. The acquisition price paid by the Plan was $11,067. This amount reflected the outstanding principal balance of the loan. The borrowers, Andrew and Katherine Lorenzo, were not parties in interest. When purchased by the Plan, the Lorenzo Mobile Home Loan carried an interest rate of 13 percent per annum and a maturity of 144 months. The collateral for the Lorenzo Mobile Home Loan was a first lien on a 1977 Liberty, Liberator (14×60 foot) mobile home. No restrictions were placed on the sale or transfer of this loan. The Plan acquired its second Mobile Home Loan from SAC on July 8, 1986 for $17,960, which represented the outstanding principal balance of such loan. The borrowers, James and Lauretta Gruber, were unrelated parties. At the time of purchase by the Plan, the Gruber Mobile Home Loan had an outstanding balance of $17,960 and bore interest at the coupon rate of 12.95 percent. The loan had a maturity of 180 months and was secured by a first lien interest on a Central Homes (26×44 foot) double-wide mobile home. The Plan could sell or transfer this loan without any restrictions. 5 5 The applicant states that no documentation exists which would define the investment criteria used by the Plan's Trustees in selecting the Mobile Home Loans as Plan investments. The applicant represents that at the time these investments were made, both Bank Western and SAC were actively investing in mobile home loans such that the Trustees thought these loans would be sound investments for the Plan due to their high rates of return. Accordingly, the Department notes that the decisions by the Trustees to have the Plan acquire and hold the Mobile Home Loans are governed by the fiduciary responsibility requirements of part 4, Subtitle B, Title I of the Act. In this regard, the Department is not proposing, nor is the applicant requesting exemptive relief for any violations of part 4 which may have arisen as a result of the Plan's acquisition and holding of the Mobile Home Loans (see Representation 7).
