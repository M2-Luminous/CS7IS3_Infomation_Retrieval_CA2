The most prominent are the efforts of Russia, which representative V. Kazimirov recently visited Stepanakert, Yerevan and Baku, and presented the new Russian initiative to the sides. What are the peculiarities of this project? Which topics of the initiative are particularly acceptable for the RMK [Republic of Mountainous Karabakh]? Are there topics which raise worries and may cause trouble in the future? [Gukasyan] This is a very broad question which is rather difficult to answer at once. We can't state that there are too great differences between the initiatives of the CSCE and Russia. The most important difference for us is in the security mechanism presented in the Russian version. The unacceptable to us topics are those concerning Lachin and Shusha. Azerbaijan and Armenia didn't have the chance of working over the project. Such a meeting will be carried out in Moscow, but only after Kazimirov meets all the parties. We will meet in Moscow and will then start working on the text. We are going to present our remarks and disagreements to V. Kazimirov before this meeting. Since Azerbaijan had more remarks (Azerbaijan wasn't prepared to this project and they in fact refused it), Russia suggested to stop the military operations for 2 weeks to work out the text of the agreement. Nevertheless, Azerbaijan refused this proposal too. [Correspondent] Such a categorical position of Azerbaijan lets us suppose that we shouldn't expect too many changes and this may be a dead end. [Gukasyan] No, I wouldn't say so. Azerbaijan only hoped to achieve military success during these two months, and this would have created favorable conditions for them during the negotiations. But Azerbaijan was unable to reach this goal and is now trying to save time again. If the Azeri leaders accept the Russian initiative and agree to cease the fire, they must account to their people since they lost some 7-8 thousand fighters during these two months with no results. It seems to me, this is a military measure. But if Azerbaijan was successful, nothing could stop them anymore. [Correspondent] Maybe such a position of Azerbaijan could be explained by certain guarantees they receive from several countries? Do you think to be a mere chance that mercenaries from a number of countries are serving in the Azeri Army, the army is armed by Turkish and Chinese weapons? Several reports appeared in British press regarding military support to Azerbaijan. Participation of Afghan mojahedins is well documented. This means internationalization of the problem. [Gukasyan] Surely, participation of other countries is not a secret, and we have facts. Regarding the internationalization of the conflict--to say frankly, I doubt if Azerbaijan is currently interested in this, but a moment will come when they will take this step. We are fighting against a coalition today. Turks, Afghans, Russians, Ukrainians etc. are fighting in the Azeri Army. [Correspondent] Do you think, that in the conditions when the Azeri attacks failed in fact, the cease fire is appropriate for us? Are there mechanisms which will disallow Azerbaijan to use this cease fire for preparing a new even more powerful attack? [Gukasyan] There are no and there could be no 100 percent guarantees. We are always worried by this. We support the peace course but we worry for Azerbaijan may be using the cease fire for war preparations indeed. Nobody is giving any guarantees to us. Everybody understands, there is a risk factor. Unfortunately there are no such guarantee mechanisms. The best mechanism would be to recognize the independence of the RMK, and we would become a subject of the international law. This is not quite possible today. The other possibility is: the peace keeping forces of the United Nations or Russia could serve as such a mechanism. But this is dangerous too. We have seen the Safonov's [military commandant in Karabakh in early 1990] regime. On the other hand, we should not allow this war to last, not to turn into a war of resources. [Correspondent] What about the position of the RA President, according to which the only acceptable version of the conflict's peaceful regulation is an immediate stop of military operations without verification of the RMK status, followed by long-lasting negotiations which may last for decades, probably? To what extent does this concern the interests and the external policy of the RMK? [Gukasyan] There are different approaches to this freezing of military operations. In our opinion, it would be more correct if the military operations were frozen at the current conditions. This means freezing the military operations without any preconditions. Freezing followed by negotiations--even maybe long-lasting ones. This will be very difficult to implement though, since all the mediators are suggesting the condition of withdrawing the troops from all the territories as the next step. This is a very dangerous precondition for us, since we can't see the perspective. Say, we withdrew the forces, and what then? [Correspondent] Can we possibly use the version "territories against the peace and status", which was widely used in the world history? [Gukasyan] We have been always suggesting this version. This is our main demand. But the world doesn't accept this. They say "we can understand when you say `peace against territories', but we can't understand when you demand the status". We tried to explain that we also mean the status when talking peace, since there will be no peace otherwise. In other words, what peace can we expect if there are no other guarantees? We have always stressed, that our goal is not the temporary fire cessation. We need guarantees for this to result in a lasting peace. It's not too easy to talk on this now, as Azerbaijan talks not only about the Fizuli but also Shusha and Lachin as well. This is not acceptable for us. Remarkably, Azeri demands rise when they hope to break our defense by means of force. [Correspondent] You represented the RMK in almost all official and unofficial meetings concerning the Artsakh problem. In your personal opinion, do you think there is a shift in the understanding of the problem by international community and the mediators? [Gukasyan] Surely, there are changes. We are working within the CSCE framework for more than a year and a half. And many things changed during this period. Everybody is admitting Karabakh as a conflicting side now. We were considered just as the representatives of an organization at the beginning, but now we are considered quite seriously and no proposals are made without consulting with us. [Correspondent] Can we state that the representatives of RMK are no more considered as the representatives of the Armenian community of Mountainous Karabakh in international organizations? [Gukasyan] Yes, of course. Everybody understands this way, and we are admitted as the leaders of Mountainous Karabakh, in spite of Turkish and Azeri struggle against this notion. [Correspondent] Do you think, that recognition of the RMK by Armenia now or at an earlier stage could support the international recognition of the RMK independence? [Gukasyan] This is hard to tell. Armenia will recognize the RMK soon or late. May be it's not the proper moment now. I don't believe that recognition of the RMK by Armenia now will immediately bring political dividends, or something will change today resulting from that. This might even make the situation worse. I am not sure. [Correspondent] The world politics seems to be searching for common edges in Karabakh, Abkhazian and Bosnian conflicts. The world seemingly tends to be looking for a universal solution. In your opinion, in what extent are these conflicts similar? [Gukasyan] They are similar and they are not at the same time. I don't think a universal solution may be found for these. A universal approach is possible though these are quite different problems. We should find a model for resolving these problems... [Correspondent] One of the discussed suggestions is the model of a confederative state. This model is based on mutual concessions and satisfies the right for independence and inviolability of borders both. In this regard, is the RMK-Azerbaijan confederation acceptable for the RMK? Does this meet the interests of Artsakh? [Gukasyan] It's too early to talk on this now. I don't believe if there could be found a single Karabakh citizen, who would agree for Karabakh to remain within Azerbaijan by any means. But it seems to me, if serious work starts in this direction, we'll participate in it. Only cultural independence is meant now. If confederative problems start being discussed, we may start working on such a project. But Azerbaijan is not willing to talk even on creating a federation, and the world (the CSCE or Russia) is not ready to talk even on Azeri federation. They talk on confederation in Bosnia, on federation in Georgia but nothing is said regarding the Karabakh problem. [Correspondent] Is there any increased activity after the new CSCE Chairman was assigned? [Gukasyan] Yes, in some sense. The style of their search for a solution of the conflict has changed at least. The CSCE course in fact didn't advance at all in 2 years. They now decided, as far as I understand, to carry out the works in Karabakh, Armenia and Azerbaijan instead of working in Rome, Paris, Vienna and other European cities as formerly. [Correspondent] What about the placement of the CSCE observers at the RMK-Azeri and Armenian-Azeri borders? Can this be the guarantee for a stable fire cessation? [Gukasyan] I don't believe that the observers may guarantee the cease fire without the peace-keeping forces. But the presence of the observers is very important. This is a part of the guarantees, but the observers should not be from Turkey. They must be from a neutral country. The Russian troops can play role of peace-keeping forces.
