But it also said the following: Many have been martyred and many others have become national heroes, the pride of our people. But some have also displayed cowardice and fled the ranks of the military forces at this difficult time for our homeland. Several have taken their arms and other material with them. Such people cannot be forgiven. So the deserters will be punished severely. They may even be sentenced to death. Acting in a humanitarian way, the Republic's leaders have decided to give them the opportunity to rectify their criminal behavior by voluntarily returning to fight on the battlefront. So, a department has been established within the Azerbaijani Military Procuracy's framework. No criminal charges will be brought against deserters who voluntarily apply for military service before 3 January 1994. The applications must be made to the following address: Azerbaijan [word indistinct], no. 30, Baku City. That applies to all deserters, regardless of when they fled their units. If they don't, criminal charges will be brought against them and they will be severely punished. We have the strength and the means to do so.
