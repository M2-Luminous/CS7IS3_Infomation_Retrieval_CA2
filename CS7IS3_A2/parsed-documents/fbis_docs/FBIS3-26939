On the afternoon of 24 December, a huge color picture of Mao Zedong, the great man the people are familiar with and respect, was hung at the center of the rostrum of the fully seated auditorium of the provincial cultural activity center. A streamer with glistening characters reading "1893 to 1993" flanked by resplendent red flags, dark green pine and cypress trees, and fully blooming flowers were placed up front. The "rally to mark the centennial of the birth of Comrade Mao Zedong" held by the Jilin provincial party committee started amid the magnificent playing of the "national anthem." Gao Yan, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and governor of the province, presided over the rally, and Comrade He Zhukang, secretary of the provincial party committee, gave an important speech. Over 1,600 people attended the rally. They were leading comrades of the provincial party committee, people's congress, government, committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and military district; former provincial-level comrades; leading comrades of the provincial court and procuratorate; leading comrades of army units stationed in Changchun and the provincial people's armed police force; chairmen of the provincial committees of the various democratic parties and the federation of industry and commerce; responsible comrades of various provincial departments and retired departmental-level comrades; responsible comrades of the large enterprises, scientific research units, and colleges and universities in Changchun; representatives of veterans of the Red Army, veteran party members, labor models, workers, peasants, intellectuals, Liberation Army, minority nationalities, Taiwan compatriots, Hong Kong and Macao compatriots, overseas Chinese, people from religious circles; and some cadres of some provincial organs. He Zhukang pointed out in his speech: We gather here today with feelings of respect, to ceremoniously commemorate the centennial of the birth of Comrade Mao Zedong, a great Marxist, proletarian revolutionary, strategist, and theorist, and the primary founder and leader of the CPC, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and PRC. Mao Zedong, a great man of history who later had a tremendous influence on China and the world in this century, was born in Shaoshanchong in Xiangtan County of China's Hunan Province on 26 December, 100 years ago. When Mao Zedong stepped up onto China's political stage and became the CPC leader, he and his comrades-in-arms accomplished the great cause that fundamentally changed China's history and destiny, so that his name will always be remembered and respected by the Chinese people. Integrating the universal truth of Marxism with the specific practice of China's revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong created the Marxism of China--Mao Zedong Thought. The crystallization of the collective wisdom of the CPC, Mao Zedong Thought is extremely rich in content, including the idea on persistently seeking truth from facts, integrating the fundamental tenets of Marxism with the specific practice of China, and blazing China's own road of revolution and construction; the idea on People's Army and people's war; the idea that the CPC is the leadership core of Chinese people and that only socialism can save China; the idea of building and consolidating a republic under the leadership of the communist party that exercises people's democratic dictatorship; the idea on correctly handling the contradiction among the people, mobilizing all positive factors, uniting all the forces that can be united, and building a great and strong socialist country; the idea on establishing and developing the patriotic united front; the idea on independence, self-reliance, plain living, hard work, constantly striving to become stronger, and standing in the world; the idea on people being the motivation to create history, persistently uniting and relying on the masses, and serving the people wholeheartedly; the idea on maintaining and carrying forward the fine work styles of integrating theory with practice, maintaining close ties with the masses, and self-criticism; and the idea on comprehensively strengthening party building. Seeking truth from facts, the mass line, and independence are the living soul dominating Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the precious spiritual wealth of our party and the great banner guiding our advance. Comrade Mao Zedong made immortal contributions to the country, the nation, and the people during his lifetime. Two of these were most prominent. One was that he discovered the road to the victory of the Chinese revolution during the period of the new democratic revolution; and the other was that he led Chinese people in establishing the socialist system and conducted great exploration on building socialism. Comrade Mao Zedong accomplished two great undertakings that changed China and influenced the world. His great contributions have been acknowledged by the world and become indelible. His meritorious service is indelibly engraved in history, and his thought is deeply rooted throughout China's vast lands. Communists in contemporary China are the successors to carrying out Mao Zedong's cause. Carrying out the cause pioneered by Comrade Mao Zedong and upholding and developing Mao Zedong Thought are the historical responsibility of communists in contemporary China. As the chief architect of China's reform, opening up, and modernization drive, Comrade Deng Xiaoping, after acquiring a profound understanding of Marxism, achieving accurate mastery of the national situation of the contemporary China, making a thorough analysis of the changes in the world situation and continuously summarizing the fresh experiences in reform, opening up, and the modernization drive, gradually created and established the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and brought Marxism to a new realm and new height in contemporary China. This theory provides, for the first time in the history of the international communist movement and the history of the development of Marxism, a fairly systematic and initial answer to the important historical task of how economically and culturally backward countries should build, consolidate, and develop socialism. This is a new and tremendous theoretical contribution made by Chinese communists to the international communist movement and is the vivid manifestation of the youthful vigor of Marxism on China's vast land. As has been proven in history, in the period of democratic revolution, Chinese revolution would not have succeeded without Mao Zedong Thought. Likewise, in the period of socialist construction, China's reform, opening up, and socialist modernization drive will not succeed without Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Comrade He Zhukang emphasized: In commemorating Comrade Mao Zedong, our most fundamental task is to uphold and develop Mao Zedong Thought, arm our minds and guide all our work with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and continue to promote reform, opening up, and the socialist modernization drive. The purpose behind our commemoration of Comrade Mao Zedong is to always adhere to the party's ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts. Emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts constitutes the quintessence of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the ideological line the entire party should uphold at all times. As we are pioneering a brand-new undertaking, new conditions, new problems, and new contradictions will emerge in an endless stream, and opportunities will coexist with challenges, and hopes with difficulties. At this moment, we should all the more adhere to the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts because it is key to the smooth progress of reform. To further emancipate the mind, we should continue to shake off the fetters imposed by the traditional pattern of the planned economy, truly understand reform as a profound revolution, and channel people's ideas onto a track compatible with the socialist market economy system. Emancipation of the mind should be reflected not only in a change of concepts but also in the courage to innovate and pioneer the way forward in the practice of reform. In commemorating Comrade Mao Zedong, we should clearly understand the essence and characteristics of socialism and take the initiative in firmly adhering to the party's basic line consisting of "one central task and two basic points." To uphold socialism, we should first clarify the most important basic theoretical questions of what socialism is and how socialism should be built. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "The essence of socialism is to liberate and develop productive forces, eliminate exploitation and polarization, and ultimately achieve common prosperity." This incisive scientific theory provides the most fundamental answers to the important questions of what socialism is and how socialism should be built and helps unify the thinking of the entire party and the people across the country. His emphasizing that reform is to liberate and develop productive forces and to ultimately achieve common prosperity means his persisting in the unity between means and purpose; his emphasizing that the superiority of socialism should be reflected in the development of productive forces and that socialism is to eliminate exploitation and polarization means his persisting in the unity between the criterion of productive forces and the criterion of people's interests; and his emphasizing that development of productive forces should be promoted by upholding the four cardinal principles, deepening reform, and opening wider to the outside world means his persisting in the unity between the "one central task" and the "two basic points" of the party's basic line. In commemorating Comrade Mao Zedong, we should devote more efforts to reform and opening up and establish the socialist market economy system more rapidly. Economic development is the foundation for us to solve all problems. Comrade Deng Xiaoping clearly pointed out: "Development is the essential criterion," and "development decides on the basic solutions to problems." The momentum for development lies in reform, and the basic way to accelerate development lies in accelerating reform. Reform has reached a crucial period, a period for resolving the greatest difficulty in combining package reform with breakthroughs in key areas. This requires that we devote greater efforts to accelerating reform. The "decision of the CPC Central Committee on the several issues concerning the establishment of the socialist market economy system" adopted at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th Party Central Committee systematizes and specifies the reform targets and basic principles of the economic system defined at the 14th party congress and formulates a program of action for changing the old system to the new and for accelerating reform. We should conscientiously implement the guidelines of the "decision," emphasize reform, extend the degree of reform, and accelerate development by accelerating reform. In commemorating Comrade Mao Zedong, we should conscientiously strengthen party building and improve the party's combat effectiveness. Party building is a magic weapon to win the success in Chinese revolution and construction. Strengthening party building means to arm the entire party with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics to raise the ideological and theoretical level of cadres with party membership, especially leading cadres; means to do a good job in improving leading bodies at all levels, resolutely implement the principle of democratic centralism, safeguard the unity and solidarity of the party, raise the awareness and be more steadfast in adhering to the party's basic line, and improve the ability to lead reform and develop the market economy; means to persistently build the material civilization and improve the socialist spiritual civilization and to be strong in doing both as consistently advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping; means to correct party style, step up efforts in building a clean government, wage the anticorruption struggle, and carry it on with unremitting efforts; and means to do a good job in improving grass-roots party organizations, give full play to the leading and exemplary role of party members, firmly remember the purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly, maintain close ties with the masses, and better unite and lead the masses to plunge themselves into the great practice of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. In commemorating Comrade Mao Zedong, we should learn from the noble examples and characters of Comrades Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping and other revolutionaries of the older generation. Their revolutionary examples and characters tempered through the long revolutionary struggle are the valuable spiritual wealth of our party. We should learn from their strong sense of historical mission and responsibility manifested in their lifelong concern for the future and destiny of the country and the nation; learn from their sacrificing spirit manifested in their respect for the masses, ardent love for the people, concern at all times for the interests and desires of the broadest part of the masses, and dedication to the liberation and development of the nation; learn from their firm faith in socialism and their tremendous courage to get rid of difficulties when the revolution encountered detours and was at a low tide; learn from their foresightedness, ability to observe and handle issues by taking the whole situation into account, and scientific approach to adopt specific measures to solve specific problems; learn from their patriotic values manifested in their unyieldingness toward external pressure and firm defense of state sovereignty and national dignity; and learn from their noble character of openheartedness and their awareness in party spirit manifested in their unselfishness and adherence to principles. We should take them as good examples, draw strength from their noble examples and characters, perform our duties more successfully, and work harder to live up to the ardent expectations of the proletarian revolutionaries of the older generation. The rally concluded amid the magnificent playing of the "national anthem." A large literary and art performance was held there by the propaganda department of the provincial party committee and the provincial culture department after the rally. With respect for Comrade Mao Zedong, performers of the provincial song and dance ensemble, the provincial national orchestra, the provincial Beijing Opera troupe, and the institute of art staged rich and colorful music, dance, and Beijing Opera programs.
