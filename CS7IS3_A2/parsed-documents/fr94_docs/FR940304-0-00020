FR940304-0-00020 FR940304-0-00007 Action is taken herein to correct these errors and to correctly add the AD as an amendment to ยง39.13 of the FAR (14 CFR part 39). The effective date of the rule remains July 22, 1993. The final rule is being reprinted in its entirety for the convenience of affected operators. Since this action only corrects wording in an existing rule, it has no adverse economic impact and imposes no additional burden on any person. Therefore, notice and public procedures hereon are unnecessary. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by reference, Safety. Adoption of the Correction. Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by correctly adding the following airworthiness directive (AD): 93&hyph;11&hyph;01 McDonnell Douglas: Amendment 39&hyph;8593. Docket 92&hyph;NM&hyph;48&hyph;AD. Supersedes AD 92&hyph;03&hyph;01, Amendment 39&hyph;8155. Applicability: Model DC&hyph;9&hyph;11, &hyph;12, &hyph;13, &hyph;14, &hyph;15, and &hyph;15F series airplanes, certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent degradation of lift due to ice accumulation on the wing leading edge, accomplish the following: (a) Except as provided by paragraph (b) of this AD, within 10 days after January 17, 1992 (the effective date of AD 92&hyph;03&hyph;01, Amendment 39&hyph;8155), revise the Limitations Section of the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to include the following. This may be accomplished by inserting a copy of this AD in the AFM. ``Wing De-icing Prior to Takeoff Caution The Model DC&hyph;9&hyph;10 series airplane has a wing design with no leading edge high lift devices, such as slats. Wings without leading edge devices are particularly susceptible to loss of lift due to wing icing. Minute amounts of ice or other contamination (equivalent to medium grit sandpaper) on the leading edges or wing upper surfaces can cause a significant reduction in the stall angle-of-attack. This can increase the stall speed up to 30 knots. The increased stall speed can be well above the stall warning (stick shaker) activation speed. [End of Cautionary Note] The leading edge and upper wing surfaces must be physically checked for ice/frost when the airplane has been exposed to conditions conducive to ice/frost formation. Takeoff may not be initiated unless the flight crew verifies that a visual check and a physical (hands-on) check of the leading edge and upper wing surfaces have been accomplished, and that the wing is clear of ice/frost/snow accumulation. Icing/frost/snow conditions exist when the Outside Air Temperature (OAT) is below 6 degrees C (42 degrees F); and either the difference between the dew point temperature and OAT is less than 3 degrees C (5 degrees F), or visible moisture (rain, drizzle, sleet, snow, fog, etc.) is present. Note This limitation does not relieve the requirement that aircraft surfaces are free of ice, frost, and snow accumulation as required by Federal Aviation Regulations Sections 91.527 and 121.629. [End of Note]'' (b) Paragraph (a) of this AD does not apply to any airplane that is both operated in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) 121.629(c), Amendment 121&hyph;231, and modified in accordance with either paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this AD. (c) Within 9 months after the effective date of this amendment, accomplish the procedures specified in either paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this AD: (1) Modify the bleed air anti-ice system so that it can operate on the ground to prevent ice reformation on the wing leading edges after ground equipment has been utilized to properly deice the airplane, and to minimize the effect of undetected ice/frost/snow contamination. Accomplish the modification in accordance with a method approved by the Manager, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Or (2) Install a supplemental on-ground wing leading edge ice protection system in accordance with McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;9 Service Bulletin 30&hyph;65, dated October 8, 1992. (d) Upon the accomplishment of the modification required by paragraph (c) of this AD, revise the AFM in accordance with either paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this AD:
