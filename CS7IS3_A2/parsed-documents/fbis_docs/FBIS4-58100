We are now very close. The first to arrive will be our policemen, then we, the PLO political leaders. But I have always said: The beginning of true Palestinian autonomy will also mark the end of the PLO as we have known it until now. We have to change jobs, become good, honest administrators, build up our self-governing institutions. The motto will be: Change or die. Very difficult times lie ahead of us. None of us really knows what will be the outcome of the meeting of the leaders returning from the diaspora, on the one hand, with the residents of the occupied territories, on the other." Bassam Abu-Sharif is venting his feelings. And doing so with a torrent of words, faxes, communications, and telephone calls, impetuously and continuously. We met him a few days ago at Gorizia, during a congress on peace in the Middle East organized by students from the International Sciences Faculty. His phone rang continuously. Because Abu-Sharif has just completed a long quarantine. Aged 47, and 30 years spent in the Palestinian resistance, last autumn he was seen as a political has-been, finished, fallen into disgrace for ever. He, every journalist's and diplomat's reference point during 'Arafat's long periods of silence, the only person able to say what was going on in the PLO's corridors of power, the former Fedayeen with his face disfigured by a letter bomb sent to him by the Israelis on 25 July 1972 in Beirut, had even had his telephone lines cut. He fends off questions with a dismissive smile. "You know how things are in the PLO. We never pay the phone bills. Mine in four years was more than 120,000 dollars. Following this they cut my telephone to save money." Then, however, the explanation became more political. "There is an old discussion within the PLO. For years many of them have been calling for greater democracy. But one knows how it is with 'Arafat. He brings us close to him and then distances us according to circumstances and what is convenient at the time. It happened to Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas] (who signed the self-government agreement in September), to Faruq Qaddumi (seen as the PLO's foreign minister), and it is not surprising that it should also happen to me. Can you image that, during last spring and summer, all of us remained in the dark with regard to the Oslo agreements until the last minute. Only Abu- 'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'] (the PLO's financial manager) was aware of 'Arafat's plans, and knew in depth how the secret negotiations were going with Rabin's people. But today the situation has changed. They have given me back my telephone in Tunis and I have begun work again after two months' absence for an operation to my ear in a Paris hospital." And to demonstrate his full reinsertion into the Palestine nomenclature, Abu-Sharif did not hesitate to explain the latest developments in the negotiations with "Hamas," the group active in the occupied territories and which rejects compromise with Israel in the name of Islamic fundamentalism. "One and a half month ago Hamas published a statement in which it said that it was ready to avoid collision with the Palestinian police force set up to manage the self-governing areas. From there on we are seeking to arrive at an internal agreement with them. The question remains open." And what should one think about the latest signals indicating that Hamas could even be ready to participate in the plans for self-government? "It is hard to say. It is not improbable. If they accept the authority of our police, then everything is possible. In fact, Hamas is much more pragmatic and articulate than is generally believed. I am also convinced that, once self-government has been achieved and in particular the projects for economic renewal in Gaza and Jericho have been started up, many followers of fundamentalism will then become PLO supporters."
