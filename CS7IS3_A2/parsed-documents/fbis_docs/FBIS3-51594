Oblitas claims that the corruption charges follow political interests. He said the sole objective was to remove him from his post. During a news conference he said: [Begin Oblitas recording, in progress] ... going against constitutional principles, aimed at myself while I was the CSJ president. But I decided not to heed the measure because it was illegal and unconstitutional. I have now decided to deliver a message to the Bolivian people so that they learn the real reasons why the current government and Congress began this senseless impeachment process. This is why I ask you to inform the citizenry about this matter, because so far the people have not been told the basic issues of this case. [end recording] Oblitas later reiterated that the charges against him and against Justice Ernesto Poppe Zubieta are not based on concrete evidence and thus violate the Constitution. [Begin Oblitas recording] The Chamber of Deputies has committed an unprecedented crime by raising charges against the CSJ president without any concrete evidence. This can be written in the book of universal infamy as a monstrous example of how savage hatred can make men act without caring about destroying the honor and dignity of others in the fulfillment of the most [word indistinct] and insane ambitions of circumstantial power. January 5 1994 will be remembered as a day of mourning and shame for Bolivian democracy because the greatest abuse against the Constitution and the law was committed on this date which, without doubt, will establish a deadly if not fatal precedent for this kind of abuse. The whole country knows that a crime of [word indistinct] was invented as a synonym for [word indistinct] to incriminate the CSJ president. This crime is neither included nor described in the 7 November 1890 Law, which clearly describes the four types of malfeasance that can be committed by CSJ justices. [end recording]
