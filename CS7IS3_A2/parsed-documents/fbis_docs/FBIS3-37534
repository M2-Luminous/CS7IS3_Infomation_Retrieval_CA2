The Aim: To Bring Georgia Out of the Crisis!"] [Text] An extended session of the Republic of Georgia Cabinet of Ministers on 9 February was devoted to implementing an anticrisis program, outlining ways of reviving the economy, conducting a correct credit and monetary policy, strengthening the coupon's exchange rate, developing the private sector, and reviving the nation spiritually. Georgian Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia delivered a report "on the Basic Results of the Functioning of the Economy in 1993 and on Immediate Tasks." The report delivered by Tamaz Chikvaidze, first deputy minister of the economy, was devoted to macroeconomic stability in the republic, an anticrisis program of systematic changes, and the first indicative plan for the country's socioeconomic development. This was then followed by a debate. The speakers and the various participants in the debate, including ministers from various departments, the heads of institutes and large enterprises, rayon gamgebelis [administrative board chairmen], bank employees, and representatives from the private sector, pointed out that, in spite of the important measures that had been implemented in 1993 to regulate and reform economic life in the Republic of Georgia, it had not been possible to activate factors aimed at stabilizing the economy or to reverse the trend toward a deepening of the crisis and the shortages of electricity and other resources. With the conditions of serious and, to a certain extent, chaotic economic processes currently prevailing, the effectiveness of laws and legislative acts that have already been adopted, as well as credit, monetary, taxation, and financial mechanisms, is extremely low. A significant part of the republic's economic potential has been excluded from economic life. In terms of 1993 prices, the total GDP amounted to 1,878 billion coupons, which is only 54 percent of that of the previous year. There was a reduction of 46.3 percent in gross national income, which fell to the level of 1964. With the credit, monetary, and financial systems on the brink of almost total collapse, it was not possible last year to ratify the budget while the rate of devaluation of the temporary currency -- the coupon -- exceeded the most pessimistic forecasts and turned into hyperinflation. Along with objective factors that have deep roots, this state of affairs was due to the fact that it had not been possible to implement measures aimed at stabilizing the coupon's rate of exchange in time. The speakers emphasized that one of the main reasons for inflation was the universal shortages on the consumer market. It was necessary, in a short period of time, to regulate the question of stocktaking in respect of all trade and implement measures aimed at saturating the consumer market with goods and services. It is significant that all the speakers tried to give a thorough analysis of current processes in their individual sector and outline concrete proposals and measures aimed at extricating Georgia from the crisis. A speech was delivered at the session by Eduard Shevardnadze, chairman of the Georgian parliament-head of state. He said: "It is impossible to draw up a universal program. This program is the result of serious work carried out by many collectives over one year. At the moment, we are short of skills [kvalipikatsia] and experience. It is necessary for us to study together not only work but also new thinking. "In the situation that has taken shape, we have to draw one most important conclusion: We should refrain from the sickly politicization of society as this will hurl us toward painful anarchy. "As regards the program for bringing the country out of the crisis -- it makes no difference whether we call its variants pessimistic or optimistic, minimalist or maximalist -- the main thing is for us not to be skeptical, as there exist the preconditions for escaping from the crisis and positive shifts enabling us to begin an economic recovery. "The main thing," said Eduard Shevardnadze, "is that Georgia avoids isolation and has the initial basis for extricating itself from the crisis. Emerging from its isolation will contribute to the restoration of economic ties. At the same time, we should not forget that the economy should be controlled." Then, the head of state touched upon the development of the private sector: "It is necessary to open the way for businessmen and to help and support them, not brandish our swords at them. The state should be the instrument that manages the economy and struggles against chaos [stikiuroba]. We speak a lot about liberalization and do the opposite. Wages should increase along with prices. "It is still not too late to halt the struggle for the Russian market. We should bring Georgian tea and Georgian wine onto the consumer market as quickly as possible; otherwise, if we delay, nothing will help this situation. Georgia has adopted the status of a developing country. This factor will contribute to the restoration of the economy but our country must tread this path quickly and within a short period of time. We should not be afraid of elements of planning being inserted into branch programs; all plans should work for the interests of the state. Our relations with the IMF and the World Bank will open up new horizons and broad paths. We have to try to get the European Community to finance our programs. In order to do this, we have to acquire the reputation of a reliable partner. However, no single businessman or investor will come to Georgia until the country resembles a country and there is stability." Batoni [Georgian polite form of address] Eduard Shevardnadze touched upon the size of military expenditure. He said: "If necessary, we will give our right arms, but everything has to be legalized and decreed by the state; a military budget has to be determined that will maintain the army." The head of state devoted significant attention to measures aimed at strengthening the coupon. "It was a mistake to introduce the coupon. Unless the economy is activated, it is impossible to strengthen it. It is probably necessary to have a parallel currency; otherwise what we have on the market today will also disappear. We cannot post a policeman at every stall. As for joining the ruble zone, the door is not yet open. There are many conditions that will have to be studied thoroughly. Working groups are being formed both in Georgia and Russia. We have to organize discussions on trade and hold debates." Then, Batoni Eduard Shevardnadze spoke about the search for ways to overcome the electricity crisis. "Georgia is a country rich in hydroelectric resources and, therefore, this problem should be resolved in the shortest time. "It is of great benefit to Georgia that Russia has agreed to supply us with gas. "The delivery of gas from Turkmenistan is expensive. Therefore, this development will ease our financial situation. "The use of non-traditional energy signifies inexhaustible sources for us. We should make the sun, wind, small hydroelectric power stations, and so forth serve the economy. It is possible that, with the help of UNESCO, Georgia will become one of the world centers for conducting this research." He devoted a lot of attention to improving work on the railroads, highways, and waterways. "The customs system, which represents an inexhaustible source of revenue for our budget, needs to be reorganized. "In spite of the difficulties of our life, no one should forget that it is essential for us to save our culture and science. The entire nation should concern itself with this." The extended session of the Cabinet of Ministers adopted the corresponding decrees on the questions discussed.
