The responsibilities of a country's police are to preserve social order, curb crime, and protect the people. Of course, there are police who suppress the people. The mainland has added the word "people's" to its police, to read the "People's Police." They should do more than the police in other countries in doing good for the people and serving the people but this is not the case. As the mainland police have disclosed, in 1993, 7 percent of public security personnel were dismissed from their posts or transferred out of public security departments and about 3,400 public security personnel were given criminal punishments or expelled from the CPC. This included more than 120 section-level public security cadres. This situation suggests that, from one angle, the public security contingent is irrelevant to "serving the people" and neither is it a reliable tool of the party. This is, of course, a tragedy for the CPC, which entrusts its political power to the armed forces and the police force. In order to strengthen and expand the police force, on 28 March this year, Premier Li Peng endorsed Order No. 12 of 1994 on "Strengthening, Rectifying, and Expanding the Public Security Contingent" and Order No. 13 of 1994 on "Supplementing and Improving the Armed Police Force." Order No. 12 was issued through the Ministry of Public Security to the party committees of all provincial (autonomous regional) and city public security departments (bureaus) in early April whereas Order No. 13 was issued to all provincial (autonomous regional) and city armed police corps on 8 April. The State Council Allocates 1.8 Billion Yuan to Public Security Departments and Security Control Departments Order No. 12 points out: In light of their social environments, all provinces (autonomous regions) and cities, from 1994 to 1996, should rectify and strengthen the leading groups of their public security contingents and develop these contingents in the ratio of 2 or 4.5 public security personnel per million of population, depending on the local conditions. In some important cities and in cities or regions where party, government, scientific, technological, and industrial organizations are concentrated, public security contingents should be formed in the ratio of 6:1,000. Viewed from provincial public security departments' arrangements, the country will increase public security personnel by 400,000 from 1994 to 1995; the central and local authorities will build or expand 70 to 80 public security schools, 10 or 12 of which will be senior public security schools. The central government will be responsible for 40 percent of the funding and local governments will allocate the remaining 60 percent. The central government will increase the percentage of fund allocation for some key provinces and cities appropriately. In mid-March, the State Council allocated 1.8 billion yuan for public security departments and security control departments. An informed source confirmed that 35,000 cadres (including demobilized soldiers) from localities and government institutions had been sent to work in public security departments. The State Council Provides the Ministry of Public Security With More Power To Use Force With the State Council's authorization, on 1 March the Ministry of Public Security issued the "Regulations on the Use of Arms During Patrols and When Performing Duties." The regulations point out: Arms can be used against any resistance to arrest, any attempt to resist, any action of violent resistance, or any assault on public security personnel. Arms can be used to stop agitation in public or state buildings and any attempt to destroy state buildings, public property, government institutions, and vehicles, if persuasion proves to be of no avail. Arms can be used to stop assaults on party, government, and military institutions; public security departments; detention centers; prisons; financial organizations; banks; and important state departments. Arms can be used to stop assaults on radio and television stations as well as central and local press and news agencies, if a warning proves to be of no avail. Arms can be used to stop assaults on airports, seaports, customs departments, and frontier stations. Arms can be used to stop assaults on power stations, water supply centers, and railway departments, if a warning proves to be of no avail. Arms can be used to stop any attempt to blockade highways, shipping routes, railways, bridges, and tunnels, if a warning proves to be of no avail. Tao Siju: The Public Security and Armed Police Forces Will Deal With All Eventualities Order No. 13 points out: Local governments should exercise direct leadership over armed police units. Armed police and public security units should be integrated. From 1994 to 1996, the country will expand the People's Armed Police Force [PAP] personnel to 450,000, improve the quality of the personnel, and enhance their efficiency in performing mobile duties. By the end of 1994, a three-level armed police force mechanism comprising provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the central authorities), prefectures, and counties will be formed. It has been learned that more than 38,000 demobilized soldiers and soldiers on active service joined the PAP in 1993. Tao Siju, PAP political commissar Ministry of Public Security chief, said: The central task of public security and armed police units is to improve their quality, raise their work consciousness, and enhance their combat effectiveness. During an inspection of a police academy in early April, Tao Siju said: From now on, the public security and armed police forces will deal with contingencies. In an important region, the public security and armed police forces should be able to dispatch 40,000 to 50,000 personnel to the scene of any eventuality within four hours. In the case of an emergency, they should be able to dispatch 5,000 to 8,000 personnel to the scene within 20 minutes. He also said: About 80,000 cadets will graduate from public security and armed police academies this year and they will be assigned to work in all parts of the country. These academies will recruit 150,000 cadets this year. Unqualified personnel will be removed from public security departments within three years. The People's Police Have Become Tools To Suppress the People The abovementioned examples prove that the CPC is strengthening and expanding its police force. Social order on the mainland is deteriorating. This is obvious to all. It is also an indisputable fact that the quality of mainland public security personnel is low, as is their efficiency in cracking criminal cases. Such being the case, the CPC needs to strengthen its police force. Apart from maintaining social order and curbing crime, the public security and armed police forces are also responsible for cracking down on dissidents. To cope with one dissident, dozens or even hundreds of policemen are used. This includes following and keeping a watch on the dissident. When Wei Jingsheng tried to return from Tianjin to Beijing, seven truckloads of police were mobilized to stop him. If used this way, the police force does not have adequate personnel to cope with eventualities. In addition, the "Regulations on the Use of Arms During Patrols and When Performing Duties" run counter to the "PRC Constitution," which stipulates that civilians have the right to hold demonstrations. The people's police have now become tools to suppress the people. CPC leaders have removed the disguise of the constitution and blatantly created the image of a police state among the people. Did any fascist, police state in the world ever come to a good end?
