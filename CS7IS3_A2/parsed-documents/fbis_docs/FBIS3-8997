The spokesman for the president recalls that President Zhelev was the first to determine the priorities of the new Bulgarian foreign policy and formulated the principles of the Bulgarian position regarding former Yugoslavia. Bulgaria declared already at the very beginning of the conflicts to the west of our border that it will not take advantage of former Yugoslavia's difficulties and that it will not interfere in any military manner in the events there, and appealed to all other Balkan countries neighboring Yugoslavia to adopt the same position. It is a fact that the Balkan countries are burdened by their past and any military interference on their part could become a precondition of a new Balkan war. This Bulgarian policy is upheld by the president in all international contacts. It also figures in President Zhelev's correspondence with Turkish President Demirel, about which the Bulgarian public is well-informed. The Bulgarian mass media are very clear regarding this position, even to such a degree that they do not think it is purposeful to repeat it constantly and thus assume the risk of becoming the target of their readers' ridicule, the president's spokesman continues. Nevertheless, one is puzzled by the attention they devote to the claims of a Greek newspaper, which are completely unfounded and unsupported by any facts or evidence, and which obviously pursue political goals which undermine Bulgaria's prestige, the statement of the president's spokesman reads.
