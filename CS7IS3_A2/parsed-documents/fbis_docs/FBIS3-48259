Japan, too, must relax its regulations so as to encourage its communications companies to compete over services and use these high-tech products. In 1992, the University of North Carolina in the United States began an experiment using a high-speed communications network for a cancer treatment involving X-rays. This is one part of the "information highway," a concept that Vice President Gore has taken the lead in promoting. In this treatment, 3D images from a CT scanner (a computer tomography device) are sent, through a telecommunication line, to a computer center, where they are processed by a supercomputer. CT images are normally difficult to tell apart, but the supercomputer three-dimensionalizes them, changing them into images that make it easy to determine at what angle and to what extent x-rays should be applied, and that are then sent to the physician. A state-of-the-art "asynchronous transmission mode" (ATM) machine developed by Fujitsu is being used in the experiment. AT&T in the United States, Northern Telecom in Canada, Siemens in Germany, Alcatel in France and other manufacturers throughout the world are frantically trying to develop ATM machines and other systems necessary for the information highway. However, NTT has led the way in the ATM field with the B-ISDN (broad-band ISDN = integrated digital communications network) concept, so that, according to an NTT representative, "The performance of [the machines of] Japanese manufacturers is presently at the top." NTT's animated television pictures, the first to be developed in the world, can also be easily transmitted In February 1990, NTT, in preparation for the age of high-speed communications, announced a plan to lay optical fiber to all the homes in Japan by the year 2015. In September 1990, NTT was the first in the world to experimentally manufacture an ATM switching machine, which it began supplying internationally in the fall of 1992. In response to NTT's activities, Japanese communications equipment manufacturers, such as Fujitsu and NEC, quickly began developing ATM switching machines and other such systems. The United States feels threatened by these activities. Accordingly, one of the aims of Vice President Gore's information highway concept is for the United States to build an optical fiber network and take back the initiative in the optical fiber field. Ironically, the Japanese manufacturers, due to the above-mentioned activities, have a strong hold on ATM switching machines, which are the core for such a network. ATM switching machines are the key technology that will be used in the next generation of communications services and B-ISDN. They are far more efficient than current digital switching and can also regulate data traffic, so that they are able to transmit at the high speed of 150 megabits/second (mega = million). They are from 100 to more than 1,000 times faster than the N-ISDN (narrow-band ISDN) that NTT is currently providing. The data volume of animated pictures is more than 200 times that of compact disks; and with ATM, animated television pictures can easily be transmitted. Also, ATM can partition large-capacity telecommunication lines. Thus, ATM will become pivotal in cases where a multiplicity of computers spread out over remote areas are linked by telecommunication lines and large volumes of information are exchanged. If ATM switching machines spread throughout the world, it will be possible for a company's Tokyo head office to retrieve document data from its research center in the United States and design data from its plant in Nagoya and conduct a television conference on product development with the staff of its Osaka office. U.S. Telephone Companies Lead in Commercial Services; Japanese Companies Shift Their Focus to U.S. Market According to Kazuo Iwama, Product Planning Director of NEC's Switching and Transfer Communications Department, "In 1997, the ATM market worldwide will be 250 billion yen." Of this, the U.S. will account for 50 percent; Europe, 20-30 percent; and Japan, 15 percent. There are already 20-30 switching machines operating in the United States. The Williams Communications Group (Wilter), a long-distance telephone company, is using switching machines for its commercial services. It has installed them in eight locations, and plans to install them in still more. Of the Bell telephone companies, which split off from AT&T, four--including Nynex and US West--have begun experiments aimed at using switching machines for commercial services. On the other hand, NTT, in 1994, will introduce an ATM switching machine into a relay station and use it for relaying data transmissions. In 1995, moreover, it will begin a common-carrier-lease-line service; however, this will ultimately use no more than part of the functions of an ATM switching machine. A genuine B-ISDN service that can make full use of the capacity of an ATM switching machine will not appear until after the U.S. information highway project: in 1994, NTT will begin experiments [for such a service] in Kansai Scientific Research City. In a word, Japan has led in the development of ATM machines and other hardware, but the United States is far ahead in communications services. With NTT at the forefront, Japanese manufacturers developed [this hardware] with the aim of introducing it domestically, but due to the domestic market's slowness in getting started, they have shifted their focus to cultivating the American market. And they have steadily been achieving results. For example, NEC will deliver switching machines to Wilter and the independent company, GTE; and Fujitsu will deliver equipment to the four Bell companies for use in their experiment. In 1992, moreover, Fujitsu supplied Nynex and US West with switching machines for their commercial services. The spread of ATM machines will depend on whether new services that fully use the power of ATM are created in the communications field. As in the experiment at the University of North Carolina, applications using images have already been developed; therefore, Fujitsu, believing that there is a strong possibility that ATM will be used at subscription telephone companies, has been aggressively trying to sell their product to the Bell telephone companies and other regional [phone] companies. At the end of 1994, Fujitsu will begin manufacturing ATM machines at a plant in Texas. Since Fujitsu will provide the Bell companies with machines, the Bell companies asked it to establish a manufacturing division in the United States and to set up a support system for after sales. According to Akio Moritera, a representative of Fujitsu's Core Communications Headquarters, "Basically, it isn't profitable to carry out local production if there aren't sales of near 20 billion yen." However, Fujitsu has judged that the market for ATM machines will start up by 1995, and that adequate demand can be expected. On the other hand, NEC believes that, for the time being, ATM switching machines will be used in a trunk line role, for relaying between switching machines. Its strategy is to wait to begin selling until after the regional telephone companies that link users to switching machines start coming up with truly high-speed applications, such as image transmission. U.S. Companies Connect Their Individual LAN's; Relaxation of Regulations Also Leads to Transmission of Rental Videos Computer aided design (CAD) has come to be used in the development of semiconductors and automobiles. There are also examples of companies in which the main office's local area network (LAN) is connected to the research center's LAN by a telecommunication line. And LANs are installed not only in research centers and plants; in the United States, they also link various other places of work, thereby shortening the time required for product development. According to NTT, the U.S. has 40 times more LAN-equipped plants than Japan. In computer graphics data, the data volume is large, so a large-capacity transmission route--from several megabits/second to 100 megabits/second--is necessary. Among LAN products, there are already high-speed ones that can handle 100 megabits/second. For N-ISDN, 64 kilobits/second is basic, so LAN is faster by a double-digit factor. If high-speed LANs are installed and a system for sending image data--from CAD and the like--is set up, the system will be meaningless if the LAN's are connected with a line that has a small capacity. If an ATM switching machine is used, a large volume of data can be sent even with a telecommunication line. Therefore, every service company is trying to deal with data transmission by introducing ATM's. Actually, ATM standardization has still not been completed. It is currently impossible to phone just anybody [with ATM]. Those who connect LANs are large corporations and other major customers of communication companies. U.S. communication companies have taken the bold step of introducing [ATM machines] with the as yet unstandardized parts made according to the company's own specifications. This is because they want to quickly respond to the desires of their big customers who connect LAN's. In the United States, competition among communication companies is severe; there are over 100 regional telephone companies; and the competition is increasing. This is greatly different from Japan, where NTT has almost a monopoly. As a result of liberalization, a new rival, CAPS, has recently appeared. CAPS are communication companies that, using optical fiber, link relay-related telephone companies, such as AT&T, with their large corporate customers. Since CAPS do this without going through regional phone companies, they are called by-pass companies. The reason that Nynex, Bell South and other regional phone companies are hurrying to introduce ATM is to prevent their important customers from being lured away by the optical fiber of CAPS. The relaxation of regulations has also been important. Because the Bell telephone companies are powerful telephone companies that succeeded to the assets of AT&T, they were put under numerous regulations. Image transmission, such as cable TV, was also regulated. In 1992, however, the authorities concerned, the FCC, lifted the ban on video on demand (VOD) service. VOD is a service that could be described as the communication industry's version of rental videos: a customer informs the telephone company of a movie that he or she wants to see, and the telephone company then takes the movie from its data base and delivers it by telecommunication line to the customer. This service is expected to become a main source of income for regional telephone companies. Nynex expects that "over the next 10 years, income from our voice service alone will be flat, but if, to [this] high-speed data transmission, image [transmission] is added, our income will double." The 150 megabits/second capacity of ATM switching machines is basically unnecessary for data transmission alone, but it is necessary for image transmission. Cable television companies have also developed a policy of installing optical fiber so as to counter the image transmission service of telephone companies. TCI, the top cable TV company in the United States, has invested about 1.9 billion dollars in building a digital optical fiber network with a total length of 12,000 kilometers. In the Regulation-Bound Japanese Communications Market, It Is Difficult To Develop Services for ATM Mitsubishi Heavy Industries will install an ATM switching machine in the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Yokohama Building, which will open in the spring of 1994. Telephones, fax machines, and computers will be connected by LAN. An ATM machine will be used for the trunk line. At the stage when animated pictures and other multimedia start being sent from terminals, other ATM's will be installed for the branch lines. In order to start a B-ISDN, an enormous investment is required. In an estimate announced by NTT in the spring of 1993, this amount was put at 45 trillion yen. Annually, NTT's total facilities investment is about 1.8 trillion yen. Even if all of this is invested in an B-ISDN, completion will take 20 years. In order to maintain this kind of investment, services that will increase income are needed. The one that is easiest to understand is an image transmission service. At present, however, telephone companies are unable to provide images to a large number of people simultaneously. The Research Committee of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has estimated that, by 2015, the diffusion rate of B-ISDN's [in Japan] will be 77 percent. However, this is if attractive applications appear and transmission charges are inviting. If attractive applications do not appear, the diffusion rate will rise no higher than 12 percent. In 1988, NTT began an N-ISDN, "INS Net 64." This N-ISDN was for the purpose of switching over from an analog phone line; at the same time, it kept charges down to analog phone levels. The goal was a system that "anyone can use anywhere." Thus, the region in which it is used has rapidly expanded. As of the end of May 1993, however, the number of subscribers was 30,425. In May 1994, the number of registered telephone customers is expected to reach 59 million. As was anticipated, customers did not initially switch to the INS network, which was thus a service for which NTT ran a deficit. With the Japanese communications market hedged round with restrictions, there is little possibility that competition over the kind of services that require ATM will rapidly develop within it. Through much effort, Japanese ATM switching machines have become the most advanced in the world, but it seems that it is American communication companies who will be able to fully enjoy their performance.
