The daily AL-ANBA' said in its leader today that "'Arafat is saying that he has placed the responsibility of the al- 'Aqsa Mosque on the custodian of the two holy mosques, as if King Fahd and his honorable people needed to be reminded by a vile person about this responsibility. The late King Faysal Bin-'Abd- al-'Aziz paid with his life for this responsibility and was assassinated, precisely because he had announced that he shouldered the responsibility for al-'Aqsa Mosque and that he was committed to it." AL-ANBA' asked: "Would be unjust to 'Arafat to remind him of the day when he knelt before his master Saddam, sang the praises of the occupying Iraqi Army, and said he wished that he had part of that occupying army in order to remain in Kuwait for 60 days [as received]?" PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat said in press statements following his arrival in Riyadh last Sunday that he placed the responsibility of the al-'Aqsa Mosque on the custodian of the two holy mosques.
