Beijing calls this "interfering in its internal affairs" and claims that "it will not yield to the United States." Some people overseas suspect that Washington is trying to "foster opposition forces" in China.... What was the Chinese reaction to "U.S. human rights pressure" exerted over the past year? Do a few people think Washington has achieved the expected results in practicing the U.S. human rights concept? United States Ignores China's Judicial Sovereignty On Clinton and his administration's position concerning the summoning of a parolee, a professor at Beijing university who is also a telecommunications expert, said in Shenzhen: "The United States has its judicial system, under which the police can arrest and detain law breakers according to its laws. Why is it that Chinese judicial authorities cannot summon a parolee who has broken his parole?" He accused U.S. politicians of being "arrogant and conceited," of "bullying others too much," and of "applying dual standards." He added that in everything the United States has done in recent years, it has very seldom respected China as an independent country: this was "unacceptable" to any Chinese with national dignity. U.S. politicians asserted that the two people "were arrested because of involvement in freedom of speech," but Beijing claims that this was "summoning according to the law." The professor said: "Every country with complete sovereignty has its own judicial system. Although China's legal system is being improved, this does not mean that there is no judicature in China. If the United States regards China as an equal independent country, it has no right to meddle in this affair!" Chinese Despise U.S. Human Rights Concept The professor from Beijing asked: There are more than 140 countries in the world, but only the U.S. President "talks glibly about human rights." Is it that all other countries "do not respect human rights" and only the United States does? An intellectual who lived in New York for four years criticized the United States by saying that "it is not entitled" to teach China how to respect human rights. His reason is that the United States itself is a country which "simply does not have" human rights, adding: From 1979 to 1991, almost 50,000 children were shot dead in the United States, an average of more than 4,000 each year, and more children have died in recent years. This ranks first in the world. "Now 13 children die through guns every day, and 30 others are wounded...." "Is there anything else more valuable than the lives of innocent children? Are there human rights in the United States?" He advised that "Asia Watch" "who specialize in fabricating" "human rights violations" in the Third World should change to "U.S. watch," who should "look into the human rights record of the United States itself." From Beijing to Guangzhou, it is not difficult to notice that the Chinese using public U.S. information and data to criticize U.S. society for "having no human rights." Cadres and intellectuals who are concerned with state affairs generally despise the U.S. human rights concept and even ridicule the Clinton administration's "human rights diplomacy." Human Rights Diplomacy Serves as Negative Example The Chinese are generally of the opinion that the U.S. "human rights theory" is hypocritical; therefore, the more the Clinton administration presses China on "human rights improvement," the more the Chinese become repugnant to what the United States says and does, and the more they are doubtful about the U.S. human rights record. This circuitous response has appeared in Chinese society. The Chinese believe that this "circuitous response" emerged from a "bad thing" and has become a "good thing" which "helps the younger generation to understand deeply the hypocritical nature of U.S. human rights and hegemonism." Some Chinese regard the Clinton administration's pressure as a "negative example." A retired Chinese diplomat said: "Some young people in China cherish unrealistic illusions about the outside world; we frequently teach them to view the United States from a rational angle. Having rational knowledge alone is not adequate, they should also have perceptual feelings." The Human Rights Baton Awakens Younger Generation This deep "perceptual feeling" occurred last year, during which U.S. politicians and the mainstream media tried every possible means to stop China from hosting the 2000 Olympics, under the pretext that "there are no human rights" in China. At that time, Chinese in foreign countries condemned U.S. politicians for their "ugly politics" and "mean" tricks. In the meantime, people north and south of the Chang Jiang, particularly workers and young intellectuals in the cities, responded most strongly to this. Even a 10-year-old primary school pupil in Beijing sadly asked his father: "Why did the United States not allow us to host the Olympics?...." Some friends who had previously "worshipped" the United States also admitted that they had "awakened." What did they awaken to? The awakened to the fact that "there is indeed hegemonism in the world and this hegemonism is targeted at China." In December last year, a researcher in the Beijing Academy of Social Sciences said privately: Problems should be viewed from a dialectical angle. Unquestionably, Washington's "human rights diplomacy" has caused "much trouble" to Chinese-U.S. relations, but at the same time it has also "taught" the Chinese to clearly understand hegemonism and "unified" this understanding. If a Country Refuses to Become a Puppet, that Country Will Be Accused of "Having No Human Rights" In recent years, the United States has accused Beijing of selling "long-range" missiles to Pakistan. It has created rumors that the Yin He was carrying materials for chemical weapons; it has framed China by saying that it exported prison-made products; it has closed down a Chinese firm in the United States; it has imposed a discriminatory embargo on trade; it has threatened to ban imports of Chinese products into the United States.... Moreover, every day it accuses China of "having no human rights" and threatens to revoke China's most-favored-nation status. Since assuming office a year ago, the Clinton administration has noisily made anti-Chinese remarks and exerted pressure on China. This has made the following impression on the world: The Clinton administration has never respected China as an independent country and has never considered that the Chinese people are entitled to national dignity. On a plane from Beijing to Guangzhou, the manager of a state-owned enterprise said in jest: "If you are willing to become a U.S. puppet, the United States will say you have human rights and will make you a pro-democracy hero. Otherwise, they say you have no human rights. Do the Chinese not understand this simple theory? Do you know why so many Chinese spontaneously commemorated Mao Zedong's centenary? Because Mao Zedong was the symbol of the Chinese spirit and national self-respect!"
