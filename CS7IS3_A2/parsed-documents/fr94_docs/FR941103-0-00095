FR941103-0-00095 FR941103-0-00015 50 CFR Part 678 [Docket No. 920409&hyph;3047; I.D. 102594A] Atlantic Shark Fisheries AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Closure. SUMMARY: NMFS announces the closure of the Federal commercial fishery for large coastal sharks in the Western North Atlantic Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea. This action is necessary to prevent exceeding the semiannual quota for the period July 1 through December 31, 1994. EFFECTIVE DATE: 11:30 p.m. local time November 4, 1994, through December 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: C. Michael Bailey, 301&hyph;713&hyph;2347; Kevin B. Foster, 508&hyph;281&hyph;9260; or Michael Justen 813&hyph;893&hyph;3161. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Atlantic shark fishery is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for Atlantic Sharks under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq .). Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR part 678. Section 678.23(b)(1)(i) of the regulations provides for two semiannual quotas of large coastal sharks to be harvested from Atlantic, Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico waters by commercial fishermen. The second semiannual quota is available for harvest from July 1 through December 31, 1994. The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), is required under §678.24 to monitor the catch and landing statistics and, on the basis of these statistics, to determine when the catch of Atlantic, Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico sharks will equal any quota under §678.23(b)(1). When shark harvests reach, or are projected to reach, a quota established under §678.23(b)(1), the AA is further required under §678.24 to close the fishery. The AA has determined, based on the reported catch and other relevant factors, that the semiannual quota for the period July 1 through December 31, 1994, for large coastal sharks, in or from the Western North Atlantic Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, will be attained by the closure date. After 11:30 p.m. on November 4, 1994, for vessels issued a permit under §678.4, possession of large coastal sharks from the management unit is prohibited, unless the vessel is operating as a charter vessel or headboat, in which case the vessel limit per trip is four large coastal sharks. However, the sale, purchase, trade, or barter or attempted sale, purchase, trade, or barter, of carcasses and/or fins of large coastal sharks harvested by a person aboard a vessel that has been issued a permit under §678.4(a)(4), is prohibited, except for those sharks that were harvested, offloaded, and sold, traded, or bartered prior to the closure, and were held in storage by a dealer or processor. Vessels that have been issued a Federal permit under §678.4 are reminded that, as a condition of permit issuance, the vessel may not retain a large coastal shark during the closure, regardless of where harvested, except as provided by §678.24(a)(2). Fishing for pelagic and small coastal sharks may continue. The recreational fishery is not affected by this closure. Classification This action is taken under 50 CFR part 678 and is exempt from review under E.O. 12866. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq . Dated: October 28, 1994. Richard H. Schaefer, Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;27221; Filed 10&hyph;28&hyph;94; 4:14 pm] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;22&hyph;F
