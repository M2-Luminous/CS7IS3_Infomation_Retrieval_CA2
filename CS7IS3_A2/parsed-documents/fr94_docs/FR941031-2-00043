FR941031-2-00043 FR941031-2-00039 Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Proposed Scope of Task for the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Board on Radioactive Waste Management (BRWM) for Peer Review of the Technical Bases for the Suitability Evaluation Process AGENCY: Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM), Energy. ACTION: Notice of inquiry. SUMMARY: Through this Notice of Inquiry (Notice) and as part of the on-going process of public participation in the development of the Site Suitability Evaluation Process begun in an April 1994 Federal Register Notice (59 FR 19680), the Department of Energy (DOE) desires to elicit the views of members of the general public on the proposed methodology for utilizing the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Board on Radioactive Waste Management (BRWM) for implementation and management of peer reviews of the technical bases for the suitability evaluation process. The DOE is committed to ensuring the quality of its technical work. One approach to ensuring technical quality is the use of an independent, impartial peer review for the technical work. To ensure a peer review that is independent, impartial, and of the highest technical quality, the DOE intends to request that the (BRWM): (1) Oversee the required peer reviews, including setting up the review committees and (2) establish a standing committee to review OCRWM's analysis of long term repository performance. DATES: Written comments on the draft methodology for peer review are due on or before November 30, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be submitted to: Dr. Jane R. Summerson, U.S. Department of Energy, Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Office, 101 Convention Center Drive, Las Vegas, NV 89109. (Phone) (702) 295&hyph;9610 (Fax) (702) 794&hyph;7907. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. Jane R. Summerson, U.S. Department of Energy, Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Office, 101 Convention Center Drive, Las Vegas, NV 89109, (702) 295&hyph;9610 (Phone), (702) 794&hyph;7907 (Fax). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background OCRWM has proposed a restructured repository program consistent with the recent Fiscal Year 1995 Administrative Funding Proposal. Under the program site characterization and engineering activities would focus initially on the evaluation of the suitability of Yucca Mountain. Because the broad credibility of the suitability determination is so critical to the success of the program, DOE proposes to make a technical determination of suitability as an independent program milestone as the result of an incremental and open process that features rigorous, independent external peer review of the technical work and focused, effective public involvement.
