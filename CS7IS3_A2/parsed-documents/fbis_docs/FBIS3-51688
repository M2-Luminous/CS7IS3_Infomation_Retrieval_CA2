The high-ranking government official said he did not know. Does any government official know the answer? An investigation by this newspaper has showed that no one can. Neither the Ministry of Government nor the Foreign Ministry really know how many DEA agents operate in Bolivia. This is because they are hidden among the U.S. Embassy staff. This issue came into the limelight more than a year ago when a DEA agent wounded a Bolivian citizen in Santa Cruz. He was immediately expatriated. The explanation given at that time was that he was accredited as a diplomat. He thus had diplomatic immunity under which, according to the Vienna Convention, the host country grants immunity to representatives of the governments with whom it maintains relations. The Vienna Convention establishes that it is not necessary for an embassy to inform a host government on the functions of its embassy personnel because it is understood that their activities will be strictly restricted to diplomatic norms. There is a clear contradiction, however, between the work done by the DEA agents and these norms which are being ignored by both the DEA and the rest of the U.S. embassy members, who on more than on one occasion have openly intervened in internal Bolivian affairs. The main subject that interests us -- that is, the "safe houses" that the DEA keeps in several Bolivian cities where alleged drug traffickers are questioned -- deserves official explanation. Claiming that the national police do not merit confidence because connections have been found between some officers and drug traffickers does not justify a third party carrying out the duties of the Bolivian State. Both the district prosecutor and the Human Rights Assembly of Santa Cruz have said that these agents ignore Bolivian laws and their actions are not controlled by our national authorities who have limited themselves to say: "There is no smoke without fire." What is worse, the DEA chief refuses to receive a national deputy in his office to discuss the charges. We must recall that this is not the first time that this kind of irregular procedures by the DEA has been made public. During the last administration, former Interior Minister Carlos Saavedra Bruno was very concerned about charges that were made and he said he would ask the U.S. Embassy for a report on the activities of these "diplomats." The subject was not discussed again, however, because of the election campaign flurry. But the fact that the issue has again come to the limelight shows that it cannot be controlled by our authorities. And this cannot be so. Following the announcement that the new U.S. drug enforcement policy has ruled out the militarization of the issue and efforts will be concentrated on police interdiction -- which certainly is good news -- it is necessary to establish clear rules that must be respected by any kind of foreign "advisers" in this field. Beside preserving our national sovereignty on such a sensitive subject, the establishment of an agreement will help the two countries to maintain relations in an atmosphere of mutual respect.
