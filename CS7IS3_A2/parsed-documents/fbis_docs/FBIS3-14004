Government spokesmen and political leaders became silent after calling these blasts cowardly acts and announcing financial relief to those who were killed or wounded. The police will go through the formality of announcing an additional increase in security. Yet this has happened again and again. Governor General Krishna Rao has appealed to the people not to be deceived by the terrorists, who want only to increase communal tensions. Does the governor hope that when there are bomb blasts in a busy market that remind them of the blasts in Bombay, when people are killed or hurt and there is great bedlam in the market, that people will not get angry and demonstrate against the government and the police? If this was the case, then we would suspect that the apathy of the people in Jammu had reached its extreme, and that even the most serious incident cannot affect them. The Kashmir government should be thankful to the people that it was the police on which the angry youths focused their outrage and not on a specific group. But it is also important to understand that if more of these incidents occurred, it would be very difficult to remain calm. Therefore, the Jammu-Kashmir government should correct the problems in its police administration. The armed terrorist organizations in the Kashmir valley have gotten the support of the people in special circumstances. They have succeeded in establishing a reign of terror in the valley. If they succeed in doing the same thing in Jammu, though, it would be very difficult to fight the resulting anarchy. The entire administrative machinery of Jammu-Kashmir is ineffective, because the government is unable to get proper information about anti-national and terrorist activities. Therefore, after every incident, they make statements in a hurry, they seem to have no other alternative. It is surprising because the government knew that due to the powerful campaign by Pakistan, there would be increased terrorist activity. Because of the increased security in the valley and in Doda, it was natural for the terrorists to attack the softer, easier targets in Jammu. Pakistan wants to show that the control of the Indian government in Jammu-Kashmir has ended, and that the whole state has rebelled. The Pakistan supporters argued in Geneva that it is not the Pakistani terrorists, but the local people in Kashmir, that are fighting the war for independence. The Jammu bomb blasts, therefore, should be seen in this context. All members of Parliament have declared Jammu-Kashmir an integral part of India and have repeated their determination to free the part of Kashmir currently under Pakistan's control. The central home minister is planning to accelerate economic development processes in Kashmir. However, all these promises will be on paper until they are implemented and an honest, effective police and administration are established in the state. The fact is that the Kashmir problem was created by poor government administration. Therefore, if the Indian government wants to give a proper and effective response to Pakistan's anti-India tirade, then it should dispose of the other political biases and start overhauling the administration in Jammu-Kashmir. The political party will benefit from this strategy because, in the present situation, no politics can be practiced there. The national determination expressed in Parliament should also be applied to the formation of an effective national strategy. *
