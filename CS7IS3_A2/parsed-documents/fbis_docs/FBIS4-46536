Even the government's ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, lobbying for a reduction in defense spending, writes about the "occupation regime of the Russian military-industrial complex." And says that there is no need to intimidate people with the sociopolitical consequences of underfunding of the defense sphere since that is just a case of shenanigans on the part of "military-industrial complex bigwigs" and generals opposed to army reform. The unprecedentedly involved "case of the 18 trillion on defense," where everyone seems to be "in favor" and there is still no money for the military, by no means constitutes an attack by military-industrial complex hawks on the limited state budget. The minimum figure requested by the Defense Ministry has been decided in accordance with the following principle: "Think about the Motherland first and then about yourselves." Therefore the list of defense spending that has been submitted for ratification is a balanced combination of spending on maintaining the troops' combat capability ("undiluted" state interest, so to speak) and on social protection for servicemen, which -- albeit indirectly -- also affects the state's defense capability. Thus the argument over whether or not to provide the money has long since changed from being a financial "wrangle" to being the subject of political speculation that may explode the situation around and within the Army. However, these "explosions" are already regrettably becoming a reality instead of just projections. In particular, an acute conflict situation has arisen among the Northern Fleet's military construction workers. A kind of protest action akin to a strike has even been held here. Needless to say, that is quite intolerable in army conditions. Although the demands do not go beyond what they were promised by the state -- the military are asking for their debts to be repaid. Yet the state owes money not only to the men of the Northern Fleet and not only for pay, which is commonly paid two or three months late in the Army and the Navy. When this edition has been signed to press, the State Duma will start discussing the question of social guarantees for servicemen. It is not worth speculating how the discussion will go, whether the State Duma's Defense Committee will succeed in persuading the government and deputies that playing financial games with the Army is intolerable, just as it is intolerable to reduce its standard of living below the lower limit beyond which chaos sets in. It is better to turn once again to the facts and figures, which, incidentally, were collected by parliamentarians themselves at the Northern Fleet. This trip took place in mid-May, but since then there has been no change for the better and the Duma has not had time to examine the submitted documents. However, the report sent to State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin and addressed to all deputies deals with not so much the military aspect of the Northern Fleet's problems, on which servicemen themselves usually focus, as the social aspect. And this is even more dispiriting than the situation as regards combat training or shipments of new arms and manning of units. Thus, as of 1 March just 40.5 percent of the required sum had been allocated for the upkeep of the Northern Fleet as a whole. At the same time there are now 1,487 families without apartments in the Northern Fleet, and the number of such families will rise while the number of apartments in the fleet's housing stock will drop owing to the impossibility of evicting people discharged into the reserve from closed garrisons. Around 2,500 families will lose their ties with the Navy this year and they are to be allocated, in line with current legislation, money to build housing outside garrisons. Nor is there enough money to look after those who are serving. The money allocated last year was barely enough to build just 242 apartments, of which Northern Fleet servicemen have only received 169. Or take medical support. Navy garrisons have half as many medics as the Murmansk Oblast average. Things are even worse with regard to hospitals and the prevention of disease among children. Some 90 percent of children under 16 have been deprived of the triple course of multivitamin treatment prescribed for polar regions, and naval families are beset by illnesses that are unthinkable for children of this age -- anemia, diabetes. Over a third of schoolchildren study on a second shift -- there is barely 50 percent of the required number of schools -- and sometimes classes are held in unfit buildings. Thus we are not even talking about the military themselves, who are accustomed to "burdens and privations"; the trillions, if they appear on a platter, will be used to revive Russia's gene pool. And for the social readjustment of the quite able-bodied citizens who have been discharged from the service. And to implement articles of laws that have been announced but are not in force, thus undermining faith in the foundations of the state. Regrettably, judging by the way in which the holey blanket of the state budget is being "pulled" this way and that, you have to see all this for yourself, wear uniform, and serve the Fatherland not out of fear but out of conscience in order to realize that the Army is not asking for anything unnecessary. It needs firm social guarantees with financial backup rather than laments that everyone is having a hard time of it today. The requested minimum sum will not ensure that servicemen have an easy life, it only guarantees Russia's security, for which men in uniform are accountable.
