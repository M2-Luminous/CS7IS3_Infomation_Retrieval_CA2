But that will not prevent Peugeot from supplying diesel engines to Honda. Early next year, the Japanese manufacturer is expected to offer a diesel version of its mid-range Concerto sedan, the mechanical equipment of which will come from Tremery (Moselle). A cousin of the British Rover 200 and 400, which already use that engine, the Concerto will be reserved to the French market. Sales are expected to reach 3,500 units in 1994. Early this year, however, Honda started designing a clean diesel engine.
