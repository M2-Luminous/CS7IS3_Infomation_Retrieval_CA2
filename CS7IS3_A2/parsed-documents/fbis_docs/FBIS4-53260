The roller-making equipment is operating normally. It had undergone load tests and trial operations repeatedly. The workers of the complex built the modern roller production and regeneration processes with their own efforts and technologies in a short span of time. They finished ahead of schedule the construction project involving the removal of 5,000 cubic metres of earth, concrete tamping of 1,000 cubic metres and assembling of 500 tons of pillars and beams. The scientists and technicians succeeded in mechanising and automating all the roller production processes through repeated tests for the solution of scientific and technical problems arising in the rotation number of the casting machine, the temperature of infusion and prevention of vibration.
