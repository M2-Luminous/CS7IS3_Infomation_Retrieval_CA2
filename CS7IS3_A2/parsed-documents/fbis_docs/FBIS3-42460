Benson and E. Siebert (University of Southern California at Los Angeles) have arrived at the conclusion that the molecules of this liquid do not jostle randomly, but form short-lived networks in the shape of cubes of eight molecules and rings of four molecules. The cubes and rings are then formed into chains and networks. Experimental data obtained for the hard and gas phases were used to construct a theoretical model of water in the liquid phase. The chemists claim that the microstructures they discovered help explain some of the unusual properties of water, such as its ability to absorb large amounts of heat and its ability to expand on freezing. Most liquids fall into one of two categories: they are either regular or structured. The molecules in regular liquids form relatively weak bonds in pairs under the impact of van der Waals forces. Because these forces do not have a particular direction, the molecules are free to adopt any orientation relative to one another to fill free space. The organic solvent tetrachloromethane is an example of such a liquid. Such liquids, the molecules of which are held together by stronger, oriented forces, are among the regular liquids. Usually, these are hydrogen bonds, which form between a slightly positive hydrogen atom in one molecule and an oxygen atom with a weak negative charge in a neighboring molecule. Structured liquids cannot be described by the simple empirical formulas that are used to describe the physical properties of regular liquids. For example, each molecule in a regular liquid with closely packed molecules can be surrounded by 10-11 others. In a structured liquid, there can be as few as 4-5 of these molecules and therefore sufficient free space remains between molecules. The American scientists think that water is possibly the most extreme representative of a structured liquid. It has maximum density at a temperature of 4�C and an unexpectedly high heat capacity. After many years of debates, scientists arrived at the conclusion that hydrogen bonds are the cause of the anomalous properties of water, however, there is still no adequate theory that precisely predicts water's heat capacity and fluidity or explains such a property of water as its low density in solid state. Benson and Siebert claim that with their new octamer-tetramer model of intermolecular hydrogen bonds permits them to predict the physical characteristics of water in the entire range of temperatures of the existence of the liquid phase (from 0 to 100�C) with an accuracy of up to 2% with regard to experimental data. The scientists do not claim that water consists exclusively of cubic and ring bonds of molecules, but they think that these are the simplest and most widespread types of bonds. Instruments do not yet exist that permit us to record such formations because the hydrogen bonds between water molecules form and break with a frequency of 500 Ghz. Benson and Siebert say that water might also contain other structures--such as cyclic pentamers (five molecules in a ring) or decameric sandwich dimers. But they also admit that there is no evidence of the existence of these microstructures, except for calculations of thermal and volumetric properties which match experimental data. The proposed microstructural theory also explains water's anomalous behavior when other substances are added. Although the presence of simple hydrogen bonds predicts that a polar substance such as ammonia gives off heat when it dissolves in water, it cannot explain why this occurs even when nonpolar tetrachloromethane dissolves.

Berlin Builds a Second Synchrotron The Federal Ministry of Research and Technology (Germany) has announced the construction of a second synchrotron, BESSY-II, in Berlin-Allershof in addition to BESSY-I located in West Berlin. BESSY-II is primarily designed for basic research and will have a ring with a diameter three times as large as BESSY-I's, which will permit the production of a magnetic field with approximately 1,000-10,000 times greater voltage. Construction of the new synchrotron will cost 190 million Deutsche marks (£68.5 million). The money will be allocated by the German Federal Government and the Berlin authorities.
