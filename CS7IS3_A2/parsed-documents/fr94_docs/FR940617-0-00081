FR940617-0-00081 FR940617-0-00018 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [ME&hyph;8&hyph;1&hyph;6282; A&hyph;1&hyph;FRL&hyph;4854&hyph;8] Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; Maine; VOC RACT Catch-ups AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: EPA is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) on January 8, 1993. This SIP revision contains regulations which require the implementation of reasonably available control technology (RACT) for various types of volatile organic compound (VOC) sources. The EPA has evaluated this SIP revision and is approving it under the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990. EFFECTIVE DATE: This final rule will become effective on July 18, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of the documents relevant to this action are available for public inspection during normal business hours, by appointment at the Air, Pesticides and Toxics Management Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region I, One Congress Street, 10th floor, Boston, MA; Air Docket 6102, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460; and the Bureau of Air Quality Control, Department of Environmental Protection, 71 Hospital Street, Augusta, ME 04333. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Anne E. Arnold, (617) 565&hyph;3166. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On December 1, 1993 (58 FR 63316), EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) for the State of Maine. The NPR proposed approval of several regulations adopted by the State of Maine which require the implementation of RACT for various types of VOC sources. No public comments were received on the NPR. Background Under the pre-amended Clean Air Act, ozone nonattainment areas were required to adopt RACT rules for sources of VOC emissions. EPA issued three sets of control technique guidelines (CTGs) documents, establishing a ``presumptive norm'' for RACT for various categories of VOC sources. The three sets of CTGs were: (1) Group I_issued before January 1978 (15 CTGs); (2) Group II_issued in 1978 (9 CTGs); and (3) Group III_issued in the early 1980's (5 CTGs). Those sources not covered by a CTG were called non-CTG sources. EPA determined that the area's SIP-approved attainment date established which RACT rules the area needed to adopt and implement. Under section 172(a)(1), ozone nonattainment areas were generally required to attain the ozone standard by December 31, 1982. Those areas that submitted an attainment demonstration projecting attainment by that date were required to adopt RACT for sources covered by the Group I and II CTGs. Those areas that sought an extension of the attainment date under section 172(a)(2) to as late as December 31, 1987 were required to adopt RACT for all CTG sources and for all major (i.e., 100 ton per year or more of VOC emissions) non-CTG sources. Under the pre-amended Clean Air Act, Maine was designated as rural nonattainment and, therefore, was required to adopt regulations pursuant to the Group I and Group II CTGs for major sources. Based on monitored ozone exceedances in Maine, EPA notified the Governor of Maine on May 25, 1988 and November 8, 1988 that portions of the SIP were inadequate to attain and maintain the ozone standard and requested that deficiencies in the existing SIP be corrected (EPA's SIP-Call). On November 15, 1990, amendments to the 1977 CAA were enacted. Public Law 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q. In amended Section 182(a)(2)(A) of the CAA, Congress statutorily adopted the requirement that pre-enactment ozone nonattainment areas that retained their designation of nonattainment and were classified as marginal or above fix their deficient RACT rules for ozone by May 15, 1991. Pursuant to the amended CAA, two counties in Maine were classified as marginal (these two counties constitute one marginal ozone nonattainment area) and seven counties in Maine were classified as moderate (these seven counties constitute three moderate ozone nonattainment areas). 56 FR 56694 (Nov. 6, 1991). The State submitted revisions to meet the RACT fix-up requirement and EPA approved these revisions to the Maine SIP on February 3, 1992 and March 22, 1993 (57 FR 3946 and 58 FR 15281).
