[passage omitted] The amazing thing is that our chosen ones at the top of the political pyramid at home are doing pretty badly too. Nevertheless, it is not their health that is giving them trouble! They are faring rather badly in the "internal" struggle for power that is being waged in silence. In their endeavors to strengthen their current positions, they are making the others suspicious! The one who is pulling the most strings is none other than Romania's big brother, Ion Iliescu, the republican of the Central Committee of the "reformed" Romanian Communist Party [PCR], who takes great care to ensure his certain perpetuation as the country's president. [passage omitted] In the last few days, Ion Iliescu treacherously administered a death blow to his "disciple," Adrian Nastase [speaker of the Chamber of Deputies and executive president of the Social Democracy Party of Romania, PDSR] who has grown too big for his boots, who has become too "famous" (obviously Ion Iliescu has not forgiven him the fact that he enjoys the most support from the electorate, as revealed by a recent public opinion poll widely disseminated in the media -- maybe that was the cause of all his misfortune), and who has accumulated too much political capital through his positions in the ruling party and the Chamber of Deputies, of which he is the leader, something that makes him omnipresent to the public at large, thanks to television and radio coverage. Therefore, it is not accidental that the government took care to splash on the front page of ADEVARUL of 27 April (when Adrian Nastase was abroad) an article entitled: "How Mr. Nastase Got Hold of Several Houses." From that article, we learn that the current president of the PDSR, of the Chamber of Deputies, and even of the Romanian Diaspora (reunited at a recent Congress in Baile Herculane -- this is how far the political paranoia of accumulating as many functions of president as possible can go!) is nothing but a second rate Mafioso, who is illegally acquiring villas through intrigue and is also involved in various profitable shoddy deals -- under the cover of relatives -- with cosmetics, pubs, and shops, thus forcing the state's hand! All of a sudden, the readers realized who Adrian Nastase -- the man who dreams of becoming Romania's president -- really was: a "cheat with functions," capable of resorting to any abuses to satisfy his own interests. All of a sudden, we all reminded that Adrian Nastase (his father-in-law is the former nomenklatura man of the Nicolae Ceausescu regime Angelo Miculescu, who is obviously a big businessman today -- you realize what kind of world Nastase belongs to) is the one who has definitively betrayed Romania, along with Ion Iliescu, by signing the perestroyka treaty with the Soviet Union after the revolution, in his capacity as minister of foreign affairs. [passage omitted] Last week, another significant article against him was published in ROMANIA LIBERA on 4 June by the alleged "independent" Antonie Iorgovan (another slimy apparatchik, currently judge at the Constitutional Court) entitled: "About the Cockiness of the Power's People and Their Lack of Restraint." [passage omitted] Driven hard into a corner, Adrian Nastase stated two days later that everything happening to him is a "new press campaign against me." A press campaign orchestrated by whom? Does he mean that our larger-circulation newspapers have also joined the early electoral campaign against Adrian Nastase and have nothing else to do than tow Ion Iliescu's line? Well, if this is the case, we are going through some pretty hard times ourselves. It seems that the Gods are still deserting us...
