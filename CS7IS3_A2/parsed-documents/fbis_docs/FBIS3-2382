Based on the improved contracted responsibility system for agricultural production, contracted rights and utilization rights of land can be divided and transferred to promote production. Establishment of collective farms and small household farms are encouraged to promote the sizeable management of the land. Further reform measures will be introduced to the markets for major agricultural products. The prices of grain, cotton and cocoon silk will be shifted to the control of the market from the traditional uniform state pricing system. The provincial government also aims to increase agricultural input by readjusting the allocation of funds. It is stipulated that the annual growth rate of expenditure on agriculture must be higher than that of the total in the financial budgets of governments at all levels. More capital will be earmarked for building and renovating irrigation works and water-conservancy facilities. Moreover, funds for agricultural technology research will be increased and more credits and loans will be provided to farmers. Export-oriented agricultural development zones will be set up to expand the opening-up of rural economy and accelerate agricultural restructuring. Disaster-relief reserve funds will be established to guarantee supplies of materials for farming production. Poverty-relief efforts will continue to be emphasized. The provincial government has earmarked 100 million yuan as special loans to boost township enterprises in poor areas.
