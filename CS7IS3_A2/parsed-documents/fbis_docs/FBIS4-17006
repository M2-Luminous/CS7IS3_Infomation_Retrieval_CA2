This goal was formulated in the social policy guidelines of the Russian Government for 1994, a document which was adopted by the Presidium of the Russian Government at its meeting on Thursday. The document stresses that "The Russian Government is guided by the premise that a fruitful and balanced social policy is a necessary condition to continue reforms, to consolidate their social basis and to improve the social and political situation in the country". The main directions of the social policy for 1994 provide for creating economic and legal conditions which will stimulate the able-bodied part of society to ensure its well-being with highly productive labour. They also provide for supporting optimum correlation between the incomes of the able-bodied part of population and disabled citizens, for ensuring the main social guarantees and for preventing mass unemployment. To realise these aims in 1994, the government plans to concentrate on preventing a drop in real cash incomes of population, ensuring a weighted balance of economic interests and material possibilities of hired labour, businessmen and disabled citizens as well as reforming the public health and public education systems, culture and housing. The government will also concentrate on creating new jobs for population and stepping up work to retrain labour.
