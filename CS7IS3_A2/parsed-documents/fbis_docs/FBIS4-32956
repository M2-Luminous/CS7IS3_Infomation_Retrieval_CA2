[jineteras] Maribel, you are astonished by the question. I can see that in your face. I believe many people are asking this question today, a question we should try to answer today, perhaps talking about the matter, talking about prostitution, male prostitution as well.... [Acosta, interrupting] And child prostitution. [Rodriguez] And child prostitution. I believe we must face this matter with a great deal of realism. This is a phenomenom new to the Revolution, but old to the world. Actually it was an old phenomenom in Cuba before the Revolution. Prostitution was a necessity, a necessity in order to survive. Later it became a way of being able to live better than the rest, in that recent period. Today, I believe the economic situation is fostering a revival of this phenomenon, but I still believe one should not have to sell one's body in order to solve problems in a crisis situation. I do not know what you, yourself think about this. [Acosta] I think prostitution is obviously on the increase, and I mean all types of prostitution -- whether of women, which is is what basically attracts the most attention and, to put it one way, is the most developed, but also of children, and of men as well. It is something that one did not encounter frequently, a few years ago. What is most dangerous, however, is that it is beginning to receive a certain amount of social tolerance, at least in the city of Havana. I know this because I travel extensively throughout the country. Situations like this also exist in other parts of Cuba, although I think it is more open, more obvious and overwhelming in Havana. This situation is also tolerated by a particular group of people in Havana. It is obvious that the economic situation in Cuba is difficult, that is clear. But as far as I am concerned -- I, who am living more or less the same way everyone else lives -- it is not necessary to sell oneself at all. There is a very curious phenomenom. For example, [pauses] of course there are many ways of looking at things in life, and the very way society sometimes looks at things contributes to different things. The other day I was walking by the Hotel Presidente on my way to the Casa de Las Americas, and on the hotel door leading to the pool there was a sign reading: children's party -- cake, soft drinks, pinatas and sweets during the last two Sundays of the month: two dollars per child. That is what the sign said. Well, we all know that having dollars is no longer penalized, but we also know that pharmacies that were selling medicines in dollars were deprived of those medicines for this very same reason because these are things with which the people must not be burdened. [Rodriguez] We have said -- in the past, in Straight Talk -- that there were limits, to dollar income. But we cannot hurt the population's feelings; and that sign you just mentioned surely hurts and exasperates those who walk by knowing that their children would like to be there but cannot because their parents do not have the dollars to pay for them. [Acosta] Does the Presidente Hotel need to be profitable at the expense of children's parties? I do not think so. I do not think it needs to do that, and it should not do it either, not only from the ethical point of view but also from the economic point of view because by no means should it base its profitability on something like this. And besides, you are walking with your child, a child who does not understand things much because he is still small, and he says: I would like to go to the swimming pool on Sunday. And you say: You cannot go there because we have to pay in dollars to get there. Imagine! And who has dollars? [Rodriguez] Maribel, I perceived indignation in you as you gave that concrete example. I do think this is not the only example, however. I think we must also talk about the family. A few hours ago, I was told an anecdote concerning a neighborhood here in Havana -- specifically, the Vedado neighborhood -- where a 14-year-old girl engages in prostitution with her family's permission. She is only 14 years old. I think that is the child prostitution matter you mentioned. She is not a full grown woman yet, and does not know what she wants. She has no idea of what love really is, nor does she know the significance of selling her body. In addition to society as a whole, I think the family is also responsible, for allowing this to happen. And of course, the government can be held partially, although not fully, responsible for this because people often want the government to solve all police problems through repression. I think this is just a matter of education. What do you think? [Acosta] Look, of course the family has a tremendous influence in this regard. And this has to do with what I was telling you about the social tolerance of this phenomenon. Tolerance means that people are looking at the phenomenon more leniently, not worrying much about whether a young girl or boy becomes a prostitute or not. This, then, becomes a growing phenomenon, and of course the family is very much responsible. There are people who claim -- and on this I agree with them -- that such behavior is normal in a time of crisis. I mean: A human being's worst aspects usually emerge in times of crisis. This is true. Therefore, we are facing a phenomenon for which there is no explanation. It is good to be alert, however, because we want to preserve the virtues we have preserved to date. And there is something that continues to bother me: Every morming I walk around the Habana Libre Hotel, and there are many children begging there, including children wearing uniforms, asking the tourists for money. The way they ask tourists for money, however, is not the way we see children in capitalist countries or poor countries ask. In a capitalist country when a child asks a tourist for money, the tourists do not dare to do anything because they know that if they try anything, they can be beaten or can be simply murdered. Our children, accustomed to being loved by society, children who are usually protected and often spoiled, do not know anything about what happens in other countries. And I have seen the way tourists are attacked and beaten up in other places. Such an example gives you an idea of the wicked actions that can occur, and I have often thought about this. Do you realize the difference here, and do you realize the real need to do these things? I mean: Do you see the difference between one place and another? The children who are begging for things in certain foreign countries, as I have seen them in Latin America, are sad-looking children. They are children who are fighting for survival, and you can see that in their eyes. But our children beg for money to buy candies. [Rodriguez] Maribel, I believe the examples you are giving us regarding the children seem to be sporadic examples that can perhaps be seen around the Habana Libre Hotel, as you said, or maybe in other tourist centers in the interior of Cuba; and they are being repressed effectively by the Pioneer organizations, the Union of Young Communists [UJC], and educational organizations, and I think families are also taking action. As you said, however, the goals of those children are candies, but sometimes they could also be attracted by signs like the one you found on the door of a hotel. Parents often also need those dollars, which cannot be obtained easily through legal means. They need dollars to take their children to such places, and to meet certain artificial needs that are often created. [Acosta] Yes. This is something we can discuss further, to tie what is happening in our society to the effects of the measures adopted recently. Moreover, the discussions held among the population, those Parliaments in the Workplace, seek to explain these phenomena, which are beginning to undermine society's values because work and the salaries of people who depend on their work, who depend on their salaries and their competency, are valued in society and are what give people their true value. The measures adopted recently, or measures outlined as policies that will be implemented gradually, will surely create the conditions in which people will be admired and respected for, and their value will depend on, their personal efforts and work, and not on immorality. This phenomenon, then, has to do with all these things, and in a way we must try to harness it socially; otherwise, social tolerance will emerge and the problem will worsen. [Rodriguez] I also think that we must... [Acosta, interrupting] We must also recall that this year, the crime committee discussed the idea of including within the penal code some criminal actions such as prostitution, procuring, etc. It was an idealistic mistake to exclude them, that is, I think that things like these must also be repressed. [Rodriguez] Yes. I also think, Maribel, that this type of action has reached a peak due mainly to the economic crisis. But there are other moral values that must be preserved. In addition to solving its economic problems, society must also preserve moral values because, as you said, these economic problems are related to our moral and social problems. But above all, I think we must recover the precept we have learned from our forefathers, from our grandparents. They are poor but honest. I think we must recover these principles because no crisis... [Acosta, interrupting] These are also the principles of Jose Marti. When we read Marti's ideas thoroughly, we realize that one of the most common words in his writings is honesty. [Rodriguez] Yes. No crisis can drag us to find dollars through any illegal means. It is true that in our society having dollars today means having solved some essential problems which most Cubans cannot solve. This is a truth no one can deny. But obtaining dollars by means of selling one's body is perhaps one of the most despicable ways for a human being to obtain a profit. And you who are a woman will probably know how to explain better to our listeners what does it mean for a woman to feel love for another person, to have a feeling, and not to be sold like merchandise because I think all those women engaged in prostitution are just merchandise. Don't you think? [Acosta] Yes. But I think you are only revealing your chauvinist position because I have to explain the situation not only because I am a woman, but I am going to answer the question anyhow because I guess I have no other alternative. Then, yes. Of course, love is essential in all aspects of life to enjoy life. This is our ultimate goal in life. As (Galiano) used to say: It is much better to make a living and not to buy it ready made. Then this is what it is, we have to gradually make our life, fighting and loving. And this type of action will ultimately generate love. No one can say that the lack of love is necessary for living. I believe these social behaviors can somehow be controlled or eradicated. I want Cuba to stop this problem. This is further proof that Cuba will remain as the Cuba we have always wanted and which we have hoped for. [Rodriguez] Thank you very much, Maribel Acosta, from the National Television Newscast, for discussing the problem of prostitution with us.
