FBIS4-56599 "drlat088_j_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-088 Daily Report 8 May 1994 Panama Advertisement Questions Background of Papa Egoro Advertisement Questions Background of Papa Egoro PA0505030494 PA0505030494 BFN [Editorial Report] Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish, on the back page of the front section of its 4 May edition, publishes an unattributed, four-color, full-page, paid advertisement that questions the background of members of the Papa Egoro Movement, including its presidential candidate Ruben Blades. The same four-color, full-page advertisement is published by Panama City LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in Spanish on page 18A of its 3 May edition and by Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA in Spanish on page 15A of its 4 May edition. The upper left-hand corner of this advertisement features a four-color graphic of the flag of the Communist Party of Italy. Next to this flag, flushed right in the upper right-hand corner of the page, is a graphic of the Papa Egoro logo. Although the Communist Party flag features the words "Democratic Party of the Left" and a small graphic rendition of a red flag with a hammer and sickle -- none of which is found in the Papa Egoro logo -- the two graphics are similar in that both feature green trees against white, circular backgrounds inside large orange fields. Beneath the Italian Communist Party flag, the words "Communist Party, Italy" are published in boldface. Beneath the Papa Egoro logo, the words "Ideological Recognition" are published in boldface. Immediately below the flag and logo, there is a box featuring three quotes attributed to Ruben Blades. The box reads as follows: ```I have been charged with belonging to the left because I do not belong to the right.' ```Che Guevara's project remains in effect.' ```Another thing that remains in effect is the need for a change, because there should be a change, no matter where it comes from.' ``Ruben Blades, (NOTIMEX) Chile'' Under the box, there is a section headlined: "What Does Papa Egoro Propose?" This section of the advertisement reads: "*`The first thing the new government must do is have its own currency' -- Raul Leis, ECLA [Economic Commission for Latin America] conference, University of Panama ``* `Mandatory military service is required' -- Ruben Blades, TVN Dialogue ``* 'Raise the Social Security quotas' -- Ruben Blades, ILDEA [Latin American Institute of Advanced Studies] ``* `We will change the Assembly in order to rule' -- Fernando Manfredo, Youth '94 TVN'' Under this middle section, there is a final section headlined "Who Is Papa Egoro?"
