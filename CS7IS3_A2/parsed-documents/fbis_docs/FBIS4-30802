Summing up the two-day talks in Talloires at this evening's news conference for domestic reporters, Krajisnik also said: "We specifically discussed western and eastern Bosnia and the Posavina issue, and we elaborated on the vital importance of these regions for the Serb population in Bosnia." "The fact that the Muslims want to acquire huge chunks of western Bosnia and the entire Posavina region remains a bone of contention. They want to include the Sanski Most, Prijedor, Kljuc, Doboj, Brcko, Zvornik, and Visegrad areas in the so-called gray zone that will be undefined and whose status will be resolved sometime in the future," Krajisnik said, and added: "We objected that sheer quantity meant nothing and that 1 percent of Tuzla or Sarajevo was worth more than 3 percent of some other territory. There were no definitive conclusions, so the Contact Group will have a hard time finding adequate solutions," he believes. Krajisnik believes that the most important effect of the negotiations was produced by the Contact Group's genuine desire to broker a lasting cessation of hostilities, although he voiced his skepticism regarding the finding of a political solution by the present participants represented in the Contact Group. "We were informed that the Muslim delegation was rejecting all offers, demanding a large percentage of the territory, and constantly laying claims to the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which only makes chances for a peaceful resolution more remote," Krajisnik said. "We clearly said and explained that we had vital interests in the regions of eastern Bosnia, Posavina, and parts of Sarajevo and I think that our position was fully appreciated, so I could say that the Talloires meeting was successful, because we also had a series of individual meetings with members of the Contact Group," Krajisnik said. "The Contact Group members did not bring a map to the meeting, so we worked on territorial issues in segments, although the Muslim demands were perfectly clear to us. I do not know whether any solutions will be imposed, but we unambiguously made it known that we will not accept any imposed solutions. It should be determined in the case of disputed territories whose interests are greater in relation to the disputed territory," Krajisnik said, stressing that no pressure had been exerted on the Serb delegation this time. The Srpska republic's national assembly president underlined that the Serb delegation had informed the Contact group about the current Muslim offensive, emphasizing that the Muslim side was warned that the Serbs will defend themselves and respond to attacks by launching counteroffensives, but the lasting orientation of the Bosnian Serbs was the establishment of a cessation of hostilities. "The international community, however, is not unanimous in the desire to stop the conflict in former Bosnia-Herzegovina," Krajisnik said. ``They forced themselves into adopting a unified stand, but this has already proved to be a sham because certain important factors are not in favor of the peace option, although there are countries strongly advocating an end to the war. The Muslims are exploiting this, they are behaving arrogantly, completely unrealistically, and they are resorting to blackmail as if the entire international community was on their side. "My impression is that the Muslims do not want the war to end, which could certainly result in an escalation of the conflict," Momcilo Krajisnik concluded at this evening's news conference for domestic reporters.
