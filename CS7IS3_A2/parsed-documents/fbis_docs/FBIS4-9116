Here is a report by Slavisa Sabljic: [Sabljic] Aircraft flew over Serbian positions on the Glamoc front in the republic of Srpska at about 1800 yesterday evening. These planes, which are as yet unidentified but which were definitely enemy planes, left behind a thick veil of smoke forcing all Serbian fighters on the front line to seek urgent medical care to deal with breathing discomforts and sharp stomach pains. Serbian military sources are awaiting the results of a microbiological analysis of specimens taken from the affected soldiers before giving any further details about the incident. They are confident, however, that an as yet unknown poison gas was used for the first time and that the brave soldiers of Glamoc were the first to experience the toxicity of the gas. The thick toxic smoke was released by propeller aircraft which throughout yesterday flew over the Serbian positions on (Goricna), Golija, and (Bujaca), about 15 km from Glamoc. [Announcer] We have learned that the specimens are being analyzed in Banja Luka and that the results of the analysis will be announced the day after tomorrow.
