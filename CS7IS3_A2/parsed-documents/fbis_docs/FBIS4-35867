FBIS4-35867 "drnes108_l_94011" FBIS-NES-94-108 Daily Report 5 Jun 1994 ISRAEL Cabinet Meets; Shahal Comments on Jerusalem Issue Cabinet Meets; Shahal Comments on Jerusalem Issue TA0506155494 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English 1500 GMT 5 Jun 94 TA0506155494 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el English BFN [Text] The cabinet today approved working permits for 35,000 Arabs of the territories to enter Israel. Approximately 20,000 have been designated for the construction sector. Next week, the cabinet is due to discuss the request of Housing Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer for another 20,000 permits. After the cabinet meeting, Minister Yosi Sarid said any Palestinian with what he called a serious and urgent medical case, will be allowed to receive treatment in Israel. Also at the cabinet meeting, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said he believed there appears to be positive movement by Jordan in the peace talks. Security officers told the ministers they were pleased with the way the Palestinian police were operating in the self-rule areas, but they said the fact that members of the police are not getting their salaries could cause problems for both Palestinians and Israelis. Police Minister Shahal has rejected Yasir 'Arafat's claim that Israeli rule has destroyed the Palestinian education, health, and housing services in Gaza and Jericho. In an interview with Jack Katzenell, Shahal said the economic progress of the Palestinians in the territories has surpassed that of the Arabs in Syria, Iraq, and even Jordan. The minister said it was high time Yasir 'Arafat came to Gaza instead of just talking. Shahal also rejected Likud opposition charges that the government had given Yasir 'Arafat a secret letter about the future of Jerusalem. [Begin recording] [Shahal] We did not give or submit any commitment on the issue of Jerusalem beyond the documents that have been submitted to the Knesset after the Cairo agreement. [Katzenell] Mr. al-Husayni was saying that he and the other Palestinian leaders in and around Jerusalem are going to continue establishing Palestinian offices, Palestinian institutions, Palestinian governing bodies here in Jerusalem. Where do you stand on this? Is this a violation of the agreement and what precisely are you, as police minister, going to do about it? [Shahal] Well, certainly if the Palestinians are going to establish Palestinian organizations and institutes in Jerusalem, this is a violation of the agreement, of the declaration of principles, and we certainly are going to take measures to prevent the establishment of such institutes in Jerusalem. [Katzenell] What about armed Palestinian security guards? We hear that he has armed guards at Orient House. [Shahal] This should be licensed by the Israeli Police and certainly there will be no armed force in Jerusalem which does not belong to the Israeli police force. If any person will do such a thing then he is violating the laws and he will be arrested like any other person within the state of Israel. [Katzenell] Lastly sir, Yasir 'Arafat said yesterday that Israel is leaving scorched earth in Gaza. The educational system is destroyed, the housing is destroyed, everything is destroyed. All the services are destroyed, he says, because of the occupation. What is your reply to this? Has Israel neglected and even destroyed the civilian infrastructure of the territories? [Shahal] Compared to what we received after the Six-Day War, the situation in health, education, and the infrastructure is immensely better than what we received. I think that what we have done during that period of time cannot be compared even to the progress in other Arab countries. The Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza have more telephones per family, more cars per family, than those say in Syria, or in Iraq, or even in Jordan. [end recording] [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English at 1500 GMT on 5 June also reports that "the government has approved a loan of 400 million shekels to the Kupat Holim Klalit Health Fund. Finance Minister Avraham Shohat and Police Minister Moshe Shahal supported appointing a receiver to the health fund, but they were the only ministers who voted against the loan. Meretz ministers Yosi Sarid and Ya'ir Tzaban abstained. Finance Minister Shohat said he would honor the cabinet's decision though he said it did not provide the solution necessary, and that drastic steps are necessary to reform the health fund."]
