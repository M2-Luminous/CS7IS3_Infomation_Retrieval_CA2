FR940725-0-00168 FR940725-0-00019 C. As Construed by the Courts and by OSHA, the OSH Act Sets Clear and Reasonable Limits for Agency Rulemaking Action OSHA has long followed the teaching that section 3(8) of the OSH Act requires that, before it promulgates `` any permanent health or safety standard, [it must] make a threshold finding that a place of employment is unsafe_in the sense that significant risks are present and can be eliminated or lessened by a change in practices [ Industrial Union Dep't, AFL&hyph;CIO v. American Petroleum Inst., 448 U.S. 607, 642 (1980) (plurality) ( Benzene ); emphasis was supplied in original].'' Thus, the national consensus and existing federal standards that Congress instructed OSHA to adopt summarily within two years of the OSH Act's inception provide reference points concerning the least an OSHA standard should achieve (29 U.S.C. 655(a)). As a result, OSHA is precluded from regulating insignificant safety risks or from issuing safety standards that do not at least lessen risk in a significant way. The OSH Act also limits OSHA's discretion to issue overly burdensome rules, as the agency also has long recognized that ``any standard that was not economically or technologically feasible would a fortiori not be reasonably necessary or appropriate' under the Act. See Industrial Union Dep't v. Hodgson, [499 F.2d 467, 478 (D.C. Cir. 1974)] (Congress does not appear to have intended to protect employees by putting their employers out of business.') [ American Textile Mfrs. Inst. Inc., 452 U.S. at 513 n. 31 (a standard is economically feasible even if it portends disaster for some marginal firms,' but it is economically infeasible if it threaten[s] massive dislocation to, or imperil[s] the existence of,' the industry)].'' By stating the test in terms of ``threat'' and ``peril,'' the Supreme Court made clear in ATMI that economic infeasibility begins short of industry-wide bankruptcy. OSHA itself has placed the line considerably below this level. (See for example, ATMI, 452 U.S. at 527 n. 50; 43 FR 27360 (June 23, 1978). Proposed 200 μg/m3 PEL for cotton dust did not raise serious possibility of industry-wide bankruptcy, but impact on weaving sector would be severe, possibly requiring reconstruction of 90 percent of all weave rooms. OSHA concluded that the 200 μg/m3 level was not feasible for weaving and that 750 μg/m3 was all that could reasonably be required. See also 54 FR 29245&hyph;29246 (July 11, 1989); American Iron & Steel Institute, 939 F.2d at 1003. OSHA raised engineering control level for lead in small nonferrous foundries to avoid the possibility of bankruptcy for about half of small foundries even though the industry as a whole could have survived the loss of small firms.) All OSHA standards must also be cost-effective in the sense that the protective measures being required must be the least expensive measures capable of achieving the desired end ( ATMI , at 514 n. 32; Building and Constr. Trades Dep't AFL&hyph;CIO v. Brock, 838 F.2d 1258, 1269 (D.C. Cir. 1988)). OSHA gives additional consideration to financial impact in setting the period of time that should be allowed for compliance, allowing as much as 10 years for compliance phase-in. (See United Steelworkers of Am. v. Marshall, 647 F.2d 1189, 1278 (D.C. Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 453 U.S. 913 (1981).) Additionally, OSHA's enforcement policy takes account of financial hardship on an individualized basis. OSHA's Field Operations Manual provides that, based on an employer's economic situation, OSHA may extend the period within which a violation must be corrected after issuance of a citation (CPL 2.45B, Chapter III, paragraph E6d(3)(a), Dec. 31, 1990). To reach the necessary findings and conclusions, OSHA conducts rulemaking in accordance with the requirements of section 6 of the OSH Act. The rulemaking process enables the Agency to determine the qualitative and, if possible, the quantitative nature of the risk with (and without) regulation, the technological feasibility of compliance, the availability of capital to the industry and the extent to which that capital is required for other purposes, the industry's profit history, the industry's ability to absorb costs or pass them on to the consumer, the impact of higher costs on demand, and the impact on competition with substitutes and imports. (See ATMI at 2501&hyph;2503; American Iron & Steel Institute generally.) Section 6(f) of the OSH Act further provides that, if the validity of a standard is challenged, OSHA must support its conclusions with ``substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole,'' a standard that courts have determined requires fairly close scrutiny of agency action and the explanation of that action. (See Steelworkers, 647 F.2d at 1206&hyph;1207.) OSHA's powers are further circumscribed by the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, which provides a neutral forum for employer contests of citations issued by OSHA for noncompliance with health and safety standards (29 U.S.C. 659&hyph;661; noted as an additional constraint in Benzene at 652 n. 59). OSHA must also respond rationally to similarities and differences among industries or industry sectors. (See Building and Constr. Trades Dep't, AFL&hyph;CIO v. Brock, 838 F.2d 1258, 1272&hyph;73 (D.C. Cir. 1988).) OSHA rulemaking is thus constrained first by the need to demonstrate that the standard will substantially reduce a significant risk of material harm, and then by the requirement that compliance is technologically capable of being done and not so expensive as to threaten economic instability or dislocation for the industry. Within these bounds, further constraints such as the need to find cost-effective measures and to respond rationally to all meaningful comment militate against regulatory extremes.
