A police spokesperson said the actual weight of the marijuana came to 697.5 pounds. The marijuana was contained in 23 separate bags that were marked "Jamaica" on the outside, he said. The marijuana appeared to be professionally packaged and intended for trans-shipment to another destination, most likely the United States, the spokesperson said. The drug had a street value of approximately US$850,000. Drugs Squad Superintendent Trevor Cutts said the large amounts of marijuana and cocaine found on Cayman beaches recently "indicate the islands are still being used to ship drugs from Jamaica and Honduras to the United States." Travellers from the Caymans, particularly U.S. citizens who have been on vacation here, are seldom searched or detained when clearing customs at Miami International or other U.S. airports, officials here say. Three U.S. nationals have been arrested here in the past six months and charged with transporting drugs back to the United States. All have admitted they were recruited to be "mules" by local residents who offered them a week's vacation in the Cayman Islands in return for ferrying marijuana and cocaine back to the States.
