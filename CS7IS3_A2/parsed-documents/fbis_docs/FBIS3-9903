(Ruiz Cubiles) added: Since we began these relations 14 years ago, we have passed through several stages. The first was advisory and course-oriented; the second, over the past five years, involved the implementation of some projects, with others still pending approval. Now we can say that the '94 Information Science Conference represents the starting point of a third stage, during which the Cuba-Spain-Unesco triangle can hopefully facilitate greater participation by public and private companies in these projects. (Ruiz Cubiles) said that these companies must take a more entrepreneurial view, more concerned about the projects' profits and economic gains.
