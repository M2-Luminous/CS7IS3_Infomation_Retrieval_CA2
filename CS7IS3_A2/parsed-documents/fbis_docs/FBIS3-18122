Party executive spokesman Ludger Volmer [speaking at the party conference in Mannheim today] accused the SPD of wanting to move "toward the Right voluntarily." [passage omitted] The SPD must no longer present itself as a "softie version" of the current government's policy. This would make it difficult for a red-green alliance to take power in Bonn. [passage omitted] Volmer stressed that the Greens wanted to become the third strongest force, replace Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and end the CDU/CSU government. The Greens needed to make it clear that environmental reform policy cannot be made without them. The program for the Alliance 90/Greens election campaign focuses on economic environmental and social policy. [passage omitted]
