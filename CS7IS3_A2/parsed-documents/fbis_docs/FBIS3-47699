The revolutionary slogan reflects the intent of the party and the leader [suryong] who wish to make 1994 a year of historic upturn in our country's revolution and construction by lifting a strong wind of self-reliance in the entire country. Today, the revolutionary slogan of self-reliance and hard struggle grabs the hearts of our people and encourages them to march toward a new feat. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has noted: The prevailing situation demands us more than ever before to highly display the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle. Our people's history of socialist construction is the history of self-reliance. Because our people have a strong revolutionary spirit of rising from the ruins with their own strength, believing in only the party and the leader [suryong], they were able to effect the great Chollima upsurge in the difficult postwar days and firmly adhere to the socialist cause by smashing all sorts of the imperialists' obstructionist maneuvers. Self-reliance is the only road to existence and to displaying the dignity of the nation; this is the truth that our people have learned by paying a dear price. All party members and working people should now advance by upholding the militant slogan of self-reliance. This is an important requirement for thoroughly implementing the party's revolutionary economic strategy and brilliantly carrying out the tasks of the adjustment period for socialist economic construction. Our party's revolutionary economic strategy is the wisest formula of economic construction aimed at satisfactorily guaranteeing the people's living condition in conformity with socialist requirements and dislodging a new position of attack to occupy a higher land of socialism. This economic strategy calls for displaying limitless economic potentials. It is our party's strategic plan, out of the principle of self-reliance, to rapidly develop light industry, agriculture, and foreign trade with our own strength, technology, and resources so as to highly enhance the people's living condition in the near future. This year is a first year of the adjustment period. The success of this year's struggle depends on how all the people will display the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle. When everyone fights with the same strong spirit of self-reliance that once filled the thick forest of Mt. Paektu and the same spirit of hard struggle with which we shoveled for the first time after the war, the flame of great revolutionary upsurge will be kindled again in every domain of the socialist construction. Everyone displaying the spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle comes as a decisive factor in consolidating the might of self-dependent economy and smashing the imperialists' maneuvers of isolation and obliteration. The might of the people who fight with a firm conviction in their own strength is infinite and no enemy can match the power of such masses. The achievements of last year's struggle that brilliantly adorned the final year of the Third Seven-Year Plan in a sharp political, military confrontation with the imperialists prove this eloquently. Today's prevailing situation in which the imperialists beef up suppression and blockade as never before and a great change takes place in the country's external economic relations demands that we further strengthen a self-dependent economy in any condition. In order to do so, the principle of self-reliance should be firmly adhered to. No one can touch us when the foundation of a self- dependent economy is firm. The slogan of self-reliance is the most reasonable slogan that totally corresponds to the basic interest of our revolution and construction and is a revolutionary slogan that turns misfortune into fortune. All party members and working people should bring about a constant innovation and continue to advance, upholding the party's slogan, "Let us accelerate the general onward march of socialism with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle." Above all, we, with a firm conviction in our strength, should keep in our hearts the chuche-oriented point of view and position that we will only live in our own way. The chuche-oriented point of view and conviction are ideological and spiritual foundations of self-reliance. A strong mettle that anything can be accomplished with one's own strength in whatever circumstances and an inexhaustible creative power that creates something out of nothing all stem from the chuche-oriented conviction. All party members and working people should vigorously advance with the firm confidence in the great leadership of our party which leads our socialist cause into the single road of invincibility; the might of our revolutionary ranks which is being single-heartedly united by the masses, the party, and the leader [suryong]; and the might of our self-independent economy which does not vacillate in whatever storm. When the party members and working people keep in their hearts the strong conviction in victory that we will surely win as long as the dear comrade leader leads our socialist cause, the revolutionary ethos of self-reliance and hard struggle will be even more displayed in any place. For those who have the firm chuche-oriented point of view and position, there will be no incident of looking at others and relying on others' strength. We believe in our own strength and should vigorously press ahead with production and construction with our own technology, materials, and natural resources. Our party members and working people, when manufacturing a single part of a machine or a single necessary item of life, should make them of good quality and strive to develop science technology that matches the current situation of our country. In order to demonstrate the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle, it is important for our party members and working people to have a strong will and mettle to implement revolutionary tasks presented by the party without fail. At a time when a grand march to adorn this year as a year of revolutionary upturn is being waged, what we need is the spirit of absoluteness and unconditionality of patriotic forefathers of the anti-Japanese revolution who strived with the conviction that they have no right to die unless there is an order from the comrade supreme commander and the indefatigable revolutionary spirit of heroic fighters of the Fatherland Liberation War who defended a height of the nation, sacrificing their lives. All party members and working people should surely carry out their revolutionary tasks presented by the party with their strength, wisdom, and devoted struggle, upholding the party's slogan, "When the party decides, we will act." In all domains of the national economy, this year's national economic plan should be unconditionally fulfilled by the day, by the month, by the quarter, and by the indicators by mobilizing all possible efforts, resources, and equipment. In particular, major domains of the national economy, such as the light industry, agriculture, foreign trade, the coal industry, the power industry, transport by railway, and the metal industry, should boldly carry out a struggle to fulfill the party's revolutionary economic strategy by highly displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle. In all sectors and units, the production and conservation struggle should be waged to mobilize internal reserves to the maximum. This is an important requirement for thoroughly embodying the principle of self-reliance in the economic construction. Our country's socialist self-independent economy has a great production potential. The question lies in searching all sorts of internal reserves by buckling down with firm resolve. Just as work to mobilize internal reserves were vigorously waged in every place to create the speedy advance of Chollima by upholding the decision made at the plenary session in December, 1956, the entire party and all the people should turn out in the effort to strengthen the production and conservation struggle. All domains and units should satisfactorily carry out maintenance and supplementary work for production facilities, management of facilities and manpower, and the work of supplying materials so that all facilities are fully operated and production is normalized at a high level. Today's circumstances demand that all domains carry out the nation's housekeeping in a frugal manner and more highly raise the beacon of struggle for conservation. All party members and working people should unanimously rise in the work for conservation of fuel, energy, raw materials and other materials, including electricity and coal. Those who save even a watt of electricity, a handful of coal, and a piece of grain can be called genuine patriots who live and struggle with the spirit of self-reliance and arduous struggle. For the guiding functionaries to thoroughly embody the revolutionary slogan of self-reliance and arduous struggle in all fields of socialist construction, they should properly carry out the combat organizational work with staunch revolutionary spirit. The position on which the commanding members should stand in this year's tense struggle is in the vanguard of the ranks. All guiding functionaries should boldly break through all difficulties they face with their own strength with ardent passion and revolutionary determination to carry to accomplishment without fail the party's revolutionary economic strategy. They should inspire production masses to the struggle to actively mobilize internal reserves and to increase production. The functionaries with a strong revolutionary spirit of self-reliance are the people who, without exception, make tenacious efforts to constantly revolutionize and classicize themselves. Rejecting stagnation and stalemate, the guiding functionaries should always live with the spirit of crossing the blazing river and bog. They should deeply mingle with the masses, sharing the same food with them, and should learn from them our people's excellent trait of struggling for self-reliance. It is important in making the whole nation overflow with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and the arduous struggle to enhance the political functions and role of party organizations at each level. Party organizations should strengthen organizational and political work so that all party members and working people unanimously rise in the struggle to strengthen the self-supporting nature and might of our economy by upholding the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's New Year's address and decisions of the 21st plenary session of the Sixth Party Central Committee. Party organizations should make all working people keenly realize that self-reliance is the only way for survival and is the road to victory, through brilliant realities in our country and the situation in the countries where socialism was frustrated. The revolutionary spirit of self-reliance displayed during the postwar period of the great Chollima upsurge is a driving force which will vigorously push ahead with our revolution and construction today and in the future. Party organizations should actively lead all party members and working people so that they live and struggle with the spirit cherished during the difficult postwar period when they produced more steel material and even manufactured trucks and tractors. Assuming our party's revolutionary slogan of self-reliance and arduous struggle as the guideline and principle in their struggle and life, all people should more vigorously fight to glorify history of socialist construction in our country forever as the proud history of self-reliance.
