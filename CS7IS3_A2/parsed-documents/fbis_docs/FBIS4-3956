Huang said prior to his departure that the main purpose of his visit is to push Japan to take effective measures to narrow the widening trade gap between the two countries and to seek Japan's support for Taiwan's bid to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Taiwan has long incurred huge trade deficits with Japan. The amount reached U.S.$14.42 billion in 1993 and may hit U.S.$16 billion this year. "We hope Japan can address the trade imbalance problem before it develops into a political issue," Huang noted. Huang will also hold informal tariff reduction talks with Japanese officials under the GATT framework. Although Japan has not yet sent Taiwan a "tariff reduction" list, Huang said the BOFT has prepared a package of measures to cope with possible Japanese requests. "To win Japan's support for our GATT bid, we plan to open our market to Japanese cigarettes and alcohol before our GATT entry," Huang said. Taiwan also plans to remove "area and quota" restrictions on 16 kinds of fruit imports, including apples, in line with the GATT requirements, Huang said. "The liberalization would allow such Japanese fruits as apples and pears to enter our market," he explained. At present, Taiwan only allows free imports of apples from the United States and Canada. Huang said Japan is most concerned about Taiwan's ban on imports of Japanese compact cars. Taiwan currently allows free imports of American and European compact cars. In line with GATT regulations, Taiwan must open its market to Japanese compact cars. In consideration of Taiwan's huge trade deficit with Japan, Huang said he will ask Japan to voluntarily restrict its auto exports to Taiwan. "Such a measure would also help minimize the impact on the local auto industry," he added. Huang is scheduled to return to Taipei Friday.
