Menem said: "As everyone here knows, we have an amnesty law, a due obedience law, court sentences, and a pardon decree" and thus this is "a closed matter." Menem made these remarks shortly before leaving for Ecuador where he will be received by President Sixto Duran-Ballen, with whom he will sign several bilateral integration agreements. In an unscheduled news conference at the military sector of the Aeroparque metropolitan airport, Menem said he finds it strange for "Italy to try to meddle in these affairs" now that "several years have elapsed since the time of repression in our country." "Those cases to which the double jeopardy principle is applicable cannot be reopened," Menem said. He said that the subject "has been artificially resurrected," adding that the presence of Italian judges in Argentina "is pointless at this time." Asked by reporters if the Italian judges could request the extradition of former de facto President Jorge Rafael Videla, Menem said: "No, they have no right to do that because he has been sentenced and pardoned." Menem reiterated that the government has great interest in the approval of the labor reform bill being discussed in Congress. At 0702 this morning Menem left for Ecuador where he will sign several bilateral integration agreements and, on 21 February he will go to Colombia to meet with President Cesar Gaviria.
