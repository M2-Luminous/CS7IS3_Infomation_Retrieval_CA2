I will, instead, refer to certain events that may, in one way or another, influence the course of events. I will discuss two basic tracks. If these two tracks meet, they can influence events in a certain way, and if they clash, they will produce an opposite result. The first track involves getting tired of the conflict or suffering, regardless of the form of that suffering. The second is the growing drift toward regionalism as a result of what happened in the Arab region, specifically in the Arabian Peninsula and the Gulf. Planes sometimes crash. Despite all the thorough investigations they conduct, specialists fail to arrive at an obvious or direct result for the crash. Specialists and experts may say the crash is caused by "the fatigue of material," which sustained constant stresses for years and then, at a certain point in time, yielded to these stresses and failed. Similarly, it seems to me that the world is now passing through what we may call "yielding to fatigue caused by conflict or other elements caused by conflict itself." Those who wish to refute this remark cannot use any ongoing conflicts anywhere as examples. Even in the midst of these conflicts, the eye can see obvious signs of fatigue. This fatigue was probably the real reason behind the Palestinian-Israeli agreement, which is not allowed to fail. That fatigue may also be the reason behind the possibility of reaching peace in the Irish question, as well as other chronic, or so-called traditional, questions. If this statement or argument is considered valid, then we can assume that several conflicts will come to an end in 1994. Based on this, one can say that the civil war in Afghanistan will end when a firm and final solution is reached; that peace treaties will be signed by the Arab states directly involved in the Arab-Israeli conflict; that the war in (former) Yugoslavia will end with its partition into several ethnic, independent states; and that the Somalis will emerge from the quagmire into which they were pushed by the policies and conduct of Siad Birri and the Somali factions that are trying to inherit him, not because they love to serve Somalia and its people, but because they lust for power and hegemony. One can further say that matters between the two Yemens will not exacerbate and reach the point of a civil war or a semi-regular war for reasons every observer knows. All these issues can be resolved if the decisive factor in such conflicts and disputes does not interfere. That decisive factor is regionalism, which, we can observe, is currently growing as a result or what happened in the region. It is noteworthy that the world undergoes cycles of events similar to those of economy. We also note that some of these cycles witness a trend toward localization with all its characteristics and qualities. There is no room here to explain this phenomenon which we had earlier discussed in some detail in writings, some of which were published. It seems that the world is currently passing through a cycle of acute regionalism. It is easy for those interested in or following up this trend to note that this cycle clearly exists in the Arab world more than anywhere else, particularly in the Arabian Peninsula and the Gulf, including Iraq, in spite of the fact that this region is historically known for its pan-Arab feelings and orientations. We, however, reiterate that the feeling of regionalism was the result of what happened in this region--a region which endured more than its capacity. Some felt that they gave a great deal, but none reciprocated by giving them as much as they offered, not even a word of thanks and appreciation. What is more ironic is that they were destroyed by those for whose sake they gave and sacrificed. Thus far, I cannot say there is any indication that this trend is subsiding. What exists is the opposite. Therefore, I can say that the new year will witness victories by the supporters of regionalism everywhere. Hence, I do not believe the Arab world will witness any serious attempt at unification neither in a general manner nor on the level of the regional entities. In the meantime, there are growing fears about the possibility of maintaining Iraq's unity. My reply to these fears is that Iraq will remain unified for several reasons. One of them is that what applies to Iraq also applies to the regional states for reasons known to all, unless these states accept what others decide for them or are unaware of what is taking place around them or inside their states. There are certain facts which should be recognized by all states of diversified demographic structure. They should take the national, ethnic, religious, and other diversification into consideration. I clearly say that from the demographic perspective, Iraq, for example, should not live or behave as if it were a 100 percent Arab country nor should Turkey act as if it were 100 percent Turkish or Iran as 100 percent Persian. What applies to these states also applies to a certain extent to Syria and others. The regional conflicts afflicting Somalia, Yugoslavia, and Afghanistan will not easily end. These states will reach a degree of exhaustion which will make them accept a solution even for a period of time. As for the Arab region, it will most likely witness changes in the Arabian Peninsula, the Gulf states, and Egypt. The extremist, fundamentalist current will get more severe, violent, and widespread. The situation in Algeria will get more complicated, and things could get out of hand in this fraternal, struggling country. Also, the Libyan-Western crisis will get worse. The result will be in favor of the West if no changes and major positive developments take place in the Arab world. These developments are unlikely to happen. This means that Libya will regrettably stay on its own. We are confronted then with a general feeling of fatigue as a result of protracted, bloody conflicts. This trend could lead to the achievement of peace in many parts of the world, including our region. This, however, depends on the courage of the decisionmakers to let bygones be bygones and turn over a new leaf by having a serious, realistic view of how things are going, despite all the bitterness involved. The purpose of this is to arrive at a new, sound framework that clarifies relations and precisely spells out rights and duties. Otherwise, things will take a different course, similar to what happened when we had blood and destruction, especially since these events were the outcome of what very brothers did even before more distant relatives came into the picture. We should also not forget that we have another trend that seeks to fragment the existing states and turn them into smaller entities. Should such a trend succeed, God forbid, it will spark new conflicts, especially if force were used, and this is not unlikely. It is common knowledge that force breeds violence, which is almost always a means to settle disputes, particularly in the Third World. Here, we lay special emphasis on the role of leaders and how much they absorb changes. If the concerned leaders realize that regional conflicts deserve much of their time and attention -- and as such should be debated instead of having recourse to bullets -- then it will be possible for the two trends to live together in peace. If, however, force has the final say, then the regional trend will most likely defeat fatigue and thus reinvigorate exhausted conflicts and disputes. I sincerely hope that decisionmakers everywhere, especially in our region, will heed this fact. Geneva, 31 December 1993.
