Oman and Qatar are important players both in the Gulf and in the wider Arab arena. King Husayn's Oman visit should further enhance the common outlook shared by his majesty and the sultan of Oman on Arab issues at this critical point in Arab history, a time when the Arabs need to exert themselves in the interest of increased solidarity and common understanding. The role being played by Jordan and Oman in the context of containing the Yemeni crisis is an indication of a common perspective on the challenges facing the Arab nation. This makes His Majesty King Husayn's visit to Oman doubly important. His majesty's visit to Qatar is no less important, especially given that it will be his first since the Gulf crisis, which, if it were not for the bold and enlightened stands of such Arab states as Qatar, might have torn the fabric of inter-Arab relations to shreds. We are optimistic and hopeful that King Husayn's talks in Oman and Qatar will yield dividends for a brighter Arab future. We are confident that the kind of pan-Arab sense of responsibility typical of the courageous leadership in Oman and Qatar will go a long way toward furthering Arab solidarity, irrespective of the obstacles that have piled up along the way.
