In his letter to NATO General Secretary Manfred Werner, sent Tuesday, Baburyan asks to take into consideration the fact that "Azerbaijan's leadership does not intend to reject its aggressive policy" while considering this issue. As Baburyan said, Baku's torpedoing of the CSCE peaceful initiatives and other peacemaking efforts aimed at the settlement of this conflict testifies to this fact. "We are especially concerned over Baku's attempt to internationalize the conflict, involving extremist forces into it," emphasizes the letter. Azerbaijan's joining the NATO Partnership for Peace program without the policy of this state changing can discredit noble goals, aggravate the situation in this region, and could lead, in general, to undesirable consequences, concludes the message.
