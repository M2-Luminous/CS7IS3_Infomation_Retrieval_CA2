It is an all-electric residence designed with a coffee shop on the first floor and so that a family of four can live on the second floor, and Kansai Electric Power will verify efficient use of energy incorporating solar batteries, an electric storage and heat storage system, and a reverse current system. The New Energy Development Organization (NEDO) has been commissioned for the corroborative tests and will continue them for a year jointly with the Electric Power Central Research Institute. The first floor of the building is scheduled to be affranchised as a coffee shop. The output of the solar batteries will be a maximum of 4 kilowatts. All the electric power used in the daytime cannot be supplied by solar batteries, but it serves to reduce the peak load. Electricity is stored in storage batteries using relatively cheap late night power, hot water heat and cold heat are stored in a heat storage tank, and used in air conditioning and heating during the day. This equipment is controlled by an independent energy management system, which forecasts power load by anticipating the next day's weather and family activity schedule and automatically selects the most appropriate use of solar batteries and storage batteries.
