In a statement after the hour long meeting, Baykal said that the country is facing a great economic crisis. He noted that all the problems are tied to the government problem, adding that it has become evident that the current government is incapable of solving the current issues. Baykal said that the government issue should be discussed at the Turkish Grand National Assembly [TGNA] and solved. [Begin Baykal recording] This issue should not be a constant source of discussion and complaints in unauthorized forums and by unauthorized organs. The time has come to discuss and assess this issue at the authorized organ, which is the TGNA, within the framework of the appropriate rules and regulations. Everyone should shoulder his responsibilities and execute his duties. [end recording] Baykal stated that the primary condition for solving the country's problems is to form a determined government that will inspire confidence and secure the support of the people. Demirel received Nationalist Action Party leader Alpaslan Turkes in the afternoon. At the meeting, Turkes told Demirel: Your messages are most beneficial. You raise the morale of the people. In reply Demirel said: [Begin Demirel recording] We are waging a psychological war. If, as a nation and as a people, we believe that we can surmount the problems then that is what will happen. We have surmounted all our problems in the past. [end recording] Demirel said that there is no reason for the Turkish economy to go bankrupt and added: There was a monetary crisis. Naturally, this problem should be solved without it affecting the economy and social issues. In a statement after the meeting which lasted for 40 minutes, Turkes said that he conveyed to Demirel his views on the country's political problems. Pointing out that the country's problems should be solved in accordance with human rights, the laws and the principles of democracy, Turkes added that views and rumored solutions outside this framework are invalid. He noted that the government and statesmen should keep up their responsible attitude regarding national unity and the country's territorial integrity. [Begin Turkes recording] I told him that statements are being made from time to time to the effect that the activities of our security forces against the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] should be stopped and that a political solution should be sought. I also told him that these statements should not be heeded. I said that these statements are aimed at deceiving the Turkish people. I said that those who want to divide Turkey are resorting to such deceit. [end recording] [passage omitted]
