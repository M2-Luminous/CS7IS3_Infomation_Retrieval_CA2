Both sides were proceeding from an understanding that nothing is possible in this world without Russia and the United States, he said. Despite the fact that Clinton's Air Force One landed in Moscow later than scheduled, the official ceremony of greeting in the Kremlin began a mere 11 minutes behind the schedule on Thursday morning. Bill Clinton arrived in the Kremlin from Hotel Radisson- Slavynskaya, where he stayed overnight, at 09.11. The official ceremony of greetings took place, according to a tradition, in St. George's Hall of the Grand Kremlin Palace. President Boris Yeltsin recalled his first meeting with President Bill Clinton in Vancouver during which they laid the groundwork for Russian-American partnership as well as for their personal rapport and friendship. He said the atmosphere of the hall where they were meeting was conducive to the profundity and success of discussions. Bill Clinton responded to Yeltsin's "welcome to Russia, welcome to Moscow" by stressing that cooperation between Russia and the United States at the present historical stage aimed to create a new security structure in Europe on the basis of democratic values and free economies which will further define the greatness of Russia. The two presidents then spent almost 90 minutes together in the Green Hall of the Kremlin Palace discussing the latest developments in the two countries in the presence of the presidential aide Dmitriy Ryurikov, special advisor to the U.S. secretary of state Strobe Talbott and interpreters. While the two presidents conferred in the Green Hall, the leaders of the diplomatic departments of Russia and the United States Andrey Kozyrev and Warren Christopher were working in the nearby Yellow Hall brushing up the package of Russo-American agreements and statements which the presidents were due to sign later. Three agreements are already fully ready for signing -- on air communications, on cooperation in the field of health care services and biomedical research, and cooperation in the study of radiation effects on humans and the environment. A memorandum of intent to cooperate in export controls has also been prepared for signing, as well as a joint Russian-American statement on the Middle East. The two presidents would also sign the main document -- the Moscow Declaration and make a statement on human rights and another on the nuclear non-proliferation. After a walkabout between buildings of the Kremlin and a visit to the Assumption Cathedral, Yeltsin and Clinton returned to the Grand Kremlin Palace where they were joined by other officials to continue discussions which lasted until 14;00, longer than scheduled. Commenting on the second session, Yeltsin's press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov said the summit was taking place in a new political situation - after Russia adopted a new constitution by a popular vote. "Russia has joined the club of revolutionary democracies, and this cannot be overlooked in the process of discussions", Kostikov said. He also pointed out that "the role played by the great powers in the world" will continue to enhance". Kostikov recalled that hopes for stabilization after the end of the Cold War failed to materialize in some parts of the world, including Yugoslavia, transcaucasus, and Latin America, and said that "the world needs a strong new order, and Russia will play its role of a great power in it". Kostikov said Clinton and Yeltsin touched upon relations between president and legislature. Yeltsin recounted the latest developments in Russia following the December parliamentary elections. The two presidents also touched on the Brussels meeting of the NATO member states. Clinton set forth the key points of his Partnership for Peace initiative. "Russia does not yet know much about this initiative, and its full meaning has yet to be understood, but in any case the formula sounds attractive and gives food for thought," he said. Clinton also touched upon the proposed extension of NATO. Both presidents said they understood the need and had the desire to work towards eliminating all lines of division in Europe. The two presidents also considered ways of implementing the accords reached at the G-7 meeting in Tokyo. Clinton-Yeltsin discussions will continue on Friday after the early-morning trilateral summit in which Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk will take part.
