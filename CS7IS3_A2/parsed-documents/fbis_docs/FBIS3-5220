FBIS3-5220 "dreas044_d_94010" FBIS-EAS-94-044 Document Type:Daily Report 7 Mar 1994 South Korea Unification Minister on 9 Mar N-S Contact SK0503005694 Seoul YONHAP in English 0039 GMT 5 Mar 94 SK0503005694 Seoul YONHAP Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Tokyo, March 5 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Deputy Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok voiced confidence Saturday that North Korea would eventually agree to exchange special envoys, possibly before the Pyongyang-Washington high-level meeting on March 21, because it knows the exchange is a must for the talks with the United States. In an interview with Japan's YOMIURI SHIMBUN, Yi, concurrently national unification board minister, said the Seoul-Pyongyang summit proposed by President Kim Yong-sam is possible anytime once the exchange is realized, hinting that South Korea is making necessary preparations. If North Korea does not meet one of the prerequisites to a third-level meeting set by the United States -- full implementation of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections and an inter-Korean exchange of special envoys -- it will have difficulty realizing the March 21 talks in Geneva, Yi said. Seoul and Washington have agreed to put off the March 21 meeting if Pyongyang fails to meet the two conditions, he added. "It is hard to predict the North's attitude," Yi said, commenting on the collapse of inter-Korean working-level dialogue on Thursday. "But we expect great progress on March 9," he said. South and North Korea, without attaining tangible results on Thursday, agreed in principle to the envoy exchange and to meet next week for further discussions. He reiterated that Seoul wants to see visits by president-designated envoys from each side take place before March 21.
