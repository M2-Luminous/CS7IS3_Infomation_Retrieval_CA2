The fund's presidium has named First Deputy Privatisation Minister Roman Ceska the new chairman. Jezek's official reason was the presumed legal incompatibility of the positions of FNM chairman and chairman of the parliamentary Budget Committee, he said. Jezek told CTK that he decided to resign "because of untiring attempts on the part of some FNM Presidium members, particularly its chairman (Jiri Skalicky)" to get him to step down, and also "in the interest of restoring normal working conditions at the National Property Fund," which have recently been seriously disrupted by "continuous attacks" on his person. He added that his decision had also been influenced by the fact that a proposal for a law on conflicts of interests has been submitted to parliament under which, Jezek said, "I would have had to put an end to my activities in the fund in the near future anyway." The decision was facilitated also by the fact that the privatisation process is "drawing to a close," he added. The FNM Presidium today also decided to dismiss FNM Vice-Chairmen Jan Princ and Jindrich Kapoun for failure to fulfill duties towards the Presidium as members of the Executive Committee, Skalicky reported. Presidium members agreed that in order to carry out approved privatisation projects more efficiently, the original system of close cooperation between the fund and the Privatisation Ministry should be reinstated, he continued. The Presidium asked the new chairman to propose candidates to replace the dismissed members of the Executive Committee at the next Presidium session. Karel Ledvinka, vice-chairman of the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA), told CTK that ODA had unanimously approved two months ago a statement in which they recommended to Jezek that if he was forced to make a decision "he should give priority to his parliamentary mandate." ODA leaders believe that "with his wisdom and range of knowledge (Jezek) would be most valuable as chairman of the Budget Committee -- one of the most important parliamentary committees," Ledvinka said. He added that the final decision, however, rested entirely with Jezek alone.
