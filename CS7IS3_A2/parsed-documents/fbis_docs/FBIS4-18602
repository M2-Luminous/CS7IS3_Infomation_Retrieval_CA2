Most analyses, however, also conceded the dangers of drawing conclusions about national politics based on local electoral results. High Turnout Welcomed Several commentators pointed to the high voter turnout in Schleswig- Holstein as a sign that concern over widespread popular alienation from politics was misplaced. About 70.4 percent of eligible voters went to the polls--up slightly from 69.4 percent during the last local elections in 1990--and turnout for the previous week's Lower Saxon state elections was at a similar level. Peter Heinacher, writing in the 22 March HANDELSBLATT, called the high turnout "the most apparent and, at the same time, most reassuring" result of the Schleswig-Holstein elections. A 22 March FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE commentary agreed, pointing out that there was "no sign of the weariness with voting" which had been predicted, and an article in the same day's TAGESZEITUNG virtually repeated this theme, noting that "the Germans apparently do not intend, after all, to tire of voting." `Warning' to Old Parties Seen Less reassuringly, however, Herbert Kremp opined in the 22 March DIE WELT that while "there is no frustration with politics...there is massive frustration with the established parties." All three traditional parties lost ground statewide compared to 1990, with the Social Democratic Party (SPD) declining from 42.9 to about 39.5 percent, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) slipping from 41.3 to around 37.5 percent, and the Free Democratic Party (FDP) dropping from 6.1 to about 4.4 percent. Several commentators remarked on this development, contrasting it with the improved performance of the Greens (up from 6.0 to 10.3 percent), the Danish-minority Southern Schleswig Voters' Association (up from 1.6 to 2.6 percent) and the state's characteristic Independent Voters' Associations (up from 1.2 to around 3.9 percent). Commentaries or related articles in the 22 March editions of the SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG, HANDELSBLATT, and DIE WELT described these results as a "warning" (Denkzettel) to the traditional parties, although the 22 March FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE commentary was more cautious, arguing only that such results could signal "a slight turn away" from the "emphatically political parties." `Red-Green Signals' Detected Some commentators highlighted the gains by the Greens--who had also increased their share of the vote in Lower Saxony--and pointed to them as a sign that an SPD-Green coalition at the federal level was a real possibility. The FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE commentary adopted the relatively understated view that the Greens had succeeded in increasing their vote to the "normal" level. Possibly referring to the perceived radicalism of the Greens' national platform, the commentator remarked that "apparently, a certain category of voter...cannot be prevented from voting for the Greens." Kremp, in the 22 March DIE WELT, saw a more dynamic trend with national implications, describing the Greens' progress as a "breakthrough" which is "taking place on a broad front in Germany," and specifically citing "red-green earnestness" as one clear lesson from the Schleswig-Holstein vote. Heinacher, however, drew the most explicit conclusions for the election's impact on the federal campaign. "After the Greens' successes in Lower Saxony and Schleswig Holstein," he wrote in his 22 March HANDELSBLATT commentary, "Red-green signals are going out from the far north toward Bonn." Interpretive Risks Noted Most analyses, however, also pointed to the uncertainties involved in divining national trends from the results of local elections. "Regional particularities mix with countrywide trends," noted the SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG commentator, diminishing the vote's importance as a predictor of state or federal elections. Kremp expressed similar reservations in DIE WELT, describing any individual's vote as a combination of his "impressions of the chancellor, the opposition, and [each party's] local performance." A commentary in the 25 March DIE ZEIT went a step further, criticizing efforts to force a national interpretation on an essentially local event, "if necessary with a crowbar." Seeing little connection between local elections and national political trends, the DIE ZEIT analysis concluded with the admonition that "a local election is a local election is a local election."
