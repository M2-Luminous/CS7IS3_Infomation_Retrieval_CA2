Yesterday, the minister was answering questions from reporters during the "Joint Effort 1994" maneuver, a staff exercise in which a complete division is deployed to impose and enforce peace on behalf of the United Nations. Minister Delcroix said "that a political consensus is emerging in favor of once again increasing funding for the Army in the following legislative session." He urges less rapid participation in UN operations, but said that such participation should be better prepared and equipped with more resources. Under the leadership of Lieutenant General Francis Briquemont, the former UN commander in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Army is holding a staff exercise through today in Leopoldsburg [Belgium]. In such exercises, no units are deployed on the ground but realistic procedures are followed. The goal of the exercise is peace enforcement, restoring peace through the potential deployment of all possible means.
