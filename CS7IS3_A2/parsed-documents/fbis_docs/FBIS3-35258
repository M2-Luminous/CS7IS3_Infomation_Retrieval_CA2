Palestinian sources have confirmed to AL-HAYAH that Hamas did not respond to the call for an extraordinary meeting after the Cairo agreement was signed. The call was made in the name of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP], the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP], the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front [PPSF], and the Palestine Liberation Front [PLF]. They said that not holding the meeting would be "a violation of the APF's bylaws which commit members to attend any meeting called for by at least four factions." The sources added that the four factions submitted a plan for the reactivation of the role of the opposition alliance, the aim of which was to foil the "Gaza-Jericho" agreement. They revealed that the plan includes the following four points: 1. Formation of a national and Islamic command for the intifadah inside the occupied territory. Some parties have reservations about the formation of such a command for security reasons related to the difficulty of coordination among the military wings of the factions. The plan urges parctical steps because of the Cairo security agreement which "is harmful to the security of the factions in the occupied territory." 2. A call for people's conferences. This issue has not been resolved because while the PLO factions want an organizational role that would produce leaderships from the Palestinian diaspora and the occupied territory, Hamas is opposed to such conferences or to restriction of the task to just "mobilization," and it is suspicious of such conferences. PPSF sources have told AL-HAYAH: "Even if Hamas rejected the initiation of such conferences, we would begin work" along with the other three factions. 3. Initiation of political and informational steps as well as contacts with the leaders of the Arab and Islamic states with the aim of strengthening the position against the agreement. 4. Discussion of some APF organizational issues. PPSF sources said: "We will accept no obstructionist formula. There must be effective moves." The same sources said that the Israeli forces recently arrested a number of military activitists from the organizations opposed to the "Gaza-Jericho" agreement. PPSF Secretary General Khalid 'Abd-al-Majid was yesterday informed of the arrest of the PPSF's military commander in Gaza. He sees the "arrest campaign as an initial result of the Cairo agreement." Meanwhile, sources of the PFLP, which is led by George Habash, have denied any PFLP intention to move to the occupied territory and also denied discharging some of its cadres. They told AL-HAYAH that the PFLP "differentiates between moving the decisionmaking to the occupied territory and moving its cadres. Although we are passing through a financial crisis, it clings to every member of its cadres. The magazine AL-HADAF (the PFLP's mouthpiece) still appears weekly."
