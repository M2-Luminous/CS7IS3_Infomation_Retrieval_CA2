FBIS4-52724 "dreas093_c_94013" FBIS-EAS-94-093 Daily Report 11 May 1994 North Korea Koreans in Russia Oppose Repatriation to ROK Koreans in Russia Oppose Repatriation to ROK SK1305024794 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 2100 GMT 11 May 94 SK1305024794 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 2100 GMT 11 May 94 Korean BFN [Text] The organization of Korean residents in Russia sent a letter of protest to the Japanese Consulate General and the puppet Consulate General in Russia condemning the maneuvers of the nation-selling, treacherous clique and the Japanese reactionaries to lure Korean compatriots residing in Sakhalin Oblast into South Korea. The letter of protest revealed and denounced the fact that in mid-January, the South Korean puppet authorities waged a negotiation commotion with the Japanese Government in a bid to lure Korean compatriots in Sakhalin into South Korea and kicked up a commotion of grasping those who have submitted an application for their repatriation to South Korea for permanent residence under the name of an on-the-spot, fact-finding team. The letter indicated: The South Korean authorities's attempt to settle the issue on the Korean compatriots residing in Sakhalin in return for receiving small monetary compensation from the criminals in disregard of its political nature is a criminal act which cannot be tolerated in light of our nation's dignity and interests. This is not only an insult to the 70 million fellow countrymen and a mockery to the nation, but is also a vicious, brigandish act of alienating overseas compatriots from the government of the Republic and, furthermore, of completely trampling the lofty ideal and dream of people who aspire a reunified fatherland and are devoting themselves to it. In the name of Korean residents in Russia, the organization of Korean compatriots residing in Russia bitterly condemns the South Korean authorities' act of attempting to replace the nation's dignity and interests with small monetary compensation, and brands the act as a shameless political swindle and fraudulence to cheat and mock at our compatriots. Noting that, under the mask of humanitarianism, the South Korean puppet authorities are hellbent on conducting propaganda to cheat the Korean compatriots in Sakhalin because they aim heinously to lure them into building an anti-Republic lot in the Far East region, and to perpetuate the country's division in order to block the struggle of compatriots for national reunification by inspiring the consciousness of discord and confrontation within the nation, the letter of protest continued: The Korean compatriots residing in Russia sternly declare its opposition to and rejection of the heinous and cunning maneuvers of the South Korean authorities and the Japanese authorities to calculate, to the end, all crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists in the past, and not to tolerate the South Korean authorities' maneuvers to sell out the nation's interests and dignity by fluttering and submitting to Japan. The South Korean authorities should immediately renounce the antinational and antireunification maneuvers of settling the issue of Korean compatriots residing in the former Soviet Union region and the Sakhalin Oblast with mere monetary compensation in collusion with the Japanese Government. The Japanese authorities should apologize before all of the Korean people for all the criminal acts that they committed against our people in the past, and fully compensate for them and should no longer commit acts hindering the independent reunification of Korea. The South Korean authorities and the Japanese authorities should know that if they continue to commit a rash and reckless act without giving heed to the serious warning of the Government of the Republic and the 70 millions of fellow countrymen to cling to the base plot to move Korean compatriots in Sakhalin to South Korea they will not be able to escape the responsibility for the crime of having insulted and abused the lofty ideal of humanitarianism, will suffer greater disgrace and defeat before the world, and will receive the justice of history.
