Petrella was referring to the document the U.S. Government submits to Congress with a detailed report on each country, and he believes that it "must be taken into account," although he made it clear that "no institutional aspect has been criticized" because "our country has made notable progress that is noticeable in the management of the OAS' Human Rights Commission." In the chapter that refers to Argentina, the document published today by a newspaper alludes to police executions, torture, and disappearances, and it puts in doubt the independent functioning of the judicial branch. Petrella added that "there are several categories within the mechanism of human rights," and he stressed: "Argentina is in a good position." Regarding the chapter that indicates that the Executive Branch puts pressure on the Judicial Branch, the vice minister explained that the report "takes up the opinion of the media," and he emphasized that "this type of opinion did not find an echo within the Inter-American Human Rights Commission." He also admitted that "without having fully read the report," in Argentina "there are aspects that can be improved," although he highlighted the fact that "if the U.S. Congress has to decide on something related to our country, it will not necessarily take the report into account." "Regarding human rights, the fact is that since 1983, Argentina's record has been a good one because our country is not even mentioned in the Inter-American Human Rights Commission report," the vice minister said.
