The government has stressed that the package is aimed at reducing "fully and significantly Japan's current account surplus in the medium term" through macroeconomic measures and to achieve a "robust and steady economic growth driven by domestic demand in the medium term." The government, however, has said that from now on, it would study concrete action programs and measures to achieve those goals. The package has again proven the government's work always focuses on quantity. At the February Japan-U.S. summit talks, the Japanese side said "no" to the U.S. demand for setting so-called numerical targets, and it was the right answer to the demand. What is important, however, is whether the Japanese Government has prepared an alternative proposal to the "no" to the U.S. demand. Looking at the package, it is regrettable that we have no choice but to conclude that the Japanese Government has not yet prepared such an alternative proposal. There is a worrisome point in the "results-oriented trade policy" adopted by the U.S. Government and the policy method adopted by it to achieve the policy. Japan is now in a stage where it must take seriously the "results-oriented trade policy." Japan's external surplus is conspicuous and too huge. If Japan's external surplus is left uncut, it may spread the trend of protectionist trade and managed trade all around the world. Japan's external imbalance is not confined to the bilateral issue between Japan and the United States, but is becoming a factor of instability in the world economic system. In other words, Japan can no longer continue its external imbalance. Hence, achieving good trade results has become a priority task for Japan itself. It is important for Japan to map out a package of concrete measures to correct its external imbalance from this point of view. If Japan maps out a package simply as a concessionary response to external pressure, it may be the wrong policy, causing a delay in the correction of Japan's external imbalance. In the course of looking for a way to correct Japan's external imbalance, the Japanese market will be disrupted, the yen will appreciate further beyond Japan's industrial capabilities, and Japanese enterprises will move more of their production overseas. If Japan's economic and industrial structures remain unchanged, this would hollow out Japan's economy. What the government must do when it announces specific policies is to have an awareness of those issues and shape a reasonable strategy on the basis of its awareness. What is important is the compatibility of Japanese and U.S. macroeconomic policies. As the United States has recognized for a long time, the current account imbalance between the two countries has come from macroeconomic factors. A reversal in the growth rate between Japan and the United States will impede the correction of the imbalance for the time being. The lack of savings in the United States is a serious issue. U.S. measures to reduce the federal budget deficit are certainly generating the desired effect, and the ratio of the federal budget deficit to the GNP has begun to fall. Nonetheless, the savings rate in the U.S. private sector has continued to drop. It would be meaningless if financial revenue and expenditure are not assessed in relation to domestic savings. No individual microeconomic measure is found in the package. What we can find in connection with microeconomic measures is the expression "attempts will be made to further improve" and "plans will be drawn up." As for deregulation, the government has left it to a report to be compiled by the Administrative Reform Promotion Headquarters in late June. No alternative proposal is found anywhere in the package to "no" to the U.S. demand.
