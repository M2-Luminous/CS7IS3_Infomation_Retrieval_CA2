On the afternoon of 18 April, North Korean authorities dispatched two agents, who seemed to be secret service men, near the Foreign Ministry resident's registration office for foreigners in Moscow. It seems that they are preventing North Korean escapees from approaching this area. These North Korean agents, clad in civilian clothes, were hanging around (Pocropka) Street, where the resident's registration office for foreigners is located, in twos and threes. They hastily disappeared when our reporter approached them. It was confirmed that they were also sitting around the North Korean Government-run restaurant--Pyongyang Restaurant--located near the resident's registration office for foreigners. It was learned that they took turns watching over this whole area during office hours. This was revealed when a certain Mr. Kim, a logger who escaped from a logging camp, reported to the ROK Embassy in Russia that the agents prevented him from approaching the resident's registration office for foreigners so he could officially apply for a resident permit with the Russian authorities on 18 April. It was learned that the Russian authorities are planning to grant residency to the North Korean escapees who apply for a resident permit through the resident's registration office for foreigners. Once they have this permit, the North Korean escapees will be able to enter the ROK after being issued a traveler's certificate. An ROK Embassy official in Russia revealed on 19 April: "If the North Korean authorities continue to interfere with this matter, it will be in reality difficult for the North Korean escapees to apply for a resident's permit." He also revealed that another emergency measure should be taken for the benefit of the North Korean escapees as soon as possible.
