If the president were to ask you now whether you managed to come up with something, what would you tell him? [Falandysz] I would tell him that for now, I know of no such way. But if the coalition manages to change the political system--that is, if it takes the right to influence the government's composition away from the president--one should consider whether the Small Constitution does not allow for a dissolution of parliament. I think that the coalition, while submitting a motion for an amendment to the Small Constitution, considered the possibility of new parliamentary and presidential elections. [Kublik] Why would the coalition think that? [Falandysz] I hope that serious politicians are aware that a change in the political system should result in new elections. I do not even rule out the possibility that the Sejm itself will come to the conclusion that it has changed the political system and then the Sejm will dissolve itself. [Kublik] I hope you do not really mean that. After all, your boss has announced that he is ready to take an extralegal measure, even if he were to face the Tribunal of State for that. The Small Constitution allows for the possibility of dissolving the Sejm in three situations only: if the Sejm does not adopt a budget in the prescribed time period, if it adopts a no-confidence vote against the government while failing to appoint a prime minister, or if the Sejm fails to nominate a new government. None of the above situations apply to what we have right now. [Falandysz] One cannot rule out anything in politics. [Kublik] Some people fear that the president, while ignoring legal provisions, will write a "Consider yourself dismissed" letter to the prime minister. This is how he recalled Henryk Wujec in the past, from the post of secretary of the Citizens Committee, and, most recently, this is how he recalled Marek Markiewicz, chief of the National Radio and Television Broadcasting Council. [Falandysz] There is no analogy there, but I cannot rule out such a situation. One would have to think more about it. [Kublik] But what do you want to think about when the Constitution does not provide that the president is empowered to dismiss the prime minister? [Falandysz] But one cannot exclude the possibility that, if the president withdraws his support for the prime minister, the latter would offer his resignation and then one would have to begin appointing a new government. [Kublik] Why would the prime minister want to resign? After all, he enjoys support in the Sejm of almost 300 Sejm deputies for the coalition. [Falandysz] Imagine a prime minister who does not enjoy the support of the head of state. How could he represent Poland abroad? Theoretically, the prime minister could be dismissed and a new government formed. The president could make that difficult. [Kublik] In what way? [Falandysz] The Small Constitution provides that the president has a final say in appointing a government, even if the government was elected by the Sejm. But the president also has the possibility of not appointing such a cabinet. [Kublik] Why? After all, appointing a cabinet is just a formality because the Sejm has voted it through, anyway. [Falandysz] If one were to interpret the Constitution in a presidential-parliamentary way, there is the possibility of the president not appointing a government. The Small Constitution clearly provides: "in case the Council of Ministers is not appointed..." So that means that the president does not have to make the appointment. And, if there is no government formed, the president could dissolve parliament. Do you know that there are countries where the president is always empowered to dissolve parliament? Such a possibility is contained in the Belweder's constitutional draft. [Kublik] Is the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] the Belweder's main enemy right now? It does not look like Walesa is attacking the Polish Peasant Party [PSL]. [Falandysz] Let me put in another way: It is not the PSL that is behind all of the antipresidential measures. It is the SLD that is antipresidential. From the very beginning, SLD men have wanted to reduce presidential powers. And then there were their attempts, aimed at the three Belweder ministries. Walesa has for years fought the kind of regime that is currently being promoted by what is today the SLD, where the United Peasant Accord was just a vassal. And this is the way it continues to be. I once said that the president treats Pawlak as his younger brother. But one can still have arguments, even with one's younger brother. [Kublik] The SLD accuses Walesa of striving for dictatorship. [Falandysz] That is rubbish. All the president does is maintain his constitutional powers. They find it extremely hard to come to terms with the fact that he, for instance, makes decisions on personnel issues in the Defense, Internal Affairs, and Foreign Affairs Ministries. They are used to a monopoly--they have to have everything: the finance minister, the ownership transformations minister, the police, the Army, foreign affairs, and the chief customs official. [Kublik] Will the president meet the SLD Sejm Deputies Club at Kwasniewski's invitation? [Falandysz] I am not sure it is a good idea for the president to hold meetings with political parties. The Constitution provides for another possibility: Article 38 states that "regarding issues of special importance to the state, the president is empowered to call sessions of the Council of Ministers and to chair them." I think that would be a more appropriate forum for a constructive debate on the current situation.
