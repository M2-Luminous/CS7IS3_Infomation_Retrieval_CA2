This happened despite the efforts to stop the train by activists of the international Greenpeace organization. The local Greens are also vigorously protesting against the importation of foreign nuclear waste to the southern Urals. Activists of the Movement for Nuclear Safety have mounted a picket at the oblast administration headquarters and are collecting signatures to prevent Chelyabinsk Oblast from being turned into a world nuclear waste ground. Meanwhile the train carrying spent nuclear fuel from Finland has been unloaded and the said material is now in one of the Mayak Chemical Combine's plants. Uranium will be extracted from this material and returned to the nuclear power industry; the Ministry of Atomic Energy will receive a substantial sum of money in dollars; and by all accounts the waste will remain, as ever, in Chelyabinsk Oblast, whose territory has long since been declared an ecological disaster zone.
