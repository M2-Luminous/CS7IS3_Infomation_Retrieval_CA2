The Democratic Party has never doubted for a minute that the imperial spirit from the East would be abandoned soon and easily, but it kept hoping that despite the numerous hardships of the current times the Romanians living in Bessarabia would prove capable of turning to good account the advantages offered by the new international situation to definitely unchain themselves and return, in one form or other, to the cultural, economic, and political space of their historic homeland. Unfortunately, the decision passed by the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova runs counter to the course of history and can gravely and dramatically delay the accomplishment of the Romanian national ideal of reunification. At the same time we reject with indignation all assertions that the post-December [1989] Romania never granted assistance to the Republic of Moldova. At least during the Roman and Stolojan governments, the assistance that was granted was continuous and substantial, it came from all our hearts, despite the fact that it meant a significant sacrifice for the population of our country. However, it is also true that a certain feeling of having been abandoned, which is experienced by the Romanians in Bessarabia, is the fault of the current government, as well as Romania's Presidency, which failed to use the favorable circumstances created after the 1989 December revolution and to show the evidence of patriotic courage and political resoluteness that would have been needed for the reunification of the country. We are certain that the will of the Romanians living on both banks of the Prut River to be together remains intact, as this guarantees that sooner or later the country that was violently torn away from us and submitted to dictatorship will be a WHOLE [preceding word published in capitals] again, to the benefit of the prosperity of the Romanian nation and stability in Europe.
