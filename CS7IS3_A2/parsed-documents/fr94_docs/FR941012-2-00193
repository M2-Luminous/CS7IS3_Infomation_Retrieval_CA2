FR941012-2-00193 FR941012-2-00117 Quarterly evaluation will be conducted of both the On-Line Grantee Program and the EGMM Pilot Program. Also during fiscal year 1995 FTA will implement the annual certifications and assurances for all grantees in which one signature will replace the continued validity statement and separate certifications and assurances. All EGMM grantee participants and On-Line Grantee participants on a case-by-case basis will be able to provide these certifications electronically. In preparation of the EGMM initiative, FTA has already issued a Master Agreement that replaces Part I and portions of Part II of the current FTA grant agreement. Upon the completion of the EGMM Pilot Program of fiscal year 1995, FTA intends to expand the EGMM Program to include additional grantee agencies during fiscal year 1996. FTA also has several activities under consideration to expand the functional content of EGMM. The kinds of activities under consideration include a mechanism to facilitate electronic statewide transportation improvement programs, electronic unified planning work programs, and an electronic library. The FTA would like your comments and suggestions on additional areas FTA could facilitate electronic interface to better serve our customers. Please write your regional office with your suggestions on the FTA EGMM Pilot Program and On-Line Grantee Program. XV. Quartley Approval of Grants The FTA has established a quarterly approval and release cycle for processing grants. All Urbanized Area Formula, Nonurbanized Area Formula, Elderly and Persons with Disabilities, Capital, Metropolitan Planning, State Planning and Research, and Title 23 Interstate Substitute Transit grants are processed on a quarterly basis. This includes Urbanized Area Formula, Nonurbanized Area Formula, or Elderly and Persons with Disabilities grants using STP or CMAQ funds. If completed applications are submitted to the appropriate FTA Regional Office no later than the first business day of the quarter, FTA will award grants by the last business day of the quarter. In order to expedite the grant approval process within the quarterly approval structure, grants which are complete and have received the required Labor Protection Certification may be approved before the end of the quarter. Applications for the first quarter should be submitted to the FTA Regional Office within five business days of this Notice. The first-quarter grants will be released on or before December 30, 1994. There are only two factors which would delay FTA's approval of the project beyond the end of a quarter. First is a failure by DOL to issue a Labor Protection Certification where such certification is a prerequisite to a grant approval, and second is the failure of FHWA to actually transfer flexible funds. For an application to be considered complete, all required activities such as inclusion of the project in a locally approved Transportation Improvement Program (TIP), a Federally approved State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP), intergovernmental reviews, environmental reviews, all applicable civil rights, anti-drug, and clean air requirements, and submission of all requisite certifications and documentation must be completed. The application must be in approvable form with all required documentation and submissions on hand, except for the Labor Protection Certification which is issued by DOL. Incomplete applications will not be processed, but if the missing components are supplied, will be considered in the next quarter. It is the policy of FTA to expedite grant application reviews and speed program delivery by reducing the number of grant applications. To this end, FTA strongly encourages grant applicants to submit only one application per fiscal year for each formula program. The single application should contain the fiscal year's capital (including flexible funds), planning and operating elements. XV. Grant Application Procedures All applications for FTA funds should be submitted to the appropriate FTA Regional Office. Formula grant applications should be prepared in conformance with the following FTA Circulars: Urbanized Area Formula_C9030.1A, September 18, 1987; Nonurbanized Area Formula_C9040.1C, November 3, 1992; and Elderly and Persons with Disabilities_C9070.1C, December 23, 1992. Applications for STP ``flexible'' fund grants should be prepared in the same manner as the apportioned funds under the Urbanized Area Formula, Nonurbanized Area Formula, or Elderly and Persons with Disabilities Programs. Guidance on preparation of applications for Capital, Metropolitan Planning, State Planning and Research, and Title 23 funds may be obtained from each FTA Regional Office. Copies of circulars are also available from Regional Offices. Issued on: October 5, 1994. Gordon J. Linton, Administrator.
