['Arafat] I regret to say that the decisions are hollow and weak compared to the enormity and seriousness of the crime and the massacre at the Ibrahimi Mosque. The Israeli Government barely scratched the surface of the problem. It failed to get to the bottom of the problem. It said nothing about the collusion of units from the Israeli military. There is proof that Israeli military units provided cover for the withdrawal of the band that committed the crime. They even opened fire on people and worshipers. Eight martyrs and more than 30 wounded fell to military gunfire. I am here quoting Israel radio. I regret to say that the decisions are far too weak in comparison to the crime. We would have wished that the Israeli Government had taken deterrent action against these criminals. I am sorry to tell you that the Israeli Government is too (?weak) to do that. If this tells us anything, it is that the Israeli Government does not want to lay clear foundations for peace. From the moment we began the negotiations, they have been talking intermittently about security for the settlements and settlers. What about security for the Palestinians, our children, women, and masses? What about security for our Islamic and Christian holy places? Let's not forget the al- Aqsa Mosque massacre that was carried out by Israeli military and security forces a few years ago. And now a massacre committed by armed settlers in which Israeli military men were also involved. Yesterday, we saw television pictures of Israeli military patrols [words indistinct] by patrols of armed settlers. I will tell them this: Who do you think you are fooling with these decisions? In any case, I never expected this government to come up with more than that. [Kurayshan] But don't you think that disarming so-called extremists around Hebron and its vicinity may mark the first of more stringent measures in the future? ['Arafat] There are entire settlements run by these extremists. I would like to remind Rabin of his reference to political settlements run by political organizations. These are his words and not mine. Let him dismantle these political settlements if he is serious and does want peace. If the idea behind the decisions is to mollify angry world opinion, then they will not make a real difference. There is much more than that at stake. They must know that our blood is not water and that it will not be spilled in vain. [Kurayshan] Mr. Chairman: Moreover, it was announced today that the occupied territories will be closed. ['Arafat, interrupting] Was it only today? What about yesterday? In other words, the punishment is not directed against the armed settlers but against the Palestinian people. Yesterday and today, confrontations erupted in Rafah, Khan Yunus, Gaza, Hebron, Bethlehem, Jerusalem, Jericho, Ramallah, Nabulus, Tulkarm, Janin, Qalqilyah; namely, throughout the country. The decision made by the Israeli army and government was to escalate the situation against the Palestinian people. The Israelis say that the four people whom they want to arrest could not been arrested because they were holding a conference. Who are they deceiving? However, everyone should know that this will not undermine our people's determination, will, and resolve. We are a people who offered many martyrs. We are the guards of these holy lands and places. As a saying by Prophet Muhammad goes: A group of my nation is still preserving the religion, confronting their enemy, and is not harmed by its enemies. This group will triumph with God's help. Some people asked the prophet: Where is and what is this group? The prophet answered: It is in Jerusalem and around it, and it will be in a state of mobilization until the day of judgment. This is thus a divine message for this people, the guards of these holy places. [Kurayshan] Mr. Chairman: There is also hesitation on the level of the UN Security Council about passing a resolution in this regard. How do you view this hesitation? ['Arafat] Regrettably, the U.S. Administration tried to prevent the convening of a session. However, we, along with the Arab, Islamic, and nonaligned groups as well as our friends in Europe and the world, insisted that a session should be held. We submitted a draft resolution which, first and foremost, provides for international protection for our people, masses, children, and women. All should know that these settlements are illegal, according to several Security Council and UN resolutions. They are also time bombs and constitute not only obstacles to peace but also walls and mines against the peace process. I regret to say that we do not agree on the U.S. draft resolution, and that we insisted on the draft resolution submitted by the Arab group. There is also a French draft resolution, which is not a bad one. However, it is sad that the U.S. draft resolution did not mention the Ibrahimi Mosque by name. Instead, it mentioned the Ibrahimi Mosque by its Israeli name. This mosque was built during the Umayyad times in the seventh century. [Kurayshan] Originally, it was decided that the issue of the settlements should be postponed until the final status of the occupied territory is discussed. Do you believe what has happened requires discussing this issue now before the final status is reached? ['Arafat] They say they want to take the weapons from the extremists. But there are settlements in their names. From Qiryat Arba' to Baruk [Goldstein] and so on, and so on. They know them. More than once, Rabin said there are political settlements which belong to political organizations. Let us see what measures he will take. [Kurayshan] You invited the negotiating Palestinian teams and you will meet in Tunis... ['Arafat, interrupting] Here they are. Sa'ib ['Urayqat] has just arrived; my brother Nabil [Sha'th] has just arrived; my brother Abu-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'] arrived yesterday. Today the Palestinian leadership will hold a session to evaluate the situation. [Kurayshan] What is expected in light of the Israeli Government's decisions? ['Arafat] I really do not like to give details before this issue is thrashed out in details and in all its aspects with the Palestinian leadership and in the presence of my brothers the delegations heads. [Kurayshan] What is the chance of responding to U.S. President Bill Clinton's invitation to go to Washington, in light of all that has happened. ['Arafat] We thank President Clinton because of this invitation, which shows his interest. However, before this, we want to know which way we are heading. Are we going to take pictures, as happened last September? Following this, Rabin said there are no sacred dates. When we spoke of an international presence, he said there are no sacred points? This in effect means that there is no sacred agreement. Before the Israeli Government answers us on all these things and before we know the results of the Security Council meeting, we cannot give answers. Let it be known, we will not allow the continued killing of our people. Our blood will not be in vain. We are all potential martyrs in defense of these sacred places. We are potential martyrs and pioneers for our Arab and Islamic nations. [Kurayshan] In conclusion, how do you view the remainder of the march in the peace process, especially since you had been on the verge of tackling all the existing differences, as has been reported. Now after the massacre, and after it has become clear... ['Arafat, interrupting] It has become clear that in the Israeli Army there are officers, forces, and commanders who oppose the peace process. They are conniving with the settlers and are forming a bloc [preceding word in English] to carry out these massacres. Regrettably, this is what has transpired.
