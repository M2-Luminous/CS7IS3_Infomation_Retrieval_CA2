Valeriy Eksuzian, general director of "Aeroflot's" affiliate company, "Russian Airlines," which operates the five aircraft, has told INTERFAX that "unless the government reaffirms its guarantees of 1991, the aircraft will have to be returned to a consortium of West European banks which is currently their owner." The Russian Federation Government decree of 10 March 1994 "On Approving Import Customs Duty Rates" calls for a 50-percent import tariff on aircraft. At the same time, the five A310-300 were leased upon government authorization in 1991, and the leasing contract envisioned that the aircraft would be exempt from customs duties and value added tax. According to the "Russian Airlines" company, any delays in or failure to make leasing payments will result in the Western partners' immediate move to ground the jumbo jets. "This will result in our losing the international flights market worth $100 million, which we are still being able to keep by providing services in line with international standards with the help of Airbus Industrie's aircraft," Yuriy Korenevskiy, Russian Federation deputy transport minister, said. In his words, "Aeroflot" will have to forgo the leasing of a new batch of four Boeing-767's. The total value of the five A310-300's is $350 million. Leasing payments in 1993 amounted to $49 million. In 1993, the A310-300's carried 350,792 passengers and around 5,500 tonnes of cargo.
