FR941130-0-00035 FR941130-0-00003 Shareholder approval is required prior to implementation of MRPs or stock option plans within the first year of conversion. In response to the comments and mindful that a uniform meeting time may be justifiable for the reasons cited by the commenters, the timing aspect in the interim final rule is being revised to allow approval at any duly called meeting of shareholders, either annual or special, to be held no earlier than six months after completion of the conversion. The OTS believes a six-month ``cooling off'' period will give the marketplace sufficient time to digest the financial data and the shareholders sufficient time to become familiar with the finances and operations of the converted association in order to make an informed investment decision in considering whether to vote to adopt such plans. The interim final rule did not specify the vesting schedule of the management stock benefit and stock option plans. As a matter of policy under both the conversion regulations and the safety and soundness authority governing management compensation, the OTS has generally required such plans to vest beginning one year from the date the plans are approved by shareholders, and at a rate not in excess of 20% a year. A provision has been added to the final rule codifying these policies. Also, in furtherance of the foregoing policy, an additional provision in the final rule generally prohibits accelerated vesting except in the case of disability or death. The OTS agrees with the commenters that savings associations should be given flexibility to obtain a reasonable and appropriate number of shares to fund stock plans through open market purchases or through authorized but unissued shares. In funding these plans, the board of directors and the compensation committees are reminded of their fiduciary duties to the association or holding company, its shareholders and the association's members. Finally, the interim final rule required that management and stock option plans be subject to approval of the appropriate OTS Regional Director prior to plan implementation. The final rule removes the requirement for OTS Regional Director approval in advance of a stockholder vote and implementation. The final rule provides that management stock benefit plans and stock option plans comply with all of the regulatory requirements. Disclosure in all proxy and related material distributed to the shareholders shall indicate that the plans in no way have been approved or endorsed by the OTS, and no written or oral representation to the contrary shall be made by the association, its management, employees or professional advisors. The final rule also adds the requirement that subsequent to shareholder approval of the plans, the association will be required to file with the OTS a copy of the plans approved by shareholders and written certification that the plans approved by shareholders are the same plans submitted to the OTS in the proxy materials. G. Merger Conversions In the interim final rule, the OTS amended its conversion regulations to limit merger conversions to institutions that qualify for a supervisory conversion, i.e., financially-weak institutions. OTS also solicited comment as to whether merger conversions involving healthy savings associations should be permitted in the future, and if so, under what circumstances. The OTS was particularly interested in how merger conversions should be structured to avoid the safety and soundness concerns raised by such transactions that were discussed in the preamble to the interim final rule. Of approximately 43 commenters addressing merger conversions, approximately 33 expressed the view that merger conversions should be permitted for healthy thrifts. Of these 33 commenters, 13 proposed a small savings association exception, with ``small'' being defined as anywhere from $5 million to $300 million in assets. The bases for the exception were the cost of doing two transactions (a standard mutual-to-stock conversion followed by a merger transaction) in order to accomplish a merger; the business reasons (access to capital markets, choice of partner, long-term survival, technological advancement, access to a strong management team and enhancement of service to communities); and the economic necessity for market-driven consolidations to occur. Those commenters who favored authorization of merger conversions involving healthy thrifts believed that the OTS should regulate and supervise these transactions and address concerns over insider abuse, excessive management compensation and stock incentive packages. They argued that OTS could set narrow approval guidelines but should not ban or eliminate merger conversions. One commenter stated that merger conversions should be allowed on a case-by-case basis taking into account the size and strategic needs of the institution. Another commenter stated that OTS should allow submission on a test case basis so as to develop a structure that would address the issues.
