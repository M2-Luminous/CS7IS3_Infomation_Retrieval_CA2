FBIS4-4782 "dreas065_d_94015" FBIS-EAS-94-065 Daily Report 5 Apr 1994 South Korea Officials on DPRK Supreme People's Assembly Officials on DPRK Supreme People's Assembly SK0504025394 Seoul YONHAP in English 0246 GMT 5 Apr 94 SK0504025394 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, April 5 (YONHAP) -- The Supreme People's Assembly of North Korea will meet Wednesday [6 April] amid rising tensions after the United Nations Security Council issued a presidential statement urging Pyongyang to allow further inspection of its nuclear sites. The seventh meeting of the Ninth Supreme People's Assembly, a two-day affair, is likely to express its position on the council's presidential statement, South Korean Government officials said Tuesday. The North's chief constitutional organization will also issue statements on the country's nuclear and foreign policies, they said. "We expect the Supreme People's Assembly to stick to the North Korean Government's hard-line policy of rejecting further inspection of their nuclear sites rather than complying with the Security Council's warning," said an official. The prediction was based on a North Korean Foreign Ministry statement issued Monday that Pyongyang would resume "peaceful nuclear activities" if the international community continued to apply pressure. "It is not likely that Kim Il-song will take measures to transfer power to his heir-apparent Kim Chong-il during the upcoming assembly meeting," the official added. As the top constitutional body of North Korea, the Supreme People's Assembly has the authority to elect and impeach party and government officials including the state president, craft government policies and approve the state budget.
