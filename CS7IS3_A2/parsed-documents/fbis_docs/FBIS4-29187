FBIS4-29187 "dreas116_a_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-116 Daily Report 14 Jun 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Foreign Chips Capture 22 Percent of Market Foreign Chips Capture 22 Percent of Market OW1406134994 Tokyo KYODO in English 1338 GMT 14 Jun 94 OW1406134994 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- Foreign-made semiconductor chips captured more than 20 percent of the Japanese market in the January-March period, according to both Japanese and U.S. calculations, the Trade Ministry said Tuesday [14 June]. The foreign share for the reporting quarter came to 22.0 percent under a Japanese formula, a marginal drop from 22.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 1993, while the same share under a U.S. method stood unchanged at 20.7 percent. The foreign chip share for the year's first quarter remained nearly identical to that in the preceding quarter, a clear contrast from the downtrend seen in the first quarter of past years, an official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) said. A 1991 bilateral chip trade accord calls for Japan to maintain a "gradual and steady" increase in the foreign share above the 20 percent level. Both domestic chip consumption and foreign chip sales in Japan declined in the January-March period from the preceding quarter in terms of value. However, the pace of the fall for both figures, which are not available according to mutual agreement, was smaller in the latest quarter than in previous years, the official said. "The latest statistics signal that the penetration of foreign chips in the Japanese market has been on the rise," the MITI official said. Tori Sato, incoming chairman of the Electronic Industries Association of Japan's Users' Committee of Foreign Semiconductors, said in a statement that "the fact that the foreign share remained close to the level attained in the fourth quarter of 1993 indicated that both sides continue to make progress in promoting access to the Japanese semiconductor market." "We encourage foreign products to continue to work with us in promoting greater cooperation between industries, so that everyone will be able to prosper in the Japanese market," said Sato, also executive vice president of Hitachi Ltd. In Washington, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said in a statement, "the U.S. is pleased to see a market share of over 20 percent has been maintained for two quarters in a row." "The latest reading is extremely important for the fate of the ongoing Japan-U.S. trade framework talks," he said. The 1991 chip accord incorporates two different methods for calculating the foreign share in Japan. The U.S. counts only on the sales of foreign chips in the open market. The Japanese formula allows a broader measurement that includes so-called "captive" sales of U.S. companies to their Japanese subsidiaries and those by Japanese companies under foreign brand names. Based on the latest calculation, Japan and the U.S. will hold chip trade talks in Tokyo on Wednesday and Thursday. The meeting will focus on reviewing implementation of steps agreed on during the Hawaii talks in March this year, including the "design-in" cooperation program for making semiconductors from the development stage, the MITI official said.
