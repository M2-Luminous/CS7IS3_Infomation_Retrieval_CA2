[Alvarez] The Grand Front is a center-left movement. I define it as an open political alternative aimed at recovering values that the Argentine people are losing. I do not know if the fact that we propose modernizing the economy with emphasis on social aspects means that we are on the government's left. But we think Argentina must be more equitable and balanced. [LA PRENSA] Do you identify yourself with any European socialist movement? [Alvarez] I think there is a models' crisis. Marxism failed. The authoritarian socialist systems collapsed. Social democratic movements also have failed in their aim of creating more equitable societies. The idea of a fundamentalist market system also has failed. The opposite is happening; there is an increase in racism and xenophobia. Our challenge is to create a new model. This model does not have to look like any of the options currently dominating the international scene. [LA PRENSA] If you controlled the public administration, what type of model would you implement? [Alvarez] It is difficult at first to place ourselves in a different situation than the present one. We represent Argentine society's need for an efficient political force to control excesses and abuse of power. We will try to develop an alternative economic program after the election for constituent members is over. Our growth must be gradual. We must institutionalize the Grand Front as a political force first. [LA PRENSA] Is it true, as comments have it, that you are working on a mini-cabinet to eventually run for mayor? [Alvarez] I am not tied to any candidacy. I want to be part of a political project capable of becoming a government alternative. We made this clear to the Socialist Party. We proposed the name of Socialist Party followers to head our tickets in this election. However, we are going to work on city matters because the people are not going to vote for us to rule the country unless we show that we are efficient administrators of a local government. [LA PRENSA] But neither will they vote for you to administer the city unless you explain what you intend to do first. [Alvarez] Correct. We must develop a clear administration and government alternative and show that corruption in the public administration is not fortuitous. Corruption is systemic, structural, and is affecting the operation of services that are indispensable for the development of a better standard of living. For instance, the most pessimistic estimates of the black money circulating in our financial system is around $4 billion per year. [LA PRENSA] Are your remarks that stability is an important achievement and that you will maintain it, indications of the Grand Front's economic project? [Alvarez] It would be silly to deny the importance of stability. We believe that stability is undeniably beneficial for society, but we must face the problems that stability alone cannot solve. [LA PRENSA] Do you believe in privatizations? [Alvarez] We must study them on a case-by-case basis. It is an instrument that we do not reject. I do not think we can talk about a [Economy Minister Domingo] Cavallo model. There are instruments. We must analyze them one by one. We do not have ideological prejudices against the instrument of privatization. But we must always analyze privatizations case by case. For instance, we believe that the privatization of Aerolineas Argentinas was very bad because we now have a single airline and it is in foreign hands. We know we cannot reverse the process but we want to discuss efficiency, service quality, and fare structure. In sum, we agree with some privatizations and disagree with others. In the same way, we do not think it is prehistoric to discuss if the state could have efficiently administered some profitable companies, as occurs in other parts of the world. [LA PRENSA] What about the economic opening? [Alvarez] The opening process bets on Argentine companies' improved competitiveness. We propose a different opening model, making sure -- as is done by the most advanced countries in the world -- that some industries have the necessary level of competitiveness and insertion into the world. The idea is to design an economic system between the private sector and a state that guides, establishes the infrastructure, and seeks competitiveness. If we leave everything in the hands of the market's spontaneous development we may end up without production of goods with high added value. I do not think it is bad for the state to help private companies. [LA PRENSA] Could Patricio Aylwin's government be an example of your policies? [Alvarez] The Chilean model developed in stages. First, the government sought an efficient economic plan, with a not-too-dogmatic vision. There is, for instance, a Chile Fund that helps small- and medium-size companies become competitive in the world. But the system also forgot areas that remained on the sidelines and at the margin of the ideological reconversion. I do not think Argentina should wait for a new government to begin looking at the areas that were left aside.
