FR940429-0-00122 FR940429-0-00012 (2) If applicable, an explanation of the reasons for deviating from applicable provisions in State law; (3) Information that is necessary to demonstrate compliance with the review standards, including information not already collected by institutions or other State agencies; and (4) A provision that would allow an institution to provide directly to the Secretary comments of third parties regarding the State's review standards within a specified time. Several commenters requested that the Secretary clarify the proposed criterion regarding the use of statistically valid methods and procedures to obtain employment-related data through the conduct of surveys of an institution graduates. A few commenters suggested that the Secretary substitute for that requirement a provision to use ``representative sampling.'' The commenters contended that representative sampling would be a less onerous requirement, especially for smaller institutions. Discussion: The Secretary thanks the commenters for their suggestions for additional criteria for reviewing standards. The Secretary has decided not to accept the first one because it imposes an unnecessary burden on a State to include a rationale for a standard where the rationale would be self-evident from the standard. However, the Secretary will use the commenters' suggestion as a useful guideline for determining whether to disapprove a particular standard. The Secretary has decided not to adopt the second suggestion because a State could not adopt a standard that was in violation of its State law. The Secretary has decided not to adopt the third suggestion because that information is not necessary to determining whether a standard is not acceptable. It is left to a SPRE to establish how an institution complies specifically with a standard. Finally, the Secretary did not adopt the fourth suggestion because it is the responsibility of a State in consulting with institutions in the development of those standards, to obtain and consider all relevant comments. The Secretary considers ``representative sampling'' to be a valid statistical method for conducting surveys. Changes: None. Comments: One commenter writing on behalf of an accrediting commission, urged the Secretary to make a State's review standards subject to third party review. The commenter also recommended this treatment for a SPRE's plan and budget for carrying out the activities under this part. The commenter believed that the statute and the proposed regulations require the Secretary to exercise informed judgment on whether a number of broad standards have been met. Third-party comment would provide valuable input to the Secretary's exercise of informed judgment. In addition, the commenter offered the view that if the Secretary's key goal for the Program Integrity Triad is to reduce redundancy and promote complimentary input from interested parties, notably other members of the triad and affected institutions, would help the Secretary determine whether State plans, budgets, and standards are in fact complementary to the efforts of the Department and nationally recognized accrediting agencies and not unduly burdensome to institutions. Finally, in the commenters opinion, input from third parties would also help prevent the Secretary from mistake or embarrassment. For example, if the consultative process in a State has been inadequate, it is highly unlikely that the State will reveal the inadequacies in its submission to the Secretary. Institutions that have been adversely affected, however, could point out those deficiencies before Federal funds are wasted on SPRE efforts to apply standards that may later legitimately be challenged. Similarly, nationally recognized accrediting agencies may provide useful information to the Secretary about proposed contracts with other ``peer review systems'' that are inadequate to the tasks that they would be given. The commenter maintained that according to interested parties the right to review and comment need not be burdensome or time-consuming, and recommended procedures under which the Secretary would provide for and receive third-party comment on a State's review standards, and the SPRE's plans and budgets, before determining whether to approve those standards and plans. Discussion: The Secretary disagrees strongly that the suggested procedures for third-party comment would not be burdensome or time-consuming. Under the suggested procedures, the Secretary would need to publish in the Federal Register each State's application for funds and each State's review standards, and allow a 30 day comment period and consider that comment, before determining whether to approve a State's application or disapprove a State's standards. These procedures would delay unnecessarily decisions the Secretary must make to ensure proper and timely administration of the SPRE. Moreover, the Secretary believes that inadequate consultation with all affected parties will likely be revealed in deficient standards, which the Secretary will have the authority to review and disapprove. Changes: None. Comments: A number of commenters believed that SPREs, not institutions, should be required to calculate student completion rates, withdrawal rates, placement rates, and licensure examination pass rates, and other related data. The commenters contended that the statute does not require or imply that institutions should be required to collect or maintain this information. Other commenters suggested that an institution be required to generate data regarding these rates only when the institution is reviewed by a SPRE. Discussion: The Secretary disagrees with the commenters. It is clear under the SPRE that referred institutions must satisfy SPRE standards, and must be able to demonstrate that they satisfy those standards. Changes: None. Section 676.23‚ê£SPRE Reviews of Referred Institutions Comments: A few commenters believed that a SPRE should be able to conduct an unannounced review of a referred institution if the SPRE has reason to believe that the institution is engaged in fraudulent practices.
