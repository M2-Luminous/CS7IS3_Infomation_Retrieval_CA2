The textile industry is sewing for "small change." In spite of all the efforts of this labor-intensive economic sector, most of which is export-oriented, to create the conditions for bigger deals, it still remains at the level of working under the Lon system [arrangement in which foreign company supplies materials and possibly equipment and receives part or all of goods produced by local labor], which is promoted by cheap labor. Last year this industry, in which 130 enterprises with 47,000 employees work, had its volume of physical production reduced by 1.33 percent in its base part, and had a 0.6 percent larger decline than Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] industry. Production capacities, up to 30 percent of which were used by spinners, 40 percent by weavers, 60 percent by the knitting industry, and 80 percent by the clothing industry, were not an obstacle to textile workers' achieving exports worth $122 million last year and accounting for 14 percent of the country's total exports. Loss of the Market Under the conditions of the application of UN sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY], commercial and transportation blockades, the growth of costs and high competition from East European countries, exports can hardly be achieved unless other incentive measures are introduced in addition to the realistic exchange rate. The textile industry is operating with obsolete equipment, whose extent of depreciation in the base sector ranges above 80 percent, and above 60 percent in the finished product industry. Because of unresolved ownership relations in the last three years, there have been almost no investments, and thus, if this lag continues, the sector will soon also lose its main market abroad, especially in the European Union [EU]. The blackmail tactics of foreign partners which, knowing about our situation, are offering humiliating prices for Lon-system cooperation, are contributing to this. It is thus happening that Macedonian garment makers are agreeing to sew certain pieces of clothing for only one mark, even though they know that they are being sold for 50 times as much in the market. With the implementation of the Stabilization Program, it can be seen that the textile workers will not be prospering this year. As several directors in this branch of the economy have noted, it is illogical for a country to borrow foreign exchange and repay it with denars. Likewise, they wonder about the logic by which interest rates continue to grow under the conditions of a realistic exchange rate for the German mark [DM]. That is confirmed by the fact that in January the DM rose by only 2.9 percent, but interest rates were between 15 and 16 percent. After all of this it appears that those faring best in all of the textile industry are garment makers, which is also confirmed by what was exhibited at the Modest 94 fair. The spinners are in the same branch, but there 75 percent of the capacity is standing idle. The reason for this lies in the fact that the Macedonian processors of cotton and wool do not have enough funds to provide themselves with raw materials for a longer period. The foreign suppliers are offering Macedonian spinners cotton at prices up to 30 percent higher than the regular ones. This problem can be solved if the Directorate of Commodity Reserves purchases a larger amount of semifinished products and provides the spinners with a longer period of peace. In view of the constant illiquidity of the spinners, the illiquid enterprises are dragging along with them those that are in a somewhat better condition, since they cannot pay their debts to them. And since we are already talking about unpaid bills, the Macedonian textile workers, just like the construction workers, cannot get their money from Iraq. With the passage of time, that amount has reached the figure of $19 million, and the state, in spite of all its promises, has not yet collected it. Textiles on the Streets Struggling with overemployment, which is estimated to amount to 20 percent of the total number of employees, low wages far behind the average for the economy, by as much as 36 percent, as well as additional withholdings from wages, so that for a net wage of 100 denars the same amount is given in taxes, the textile workers also have to struggle with the gray economy. Mass smuggling of textile products, for which the 25 percent turnover tax is not paid, is the only reason why textiles are displayed in regular shops, but sold on streets and sidewalks. It is not clear to textile workers how textiles could have been left out of the ban on the sale of goods in marketplaces. In the sea of problems afflicting this sector, one of the urgent ones is technological obsolescence and the high degree of the amortization of equipment, almost 80 percent of which is ready to be written off. Likewise, it is absurd that machines which are not produced here should be exempt from customs duties, while spare parts for the old machines, which are likewise procured through imports, are still subject to customs duties. It is precisely for that reason that textile workers are demanding that they be exempted from these duties, regardless of the cheaper value of the parts, under $1,000. At the same time, it is necessary to reexamine the present mechanisms for incentives for exports, which, in their current versions, are insufficiently stimulating exports in this sphere. Also essential is financial assistance for financing the preparation of production for export and the reexemption of profits achieved through exports. In a situation in which textile workers even have the profits from exports taxed, why should they have any interest in continuing to export? Accordingly, the new institutional measures are assessed by textile workers as solely aimed at ensuring a more comfortable life for the state, without providing a single denar more for incentives for those who are doing a good job. With the curtailment of all privileges for those who are export-oriented, the textile workers think that the branch that they are sitting on is being cut from under them, and also add that the new fiscal policy lacks not only a developmental function but also a social welfare function. The textile workers are demanding compensatory solutions, and also that other permits for imports and exports be valid for one year, and not partial and for shorter periods of time, and that they be issued within the framework of the Chamber [of Commerce] institution. In the area of wages, all the enterprises that have an average wage below than the average for the economy should be allowed to increase them up to that average, while the process of transformation should be accelerated, giving workers an opportunity to participate for free in purchasing some of the enterprise shares.
