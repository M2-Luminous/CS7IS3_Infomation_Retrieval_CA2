In accordance with Department policy and 28 CFR 50.7, notice is hereby given that on February 11, 1994, a proposed Consent Decree in United States, et al. v. Wayne County, Michigan, et al. (Civ. No. 87&hyph;70992) was lodged in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. The United States filed the complaint commencing this enforcement action in 1987, under the Clean Water Act (``Act''), 33 U.S.C. Section 1251 et seq., alleging violations of Act and the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (``NPDES'') Permit that applies to the waste water treatment plant (``Plant'') owned and operated by Wayne County, Michigan, and located at 797 Central Ave, Wyandotte, Michigan. The State of Michigan is a co-Plaintiff, and fourteen units of local government served by the Plant are named as Defendants along with Wayne County. The United States, State, and all Defendants are signatories to the proposed Consent Decree, under which the Defendants shall design, construct, operate, and maintain significant, additional facilities_construction of which is presently estimated to cost about $230 million. These facilities will improve both the quality and capacity of treatment provided by the Plant and also give the Plant significant transport and storage capacity_in the form of underground tunnels and above-ground equalization basins_for waste water that Plaintiffs believe is bypassed without treatment into the waters of the United States. The Decree also requires that Wayne County pay a civil penalty of $413,000.
