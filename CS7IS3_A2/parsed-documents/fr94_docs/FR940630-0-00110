FR940630-0-00110 FR940630-0-00036 (iii) Other public construction project (which includes other buildings or improvements, regardless of ownership). Section 3 covered contract means a contract or subcontract (including a professional service contract) awarded by a recipient or contractor for work generated by the expenditure of section 3 covered assistance, or for work arising in connection with a section 3 covered project. ``Section 3 covered contracts'' do not include contracts awarded under HUD's procurement program, which are governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation System (see 48 CFR, Chapter 1). ``Section 3 covered contracts'' also do not include contracts for the purchase of supplies and materials. However, whenever a contract for materials includes the installation of the materials, the contract constitutes a section 3 covered contract. For example, a contract for the purchase and installation of a furnace would be a section 3 covered contract because the contract is for work (i.e., the installation of the furnace) and thus is covered by section 3. Section 3 covered project means the construction, reconstruction, conversion or rehabilitation of housing (including reduction and abatement of lead-based paint hazards), other public construction which includes buildings or improvements (regardless of ownership) assisted with housing or community development assistance.

Section 3(b)(2) of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437a(b)(2)) defines this term to mean families (including single persons) whose incomes do not exceed 50 per centum of the median family income for the area, as determined by the Secretary with adjustments for smaller and larger families, except that the Secretary may establish income ceilings higher or lower than 50 per centum of the median for the area on the basis of the Secretary's findings that such variations are necessary because of unusually high or low family incomes.
