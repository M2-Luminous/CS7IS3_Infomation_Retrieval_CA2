Last night, Guo Fengmin attended a spring get-together, sponsored by the Chinese Enterprises' Association, where reporters asked him questions about the Xi Yang case. One reporter asked: "Do you think it is appropriate for the Hong Kong government to issue a statement on the Xi Yang case?" Guo Fengmin answered: "This matter is China's internal affair and should be handled in accordance with the law of China." Guo Fengmin added: The State Council Foreign Ministry spokesman has made it very clear that the Xi Yang case is a matter which has been handled according to the law of China. As for the concrete details, he said that, as the leader of the JLG, he did not have much understanding of the case. However, he stressed that the Xi Yang case did not have any bearing on Hong Kong journalists' normal news-gathering activities and, because state secrets were involved, such a case, according to China's law, could not be tried openly.
