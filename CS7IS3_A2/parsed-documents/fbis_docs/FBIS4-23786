And it emerged that Mandela is being seen by fellow African heads of state as a key to mediating in the Rwandan and Angolan wars. Mandela's spokesman, Joel Netshitenzhe, said yesterday both Rwandan government and rebel representatives had asked to meet Mandela to seek his help in resolving the bloody conflict. He said Mandela would meet the two parties. Addressing a press conference at the SA embassy in Tunis yesterday, Mandela also revealed he had discussed the Angolan war with President Eduardo dos Santos of Angola and President Mobutu of Zaire during the Organisation of African Unity summit in Tunis. He reiterated his willingness to meet UNITA [Total Independence for the Liberation of Angola] leader Jonas Savimbi to help resolve the Angolan dispute. On possible reparations by South Africa to African countries, he said no compensation would be offered to countries that had helped in the liberation struggle because they had done it not for reward but from a sense of duty. Mandela was asked how the Government would respond to requests for reparations in the light of indications that the Angolan government might seek such payments. "We are prepared to discuss issues with the aim of resolving past differences, and if we have the resources and there is a demand that we should make reparations we will have to consider that matter seriously". He said that if a complaint was made by a neighbouring country about damage done by the previous government "we cannot take the attitude that, look this was a minority government, we are not responsible for its crimes. "But the matter will have to be discussed very carefully. "We too were involved in the struggle as organisations and as people not affiliated to any particular organisation. "Now that we are free we are not going to give any material resources to the people who took part in the struggle other than to help to raise their living standards to ensure that they have a secure future. "It was in that spirit that the continent of Africa helped us." Asked whether Deputy President F.W. de Klerk's failure to attend certain recent functions indicated a split between him and the president, Mandela said both he and De Klerk at times had to miss functions because of the pressure of other duties.
