The foreign minister, Mr. Velayati, in an interview with our correspondent, while declaring Iran's readiness to give any assistance to the innocent people of Palestine and for serious action against the Zionists, said: Iran's delegation at the United Nations has called on the Security Council to take measures to end the Zionist atrocity in occupied Palestine. Mr. Velayati added: Despite the Zionists' act, Palestinian Muslims will participate in the arenas of confrontation against the occupiers and that action [massacre] is an answer for those naive people who have pinned their hopes on a peace resulting from the Gaza-Jericho agreement. Our country's foreign minister also held a telephone conversation with his Pakistani counterpart and conferred with him on the need to convene an ICO meeting.
