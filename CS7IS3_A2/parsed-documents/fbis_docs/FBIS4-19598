Thank you for waiting for this link-up to be arranged. You were bitter this morning. You called on the international community to regain its self control and to define a common position. President Mitterrand asked Butrus Butrus-Ghali this evening to restart the negotiations. How can we do this, Alain Juppe, according to you? [Juppe] This is exactly what I did today at the Council of Ministers of the Twelve. I would like to remind you that we were able to define a common position as early as last week on the basis of the French proposals. First of all, I would like to say that the question of Gorazde, the negotiations in Gorazde, were badly led. They were badly led because we did not do what we had done in Sarajevo, namely for all those concerned to hold a common position: the United Nations, the European Union, the Americans, and the Russians. We must draw lessons from this. The first thing we, the Twelve, are hoping for, is that a fait accompli is clearly rejected. It is out of the question for us to resign ourselves to the situation created by the Serbs in Gorazde. This is why we are calling on the Security Council to demand an immediate cease-fire, the withdrawal of Serb troops outside an exclusion zone, which remains to be created, and the deployment of the UN Protection Force. You know that France has agreed to take part in this deployment, together with the British and others. [Amar] Mr. Minister, you are being quite firm this evening. Does this mean that NATO will intervene if the Bosnian Serbs do not listen? [Juppe] This means that each must now face one's responsibilities. If this resolution is submitted to the Security Council -- and this is our wish -- we will see if the Americans and the Russians vote it through. From the moment they vote it through, I believe that the message will be clear to the Serbs. The second proposal we have made...[pauses] what you said earlier in the news bulletin on the evolution of the Russian position -- I heard it here in Villacoublay while I was watching -- is interesting. Everyone now realizes that the Serbs and all the communities at war in Bosnia tend not to take anyone seriously, and this may have been the useful part of the negotiations that have been under way for a month and a half. Therefore, it is necessary for the Americans, the Russians, and the Europeans to define a common position, on the map and on the development of events, once our basic demands have been met. This is what we are calling for. [Amar] In any case, this means that the Russians may not be opposed to a firm decision on the part of the United Nations or NATO, does it not? [Juppe] This would be in total contradiction with what they said yesterday, when Mr. Akashi presented his plan to the Serbs, and with what I have just heard in your bulletin, namely the words of Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Churkin. [Amar] Would a possible UN intervention not be too late, given the fact that the Serbs are in Gorazde? A UN spokesman has just said that Gorazde has fallen. Is a UN intervention possible technically? [Juppe] I think that there should be no mistake about what we have called for. Gorazde is under Serb control; we should not play with words on whether Gorazde has fallen or has not fallen. Gorazde is under Serb control. Quite obviously, this deprives us of the possibility to carry out air strikes on Gorazde. This is why we have called for this resolution by the Security Council through a joint initiative from the Americans, the Russians, and the Europeans, so that the Serbs -- who are the aggressors -- yield. Our aim is also to summon the three belligerents to the negotiating table as soon as possible and to impose a settlement plan on them. The European Union tried to do this last year. It failed on its own. For several weeks now, the Americans have started bilateral diplomacy. We can now see its limitations. The same goes for the Russians. Once we Europeans, Russians, and Americans manage to define a common position, I am hoping that pressure on all those war-thirsty people who, it must be said, can be found on all sides -- the Serb side today -- could make them aware of the fact that the international community is determined. This is our last trump card. We cannot yield to the temptation of military escalation because we do not know what this may lead to. We cannot yield to the temptation of desertion, which would be a fiasco for the international community. Therefore, it is necessary to put the diplomatic process back onto the rails, together with the two diplomatic initiatives taken by the French and approved by the Twelve today, and which remain to be approved by the Russians and the Americans. This is what will be done over the next few hours and over the next few days. [Amar] You used the expression time limit. Do you know what kind of time limit you intend to set? [Juppe] The time limit must be very short, because the situation on the ground can get out of hand any minute. It seems to me that a meeting between us four -- the United States, Russia, the European Union, and the United Nations -- can be held within the next two days. [Amar] One last question, Mr. Minister. You said earlier on that the negotiations in Gorazde were badly led. You want to learn from this. Does this mean that the United Nations is in fact unable to stop this war? [Juppe] You know, it is necessary to draw lessons from the mistakes we have just made, but this does not mean that we should expose such and such organization to condemnation. The United Nations has its weaknesses, but it must be pointed out that its means are not always appropriate. France has been doing its duty for months on end. Once again, who is ready to send troops to Gorazde? Great Britain and France. Let us give the United Nations the necessary means. Let those who have been lecturing so far agree to commit themselves on the ground at last. It may then be possible to make more valuable criticisms of the United Nations if it is not able to make the best of its means. At the moment, it does not have such means, and it must be given them. [Amar] Thank you, Mr. Juppe, for speaking to us live from Villacoublay. Good evening. [Juppe] Good evening.
