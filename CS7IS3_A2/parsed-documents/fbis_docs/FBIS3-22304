New Zealand has no facility capable of destroying PCBs, which were used in electrical equipment. The PCBs are to be incinerated by French state-owned company Tredi at a site near Lyon, which is expected to receive the PCBs from New Zealand. The environmental organisation Greenpeace said it will continue its campaign to stop toxic waste shipments. Spokeswoman Stephanie Mills said the shipments to France broke the spirit of the Basel Convention on waste trade, which called on countries to deal with wastes themselves.
