The rumors were spread after a Russian-language radio station aired reports of an accident at the reactor facility today. Estonian Rescue Department officials were dispatched to the site to check the radiation level around the base. Radiation near the reactor building was no higher that the background of the previous days and is lower than the maximum allowed by the norms, said Juri Tikk, the Estonian Government's representative at Paldiski. Also Estonian police who observed the site found no signs of a possible nuclear accident, Tikk added. "I'm absolutely sure everything is all right at Paldiski," he said. Tikk said rumors had spread in the morning of a black cloud forming above the reactor building. He said the rumor had been taken so seriously in some places that people were ready to start evacuation of schools and kindergartens. "I suppose the rumors may have arisen from earlier suppositions by some Estonian officials that the taking out of nuclear fuel from the reactors is going to start on Apr. 5," Tikk said. Estonian authorities are now trying to find out who started the rumors. Also in Paldiski, rumors spread late last month about Estonian authorities registering the residents in the town in preparation of a massive deportation.
