C. Tsai] [Text] Taipei, March 17 (CNA) -- Taiwan's unemployment rate stood at 1.44 percent last year, the lowest level since 1982, the Council for Economic Planning and Development reported Thursday [17 March]. Council statistics show that out of an average labor force of 8.87 million in 1993, only 128,000 were unemployed. The labor force includes civilians 15 years of age and over who are available for work. Officials said that the relocation abroad of labor-intensive industries, an increase in public investment projects, and a strong job demand by the service sector were among major factors pushing down the joblessness rate. The number of employees in the manufacturing sector shrank by 4 percent to 2.48 million last year mainly due to the relocation of labor-intensive industries and the acceleration of production automation, while service sector employees increased 4.2 percent to 4.32 million, the officials elaborated. In addition, they said, the labor force participation rate fell to a 10-year low of 58.82 percent in 1993, indicating that Taiwan residents have yet to increase their willingness to work. The labor force participation rate is the percentage of the labor force compared to all civilians 15 years of age and over, including those who are unavailable for work. Those unavailable for work are people such as housewives, students, and senior citizens who are not working and are not seeking jobs. Meanwhile, the average monthly salary in Taiwan was NT$32,009 [New Taiwan dollars] (US$1,207.88) last year, up 7.7 percent from the previous year. The pay raise rate was the lowest level since 1986, indicating lackluster domestic business in 1993, the officials noted.
