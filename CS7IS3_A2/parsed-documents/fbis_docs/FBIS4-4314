The author of the article says: The dear leader's work "On the Chuche Idea" is an immortal work which consummates in an integral system the principles and contents of the chuche idea on a profound scientific and theoretical basis; it is a great encyclopedia of the chuche idea which enriches the chuche idea with a wealth of new ideas and theories. The greatness of the ideological and theoretical exploits of the dear leader is, first of all, that he established in an integral system a true world outlook of the era of independence with the popular masses placed in the centre. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il said: "The chuche idea is a new philosophical thought which centres on man." In the work, the dear leader gave a unique exposition that man is a social being with independence, creativity and consciousness and, on this basis, systemized in an integral way the chuche outlook on the world with the popular masses placed in the centre. The philosophical principle of the chuche idea that man is the master of everything and decides everything gives a scientific exposition of the position and role of man in the world on the basis of his essential characters. The socio-historical principles of the chuche idea clarify from a new angle the essence, character and motive force of the socio-historical movement with the popular masses as the driving force. As clarified in the work, the philosophical world outlook of chuche unifies the view of the world focussing on man and the man-centred viewpoint and stand toward the world; the socio-historical outlook of chuche closely combines the view of the socio-historical principles and law centred on the popular masses, the makers of history, with the viewpoint and stand approaching historical development and social revolution with the popular masses placed in the centre. Thus, the chuche idea convinces the masses of people that they are responsible for their own destiny and enables them to discharge their duty and role as masters in the revolutionary struggle and constructive work to transform nature, society and man. The dear leader's scientific exposition of the essential characters of man and systematization of the world outlook of chuche with the popular masses placed in the centre are immortal exploits in that they bring into bolder relief the main features, uniqueness and advantages of the chuche idea that broke a new ground in the development of mankind's outlook on the world, and provide the popular masses with a powerful weapon to transform the world positively and actively. The greatness of the dear leader's ideological and theoretical exploits is also that he enriched the chuche idea so that it may serve as a powerful weapon in the practical efforts to shape the destiny of the popular masses. In the work, the dear leader, basing himself on a scientific analysis of the founding and development of the chuche idea and the rich practical experience of the Korean revolution, elucidated the guiding principles in the revolutionary struggle of the popular masses to transform nature and society. The guiding principles of the chuche idea -- maintaining the independent stand, applying the creative method and placing the main stress on ideology in the revolution and construction -- make it possible to firmly defend, embody and give full play to the independence, creativity and consciousness of the popular masses in the revolutionary struggle and constructive work so that they can positively transform nature and society and actively shape their own destiny. The integral systematization and consummation of the chuche idea in conformity with its main features and ideal by the dear leader are an immortal exploit in making the chuche idea more famous than before as a flawless system of scientific and logical ideas and theories and a great guiding idea of the time with a new, unique composition and contents. This was an epoch-making event which provided the first perfect revolutionary world outlook of the working class in human history.
