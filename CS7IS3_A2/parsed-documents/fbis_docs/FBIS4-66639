Chavan's broadside against the United States in the Lok Sabha, which paid little heed to diplomatic niceties, marks a new assertiveness in India's Kashmir policy. But it also points to the lamentable gulf that seems to separate India from America these days. By charging the U.S. with seeking gains for itself in Kashmir, the home minister seems to have virtually accused it of harbouring covetous designs on Indian territory. Even otherwise, the tone of his utterances and the fact that they follow the parliamentary resolution, reaffirming India's determination to maintain its sovereignty over the state, ought to send an unequivocal message to whoever has been taking an interest in the matter. The opposition, of course, cannot be faulted for criticising the government's handling of the state's affairs, given the prevailing lawlessness there and a feeling that other countries were being too casual about India's concerns. Indeed, given the peculiar circumstances in Kashmir at present, Parliament is, in a sense, its custodian. Fortunately, after a shaky beginning, the official policy seems to have been fleshed out with the governor, Gen. K.V. Krishna Rao, in command in Srinagar and the home minister spelling out the government's position with uncommon vigour in New Delhi. In advance of the outcome of the UNHRC [United Nations Human Rights Commission] in Geneva, the combative home minister has also given short shrift to charges of human rights violations by India in Kashmir. There is little doubt, therefore, that the situation is far clearer than it used to be not long ago. While the home minister's remarks were not always taken all that seriously in the past, his latest observations on the U.S. and Pakistan undoubtedly represent a new and carefully-structured position of the government. The latter apparently wants to make it quite clear, in the light of various suggestions emanating from Washington, that New Delhi will take serious exception to measures that seek to question India's sovereign rights over Kashmir. Perhaps the forthcoming visit of the top American official dealing with South Asia, Ms. Robin Raphel, lent an edge to Mr. Chavan's comments. Unlike some people, Mr. Chavan has not shied away from charging that Ms. Raphel's statement, questioning the accession of Kashmir to the Indian Union, had the sanction of the U.S. President, Mr. Bill Clinton. The Indian officials dealing with the U.S., who have been trying to keep the relations between the two countries on an even keel despite the severe buffeting they have received, may detect a positive element in Mr. Chavan's observation that India must "find out what exactly are the intentions of the U.S. government". But, as home minister, Mr. Chavan has also to deal with the seamier side of international politics, namely, espionage, cross-border sabotage and proxy wars. So it is not surprising, especially in the context of Kashmir, that his remarks were sharp, without any mitigating element one normally expects in any reference to a country with which there is no direct confrontation.
