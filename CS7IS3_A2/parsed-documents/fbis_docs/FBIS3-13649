We have to wait and see if and how the President's commitment to a united Jerusalem as the capital of Israel is translated into the vote of his UN delegation. And, lest we forget the forum in which the remarks were made: The leaders of the Jewish community in the United States -- the same people whose lobbying and donations we so much like to dismiss -- are the ones who heard from the President his renewed commitment to the issue of Jerusalem.
