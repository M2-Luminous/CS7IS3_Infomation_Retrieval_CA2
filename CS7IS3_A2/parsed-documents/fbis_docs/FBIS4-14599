Grigoriy Karasin, director of the Foreign Ministry's Information and Press Department, noted at a briefing today that these incidents could "deal a blow not only to the prospects for achieving accords between the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the Israeli Government, but also to the whole Near East peace process." In these conditions, the MID spokesman stressed, "the Russian co- sponsor for a settlement considers it his duty to once again urge both sides -- the Israelis and the Palestinians -- to show maximum restraint and calm in order to prevent the fate of the peace efforts being handed to [ne otdavat na otkup] irresponsible extremist elements." The main thing now, the Russian foreign political department believes, "is to do everything to ensure the speediest conclusion of an agreement by Israel and the PLO on Gaza and Jericho and its practical implementation." "This would signify the first real step on the way toward implementing the Palestine-Israel declaration on principles, and would give a strong boost to the successful advancement of the peace process in the Near East," Grigory Karasin stated.
