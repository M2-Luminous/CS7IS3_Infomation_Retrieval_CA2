Successive surveys indicate that the ANC [African National Congress] will win a two-thirds majority of the vote without any serious threat from its main rival, the National Party (NP). Four opinion surveys conducted in recent months show ANC support ranging from about 55 percent to more than 70 percent. More recent surveys suggest that the organisation's support might even surpass the 70 percent mark. This is significantly up on the ANC's own estimates, when it said in March last year that it was assured of 53 percent of the vote. More recently, the Institute for Multi-party Democracy (IMPD), in a survey done in association with the Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC) and MarkData, estimated support for the ANC/SACP [South African Communist Party] alliance at 70.3 percent. This includes ANC support in the Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda and Ciskei. Surveys conducted by Markinor in May 1992 also show that support for the ANC among black voters is unparalleled. The survey found that only three percent of all potential black voters rejected the ANC "completely and on principle". During the same survey, 70 percent of blacks said they would "definitely vote for it (the ANC) if there were an election". Almost a year later, the same level of support is being reflected in surveys such the one conducted by the HSRC for the IMDP. A Markinor survey found that when the total number of people who indicated their preference for the ANC as a first and second choice were combined, the movement walked away with a 76 percent majority. Surveys have consistently shown the National Party (NP) as having the next highest supporting. Four surveys conducted in the past year, estimated NP support at anything between 15.5 and 25 percent. Most recent figures put NP support at between 15.5 percent and 16.1 percent. It remains a largely white-based party, with only five percent of metropolitan blacks supporting it. While it enjoys considerable support in percentage terms from among the Indian and coloured communities, this does not translate into much in terms of the number of votes, given the relatively small size of these population groups. Despite the NP's poor showing among blacks, only six percent said they "rejected it completely and on principle". Its overall performance among blacks, however, appeared to be deteriorating, with support at around 10 percent according to results of a Markinor poll released in November last year. This was five percent less than 12 months before. Support among whites also seemed to be on the slide. The number of voters who saw the NP as their first choice dropped from 67 percent in May 1992 to only 43 percent a year later. More unpopular than the NP among black voters is the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP). According to the May 1992 Markinor survey, 71 percent of blacks said they rejected the organisation. This made it even more unpopular among blacks than the Conservative Party (CP). This lack of popularity has been reflected in almost every other survey conducted so far. The results of a Markinor survey released in November last year showed that only three percent of metropolitan blacks supported the IFP. The HSRC survey put its support slightly higher, at 3.3 percent, while one political analyst gave it between eight and 10 percent support -- its highest ever. Inkatha has consistently rejected the opinion poll results and has argued that surveys did not reflect the extent of its support in Natal, where it claims it enjoys considerable support. But a Markinor survey in May 1993, conducted among 163 black respondents in Durban, gave the IFP only 15 percent support, compared to the ANC's 50 percent. Interestingly, the IFP commands more support among whites in Durban than the ANC. While none of 100 whites polled supported ANC, 11 said they supported the IFP. Support for the PAC [Pan Africanist Congress] among metropolitan blacks remained static since November 1992. Of all potential South African voters, the PAC enjoys the support of only 2.4 percent, according to the HSRC/IMPD survey. Another recent survey, whose results were published earlier this month, suggests that the PAC could count on the support of only 1.5 percent. The Democratic Party (DP) has put up an equally dismal showing in successive opinion polls. A SUNDAY TIMES/Markinor survey gave the DP less than three percent support. But the party has rejected the results and said it would aim to capture 15 percent of votes. Recent surveys suggest it is far from achieving what clearly seems like an ambitious target. It is against the background of this ambitious target, and the ANC's strong showing, that the DP and the NP have committed themselves to denying the liberation movement a two-thirds majority. The DP has been at the forefront of the crusade to block the ANC from winning more than 66.6 percent of the vote, with the NP boarding the bandwagon recently. While the ratings of political parties serve as an important indicator of trends ahead of the elections, popularity ratings of individual political leaders cannot be ignored. This is especially important given that ballot papers will be marked with images of political leaders rather than symbols. While it is difficult to gauge popularity trends in the case of ANC president Nelson Mandela, given the fact that few surveys go back further than 1992, a more comprehensive picture can easily be assembled of NP leaders. A survey to gauge opinion on how the state president was running the country found that in 1978 only 22 percent of all blacks believed that the NP leaders was running the country "very well or fairly well." However, 95 percent of all whites surveyed at the time found that the NP president was doing a good job of running the country. This support declined steadily during the next four years, dipping to 78 percent among whites in 1982. Black respondents' opinion of the president improved during this same period. Whereas only 22 percent of black respondents felt that the head of state was doing a reasonable job of administering the country's affairs in 1978, the figure increased to 31 percent four years later. Support for the National Party president took a dip in 1989 following the resignation of P.W. Botha and the ascendancy in the party leadership of F.W. de Klerk. While De Klerk might have cost his party some white support because of reformist noises he made after his election as leader of the party in 1989, he gained a considerable favour among black respondents. Markinor figures show that De Klerk's approval ratings soared among blacks from a low of 22 percent in 1978 to 88 percent in May 1990 compared to 70 percent among whites. This was the year in which he unbanned the ANC. However, by November 1992, the picture had changed markedly with De Klerk being regarded as doing a good job by only 47 percent of all blacks surveyed compared to 69 percent of whites. In a matter of 12 months to May last year, the number of metropolitan blacks who felt that De Klerk was running the country fairly well dropped from 76 percent to 35 percent. This almost certainly has a direct bearing on the level of violence, which since 1990 has claimed thousands of lives in Reef townships. Much of his support among whites came from English-speaking respondents. Markinor figures show that in November 1992, 75 percent of English-speaking whites felt De Klerk was running the country very well or at least fairly well compared to 64 percent Afrikaans speaking whites. Marginal improvements in his approval ratings were recorded in May 1993, with 76 percent of English- speaking respondents approving of De Klerk compared to 66 percent of Afrikaners. Mandela, by comparison, was favoured as a leader by 78 percent of metropolitan blacks, while only seven percent of whites said they would vote for him. In fact, Mandela increased his support among metropolitical blacks by five percent since November 1992. Joe Slovo, chairperson of the SACP, showed the biggest gain, moving up from 13 to 27 percent among metropolitan blacks. This will certainly translate into significant voting support for the ANC, given the fact that Slovo features high up on the ANC's list of candidates for the National Assembly elections.
