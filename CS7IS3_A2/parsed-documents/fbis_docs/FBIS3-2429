Xiao Rong said: The description of my father's conditions today can be boiled down to two sentences. The first is that he is not ill, and the second is that he is, after all, 90 years old. It is the law of nature; his physical quality, in its entirety, is poorer than it was a couple of years ago. Nevertheless, he persists in doing some exercises every day, mainly walking. He makes it a rule to walk three kilometers each day, even against Beijing's cold wind. Xiao Rong said: I personally believe that a secret of my father's longevity is precisely an orderly life. Even before his retirement, when he was still in office, he led a very orderly life. Since his retirement, he has continued to maintain a very orderly life. Every day, he gets up at around 0700, then he does some exercises, in a workout with several movements, which he himself has worked out. After breakfast, he reads the press. My father just loves to read newspapers. I believe, in his mind, reading the press is no less important than reading documents. He subscribes to a dozen or so newspapers, which he invariably reads through -- the whole lot. We used to say as a joke that the source of information in our family is precisely my father because, none of us in our family reads the press as earnestly as he does, none of us reads such a huge volume as he does. Sometimes, he will ask us which team won a famous football match a day before, and none of us can say. Then he will be very pleased with himself, telling us the result. After reading the press, it is time for a walk in the morning. In the remainder of the day, he sometimes does some reading, or watches television. Then, there are his grandchildren. When they are back from school at noon, they invariably will go to see their grandpa and play with him. My father is a person who just loves the family, his children and grandchildren. Therefore, being together with his family members is his happiest time every day. He spends most of his time in the evening playing bridge. He has a few loyal partners playing bridge, most of whom are retired old men.
