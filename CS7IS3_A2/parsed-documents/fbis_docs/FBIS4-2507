The death sentence was passed by the Intermediate People's Court of Beijing, upheld by the city's higher court at the final hearing of the case, and confirmed by the Supreme People's Court. Shen, 39, was also deprived of his political rights for life. Li Xiaoshi, a former vice-minister of the State Scientific and Technological Commission, who was implicated in the case, was jailed for 20 years, with his political rights revoked for four years. According to an announcement by the supreme court, Shen's accomplice and wife Sun Jihong, 40, was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment. She was vice-president and head of the accounting department of Changcheng, which was ordered closed in the second half of last year. On March 2, 1993, Shen Taifu and Sun Jihong withdrew one million yuan in cash from the company's fund-raising department, then deposited it into Sun's personal bank account. On February 21 and 22, 1993, Shen filled in two receipts for one million yuan each, allegedly to pay for patent commissions. With one of the receipts he drew one million yuan in cash from the Shenzhen Taifu Company, and then asked You Chengshun, the head of this subsidiary company of Changcheng's, to use the other receipt to reimburse the same amount of cash. In March of the same year, Shen managed to persuade others to pass a decision before the Changcheng board of directors exclusively for his own benefit -- for every transaction he concluded, he would be entitled to a 10 percent patent commission. To cover up the trick, Shen had the decision affixed with the date "January 4, 1993" -- about two months before its adoption. To facilitate the illegal fund-raising by Changcheng and its subsidiaries from 1989 to March 1993, Shen gave out bribes amounting to 255,791.9 yuan, in cash or in kind, to Li Xiaoshi as well as to 11 other state functionaries. The eleven have all been prosecuted for receiving bribes or for negligence of duty. Some of these people -- a government official at the deputy bureau director level, four reporters, three bank clerks and three retired accountants -- will be dealt with in cases connected with Shen's illegal fund raising. On March 4, 1994, the Intermediate Court of Beijing sentenced Shen Taifu to death and all his personal property was confiscated. Sun Jihong was sentenced to 15 years in jail and deprived of her political rights for three years. At the final or second hearing later, the Higher Court of Beijing upheld the intermediate court's sentences and rejected their appeals. On April 8, 1994, the supreme court confirmed the validity of Shen's death sentence. Acting on an order issued by the president of the supreme court, the Intermediate Court of Beijing carried out the death sentence today. Li Xiaoshi, 53, was found guilty of receiving 52,690 yuan in bribes and pocketing 20,000 yuan in public money while serving as vice-minister of the commission. On March 4, 1994, the Intermediate Court of Beijing sentenced him to 20 years' imprisonment with his political rights revoked for four years and part of his personal property confiscated. Li also pleaded not guilty. However, the Beijing higher court rejected his appeal and upheld the sentence. At a press conference this afternoon, Liu Jiachen, vice-president of the Supreme People's Court, accused Shen Taifu of pocketing three million yuan in funds he had raised, allegedly to develop machinery and electronics technology. The vice-president advised state functionaries, especially those with power, to learn proper lessons from the cases of Shen Taifu and Li Xiaoshi.
