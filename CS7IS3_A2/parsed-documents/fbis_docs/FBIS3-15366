Those accusations are groundless, Front leaders told Interfax in Baku on Thursday. The National Security Ministry has declined to comment on the statement made by the two government officials. In the meantime, police searches are under way of the Front's headquarters in Baku, now into their fourth day. The measure comes after the police found military uniforms, ammunition and petrol bombs in the basement of the building. But deputy Front leader Arif Aliyev said all of this had been deliberately put there to discredit his organization.
