Minister Perez accepted the request. This information was disclosed by the Defense Ministry in a brief communique of four and a half lines. General Stange will thus remain outside the Carabineros institution for another 60 days after his leave permit is over. It should be recalled that Defense Minister Perez Yoma had stated in Concepcion that Stange's vacation was for an "indefinite" period of time. Carabineros Deputy Director Fernando Cordero Rusque is currently carrying out Stange's duties in his place. Stange went on leave after special Judge Milton Juica condemned 16 Carabineros officers and one civilian to sentences ranging from 61 days to life imprisonment for the abduction and murder of communist leaders Jose Manuel Parada, Manuel Guerrero, and Santiago Natino, for the abduction of several leaders of the former Agech [Chilean Educators Association], for the abduction of Ramon Arriagada, the wounding of professor Leopoldo Munoz de la Parra with a bullet, and for the unlawful association for terrorist purposes, among other crimes. After Judge Juica's ruling was disclosed, President Eduardo Frei met on 5 April with Stange at La Moneda Palace. Frei allegedly asked Stange to resign, but at the end of the meeting the Carabineros director said: "I am not resigning." On 8 April Stange went on leave, which prompted a polemic between the Carabineros and the government. According to the Carabineros, Stange was taking a regular 30 day vacation, while the government maintained he would be on leave for an "indefinite" period of time. [passage omitted]
