FR940725-0-00149 FR940725-0-00019 These persons would be acting under authority of a Coast Guard license or document for compliance with regulations contained in 46 CFR, but it is not clear that they could be effectively held accountable for their performance related to OSHA regulations. Coast Guard authorized persons do not typically have training in hazards related to the toxicity of various chemicals. Since such training is necessary so that the required tests and inspections are performed safely and appropriately, OSHA concludes that the final rule should not automatically permit these persons to perform tests and inspections under ยง1915.12(c). Three commenters urged OSHA to include language permitting any qualified person to perform the tests and inspections required under ยง1915.12(c) (Ex. 6&hyph;3, 6&hyph;6, 6&hyph;12). They argued that requiring these tests to be performed by a Marine Chemist or a certified industrial hygienist would unnecessarily restrict an employer's means of complying with the standard. The Shipbuilders Council of America (Ex. 6&hyph;3) stated this position as follows: SCA recommends that OSHA utilize performance-oriented language and require a ``qualified person'' perform the testing. The required testing has been performed in the Shipbuilding, Ship Repairing and Shipbreaking Industry for years without incident. With proper training, competent or other qualified persons can test and inspect for toxic substances and provide for safe entry into confined spaces. The proposed wording will require shipyards to utilize either a Marine Chemist or Certified Industrial Hygienist (CIH) for all confined spaces entries or a competent person and a Marine Chemist or CIH for confined space entry. This requirement is overly restrictive and unnecessarily expensive on the declining Shipbuilding, Ship Repairing and Shipbreaking Industry without adding any additional degree of safety. SCA recommends that OSHA delete all references to Marine Chemists and Certified Industrial Hygienists and specify that a ``qualified person'' perform all required tests (see Issue # 2). OSHA has concluded that a two-pronged approach is necessary for the protection of employees working in confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres from hazards related to the toxicity of various chemicals. First, the initial tests and inspections must be performed by a competent person (paragraph (c)(1)). Using the results provided by the competent person, the employer can then install ventilation, if necessary, to render the space safe for entry (paragraph (c)(2)). Second, if ventilation fails to bring concentrations of air contaminants to acceptable levels, a Marine Chemist or Certified Industrial Hygienist must be brought in to develop and implement control measures to protect employees entering the space (paragraph (c)(4)). Under final ยง1915.7, competent persons have the following skills and knowledge (among others): (1) The ability to understand and carry out instructions of Marine Chemists and certified industrial hygienists, (2) Knowledge of the requirements of Subpart B, (3) Knowledge of the structures, locations, and designations of spaces where work is to be performed, (4) Ability to calibrate and use test instruments, including carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide indicators,
