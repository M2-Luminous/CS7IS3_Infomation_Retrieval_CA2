This inclination comes in the wake of the first official visit to Cairo by Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati, during which he attended the Nonaligned Movement conference and met with his Egyptian opposite number 'Amr Musa. They discussed issues of common concern on the Islamic and Arab scenes. Well-informed sources stressed that important developments in relations between Egypt and Iran indicate that positive steps are expected to be taken soon, but it depends on the results of the coming days. Diplomatic sources have pointed to the two countries' endeavors to open a new page in relations based on surmounting the points of disagreement, working to eliminate them, and bolstering the issues agreed upon, especially what concerns the two sides on the regional and international scene, in particular Islamic issues and nonalignment.
