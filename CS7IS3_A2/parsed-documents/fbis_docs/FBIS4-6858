Noting his administration achieved some reforms that his predecessors could not, including political reform, Hosokawa said he was grateful to the public for their "warm encouragement and help." "It is extremely painful that I have to leave office halfway through my reform efforts (and) at a time when there are a number of domestic and foreign challenges...I don't know how to apologize to the public for that," Hosokawa said in a statement. But he sought understanding of his decision to resign, saying he had to take political and moral responsibility for the delay in Diet budget debate and for his involvement in questionable financial dealings. Hosokawa, who rose to power last August, also expressed hope the next administration will deal squarely with a host of formidable domestic and foreign policy tasks and "herald a new era for Japanese politics." At an extraordinary cabinet meeting earlier Monday, Hosokawa thanked cabinet members for their cooperation with his reform efforts and vowed to support the next government as a legislator, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said. Takemura, speaking at his last news conference as the Hosokawa government spokesman, said he felt as if he set sail for the rough seas when he started working as part of the Hosokawa administration. "Today, I feel I can come ashore after so much time," he said, adding he wants to make full use of his eight-month experience at the center of power and get ready for an expected political reconfiguration.
