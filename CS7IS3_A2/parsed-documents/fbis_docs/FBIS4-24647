Since 1986, nearly 220,000 workers--6.5 per cent of all staff--laid off as a result of the Railway Ministry's recent efficiency drive have been moved to new services such as tourism and catering. Minister Han Zhubin termed the multi-industry wave as "an effective way" to improve the sector's efficiency and digest surplus workers from its 3.4 million employees. "Unwieldy labour forces and low labour productivity leaves us far behind the world's advanced level", he said on Thursday, vowing to divert 600,000 more workers from rail transport by the turn of the century. The ministry's diversification has created 330,000 jobs in travel agencies, commerce and trade, tourism, catering, advertising, construction and mining. But the minister reiterated the ban on businesses run by any railway security, procurators, judicial bodies or railway functional department. "This is to prevent power abuse, and let grass-roots rail departments focus energy on shipping and safety," he explained. The minister also warned against illegal trade of freight cargo or train tickets under the disguise of diversified business. This has hurt the railways image over the past two years. "We are tightening check-up and supervision over those engaged in transport agencies. Both their service items and charges must be rational and legal," he stressed. A special agency has been set up to promote and oversee the sector's diversified operation. "We want a fast development of diversified operation, but it shall be on a healthy and legal track," the minister said.
