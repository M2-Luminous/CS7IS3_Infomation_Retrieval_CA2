Taking this into consideration, what can you say about this organization? [Me'simov] The Independent Economists' Association is a public organization. This organization, which began its activities as the Independent Economists' Group in 1988, became active under its present name after having expanded its ranks following the founding conference in April 1992. The basic goal of the association is to unite the efforts of scholars, specialists, enterprise workers and businessmen with a new economic concept in the name of Azerbaijan's socio-economic progress, coordinate their activities and direct them toward one goal. The organization unites not only economists, but also those of other specialties capable of uniting economics with problems in their own sectors under its aegis. In the five years the association has been active our specialists have prepared a number of scientifically-based concepts and programs ("Azerbaijan's Concept of Economic Independence," "Program of Measures Taken Against the Economic Crisis in Azerbaijan," "Program of Azerbaijan's Economic Revival") on privatization, agricultural reform, the organization of social processes, foreign investment policy and other important economic issues, among them many which have been valued quite highly by foreign specialists. We have also participated closely in the preparation of legislative acts and other state programs and documents, and in terms of expertise. The number of association members, their variety of expertise and competence, has provided much practical advice, proposal preparation and expert opinions, and makes it possible to prepare alternative documentation for important economic problems, and short-, middle- and long-term prognoses. [Question] After having stepped down from your post as first deputy Prime Minister and having revived your activity in the Independent Economists' Association, what directions will you give priority in the work of the Association? [Me'simov] The major priority in the Association's work has been defined by the dictates of our disturbance created from the tension created in the economic situation of our republic as a consequence of the present economic policy of the government. Some confusion in the government's economic policy and the inconclusiveness and mistakes stemming from this are felt clearly. If the government attempts to build economic policy with the help of incorrectly evaluated measures, the situation in all sectors of the socio-economic life of the country could worsen in the next few months. Every organization and economist, no matter what the position or function in society, which foresees the harm these tendencies could do to our economy, standard of living of the population and statehood must understand that the responsibility falls on the present extreme conditions, and must direct his activities towards getting out of the situation which has been created. Whether one emerges from the situation which has been created at maximum or minimal cost depends primarily on whether economic policy is correctly or incorrectly structured. The goal of independent economists who are always trying to be objective in their views and who made known their constructive relationship to the steps taken in the economic sector even when I held high positions in government structures was and is unambiguous. Our goal is to influence legislation and other state documents of an economic character by providing expertise, preparing alternatives, making known an objective relationship to steps taken by the government in the economic policy sector, and avoiding mistakes, as well as influencing the correct structuring of economic policy to the extent it depends on us and our abilities. In connection with this, members of the Association regularly inform the mass media on their views on economic policy and related problems. This is a very important question because it occurs to a person sitting within the government structure that he sees and knows everything, and that he is in control. Unfortunately, there are such things that are seen better from a distance. The Association of Independent Economists, taking into consideration the direct influence of every step taken in the economic policy sector on the living standards of the people, will provide help and expertise in the preparation of drafts of state documents on reforms in an unbiased manner, will not intrigue against anyone, and its members will not declare beforehand that they will not take a post in the administration.
