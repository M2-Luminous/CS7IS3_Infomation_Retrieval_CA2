Katyal] [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 10--For the first time, India has given a firm schedule to the International Commission of the Red Cross (ICRC) to go to Jammu and Kashmir. Its survey team could visit the State, the ICRC has been told, anytime after March 20, while any one from its side could go there for preliminary purposes right now. As a matter of fact, the Indian authorities offered to arrange an immediate visit to Kashmir by the ICRC representative, Mr. Jean Mich Elli Monod, who was here this week for a workshop in Hyderabad. Mr. Monod, however, wanted to go back to the headquarters in Geneva for consultations. India also suggested that the Hyderabad workshop, in which Mr. Monod and other representatives of the ICRC and the commanders of the paramilitary forces took part, could be made an on-going process. During the discussions the ICRC representatives explained the norms that needed to be followed in regard to the treatment of detenus and related matters while the Indian side detailed the practices observed by the paramilitary forces. India's decision to give immediate access to the ICRC to Jammu and Kashmir is the culmination of a process that began more than a year ago, with its request for permission to send a survey team to the State. However, a decision was delayed as the exchange of views between the two sides got prolonged. During this period, representatives of the Amnesty International visited India. The present relaxation is to be seen in the context of the discussions that began early in 1993. At another level, India of late stepped up its diplomatic contacts to meet an immediate situation, created by Pakistan's move for a resolution at the U.N. Human Rights Commission at Geneva. The diplomats from some 45 out of the 53 member-countries of the U.N. Commission were briefed last month by the then Foreign Secretary, Mr. J.N. Dixit. They also met the Home Secretary, Mr. N.N. Vohra, in two batches. The detailed accounts of the havoc wrought by the terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir and their links with the outfits in the Pakistan-occupied part of the State were supplemented with video presentations. This was besides the visits of the Civil Aviation Minister, Mr. Ghulam Nabi Azad, and the Minister of State for External Affairs, Mr. R.L. Bhatia, to the Muslim countries to put the record straight on Kashmir-related issues. The other Minister of State for External Affairs, Mr. Salman Khursheed, is due to brief the Delhi-based envoys next week. Significant move: In a significant move, India has invited the member-nations of the U.N. Commission, including the Muslim countries, to send their envoys to Jammu and Kashmir. Mr. A.B. Vajpayee, Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, who, along with the Finance Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, had gone to Geneva earlier this month, will undertake another trip there this weekend, while Mr. Khursheed will join him later. They will be there at the time of the possible Pakistani action to move a resolution on alleged human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir. The text of the draft resolution, circulated by Pakistan, is as follows: "The Commission on Human Rights: Recognising the need for the universal promotion and protection of fundamental human rights as defined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other instruments, covenants and declarations on human rights. Noting the persistent and well-documented reports of massive human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir, (1) Reaffirms the fundamental human rights of the people of Jammu and Kashmir; (2) Expresses grave concern at the gross and consistent violations of the human rights of the people of Jammu and Kashmir; (3) Decides to send a fact-finding mission to Jammu and Kashmir to investigate and report on the human rights situation there to the 49th Session of the U.N. General Assembly; (4) Decides to consider the situation of human rights in Jammu and Kashmir at its 51st Session."
