Urinson said that if the plan worked, capital investments would increase, the production slump would halt and stabilization would begin along with the improvement of the living standards. The ministry leaders are now "airing" their plans for 1994 in the economic circles in a bid to drum up support for further market reforms and a moderately tough financial and monetary policy. The ministry vows support to the most vulnerable groups of the population by fixing general spending on public needs at 16 percent of the Gross Domestic Product. The exact amount will depend on revenues. To ensure these, the ministry intends to preserve the present taxation system, whose stability and predictability is expected to make it easier for the entrepreneurs to adapt, and the tax agencies to levy taxes in full measure. Urinson said this move can hardly be popular with most industrialists and entrepreneurs, who believe that high taxes are pernicious to any production. The deputy minister, on the contrary, believes that the development of production expands the taxable base and heaps up the revenues. Last year, 17 percent of all Russian enterprises ended the year in the black, he said. They drained the federal budget, inflated its deficit and "froze" restructuring. Much has to be done to pull them out from under the budget umbrella and make them use their production potential to meet market demand. Some of them may end up in bankruptcy, while others, particularly those of special economic or public importance, will have to be helped out. This applies primarily to the most important coal and metallurgical enterprises and fertilizer producers. Restructuring is closely linked to the liquidation of monopolies which are hampering the development of market relations and deflect state resources. As an example, considerable resources allocated to the agroindustrial sector never reach farmers but are intercepted by processors of farm produce, suppliers of means of production, banks and retailers, whose monopoly positions enable them to "redistribute" resources in their own favour.
