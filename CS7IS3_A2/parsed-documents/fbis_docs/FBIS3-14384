He added that the session dealt with a number of political, economic, legal, and financial issues that concern Arab countries. Speaking at a news conference tonight following the conclusion of the session, he said that this two-day session was held at a very sensitive and critical time dominated by the consequences of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid underlined the Arab League's desire to give impetus to the comprehensive and just peace process in the Middle East. He also underlined the Arab League's commitment to the Arabism of Jerusalem and said that this issue will never be relinquished. He explained that the Arab League Secretariat General issued a statement several days ago expressing concern over reports about new U.S. statements that Jerusalem is Israel's capital. He noted that the U.S. Embassy in Cairo has denied these statements and stressed Washington's firm stance on the Jerusalem issue. The Arab League secretary general said that the issue of amending the League's charter has been postponed because of the differences in the views of the member states on this issue. He explained that identical views were required on the concept of the amendment proposed by the Arab League's secretariat general, but this does not mean that the amendment has been rejected. He called for respecting the views of all the Arab parties, adding: Differences in views do not spoil an issue. Regarding his initiative on Arab reconciliation, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that it is now being studied. He added that he got the feeling from the ministers participating in the session that they accept the reconciliation proposal but that the matter will require more time because the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 has left a painful wound. He said that he raised the following question: Since we are facing an Arab-Israeli reconciliation, hasn't the time come for holding an inter-Arab reconciliation? Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid urged patience on the issue of Arab reconciliation and expressed his belief that it will happen in the future. He noted that no one spoke about Arab reconciliation a year ago but it is now on every tongue and has become a theme of a number of intellectual seminars. He said that the Egyptian paper AL-AHRAM will soon host a seminar on this issue. Regarding the Arab League's stance on the Libyan-Western crisis, the secretary general said that the seven-member committee charged with discussing this crisis met on the sidelines of the council's session and discussed the developments. He added that the council felt Libya's desire to find a solution that will be compatible with international law and preserve that country's dignity and sovereignty. He said that the Arab League Council backed the Libyan proposal that the two suspects in the Lockerbie incident be tried before the International Court of Justice in the Hague with Scottish judges sitting on the bench and Scottish laws, which are more flexible than British ones, applied. He described this proposal as practical and emphasized Libya's flexibility in solving the crisis, adding that no country hands over its citizens to another country to be tried there. Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that the council decided to lift the boycott imposed on Liberia because of its dealings with Israel. He said that the League Council decided to draw up a comprehensive Arab concept on setting up a zone free from weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East region, which will be submitted to the League Council at its 102nd session scheduled to be held at Arab League headquarters. He said that the Islamic Republic of Comorro asked that the next session be held there, but no decision has been made on this matter.
