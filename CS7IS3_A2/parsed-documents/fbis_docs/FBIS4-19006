Shaykh Hamad, who has been in Bonn since Monday, is discussing possibilities to increase cooperation between Germany and the Arabic Gulf emirate with the Federal Government and Bundestag deputies. The two countries are negotiating an agreement in the spheres of economic cooperation, investment protection, double taxation, aviation, and cultural exchange. According to statements from the Foreign Ministry, Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and Shaykh Hamad in a meeting last night agreed to conclude these negotiations as quickly as possible. Bonn would also try to further extend relations between the European Union [EU] and the Gulf Cooperation Council -- the community of the six Arabic Gulf monarchies -- during the German EU presidency (second half of 1994). Before his meeting with Kohl, the Qatari foreign minister held talks with Hans Stercken, chairman of the Bundestag's Foreign Committee; Reinhard Goehner, parliamentary secretary in the Economics Ministry; and Friedrich Bohl, head of the Chancellor's Office. Tonight, the foreign minister is scheduled to meet Joerg Schoenbohm, state secretary in the Defense Ministry, for talks. With exports worth 192 million German marks [DM] in 1993, Germany was one of the most important supply countries for Qatar (after Japan, the United States, and Britain). Qatar's exports to the FRG, mainly crude oil, only amounted to DM8 million.
