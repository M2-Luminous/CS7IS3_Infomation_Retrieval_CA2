Official sources reported today on the "unexpected" visit and noted Niehaus was already on the island of St. Lucia and is currently in Guyana from where he will fly to Grenada. According to some news reports, Niehaus' visit is related to the pressure the United States is exerting on some Caribbean countries to withdraw their pledge to support the Costa Rican foreign minister. Costa Rican President Rafael Angel Calderon said today "it would be regrettable" if the United States were trying to pressure the countries of Central America and the Caribbean to withdraw their support for Niehaus. The head of state added that Niehaus is most likely going to have to vie for this post with Colombian President Cesar Gaviria, "who has the backing of the United States." Calderon reiterated his government's endorsement of Niehaus, who is ready to go "to the end" on this matter, he stressed. Bernd Niehaus has been saying for some weeks he has the majority of votes needed to win the post of secretary general on 28 March and replace Brazilian Joao Baena Soares, since he has the backing of all the countries of the Caribbean and Central America, and some South American countries. Cesar Gaviria's candidacy, which the Colombian president has not officially announced, has the backing of the United States, Mexico, and Brazil, among other big countries, according to news reports. Before returning to Costa Rica, Foreign Minister Niehaus will go to Mexico to participate in a seminar on poverty in Latin America sponsored by the OAS.
