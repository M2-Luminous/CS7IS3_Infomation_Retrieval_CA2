This would be the end of the long "honeymoon" that reached its peak during the war waged by the "contras" against the Sandinist regime in Nicaragua. It was also reported in Tegucigalpa that Armed Forces Chief General Luis Alonso Discua said on a U.S. television network that the current agreement "includes certain rules that are out of date because the treaty was signed in 1954." Official Honduran sources and the U.S. Embassy in this capital declined to make any statements to ACAN-EFE but promised to do so "in the next few hours." Meanwhile, the Presidency announced an upcoming meeting of the Security Council. The Legislative Assembly already knows about the Armed Forces position. Vice President Rafael Pineda Ponce said today that it includes "professional, analytical, and thoughtful" proposals. Honduran military personnel have initiated efforts to modify the Military Assistance Treaty because it is obsolete and currently benefits only Washington in allowing it to exert pressure on the Central American nation, local commentators said. These sources did not rule out the possibility that the military will try to capitalize on the fact that the United States will leave the Panama Canal in the year 2000, thus making Honduras the sole military base in Central America. Political and humanitarian group leaders, however, criticized the military initiative today, saying that Honduras's foreign policy should be set by civilian rather than military powers.
