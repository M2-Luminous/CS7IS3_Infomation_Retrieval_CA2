The government will consider such reforms as lowering the tax exemption ceiling for corporate entertainment expenses, raising levy rates on profit-making operations at nonprofit organizations and gradually abolishing the special treatment of medical institutions and seven designated businesses such as mass communications, the sources said. They said an adoption of punitive heavy taxes is also on the discussion table for unexplained corporate expenditures that are widely suspected of being used in dubious political donations and bribes. The move is apparently intended to pave the way for raising the consumption tax rate, currently at 3 percent, in line with hearings at six major cities conducted by the Tax Commission, an advisory panel to the prime minister, in November. Panel members had said the majority opinions at the hearings were for rectifying unfair tax systems before the tax hike. The hearings were to gather regional opinions on the panel's tax reform report that calls for an income tax cut and a consumption tax hike in a single program. A Finance Ministry official said, "a huge increase in tax revenues can't be expected" with the reforms on unfair tax systems. The ministry is strongly insisting that an income tax cut must be financed by a consumption tax hike, thus conflicting with socialists and some other parties within the ruling coalition that are against the tax hike. This dispute is preventing discussions on including the income tax breaks in the government's fresh economic stimulus package to be launched around January 20. Meanwhile, the tax panel will resume its talks on fiscal 1994 tax reform on Friday, apparently with settlements looking set for Diet deliberations on political reforms -- Hosokawa's top policy priority. The panel suspended its meetings in mid-December to watch the development in political reforms. On the entertainment expenses, the government wants to lower the exemption amount to check those companies evading corporate taxes through huge write-offs of such expenses to artificially fall into the red, the sources said. Currently, entertainment expenses at companies capitalized at 50 million yen and more are levied fully. But 4 million yen is allowed for nontax write-offs as losses for companies capitalized up to 10 million yen, and 3 million yen for companies between 50 million and 10 million yen. Some government leaders have been calling for the reform in those expenses in or after fiscal 1995, to avoid undermining corporate activities amid the current economic slump. But the Finance Ministry has been strongly insisting on an early overhaul. The sources said the government intends to raise the special levy rate, currently at 27 percent, on profit-making operations at religious, educational and other nonprofit organizations by 1 percentage point to 28 percent, the same specially treated rate on medium-size to small businesses. Clarification of nontax and tax operations will also be considered, the sources said. Currently, for example, donations and charms are tax-exempt for religious organizations, but postcards and parking tolls are subject to taxation. A staged abolishment is planned for nontax treatments on social security rewards to medical practitioners and lower-tax treatments on mass communications, publications and five other specially designated businesses. Considering unexplained expenses, recently uncovered bribery scandals underlined practices by Japanese companies using such expenses in political maneuvering. The government is eyeing a punitive heavy levy as one of the options to stop such practices, but concerns exist over companies taking it as an excuse to write off an unlimited amount of unspecified expenses as long as they pay the heavy tax. The sources said a final decision on the dubious expenses will be left to the government and the ruling coalition parties to decide.
