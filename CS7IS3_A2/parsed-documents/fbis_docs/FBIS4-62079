In this connection the Public Relations Centers of the Russian FCS and MVD officially declare that, following a transfer of a large amount of currency, the FCS detained an internal service major, a former employee of the Moscow Oblast Administration Internal Affairs Main Administration Punishment Execution Administration (dismissed in April 1994), and a major of justice, a senior investigator of the Russian MVD Investigative Committee. These persons have now been arrested and charged under Article 88 (violation of regulations on currency operations), Article 170 (abuse of official position), and Article 174, Part 1 (giving a bribe) of the Russian Federation Criminal Code. An attorney's office staffer has also been arrested on a charge of committing a crime covered by Article 174, Part 1 of the Criminal Code. The criminal case which has been instituted has been forwarded for investigation to the Russian Federation General Prosecutor's Office. All three were charged 6 May. No leading employee of the Russian MVD is involved in this case. The Russian FCS and MVD deem it necessary to draw attention to the fact that operational-investigative measures and investigative actions relating to this case are being carried out in cooperation with the MVD. This is the usual practice in such instances. The position of the Russian FCS and MVD leadership with regard to cases of corruption and official and other crimes committed by staffers of organs subordinate to them is well known and boils down to their resolute eradication. Questions of the reliability and purity of personnel and of their own security are topical for the whole law-enforcement system. For counterintelligence and internal affairs organs participation in exposing and stopping corruption -- not only in law-enforcement organs but also in other state structures -- constitutes the fulfillment of their immediate duties and functions of ensuring national security defined by current legislation. Coordination of the efforts of law-enforcement organs and special services and direct interaction and close cooperation between internal affairs and counterintelligence organs are a very important condition and an obligatory and natural element of successful operational-investigative work, particularly in the struggle against the most dangerous crimes. MVD and FCS staffers have recently carried out a number of successful joint operations which have ended the activities of many dangerous criminal groupings which were engaged in the illegal dissemination of drugs, weapons, and contraband antiques. Positive results have been obtained as a result of carrying out the comprehensive "Putina," "Tral," and "Arsenal" operations. In this connection the Public Relations Centers of the Russian FCS and MVD believe that the dissemination of fabrications about a confrontation or "war of monsters" between the FCS and the MVD should be regarded as a provocation harmful to the common cause of combatting crime and corruption and ensuring the security of the individual, society, and the state.
