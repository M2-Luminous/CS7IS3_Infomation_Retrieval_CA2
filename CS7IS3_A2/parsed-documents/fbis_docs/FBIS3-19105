The Federal Government does not have any "feeling" for the east Germans, PDS Bundestag Group chairman Gregor Gysi said on Friday [11 March] shortly before the opening of a party congress in Berlin. Therefore, he is optimistic that his party will exceed the 5-percent threshold. The party sees "realistic prospects" for getting a direct mandate in 10 east German constituencies. Therefore, it will "struggle very vehemently for first votes" there, Gysi said. In the old laender, the struggle will be pursued for the second votes. Andre Brie, the party's election campaign leader, calculated that the PDS wants to get 18 to 20 percent of the votes in the east and 1.5 to 2 percent in the west and thus jump over the 5-percent threshold. In the Bundestag election campaign the PDS will put the topics of mass unemployment, basic social safeguards, as well as the opposition against social cutbacks and a shift to the right into the center of its activities. At the three-day party congress the 524 delegates, who represent 131,406 members, intend to adopt their ticket of candidates for the European elections as well as the programs for this election and for the Bundestag election. It is considered certain that Bundestag Deputy Hans Modrow, the former GDR premier, will head the ticket. The announcement that the Dresden public prosecutor's office will indict him for intentional false statements under oath threw a shadow on his nomination. Nevertheless, the PDS will nominate Modrow, PDS Chairman Lothar Bisky stressed.
