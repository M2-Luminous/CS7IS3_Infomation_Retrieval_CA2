"Drought besetting several areas of the country is difficult to predict as it has deviated from the long dry cycle," he told the press after attending the opening ceremony of the sport week to mark the Ministry's hari krida pertanian (outdoor activity day). The five year cycle of long dry season occured in 1972, 1977, 1982, and in 1987. It was predicted that 1992 would see a long dry season but it did not and even in that year the rice production increased by 7.8 percent from 47.5 million tons in the previous year. Drought is expected to plague hundreds of hectare rice fields in the Central Java cities of Wonogiri, Sragen, Cilacap, Demak and in West Java cities of Indramayu, Cirebon and Bandung which are all regarded as the breadbaskets. Amrin proposed that farmers in the areas which are short of water after rainy season should resort to planting crops which need less water, such as corn and soybean. The drought, however, will not threaten the Indonesia's existing self-sufficiency in rice. "Indonesia's rice production is still much bigger than that of consumption. Besides, several neighbouring countries which borrow Indonesia's rice will in the near future repay it so that it can be used to secure the rice self-sufficiency," he said.
