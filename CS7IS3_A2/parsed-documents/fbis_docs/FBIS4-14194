The judge also listened to a number of witnesses, but the judicial sources who reported this did not reveal any details. Judge Hunayn and Judge Jozeph Furayhah, who is investigating the bombing of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church, this morning received in their offices at the Justice Palace lawyers for a number of detainees and petitions from their families. The judges agreed to some of the requests. According to the judicial sources, Chief Public Prosecutor Judge Munif 'Uwaydat asked that the treatment of Dr. Ja'ja' be improved. 'Uwaydat pointed out, however, that Dr. Ja'ja is not being treated badly and that Justice Minister Bahij Tabbarah is taking care of this. The sources said that the cases referred to the Judiciary Council are old files under investigation. Some of them are being examined by investigating judges and are automatically activated when new evidence appears. Other cases, including the assassination of Deputy Tony Franjiyah and his family, require the appointment of new investigating judges. The sources said the case involving the bombing of Minister Elie Hubayqah's car was dropped in accordance with the general amnesty. Concerning the assassination of former Prime Minister Rashid Karami, the judicial sources said the case was referred to investigating Judge Walid Ghamrah and that there is nothing new. On the file of former President Rene Mu'awwad, the sources said that Judge Sa'id Mirza is the investigator into this file and that investigations have been continuing for three years. Regarding the file of Major General Michel 'Awn, which includes his breach of state security and keeping state taxes and fees for himself, the judicial sources said the general amnesty law did not cover the financial part. They said that Judge Labib Zuwayn left the case about a year ago and that the security agencies are now appointing a judge to investigate this file. The sources said there is no request to extradite Michel 'Awn because such a request cannot be made before an arrest warrant is issued by the investigating judge. The case is awaiting the appointment of an investigating judge and an extradition request is not appropriate at present. On the assassination of Colonel Khalil Kan'an, the sources said that it is within the jurisdiction of the military court.
