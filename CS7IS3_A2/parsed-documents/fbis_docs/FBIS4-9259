FBIS4-9259 "dreeu078_s_94005" FBIS-EEU-94-078 Daily Report 22 Apr 1994 SLOVENIA _O_Survey of Political Parties _O_Survey of Political Parties 94P20669A 94P20669A CSO [Editorial Report] In its 7 April survey of Slovene parties titled "Three Slovene-Two Parties" DNEVNIK contends that the reason for the plethora of political parties and associations -- 124 are currently registered in Slovenia -- is that only 20 signatures are required to register a new party. The Ljubljana daily predicts, however, that the number of parties will be "drastically reduced" by a new law that, if adopted in its present form, will include the requirement that "at least 500 adult Slovene citizens must sign charter statements and adopt a party statute and program" to form a party. The paper notes that this will not be an obstacle for the seven parties that have deputies in parliament, but will "probably be quite a hardship" for smaller parties with only a few hundred members. The DNEVNIK article contains a "survey" of political parties, including information on their membership, organization, and dues. The paper observes that while none of the parties possess precise membership figures, all of them boast that their ranks are swelling. The largest political party, according to DNEVNIK, is the Slovene People's Party (SLS), whose chairman is Marjan Podobnik, with 36,000 members organized in 51 county (opstina) committees. SLS Secretary Franc Feltrin claims that membership is growing, "especially in urban areas." Party dues are 1,000 tolars a year. The party rules do not bar membership in other political parties, except for members of the SLS leadership, and place no restrictions on admission. DNEVNIK lists as the second largest political party the Slovene Christian Democrats (SKI), whose chairman is Lojze Peterle, with about 35,000 members, 20 percent of whom are also members of other parties. Members must be "adult Slovene citizens who accept the SDK statute and program." Among SDK members, however, are about 1,200 Slovenes who live abroad and are "not necessarily Slovene citizens." The party has 356 town, 62 county, and 16 regional committees. A new member has to sign a special admission form and pay dues based on income. The United List of Social Democrats (ZLSD), whose chairman is Janez Kocijancic, has 23,000 dues-paying members and about 10,000 "sympathizers" who pay their dues irregularly, according to its secretary, Dusan Kumer. Dues are 1 percent of a member's net personal income or "as much as he or she can afford." The ZLSD averages seven town committees in each county (there are presently 62 counties in Slovenia) and has 13 regional committees. Several associations such as the Women's Forum, the Youth Forum, the Retirees Association, and the Workers Association are also included in the ZLSD. The new united Liberal Democracy of Slovenia (LDS), whose chairman is Janez Drnovsek, has 18,000 members, says its secretary, Andrej Novak. Formed on 12 March by a merger of four "left-of-center" parties, the LDS has "at least" one party committee in each county in addition to town committees. LDS members are not allowed to belong to other parties. Following the merger, it is expected that committees will be reorganized and the annual dues of 3,600 tolars reduced. Party officials pay dues of up to 2 percent of their monthly gross incomes. Branko Grims, secretary of the Social Democratic Party (SDSS), whose chairman is Janez Jansa, says that the party's membership has increased almost 10 percent due to the "recent political events"--Jansa's dismissal from the post of defense minister and the party's subsequent departure from the governing coalition. The party has about 6,000 members, mostly "nonagricultural workers." Membership in other parties is not allowed. The SDSS has committees in every county; it is "particularly strong" in Murska Sobota, Ljubljana, and Maribor. Annual dues are 1,000 tolars. The Slovene National Party (SNS), whose chairman is Zmago Jelincic, has more than 4,000 members. The SNS statute stipulates that to become a member of the party "one has to be a Slovene and a Slovene citizen, must feel like a Slovene, must agree with the SNS statute, and not have been a member of the League of Communists of Slovenia or Yugoslavia." The last requirement can be waived by the SNS Presidency, according to DNEVNIK. Membership in other parties is not allowed. The monthly dues are to 200 tolars for persons who are employed; the unemployed, retirees, and students pay 50 tolars a month. The Slovene National Right (SND), whose chairman is Saso Lapa, has about 1,000 card-carrying members organized in five provincial committees; each provincial committee is composed of eight regional committees. According to Saso Lapa, there are six requirements for becoming an SND member: "One must be a Slovene, behave like a Slovene, feel like a Slovene, and accept our culture, traditions, and rules of the game." One must never have belonged to the Communist Party or the League of Communists and never held an office in the Socialist Alliance or Socialist Youth League. Party dues are 100 tolars per month. DNEVNIK lists three additional minor parties which do not have seats in parliament: the Freedom Party with 500 members, the Forward Workers Party in Idrija with 100 members, and the Slovene Christian Socialists with 150 members. They are preparing to merge into a "new, left-oriented Social Democratic Party."
