The sources told MENA that the Palestinian-Israeli subcommittee working to draft an agreement on the international presence in Hebron, the Palestinian police force that will deploy in the city, and the armament and jurisdiction of this force has made progress and that the two sides are expected to reach an agreement in the next few hours. The sources added that the agreement will be tantamount to an "integrated package" that should be accepted or rejected as a whole. The decision on whether to resume the talks on self-rule in Gaza and Jericho will depend on this package. The Palestinian sources said the agreement the subcommittee is working on drafting will take into consideration the Palestinian demands to move 42 Israeli families living in Hebron city in the Qiryat Arba' settlement outside the city, because their presence in Hebron causes tension. The agreement also provides for instituting joint patrols of Palestinian and Israeli police in Hebron to maintain security and protect the Palestinians there. The Palestinian sources believe the latest developments in Hebron city over the past 48 hours assert beyond any doubt the importance of adopting security measures to protect the Palestinian population in the city in light of its unique situation with Islamic holy places there. The Palestinian sources stated that Israel has agreed to international protection for the Palestinians through international observers armed with light weapons. This is a Norwegian proposal agreed upon by the Palestinian and Israeli sides as a substitute for an Israeli proposal suggesting unarmed international observers from the International Red Cross and United Nations Relief and Works Agency personnel in the occupied territories. The sources noted that the Israeli Cabinet accepts the Security Council resolution calling for international protection for the Palestinian people in the occupied territories, especially in Hebron city.
