Lee, in an interview with the Japanese daily MAINICHI SHIMBUN, said, "theoretically, realization of the special envoy exchange is possible before March 21, but it is nothing more than our (South Korea's) wishful thinking. Actually, we have little time. It is difficult." Yi added that since Washington agreed with Seoul not to hold the talks unless the special envoy exchange is realized, the scheduled third round of high-level talks between Pyongyang and Washington seems impossible either. In one promising development, North Korea virtually withdrew four preconditions for the envoy exchange including "suspension of the nuclear military exercise" at an inter-Korean working-level contact last Saturday. "With North Korea's change of attitude, although the special envoys may not be exchanged before March 21, a final agreement on the exchange may be reached by that date," he said. South Korea will press the envoy exchange because it is part of preparatory work for an inter-Korean summit meeting, Yi emphasized. Yi said North Korea had admitted its economic failure, adding that Pyongyang seemed to be re-evaluating its announced withdrawal from the nuclear nonproliferation treaty (NPT).
