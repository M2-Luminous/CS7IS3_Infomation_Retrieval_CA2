FR940812-1-00024 FR940812-1-00005 2. In the Fifth Report and Order in this proceeding, PP Docket No. 93&hyph;253, 59 FR 37566 (July 22, 1994) (`` Fifth Report and Order ''), the Commission determined that, to expedite the provision of broadband PCS in rural areas, which have historically suffered from delayed introduction of new services and fewer choices in service providers, rural telephone companies should be permitted to obtain PCS licenses by partitioning certain geographic areas from the licensed PCS service area (MTA or BTA). These companies will be permitted to acquire partitioned broadband PCS licenses in either of two ways: (1) they may form bidding consortia to participate in auctions, and then partition the licenses won among themselves, or (2) they may acquire partitioned broadband PCS licenses from other licensees through private negotiation. We required that partitioned areas conform to established geopolitical boundaries (such as county lines) and that each area include that portion of the rural telephone company's wireline service area that lies within the PCS license area. In addition, where a rural telephone company acquires a partitioned license from another PCS licensee, the partitioned area must be reasonably related to rural telephone company's wireline service area. See Fifth Report and Order at ¶¶148&hyph;153. 3. Our rationale in allowing partitioning for rural telephone companies is that these companies are uniquely positioned to use their existing infrastructure to provide broadband PCS in rural areas. Many rural telephone companies argued that if they were required to bid on entire Basic Trading Area or Major Trading Area licenses to obtain licenses covering their wireline service areas, they would be effectively barred from entering the broadband PCS industry. They contend that under a partitioning plan, they would be able to serve areas in which they already provide service, while the remainder of the PCS service area could be served by other more efficient providers. II. Discussion 4. We wish to consider whether a similar post-auction broadband PCS partitioning plan should be adopted for the benefit of businesses owned by minorities and/or women. We note that some parties commenting on petitions for reconsideration that we received in GEN Docket No. 90&hyph;314 supported various forms of geographic partitioning. 1 Others, however, were opposed to partitioning. 2 The record has not been sufficiently developed on the issue of whether the public interest would be served by permitting businesses owned by minorities and/or women to hold partitioned licenses to enable the Commission to make a determination on this issue. We therefore seek further comment from interested parties. 3 Commenters should address the following issues: (1) whether allowing businesses owned by minorities and/or women to hold partitioned PCS licenses would serve the public interest; (2) if so, what parameters the Commission should provide for these entities to obtain partitioned licenses ( i.e. , through what mechanisms should partitioned licenses be granted and what, if any, limitations should apply); and (3) whether any such partitioning should be prohibited for a period of time after initial PCS licensing, and if so, for what period. 1 See e.g., comments of GTE Service Corp., Association of Independent Designated Entities, McCaw Cellular Communications, Inc. on Petitions for Reconsideration in GEN Docket No. 90&hyph;314. 2 See e.g., comments of MCI Telecommunications Corporation and comments of Nextel Communications, Inc. in GEN Docket No. 90&hyph;314. 3 Comments submitted on this issue in GEN Docket No. 90&hyph;314 will also be considered in this proceeding. Commenters should focus on the public interest impact that allowing such partitioning would likely have. We are particularly interested in hearing from interested parties whether such partitioning could be expected to give rise to benefits corresponding to those we expect to derive from rural telephone company partitioning. We also seek comment on whether the potential benefits that may be derived by partitioning in this context outweigh any practical or administrative difficulties that might arise, and whether more rapid and better service will be provided to any areas as a result of the partitioning. 5. We also wish to explore whether the Commission should restrict the transfer or assignment of partitioned licenses (held by rural telephone companies or by businesses owned by minorities and/or women) for some period of time. We therefore seek comment on this issue, and ask commenters to address how long any such transfer restriction period should last. III. Procedural Matters 6. Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. As required by Section 603 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Commission has prepared an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IFRA) of the expected impact on small entities of the proposals contained in this Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making (FNPRM). We request written public comment on the IRFA, which follows. These comments must be filed in accordance with the same filing deadlines as comments on the rest of the Notice, but they must have a separate and distinct heading designating them as responses to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. The Secretary shall send a copy of this Notice of Proposed Rule Making , including the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration in accordance with paragraph 603(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Pub. L. No. 96&hyph;354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. §601 et seq. (1981). 7. Reason for Action: This FNPRM is issued to obtain comment regarding the certain aspects of the implementation of Section 309(j) of the Communications Act, as amended by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Budget Act).
