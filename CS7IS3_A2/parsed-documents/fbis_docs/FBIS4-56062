Djurkovic said that Serbs who want to leave the Tuzla area have to pay between 1,000-1,500 German marks per person. The Tuzla area is a specific prison for the Serbs, Djurkovic said and added that it is believed that 20,000 Serbs still remain in the region. Both the world public and the humanitarian institutions have shown insufficient interest in the destiny and salvation of the Tuzla Serbs, although the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) Commander for Bosnia, General Philippe Morillon, had promised to enable them to leave for the Bosnian Serb Republic (RS), Djurkovic recalled. The issue of the Tuzla Serbs remains open, but the opening of the Tuzla airport, allegedly solely for humanitarian purposes, remains in the focus of interest of many in the world, he said. About 7,000 Serbs and other nationals have so far left Tuzla through official exchanges with RS and Yugoslavia, while another 3,000 civilians have fled mainly individually via the front lines, Djurkovic said. Quoting eye-witness reports, Djurkovic said that numerous Serbs had been liquidated such as in cases when they were forced to cross mine fields when leaving Moslem-controlled territories for RS. The Tuzla refugees, who also include Croats, claim that the Serbs have been stripped of all their rights in this town. Many were killed, imprisoned, tortured and humiliated with the tacit agreement of the Moslem local and regional authorities, Djurkovic said. He said that many Tuzla Serbs are literally living in the streets since the authorities have evicted them out of their homes so that now they roam the town without food and clothing. The months-long persistent attempts by the Serb side to convince the Tuzla authorities to agree to an exchange of the population, remain futile. The Serb side, primarily motivated by humanitarian reasons, decided to unilaterally organize the reunification of separated families, i.e. to enable the arrival in Tuzla not only of Moslems living in Semberija, where they live in freedom and safety, but also of those from the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia who wish to leave, Djurkovic said. The exchange is in preparation and should be attended by the representatives of international humanitarian organizations, he said.
