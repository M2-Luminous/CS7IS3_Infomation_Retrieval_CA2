He was an expert assistant in a Gynaecological and Maternity Clinic in Bratislava, and later director of the Medical Bionics Research Institute in Bratislava. From September 1990 to March 1992 he was chairman of the Czech and Slovak Confederation of Trade Unions, and deputy chairman from March until June 1992, when he was elected a deputy of the House of Nations of the former Czechoslovak federal parliament. He was then appointed deputy prime minister of the Slovak Government and Minister of Inspection, holding the latter post until September 1992. In the first round of presidential elections in the independent Slovakia, Roman Kovac was the unsuccessful HZDS [Movement for a Democratic Slovakia] candidate. In relation to his candidacy as president, his relationship with the Communist Party of Slovakia (KSS) came into the foreground. In 1989 he was a Communist Party candidate, but did not become a member. Other sources say he actually became a member but was not able to collect his membership card before the events of November 1989. Roman Kovac is married. His wife Lubica is also a physician, and they have two children. Kovac handed his resignation as deputy Slovak prime minister in the former Vladimir Meciar's government to President Michal Kovac on February 25, an admission of defeat in a battle with Meciar over policy formation in the governing Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS). Roman Kovac, once Meciar's right hand man, fell into the prime minister's disfavour when he started to express himself independently and without warning. Among the first signals that Roman Kovac had got into Meciar's bad books was a letter from the district board of the HZDS in Vranov nad Toplou, east Slovakia. The board wrote that "we have already registered, on June 10, 1993, our disagreement with the activities of the deputy prime minister, and we stick by them." In an interview for NARODNA OBRODA on December 20, 1993, Kovac said that not only between him and the prime minister but between him and the government there were various opinions on the solution of problems. In the interview he also said that he had reservations concerning Meciar's style of work in the HZDS. An acceptable solution to the Slovak political situation, he said, would be a wide coalition government with HZDS participation. The disputes within the movement culminated at the meeting of the HZDS Deputies' Club on February 10 in Casta-Papiernicka, west Slovakia. This was where Roman Kovac announced the formation of the breakaway Alternative of Political Realism, backed by nine deputies and Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik. The Alternative proposed the formation of a broad coalition government without political leaders including Meciar. The HZDS National Board called an extraordinary meeting on February 12, at which it did not express political confidence in Kovac and Moravcik, and proposed that they be expelled from the party. It also recommended to Meciar that they be dismissed from their government posts. On February 15, Meciar asked them to leave a cabinet meeting, and a day later wrote to President Michal Kovac proposing their dismissal. Roman Kovac and Moravcik said they would only step down in accordance with a presidential decision, and that they were prepared to continue their goverment responsbilities. As reason for their refusal to leave they said that by doing so they would be condoning the charges which Meciar had made against them. Nonetheless, Moravcik handed in his resignation yesterday, as did Kovac today. "Minister Moravcik and I have decided to made the president's decision easier, partly in an aim to prevent the deepening of the confrontation between the Castle and the government," Kovac said about his decision. The HZDS Bratislava-Old Town District Board had decided by secret ballot on February 11 to cancel Roman Kovac's membership.
