FBIS3-44172 "drafr017_c_94012" FBIS-AFR-94-017 Document Type:Daily Report 26 Jan 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 26 Jan MB2601130294 MB2601130294 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] THE STAR SACP Influence in ANC Unknown, Confusing Factor -- The South African Communist Party (SACP) has "been thrown on the defensive by charges that it is a dominant -- and manipulative -- influence in the ANC [African National Congress]," states a page 14 editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 25 January. "SACP spokesman Jeremy Cronin, attempting to neutralise the propaganda, says only 34 of the 200 candidates are SACP members." THE STAR believes, however, Cronin's explanation "will not spike his opponents' guns as long as the dividing line between SACP and ANC remains blurred. It is difficult to know where the SACP ends and the ANC begins, in regard to policy as well as membership." "Those who favour the ANC have to recognise that a vote for the ANC is simultaneously a vote for the SACP, that the endorsement of bourgeois capitalists in the ANC is at the same time endorsement of the SACP's `democratic socialists'. The sooner the SACP campaigns under its own manifesto and stands or falls under its own banner, the better for South Africa." BUSINESS DAY ANC, Government `Obsession' To Close Radio Pretoria -- Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 26 January in a page 4 editorial says the National Party and the ANC's "obsession with closing down Radio Pretoria and other right-wing radio stations calls into question their political judgment, and highlights their similar approach when it comes to dealing with political opposition." The courts have ruled that Radio Pretoria is operating unlawfully, but this "legalistic approach," is "inappropriate," and "a transparent attempt by government to evade responsibility for its own decision." BUSINESS DAY hopes it is a matter of time "before the airwaves are deregulated sufficiently to render unlawful the operations of quaint right-wing groups and others. In the meantime, given that the regulations are something of an ass anyway, it would make sense to turn a blind eye to technical contraventions." CITY PRESS To End Township Rent Boycott Not Easy -- The call by ANC President Nelson Mandela for an end to the "decade-long rent and service charges boycott would well provide the incoming government of national unity with one of its most intractable problems," points out Johannesburg CITY PRESS in English on 23 January in a page 14 editorial. To upgrade townships to acceptable levels is going to require "billions of rands and decades to achieve. And therein lies the trouble: While these grievances remain, some people will feel inclined to continue with the boycott. The culture of non-payment is now deeply ingrained among residents and no matter how popular Mandela and the ANC might be, persuading people to end the boycott is not going to be easy." BEELD Concern Over Number of `Communists' in ANC Election List -- Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 24 January in its page 8 editorial focuses on the ANC's strategy in its selection of parliamentary candidates. "There are the expected representatives of the internal, as well as the external wings of the ANC. The internal wing is further divided into two -- the so-called 'Robben Island factor' and those that conducted the struggle from within structures of the national government." What is "disturbing," however, are the number of members from the South African Communist Party, who, "according to some sources, represent 13 names of the top 20 names on the list." "Should the ANC get what opinion polls indicate, the major part of ANC representation in the cabinet will therefore be communists." They will be able to hold key portfolios such as labor matters, information and security. The editorial further focuses attention on the implications and dangers of having so many communist members in government, and concludes: "That there are several potential sharks in the ANC's wave of candidates rolling toward us must not be doubted."
