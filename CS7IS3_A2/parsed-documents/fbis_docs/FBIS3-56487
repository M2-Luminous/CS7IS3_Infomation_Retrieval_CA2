In an interview with Interfax-Ukraine, Marmazov said the Supreme Soviet would not ratify the deal unless the conditions it had set for the ratification of the Start-I treaty were met. Last November, the Supreme Soviet ratified the Start-I agreement but with some strings attached. Among other things, the deputies demanded security guarantees and sufficient compensation for the nuclear weapons Ukraine had inherited from the former Soviet Union. Under the parliament-approved deal, Kiev is to transfer 36 percent of its long range missiles and 42 percent of the nuclear warheads to Russia.
