The group will be 20-30 strong and its main task will be to "set the stage for the arrival of more groups." According to Andriy Shkil, "active vacation groups" in Lvov Oblast have already about 200 volunteers on the rolls. But UNA-UNSO is unable to dispatch them to Crimea immediately for lack of money. "We are busy looking for sponsors of the action who would appreciate the need to defend Crimea," Andriy Shkil said.
