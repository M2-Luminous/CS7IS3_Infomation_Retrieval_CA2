Hans Sarmiento has the story. [Begin recording] [Sarmiento] This is the third time the government has declared a state of internal disturbance to avert a legal crisis. This time the state of internal disturbance has been declared amid a dispute between Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff and the national government. The prosecutor general, however, made peace with the president at the beginning of the meeting [not further identified] and accepted the state of internal disturbance even though he had previously opposed it. [De Greiff] The president convinced me how appropriate the measure was and how dangerous the mass release of inmates was. I accepted because I am a reasonable, not arrogant, man. [Sarmiento] Some 860 inmates will have to wait two more months, the period of the state of internal disturbance, for their cases to be considered. At the end of this period, however, there is no guarantee they will be released. [Unidentified speaker] We Colombians are inclined to declare a state of internal disturbance and to live in a state of exception. I think Colombians must trust a government and a state that are willing to adopt timely measures to maintain public order. [Sarmiento] As part of the state of internal disturbance, a judicial emergency was decreed, and trials with faceless judges were suspended for 60 days. [end recording]
