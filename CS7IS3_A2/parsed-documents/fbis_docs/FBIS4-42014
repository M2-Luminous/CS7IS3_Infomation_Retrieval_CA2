Specialists from the United States are expected in Kiev soon to establish a direct connection between our defense minister and his U.S. colleague. During an official visit to the United States by a delegation of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Ukrainian Army General [and Defense Minister] Vitaliy Radetskyy spent three days in the company of William Perry. The atmosphere of confidence can be confirmed by the following fact: Our minister observed the dismantlement of a strategic missile launcher. ( By the way, he also had an opportunity to touch the tumbler that destroyed it.) He showed us the device used to do that, which he kept as a souvenir. He also told us that the explosion at the silo was observed by a farmer and his family, on whose land the launcher had been located. His wife held their two-month-old son, who did not even wake up from the sound of the explosion. This fact confirms the security of works connected with the dismantling of silos, and those that are still in operation, which had previously been aimed at Ukraine but were retargeted on 30 May. We did the same thing as early as December of 1993. Most likely, relations of confidence, which have been established between the chiefs of military departments, will soon be expanded to include officers and soldiers. An agreement on training Ukrainian officers at U.S. military education centers has been reached. Meanwhile, our soldiers are preparing for joint military exercise with Polish and Dutch servicemen. Similar exercises with U.S. Army units have been scheduled for 1995. According to Vitaliy Radetskyy, there are plenty of things to be implemented, based on the experience of our U.S. colleagues. In particular, this relates to the organization of education centers and use of simulators. An agreement has already been signed, which envisions that 12 Ukrainian officers will be sent to military centers to study the U.S. experience firsthand. At the same time, however, we cannot copy everything; which must take into account our own capabilities and conditions, which are quite unique. For example, let us look at living standards. The Army driver who was driving Vitaliy Radetskyy during his visit to the United States, is a contract serviceman. He receives $1,600 [per month], has his own apartment and car, as does his wife. Our country, however, currently does not have funds to introduce a contract service that would meet servicemen's demands. Therefore, the mixed system of staffing the Army is being preserved. As of today, 72.3 percent of young reinforcements have been drafted, and 35,000 people are already serving on contracts. Nevertheless, in general, these conditions do not satisfy people. This relates, in particular, to wages. A lieutenant receives so little money that he is not able to invite his girlfriend to a cafe. Therefore, the defense minister has recently addressed the issue of increasing financial provisions for servicemen to the president and the Supreme Council.
