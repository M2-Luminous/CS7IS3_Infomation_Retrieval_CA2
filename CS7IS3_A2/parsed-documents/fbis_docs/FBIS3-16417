He said the lifting of the state of emergency could trigger off a new armed conflict and make necessary the introduction of the armed forces in the region. Shakhray spoke during the closed parliamentary hearings in the Federation Council which discussed settlement of the inter-ethnic conflict. According to Shakhray, the state of emergency must be preserved, and does not demand significant expenses. Shakhray told Interfax that the cost of financing the interim administration in the conflict zone during 1993 had been put at 23 Bn rubles. He stressed that the Ingush budget was subsidized by 97and the North Ossetian one by 60Both republics explained the financing by the necessity to eliminate of the conflict's consequences. However, "not a single house has as yet been repaired," Shakhray said. According to him, due to the current situation it was necessary to resort to economic pressure through use of the federal budget. This means that financial aid must be conditioned with the holding of negotiations between the conflicting parties. The central authorities must help with the negotiations and establish the needed guarantees, he emphasized. Shakhray said that during the parliament's meeting he had received the impression that the North Ossetian and the Ingush presidents were ready to negotiate.
