He added: "The people's rejection of and scorn for politicians will turn into hate." Brizola said he was "shocked" at the parties' estimated expenses. "This will cause uneasiness in the barracks because it amounts to squandering public funds," he said. He criticized the bill providing for income tax discounts covering part of the donations. He admitted that the deputies of his own party are reluctant to approve the bill. Brizola advocated Superior Electoral Court (TSE) action to strictly limit candidates' expenses. According to Brizola, if the TSE president does not take action, "Brazilian democracy will deteriorate to the benefit of those in the military who nurture moralistic and power ambitions." He said a modest budget allocation for parties would be better than the current law. He suggested that the TSE allow each candidate to use only two small jet planes and ban electoral shows, "which are too expensive." If no action is taken, "what Fernando Collor did will be very small compared with what will be done during these elections," Brizola said. [passage omitted]
