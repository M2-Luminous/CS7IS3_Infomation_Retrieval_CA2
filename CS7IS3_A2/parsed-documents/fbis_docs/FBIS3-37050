Forty-six year old Georgiy Satarov was given the post of presidential aide. He is a Muscovite, and he graduated from the Moscow State Teachers Training College. He worked there until 1991, studying the application of mathematical methods to social sciences. After that he became head of the Center of Applied Political Research, which he himself had set up. Since 1993 he has been a member of the Presidential Council. He is married, and has two daughters. [Correspondent] First of all, Georgiy Aleksandrovich, allow me to congratulate you on your appointment. But what made you stop being a freelance and become an official? [Satarov] Possibly it is a Joan of Arc type complex: Who if not I? Because I know no other good reasons for a person with a good academic career and a more or less successful life to become a functionary. That is first. Second, there is, of course an element of a sort of basic curiosity. It is one thing to analyze and advise, and quite another thing to try and put things into practice. [Correspondent] You automatically cease being a member of the Presidential Council? [Satarov] Yes. [Correspondent] What will your responsibilities be? [Satarov] They will encompass a range of political issues connected with the interaction of the president with the Federal Assembly and with parties and public bodies; the problem of his constitutional powers in connection with the interaction between society and authority; the building of a civic society, etc. [Correspondent] The president is presently reorganizing his staff, we all know this. Is the president trying to strengthen his home front as he sees Chernomyrdin's team becoming stronger?. [Satarov] That is not the case for the simple reason that the reorganization of the administration that is to take place in the near future, as well as the new appointments that were made just now, mine included, were planned a very long time ago, even before the start of the elections. [Correspondent] When the government is criticized do people criticize the president as well? [Satarov] Yes and no. At present there is a certain distancing, of course. In particular, this is also connected with the constitution, this new system of powers. On the other hand, the president is responsible for the Cabinet, because the prime minister was chosen by him. So he cannot avoid responsibility completely, and it is clear that any criticism of the government also reflects upon the president, there can be no doubt about that.
