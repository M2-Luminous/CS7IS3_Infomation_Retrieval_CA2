This is an open agitation of "unification through march northward" which must not go unnoticed. The "retaliation" threatened by the warmaniac meant a war and "linking to a chance of unification" meant "achieving unification through march northward" with the help of the United States. Yi Pyong-tae did not trouble himself to conceal that his clique was working out a "strategy" to attain this aggressive aim. This vividly shows to what extent the Kim Yong-sam traitor group has gone in its adventurous war provocation moves against the North. Facts fully prove that the Kim Yong-sam group is obsessed with a wild ambition to achieve "unification by invading the North", "unification by prevailing over communism" with the backing of the U.S. imperialists, and its aggravation of tension under the pretext of the non- existent "nuclear problem" of the North was a premeditated provocation to pave the way for a war against the North. But it must not act rashly. The Kim Yong-sam traitor clique must clearly know that those who dare attempt to harm our socialist system centred on the masses will only suffer a miserable destruction.
