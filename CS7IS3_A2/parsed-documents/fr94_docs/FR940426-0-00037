I. Introduction The Commission today is adopting a number of initiatives designed to streamline the registration and reporting process for foreign companies accessing the U.S. public securities markets. In companion releases, the Commission is proposing additional initiatives to further this goal. 18 The rule and amendments adopted today were proposed by the Commission on November 3, 1993. 19 In most respects, the rule and amendments are being adopted substantially as proposed. 18 See Securities Act Release Nos. 7054, 7055 and 7056 (April 19, 1994). 19 Securities Act Release No. 7029 (Nov. 3, 1993) [58 FR 60307] (the ``Proposing Release''). Most of the comment letters received regarding the proposals were generally supportive of the Commission's efforts to reduce the registration and reporting burdens on foreign companies. 20 A number of commenters suggested modifications to the proposals, a number of which have been incorporated into the provisions being adopted. 20 Thirty-one comment letters on the proposal were received. Those letters and a summary of the comments are available for public inspection and copying in File No. S7&hyph;30&hyph;93 at the Commission's Public Reference Room in Washington, DC. These provisions are part of the ongoing efforts of the Commission to ease the transition of foreign companies into the U.S. disclosure system, enhance the efficiencies of the registration and reporting processes and lower costs of compliance, where consistent with investor protection. The new provisions further streamline the foreign issuer integrated disclosure system. This system already provides a number of accommodations to foreign practices and policies. These accommodations include: •Interim reporting on the basis of home country regulatory and stock exchange practices; quarterly reports are not required from foreign issuers; •Exemption from the proxy rules and Section 16 insider stock reports and short-swing profit recovery; •Executive compensation disclosure requirements that allow disclosure of compensation for executives on an aggregate basis, if so reported in the issuer's home country; and •Offering document financial statements that are required to be updated principally on a semi-annual, rather than quarterly, basis. Additionally, to facilitate cross border offerings and stock market listings, the Commission staff has implemented procedures to review foreign issuers' disclosure documents in draft form on a non-public basis, if requested by the issuer. Recognizing the particular difficulties of co-ordinating time schedules for cross border offerings, the review process has been tailored to accommodate the special scheduling demands for such offerings. As reflected in the companion releases, the Commission's efforts to address the special needs of foreign companies entering the U.S. public markets are ongoing and will continue, as consistent with investor protection.
