FBIS3-36162 "drsov023_b_94021" FBIS-SOV-94-023 Document Type:Daily Report 3 Feb 1994 RUSSIA NATIONAL AFFAIRS Military Issues Report on Resignations in Special Secret Subunit LD0202204194 LD0202204194 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in Russian at 1700 GMT on 2 February, in its "Vesti" newscast, broadcasts a 3-minute report by correspondent Gindileyev on problems in the security service. The announcer introduces the report by saying: "Our correspondent met with another representative of the security service today. He said that an entire subunit of the Interior Ministry has resigned." The correspondent then takes up the story. He says: "The `Vympel' team, one of the most secret subunits of the former KGB'S directorate of intelligence services, was created in 1979. Its aim was to carry out special operations, often military operations on the territory of foreign states, for example, such as the seizure of Amin's palace in Afghanistan. Nobody would ever know about this unique subunit if it were not for the October storm at the White House. Officers of `Vympel' and the `Alfa' team at that moment refused to shoot and seized the White House without a single shot. They saved thousands of lives. It seems likely that some politicians did not like this disobedience. The Russian president has issued an edict according to which `Vympel' has been transferred to the Interior Ministry. As a result, 110 out of 180 operational officers of `Vympel' have resigned." The video shows the building of the former KGB, then views of Afghanistan, then the seizure of the White House in Moscow in October, and the faces of Khasbulatov and Rutskoy when they surrendered. The video then cuts to show the back of an unidentified person in a car speaking about resignations in the "Vympel" team, who says: "It is possible that we are talking emotionally at the present time but nevertheless, the opinion of many employees shows that this decree messed up, or more precisely, put an end to the existence of subunits such as `Vympel.' In practice, there will be nobody there soon. It seems likely that practically the entire officers' corps will leave. Probably some of them will go to commercial structures." The announcer then concludes the report by saying: "It is clear that we should pay special attention to the fate of these people. In the end, peace of mind and security of the leaders of the state themselves depend on where they will go and whom they will join."
