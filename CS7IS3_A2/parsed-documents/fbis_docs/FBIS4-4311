Our party cell secretaries are our party's core elements who assume responsibility for the basic infrastructural organizations of our party and primary political functionaries who are directly organizing and leading the party life of party members. Today, the combat capability of our party cells has increased; our party is demonstrating its dignity of being an ever-victorious and invincible party; and the singlehearted unity of the leader [suryong], the party, and the masses are strengthening with each passing day. This is thanks to the unheralded efforts of party cell secretaries. Today, all party members and the working people throughout the country sincerely rejoice over and extend warm congratulations to the fact that party cell secretaries of all various sectors--who have actively contributed to strengthening and developing our party and to accelerating the revolution and construction, cherishing infinite loyalty to the great leader [widaehan yongdoja], by enhancing the function and role of party cells--gather at one place to convene the historic meeting. The meeting of party cell secretaries of the entire party is a meeting which is held for the first time in the history of our party and is of great significance in strengthening and developing our party into an ever-victorious and invincible party and in consummating the socialist cause of chuche. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has indicated: Party cells occupy a very important position in strengthening and developing the party and in vigorously advancing the revolution and construction. The meeting will become a signicant meeting which marks a new turn in constantly strengthening and developing our party into an impregnable fortress and in enhancing by all means its combat capability and leadership ability. Party cells are the cornerstones holding up the party and are the lowest level of combat units implementing the party's line and policy. A man becomes healthy only when the cells which form his body are strong and healthy. Likewise, only when party cells which form the party are sound and their function and role are high can the party become strong. Strengthening party cells becomes an important factor in strengthening the entire party. Today, our party is taking pride in its existence as a party of impregnable fortress, which is unprecedented in history. This is because all party cells forming our party have been firmly built and their combat capabilities are strong. In the glorious history of our party there has been no period in the past in which party cells grew up and strengthened and the party strengthened like today when the dear comrade leader's great party building ideology and theory are being thoroughly embodied. Through the current meeting of party cell secretaries of the entire party the wisdom of leadership of the dear comrade leader who has always paid deep interest to enhancing party cells' combat function and role will be vigorously demonstrated and, at the same time, all party members and the working people will more firmly cherish in their hearts the firm faith that as long as the dear comrade leader is with them our party can take pride in its dignity of being an ever-victorious party forever. With the current meeting as an occasion the struggle to enhance the function and role of party cells and the outstanding successes and experiences attained in the work with the masses of all strata will be generalized widely and the work to build all party cells into cells of loyalty will be more vigorously waged among party organizations at all levels. Thus, the current meeting will make a great contribution to further strengthening our party's might and to deepening all means the single-hearted unity of our revolutionary ranks. The meeting of party cell secretaries of the entire party under the wise leadership of the party and the leader, is a historical meeting which is greatly significant in its struggle to resolutely advocate, adhere to, and complete, to the end, socialism of our own style which has been elucidated and obtained with blood. Socialism of our own style, which our people chose themselves and built with their own strength by highly upholding the banner of the great chuche idea, is the most superior socialism in this world. As shown in countries where socialism was frustrated and capitalism reinstated, there can only be bitter pains, twists, and turns, and a wretched fate for the people who have lost socialism. The road to defending and elucidating socialism lies in first, second, and third, strengthening the working-class party--the general staff of the revolution--and endlessly enhancing its leadership role. To achieve this, the party cell--the primary-level infrastructural organizations--must be strengthened. The party cell must be strong so that the party can be strong, and the party must be powerful so that socialism can vigorously advance in whatever hardships and without the slightest wavering. How to thoroughly embody all lines and policies of the party to highly manifest the superiority and might of socialism and to change them into a great reality, are largely dependent on the role of the party cells who are the primary-level militant unit in implementing the party's policy. The meeting of party cell secretaries of the entire party is a meeting of faith and will that shows our party's firm determination to strengthen the party and all the more enhance the function and role of the party organizations to smash [chitbusigo] all kinds of antisocial and antirepublic maneuvers by the imperialists and reactionaries and complete socialism of our own style to the end. As long as the imperialists and reactionaries drive the situation to a brink of war and viciously carry out the reckless provocative maneuver opposing our republic, our party cell secretaries will defend to the end, socialism of our own style through the might of single-hearted unity firmly united around the dear comrade leader. The voice of faith of our party cell secretaries will resound vigorously throughout the meeting. At the meeting, our party's firm determination and will displayed on the road to advocate, adhere to, and elucidate socialism without the slightest wavering and the magnificent spiritual world of the members of the Workers' Party of Korea, who are endlessly loyal to socialism, will be manifest itself vigorously and the revolutionary struggle trait and way of life will dominate the whole party and society all the more. The meeting of party cell secretaries of the entire party will become a meeting that has epoch-making significance in the struggle to bring about a new upsurge in socialist construction by thoroughly implementing our party's revolutionary economic strategy. The meeting of party cell secretaries of the entire party will enhance the role of the party organizations at all levels and party cells to vigorously call forth all the party members and workers in the struggle to implement the party's revolutionary economic strategy. Through this meeting, the political work and work with the people will be carried out all the more vigorously at all working places of socialist construction where our party cells, party members, and workers are at work, and the justness and vitality of our party's method in which it firmly gives priority to ideology and revolution will manifest itself wholly. Therefore, the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude in all fields of socialist construction will manifest itself further, and an infinite number of new miracles and feats will be created. The meeting of party cell secretaries of the entire party will be brilliantly recorded in our party's history as a meeting of loyalty and filial piety enabling the party members and working people to become true loyalists and dutiful children, a meeting of our party and people's belief and will to complete socialist cause to the end with single-hearted might, and a meeting of the grand march to effect a revolutionary upsurge in socialist construction. The meeting of party cell secretaries of the entire party is a proud meeting that could only be held in our country where the historic cause of building an ever-victorious iron party upholding the great leader [suryong] and the great leader [yongdoja] has been most brilliantly achieved. The respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song has led the cause of the construction of our party straight to a single road of victory during the long period from his early days of revolution until today. During those days, he has consolidated brilliant and immortal achievements of the century. In our country, the historic cause of grounding the party's historical root and founding the party was achieved by the great leader, and the endlessly rich and lofty chuche lineage of our party was also established by the great leader. Our party, which was founded and fostered by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, has been able to more vigorously demonstrate its dignity and might by upholding the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il at the fore. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is a great leader [widaehan yongdoja] of the working class of our time for achieving the cause of party construction. The dear comrade leader plainly set forth unique party construction ideology and theories for building an ever-victorious party and brilliantly solved all theoretical and practical problems rising from enhancing the function and role of the party cells. Particularly, the dear comrade leader's immortal work "Let Us Strengthen the Party Cells" released on 10 May 1991 has great historical significance. Valuable guidelines have been provided for better fostering the party cells as a combat organization endlessly loyal to the party and the leader [suryong] due to the release of the immortal work, which is a synthesis of the fundamental questions of bringing up the party members as loyalists and dutiful children, organizing and giving guidance concerning party life, carrying out work involving the masses well, and of enhancing the role of the party cell secretaries. The ideological theory explained in the work is acquiring more vitality day after day due to its correctness and truth. Without the tested leadership of the dear comrade leader, who has always shown a great interest in strengthening and developing the party cells, we cannot talk about our party being strengthened and developed into a strong and mighty party consisting of hundreds of thousands of cells with strong combat capabilities, and we cannot imagine the party cell secretaries being loved and respected by the people while excellently fulfilling their roles as the core of our party. That is why the participants of today's meeting of party cell secretaries of the entire party, and all the party members and working people are paying their utmost honor to the dear comrade leader, who has strengthened and developed our party as an impregnable fortress, and are filled with firm resolution to share, to the end, the party's destiny, in any storm. Today, we are faced with the task of enhancing the party's leading role, smashing [chitpusida] all kinds of antisocialist maneuvers of the imperialists and reactionaries, and completing, to the end, the chuche revolutionary cause in conformity with the demand of the developing reality. To carry out the weighty and honorable task, all cells that comprise our party should excellently carry out their own functions and roles. "Let us make all the party cells loyal cells." This is an important slogan being put up by our party today, and this is the core task to be advocated by party organizations of various levels. On the occasion of the meeting of party cell secretaries of the entire party, the party organizations at each level must effect a new upsurge in the struggle of implementing the party's such slogan. Today, our party members' sense of loyalty and dutifulness to the party and the leader [suryong] are very high. All party members are living and working in a revolutionary manner by cherishing a firm determination that they want to become rifles and bombs in the course of resolutely safeguarding the leader [yongdoja] of the revolution and are overflowing with conviction of going through fire and water for a struggle to implement the party's policy. The party cells must glorify every moment of their lives with loyalty by cherishing in their hearts a high sense of dignity and pride that they are always the party members of the glorious WPK led by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. They must properly lead the party members to fully play a role, as the vanguard fighters, in the revolution and construction. The might of our party and socialism of our own style is the might of the single-hearted unity of the leader [suryong], the party, and the masses and, with this, we should vigorously carry out our revolution. This is an important purpose of this meeting. On the occasion of the meeting, the party organizations at each level must actively carry out the work of an ideology and indoctrination among the party members and working people and lead them to fight on for the leader [yongdoja] at the risk of their lives by having a firm position and viewpoint that their boundless happiness, future, and socialist fatherland exist because there is always the dear comrade leader. Along with this, all sectors and units must always firmly continue on the alert in conformity with the demands of the present situation. Also, they must lead all party members and working people to live and work with an invincible faith and revolutionary obligation, just like the anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters who resolutely safeguarded the respected and beloved comrade commander and the heroic combatants who protected the hill of the fatherland at the risk of their lives by keeping their pledge of loyalty made to the great leader [suryong] at the general meeting of party cell during the harsh Fatherland Liberation War. A long time has passed since the first party organization was formed in period of the dawning of the Korean revolution. During this period, our party cell has been developed and strengthened more strongly. Our party is great and our revolution's final victory is certain because it has the vigorous party cells, which have a combatant capacity that cannot be found in any places, in either its loyalty to the leader [yongdoja] or its function or role. All of us must hasten the independent reunification of the fatherland and the complete victory of socialism by continuously making an innovation and by moving forward, thus cherishing deep in their hearts the great dignity and pride of embarking upon the road of the party's guidance--invincible and ever-victorious--under the leadership of the great leader [yongdoja].
