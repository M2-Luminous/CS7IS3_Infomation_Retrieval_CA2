Key points of the new measures are seeking to assist expanded imports of foreign-made automobiles and auto parts, to promote market access by increasing the investigative staff of the Fair Trade Commission, for instance; and to strengthen competition. Macroeconomic topics which will be given further study include the issue of whether to continue tax cuts into 1995 and thereafter, as well as the possibility of revising the public investment basic plan. Specific measures on these matters will not be finalized until June. The government wants to break the ice in relations with the United States before the industrialized nations summit in July (Naples summit) by coming up with a series of measures. The overall foreign economic policies are composed of: 1) macroeconomic measures; 2) voluntary liberalization plans having four points: deregulation, import and investment promotion, strengthening competition, and expanded government procurement; and 3) market-opening measures in the priority areas of the Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks such as government procurement of telecommunications and medical equipment; insurance, and expanded imports of automobiles and auto parts. As for those points which cannot be finalized by the end of March, the government will inform the United States that it will continue to study them and will work to finalize them by June, before the Naples summit. In a new measure with respect to expanded imports of automobiles and auto parts, Japan is to provide information on auto registrations (individual registration data) -- the information under the control of the Transportation Ministry -- for a fee to foreign auto manufacturers through the Japan Automobile Imports Association. Using the information on sales activities per se will be prohibited from the perspective of protecting privacy, but the information is believed to be useful in carrying out surveys and analyzing the Japanese market. As a way of helping expand the imports of auto parts, an office for consultations on foreign-made parts will be created at the Japan Automobile Maintenance Companies Association, which is the industrial organization representing auto servicing companies. In addition, the government will sponsor receptions and business meetings of foreign auto manufacturers' missions to promote the exports of their products to Japan, as well as seminars on Japan's service parts market. The government will also issue instructions to the auto service industry asking it not to discriminate against foreign-made parts. Because auto companies plan to announce starting from this week their own plans, aside from the government's measures, on expanded purchases of foreign-made auto parts, the government is thinking about referring to these private sector plans in its measures as well. In the area of strengthening competition -- the area in which the United States is interested -- the government wants to announce an increase in investigative personnel at the Fair Trade Commission to help improve capabilities for uncovering instances, such as bid rigging, of violating the Antimonopoly Law. Another measure requires guidelines on public works bidding to specifically warn against violations of the Antimonopoly Law.
