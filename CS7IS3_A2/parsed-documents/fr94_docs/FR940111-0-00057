FR940111-0-00057 FR940111-0-00015 Response. The EPA agrees with the commenter and encourages States to develop clear agreements as to which functions are being performed by which agencies. Note in particular that section 174 of the Act requires States to jointly review and update, as necessary, their planning procedures that were in effect before the Act was amended in 1990 or to develop new procedures as appropriate. In preparing such procedures, State and local elected officials must determine which elements of a revised SIP will be developed, adopted, and implemented by the State, and which elements will be carried out by local or regional entities. The EPA has provided guidance on this and other section 174 requirements in a document entitled ``1992 Transportation and Air Quality Planning Guidelines'' (July 1992, EPA 420/R&hyph;92&hyph;001). The EPA will work with the State and the political subdivision to ascertain if this criterion has been met. In addition, any comments raised as to this issue during the rulemaking process on a specific section 110(m) action will be properly considered by EPA. 5. Comment. Concerning Criterion 4 [ยง52.30(c)(4)], the U.S. DOT also comments there should be a provision included to provide against ``State failure.'' If a local agency cancels an agreement to perform a certain function, it might leave the State without the time or resources to perform the function. Thus, the State, instead of the local agency, would become principally responsible. The U.S. DOT believes it would be inappropriate to apply statewide sanctions in such a case. Response. If the local agency cancels its agreement to perform a function, EPA would take this into consideration when determining whether the political subdivision is principally responsible in causing the deficiency. Moreover, this factor may be considered in determining the area to which it is reasonable and appropriate to apply sanctions. The EPA can consider all factors in determining what area is reasonable and appropriate. 6. Comment. The Massachusetts DOT believes the rule should contain a specific provision for State consultation in determining principal responsibility because many factors such as regional demographic trends, changing local traffic patterns, and land-use decisions in adjoining areas have a larger impact on emissions than institutional arrangements for air quality planning. The proposed criteria may be the best way to evaluate whether the State or the political subdivision is solely responsible for the emissions requirements, but it may not be relevant in targeting the actual source of the problem or in defining solutions. Response. To the extent it determines appropriate, EPA will consult with the State when evaluating the criteria under section 110(m). In any event, the State will have adequate opportunity to raise any such concerns in the comment period following the notice of proposed rulemaking for imposition of section 110(m) sanctions. D. Other Relevant Comments 1. Comment. The State of Vermont comments that it is the only State in attainment with the ozone national ambient air quality standards and also located within the Northeast Ozone Transport Region. Vermont requests clarification in the rule of whether attainment status or inclusion in the ozone transport region (OTR) is the deciding factor with respect to applicability of these rules. Response. Neither attainment status nor inclusion in the OTR is the deciding factor. Under section 110(m), EPA may impose sanctions on a statewide basis or on any area of the State deemed reasonable and appropriate based on the failure of the State or a political subdivision of the State to meet a requirement of the Act with respect to a plan or plan element. If a requirement is applicable to a political subdivision of the State, EPA will determine whether that political subdivision was principally responsible for the failure, using the criteria established in this rulemaking. The EPA's ability to use the section 110(m) sanctions is not limited to nonattainment areas or areas that must meet the title I, part D nonattainment requirements. 2. Comment. The City of Chicago comments that the term ``required activity'' contravenes the definition of required activity in section 179 and permits EPA to sanction entities without providing any prior notice that EPA considers a particular action to be sanctionable. The City of Chicago also comments that since section 110(m) incorporates section 179(a), EPA is not permitted to create a second, conflicting definition. Furthermore, the proposed definition does not identify covered activities, and it does not give entities prior notice of sanctionable activities. Finally, the City of Chicago is concerned about the ambiguity of the definition and that it may mean EPA is expanding the definition from section 179(a).
