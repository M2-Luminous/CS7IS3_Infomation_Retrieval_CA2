"We are going work for a negotiated settlement," in Sopheap, a representative for the guerrillas in Phnom Penh, told AFP. The comments contrasted with a combative statement made earlier Monday by Khmer Rouge radio. The Khmer Rouge representative could not confirm rumors circulating here that the guerrillas' nominal leader, Khieu Samphan, would soon be arriving in Phnom Penh. Cambodia's co-Prime Minister, Hun Sen, told AFP Monday that the government "left the door open" to negotiations with the Khmer Rouge. Cambodian government forces launched a major offensive against Khmer Rouge-held territories early this month either to flush out the guerrillas or force them to the negotiating table. The government, elected under UN-sponsored elections in May 1993, wants to take back full control of the country to establish stability and enhance international investment and spur the economy. The Khmer Rouge has demanded representation in the government, but has refused to give up its weapons or cede areas under its control, which are mostly along the border with Thailand. Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk, who was treated for cancer in Beijing the last six months, is expected to return to Phnom Penh April 8 and hopes to restart negotiations with the Khmer Rouge, said the country's foreign minister, Prince Norodom Sirivut. The negotiations were suspended in mid-January, but Hun Sen added, "Our position has not changed. We are keeping the door open. We are also thinking of the possibility of a meeting when the king (Sihanouk) returns." Hun Sen said: "The Royal Cambodian Government is ready to join the discussions." But a representative of the "hardline" anti-Khmer Rouge faction said, "I am not sure if the (Khmer Rouge) problem can be resolved." The offensive against Pailin was decided in concert with the Sihanoukists, represented in the government by Prince Norodom Ranaridh, co-prime minister, and supporters of Hun Sen. Hun Sen said, citing military sources, that former Khmer Rouge chieftain Pol Pot, who still controls the guerrilla movement of 8,000 soldiers despite his official retirement, was with the group's leaders in the village of Kum Reang, a few kilometers (miles) north of Pailin, during the government offensive. "They left two days before the fall of Pailin," he said, without saying where they were headed. Pailin, the Khmer Rouge stronghold near Thailand, fell on March 19, according to the government, or March 22, witnesses at the scene said. Khmer Rouge leaders have veiled themselves in almost total secrecy since the group's founding in the early 1960s. About 85 Khmer Rouge soldiers were killed in the defense of Pailin, Phnom Penh said. Government losses, without official estimates, are estimated at several dozen killed or wounded. Pailin, rich in rubies, has helped finance the rebel movement since 1989 with contracts from the Thai business community.
