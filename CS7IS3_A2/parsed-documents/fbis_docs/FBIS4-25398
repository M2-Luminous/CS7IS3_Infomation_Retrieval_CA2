Japan should contribute to the revitalization of the global economy by offering positive assistance to other Asian countries in their efforts to help themselves, while maintaining and expanding its own dynamic growth, said the white paper on economic cooperation for the fiscal year 1994. It added that Japan should expand its direct investment in and imports from other Asian countries. The white paper, prepared by the International Trade and Industry Ministry, described the newly-industrializing economies (NIES) in Asia and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as "the growth center for world economic development." The report consists of three parts -- current trends in the developing countries, countries aiming at further development through the utilization of the market mechanism and the expansion of dynamism in Asia. It said that gross domestic product (GDP) last year in the developing countries showed a stable growth of 6.1 percent. The growth in Asia reached 8.4 percent, while favorable growth was observed in the Middle East and in Central and South America. On the other hand, economic growth remained sluggish in Africa, the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, the report said. It paid particular attention to China, Vietnam and India, devoting much space to analyzing various problems related to economic reform in these countries. "China has achieved rapid growth again, as in the previous year, by gradually promoting reform and more open policies since the introduction of a market economy," the report said. The country's trade and investment have expanded and inter- dependence with the world economy has deepened, especially in China's coastal areas. But the paper noted that China still faced many problems, such as regional differences between the rapidly-growing coastal areas and the inland areas where the infrastructure is weak. It said Japan's overseas aid in 1992 fell by 36.3 percent to 15,944 million U.S. dollars, smooth growth in official development assistance (ODA) being more than offset by a substantial drop in private-sector aid. Japan's ODA in 1992 totalled 11,332 billion dollars, making the country the top donor in the world for the second consecutive year, the report said.
