The importance of trade-economic relations has drastically increased now that Russia and Hungary have overcome the past and have no serious political problems, said. Geographic closeness of Russia and Hungary and years-old traditional bilateral contacts are very important. The two countries know each other's conditions, customs and potential market abilities and have a developed communications network for economic relations. Cooperation reserves are huge, stressed the premier. Viktor Chernomyrdin called for encouragement of new forms of business cooperation, creation of joint ventures and banks, mutual participation in investment processes and privatization programs in Hungary and Russia. He thinks that production cooperation and direct relations of Hungarian and Russian plans are a priority area. There are also reserves of regional cooperation. "We value high Hungarian experience in this sphere. Hungary has been active in Tatarstan, Bashkortostan, the Komi Republic and the Stavropol territory," he said. Speaking of the Russian economic situation, Chernomyrdin stressed that Russian market economy has been created and will be further developed. "We are determined to follow this path no matter how hard it might be. Russian problems cannot be solved at once. Any haste can rather spoil the situation, provoke social tension and break the economic reforms," noted the Russian prime minister.
