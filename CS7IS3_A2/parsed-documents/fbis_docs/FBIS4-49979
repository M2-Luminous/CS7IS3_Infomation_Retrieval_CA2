Officials close to the negotiations said the British were "shocked" when told that the promised new naval base for the People's Liberation Army (PLA) on Stonecutters Island was "too small." The Chinese have also reneged on a promise to allow some residential property occupied by the British military to be redeveloped. The PLA now wants to use the property to house its own soldiers. Chinese negotiators were also reluctant to agree on specific wording that any unused sites after the 1997 handover must be given to the special administrative region government. The PLA, a powerful behind-the-scenes influence during the seven-year talks, is thought to be responsible for the new demands. These unexpected setbacks emerged after the second day of Joint Liaison Group (JLG) talks in Hong Kong yesterday. A source said that the British side had thought that everything was in place and a final agreement had been expected tomorrow. Officials said it was unlikely that Britain could meet China's new demands. The government's original idea was to pay for the PLA naval base on Stonecutters Island with the profits received from the sale of the military flats. If those flats had to be released to the PLA, officials said, the Government would have to draw from its reserve funds to build the new naval base. It would be hard to win Legislative Council approval for this. It is believed that during the last JLG defence land expert meeting the two sides agreed the size of the new naval base would be about 160,000 square metres. It was estimated the government would have to pay more than $1bn for its construction. China's new demands mean that seven years of talks have failed to reach agreement about the disposal of military lands. This will create a bad atmosphere at the JLG general session scheduled for May 31. During the two-day meeting, according to sources, British negotiators tried deseparately to remind their Chinese colleagues of all those matters that Britain assumed had been agreed by China before the meeting. China had reportedly agreed to release about 25 sites to the government for redevelopment, including Royden Court in Repulse Bay, Mt Austin Mansion at the Peak, Cape Mansion, Harcourt Place in Happy Valley, Tudor Court in Kowloon, and Burma Lines in Fanling. Of 11 main military sites, the PLA was expected to get about eight, including the Prince of Wales building in Central, the naval base on Stonecutters Island, the Gun Club Hill site in Kowloon, which will be used to build a military hospital for the PLA, Stanley Fort, and the barracks in Osborn [Kowloon Tong] and Sek Kong. The Chinese JLG officials will be shown some sites today, after which the talks will continue.
