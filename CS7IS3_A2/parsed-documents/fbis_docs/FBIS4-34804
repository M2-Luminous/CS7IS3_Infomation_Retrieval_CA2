Barberousse referred to the exile offer extended by President Bill Clinton to the regime headed by Lieutenant General Raoul Cedras, whereby its leaders would not be victimized or prosecuted. The diplomat explained that President Jean-Bernard Aristide has agreed to grant political amnesty, but that common crimes would not be covered by this. He stressed that common crimes must be resolved under common law. With regard to whether or not Haiti's powerful economic class has offered the military hierarchy bribes to leave the country, Barberousse said that although this sector would be interested in stabilizing the situation, it is also a fact that they sponsored the coup d'etat against Aristide. If they were to make such an arrangement, it would be among themselves, he said. Regarding the problem posed by the 150 undocumented Haitians who are currently in Panama, and to whom the Directorate of Immigration has granted permits to remain in Panama while their return to Port-au-Prince is being arranged, Barberousse said the embassy has not yet received an official statement from the Panamanian Government. Nevertheless, Barberousse expressed concern over the situation this group of Haitians will face. They will not be allowed to work and will not be provided with the means to survive. Under these conditions, he said, they could easily become the victims of crime. Barberousse commented on one aspect of the remarks made by Immigration Director Antonio Dominguez, who banned the Haitians from practicing voodoo. "I believe there is certain evidence of cultural insensitivity," said the charge d'affaires, who pointed out that all peoples have their own values, idiosyncrasies, cultures, and religions, and to deny a people these things is intolerable. Barberousse defended the Haitian ancestral religion as one of his people's values, just as Catholicism, Buddhism, and other religions reflect other values. It is a religion that is also a way of life and deals with relations between humans and God; it has positive as well as negative aspects, and the former outweigh the latter. Barberousse added that the negative aspects have been exploited by foreigners who go to Haiti to attempt to resolve their problems. Meanwhile, Panamanian Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino announced yesterday that his office is trying to make arrangements for the 150 undocumented Haitians to return to their country on flights coordinated by the national government. Mulino pointed out that since COPA flights will be suspended on 26 June, arrangements are being made to schedule two flights before that date. "If, for some reason, a group is unable to get seats on the scheduled COPA flights, we could do what we have done in the past -- in other words, issue permits for one or two more flights to return to Haiti those left behind," he said. According to the foreign minister, this procedure would not constitute a violation of international laws governing the matter. "My interest," Mulino underscored, "is to return these people to their country of origin, because in Panama we have enough unemployment and security problems of our own, and we do not have the economic capability to maintain all of them, even though their reasons for fleeing their country are justified."
