Trilateral negotiations between the government, the African National Congress and the Freedom Alliance, of which the IFP is a member, are to resume on Thursday in a last-ditch effort to ensure the alliance's participation in the election. The IFP Central Committee in a statement on Wednesday night also expressed concern that the lack of progress in separate negotiations on the position of the Zulu king and kingdom would "impair the ability of (the) conference to consider what course of action to adopt and to come to a final decision as to the IFP's responsibility to South Africa in regard to the forthcoming elections".
