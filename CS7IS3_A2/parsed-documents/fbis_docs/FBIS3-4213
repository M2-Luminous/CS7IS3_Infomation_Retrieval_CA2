The working-level talks continued to center on the three issues originally planned for discussion. The ARATS presented a number of new proposals based on its study of the SEF's views. However, the two sides were not able to narrow their differences and reach an agreement. After the talks, ARATS Deputy Secretary General Sun Yafu told reporters: [Begin recording] Personnel of the two sides held general discussions this afternoon touching on the three issues discussed in the last couple of days. The first issue concerns the repatriation of personnel who entered the areas of the other side in violation of the relevant regulations. On this issue, each side essentially discussed matters that need to be considered by the other side. The second issue concerns the repatriation of hijackers across the Taiwan Strait.

He said he believed that although the two sides encountered difficulties, the ARATS is willing to continue the talks. He said: [Begin recording] These working-level talks were based on the common understanding reached between the persons in charge of the ARATS and SEF during their previous talks in Beijing. They pledged to honor the understanding and hoped that agreement could be reached as soon as possible. It should be pointed out that the two sides did not reach a common understanding on all issues. They clearly reached a common understanding on certain issues while approaching agreement on others. It is our hope that the two sides will conduct the current working-level talks based on the Beijing talks. During the talks, both the SEF and ARATS may also talk about additional issues raised by the other side. This is a question of following the rules on contacts and talks between the two sides. To make the talks successful, we are willing to continue the talks. [end recording] It was learned that the ARATS and SEF will decide through discussions on the evening of 27 March whether or not to continue the talks. SEF Deputy Secretary General Xu Huiyou [Hsu Hui-yu] said that SEF Deputy Secretary General Shi Chiping [Shih Chi-ping] was not able to arrive in Beijing on schedule and that the date of his arrival would be decided by Taipei.
