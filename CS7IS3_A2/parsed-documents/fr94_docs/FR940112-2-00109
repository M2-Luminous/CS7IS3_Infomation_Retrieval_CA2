The exemption became effective on December 24, 1993. The lines being acquired, by subdivision, include the following: (a) Santa Fe's line on the Los Angeles Harbor Subdivision between milepost 27.6 and milepost 28.3 in the County of Los Angeles; and the connection track between SPT's San Pedro Branch and Santa Fe's Watson Yard; (b) SPT's line from the connection with UP switch at the east side of Santa Fe Avenue easterly of ``J'' Yard, milepost BG 486.17 (San Pedro Branch) southeasterly through ``J'' Yard and a portion of the SPT's Santa Monica Branch to a point of connection with the San Pedro Branch milepost BBM 484.99 (Wilmington Branch) then southerly paralleling Alameda Street to a crossing of the Wilmington Branch at Dominguez Junction milepost BG 496.50 (San Pedro Branch) crossing over to the Wilmington Branch southerly to a point southerly of Sepulveda Boulevard and merging into the San Pedro Branch with the Wilmington Branch terminating at the Santa Fe's Harbor Subdivision Thernard Crossing milepost BBM 501.20 (Wilmington Branch) and milepost BG 501.4 (San Pedro Branch) and the San Pedro Branch continuing southerly and southeasterly through the Port of Los Angeles to approximately 22nd Street in San Pedro and also including to the legs of the West Wye and the Long Beach Branch from the San Pedro Branch into the Port of Long Beach and terminating south of the 8th Street Yard milepost BH 503.73 (Long Beach Branch); and (c) UP's line from a connection with SPT's ``J'' Yard at the east side of Santa Fe Avenue in Los Angeles milepost 1.8 via Redondo Jct. and Bridge Jct. to a connection with the East Bank main line at Ninth St. Jct. milepost 0.97; from Bridge Jct. on the aforesaid line milepost 1.30 to Soto St. Jct. milepost 2.08 (a distance of approximately 500 feet); from Soto St. Jct. milepost 2.08 to Downey Road milepost 2.88; and from milepost 2.84 near Downey Road to Hobart Junction milepost 3.08 on the San Pedro Branch north of Santa Fe's at-grade crossing; and the San Pedro Branch from milepost 21.71 to milepost 23.73 in the County of Los Angeles. Santa Fe, SPT, and UP are to retain trackage rights and/or permanent easements over those portions of property on which they currently conduct rail operations so as to continue rail freight service. According to the Cities, their acquisition of the described property interests from Santa Fe, SPT, and UP will not confer common carrier status on the Cities, and the Cities reserve their right to file a motion to dismiss this notice or subsequently to seek revocation of the exemption. If we subsequently find that we lack jurisdiction over these transactions, we will enter a supplemental order vacating this exemption. Any comments must be filed with the Commission and served on: Samuel M. Sipe, Jr., Steptoe & Johnson, 1330 Connecticut Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20036. This notice is filed under 49 CFR 1150.31. If the notice contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void ab initio . Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke will not automatically stay the transaction. Decided: January 5, 1994. By the Commission, David M. Konschnik, Director, Office of Proceedings. Sidney L. Strickland, Jr., Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;769 Filed 1&hyph;11&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7035&hyph;01&hyph;P
