When the masses of cadres, especially the high-ranking party and government leading cadres, acquire a thorough knowledge of the theories in this work, it will indeed ensure unity in thinking; reinforce our conviction; and facilitate active, comprehensive, and correct implementation of the Party's basic line. Comrade Jiang Zemin spoke at the study report meeting and gave an incisive exposition of the theme of The Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping: "Only socialism can save China; only socialism can develop China. The socialism we uphold is a socialism with Chinese characteristics." The quintessence of this theory is its liberated ideas and its practical and realistic approach which are inherently unifying in nature. Through extensive practice and in the course of probing, studying, formulating, and perfecting this theory, we should discard some principles and some bookish, dogmatic ways we understand Marxism as well as some unscientific and even distorted interpretation of Marxism, and we should abandon incorrect ideas that are beyond the early stage of socialism. On the other hand, we must firmly oppose those erroneous viewpoints that basically reject socialism but insist on using a dialectic materialist and historical materialist world-outlook and methodology to analyze and solve problems. Comrade Jiang Zemin's exposition no doubt will play an important role in guiding our study of The Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. When we study The Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, of course we must first study the original and understand its gist, but we must also link it to reality, including today's reality and the practices of the past decade or so, for only then can we learn and apply what we have learned and actively, comprehensively, and correctly implement the party's basic line and accomplish various socialist modernization tasks and in turn forge a closer relationship among the party, the government, and the masses and acquire high esteem to lead the masses to struggle for our new cause. While studying The Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, Volume 3, I thought about some of the basic knowledge we have accumulated in practice over the past several decades and the work we have done in the last 10 years or so in the course of constructing a socialism with Chinese characteristics. Here, I want to discuss some of my own crude and simplistic viewpoints, and I welcome criticisms and comments from the readers. The first matter that requires proper handling is the relationship between politics and economics. Economics is the base, and politics is the centralized manifestation of economics. Politics is built on, but also counteracts on, the economic base, and under certain conditions, politics can even decide a nation's economic rise or fall. In his later years, Engels once wrote a letter in which he talked about the counteraction of politics (state power) on economic development. He said politics could make the economy develop faster, but it could also cause the economy to collapse (see Selected Works of Marx and Engels, vol 4 pp 483 and 486.) In practice, we often have trouble handling the relationship between politics and economics, and we often have disagreements and arguments. In essence, the focus of contention over the way the Eighth National Party Congress worded the country's major contradictions at that time and questioned whether the party's central task should be shifted was also on the relationship between politics and economics. The opinion that the party's central task should be gradually shifted to concentrate our energy on developing the productive forces was a correct one at that time. But in 1957, the year after the Eighth National Party Congress ratified the decision, the anti-rightist struggle expanded: In early 1958, the so called "criticism of people who stood against rash advances" became a political issue. Later, serious mistakes were made in the Great Leap Forward and in the commune system when we attempted to speed up the development of the productive forces and change the productive relationships. That was followed by the Lushan Conference during which Comrade Peng Dehuai's correct ideas were criticized as rightist opportunism and anti-socialist thinking. A massive counter-rightist movement ensued. These approaches not only did not protect or develop the productive forces but actually ruined them, just like Engels had said; it brought the economy to the brink of collapse. In 1963, when we just began to overcome our economic difficulties, just when agricultural and industrial productions were recovering and were going to move forward again, we were interrupted by the "Four Clean-Up" movement [clean up politics, ideology, organization, and the economy.] By the time of the "Cultural Revolution," the two counterrevolutionary groups under Lin Biao and Jiang Qing used politics as an excuse to greatly exaggerate the class struggle. They also tried in vain to ruin the economy and cause the social productive forces to stall and move backwards and widen the gap between us and the Western capitalist nations. One of the root causes of China's erroneous "leftist" guiding ideologies in those 20 years was the mixed-up relationship between politics and economics. Practices that only stressed politics and alienated economics, or we should say the method of using politics that violated the laws of economics to direct the economy, seriously jeopardized the development of the social productive forces. It was a very profound lesson. History has already drawn for us the following simple conclusion: Politics that do not follow the laws of economics, and politics that do not serve the economy do not facilitate and can even jeopardize the development of the social productive forces and in turn obstruct the reinforcement of the socialist system. After the proletariat obtains political power and stabilizes the political situation, it should stand firm and concentrate its strength on developing society's productive forces. But history has also provided us with experience of another kind: If economic development deviates from the correct political leadership, it can lose its way and embark on the wrong road, a winding road, or a crooked road, producing many social problems which can turn around to cause political harm and hurt the leadership. The greatest victory of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Party Central Committee was its firm decision to shift the focus of the party's tasks and the attention of the nation's people to the socialist modernization process. In a little more than a decade, China's socialist modernization has obtained glorious results and has displayed its own characteristics. This is an integral part of correct political leadership. The two basic points determined by the party's basic line, namely, the four basic principles and reform and opening up, give expression to unity of politics and economics and to their ability to promote each other and restrain each other, and the party is correct on this. But we must also point out that because of weakened political ideology education, and because of the abuse of power for personal gains and other improper behavior among party and government cadres and among workers in various trades and industries, extreme individualism, money worship, hedonism, money-before-everything mentality, and other improper ideas have sprung up within the party and in society. Bourgeois liberalism ran amuck on several occasions, economic development surged and plummeted, the industrial structure deteriorated, and profit fell and so on, and all these have an adverse effect on the comprehensive and correct implementation of the party's basic line. It is clear that the basic problem lies in the inconsistent handling of the relationship between politics and economics. Before the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Party Central Committee, everything had been politically-oriented to the point of ignoring the economy, but in the last decade or so, the economy has taken precedence and politics has been slighted or even ignored. In opposing the one-sided approach of letting politics determine the economy, some comrades go to the other extreme to produce another kind of one-sidedness, which is to overlook the active counteraction of politics on the economy and to deny that under certain conditions, politics can play a leadership role or even commanding role in the economy. The substantive manifestation of this role is the party's unified and correct leadership, and the concrete work it performs is strong and effective education in political ideologies. After the "4 June" disturbance, Comrade Deng Xiaoping hit the nail on the head when he pointed out that, "If a mistake has been made, it would be our lack of consistency in upholding the four basic principles and our failure to make that our basic thinking in educating the people, the students, and the entire body of cadres and communist members. The nature of that incident was a contention between bourgeois liberalization and the four upholds." (see The Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping Vol 3 p 305.) An extension of the relationship between politics and economics is the question of how to correctly handle the relationship between material civilization and spiritual civilization when constructing socialism. Upon obtaining political power, it has been the theme of the Communist Party members to develop the social productive forces and construct a material civilization at a rate faster than that of the capitalist nations. A nation without economic power will have no place in this world and eventually will be subjugated by those who subscribe to hegemonism. But to develop the productive forces at high speed, we need two things: First, the party and the state must have a correct construction line and a set of general and specific policies. Second, the masses of cadres and the people must be willing to engage in arduous struggle for the sake of socialist modernization. To attain the second condition, we must focus on the construction of the spiritual civilization. Of the great economic powers in the world today, some nations, such as the United States, rely mainly on their superior natural conditions, the rich endowment left by their ancestors, and their control and exploitation of the third world nations. Others, such as Germany and Japan, who were defeated in the war, rely mainly on their own people's arduous struggle and advanced science and technology and management methods. China's natural conditions are fairly good, and we have a fine national tradition of arduous struggle and self-reliance. So long as we have the above two conditions, and if we truly unite, overcome hardship and learn, and do some hard and solid work for a few decades, we will be able to catch up with the economic powers. Of course, they too are developing, and to catch up with or even surpass them, we must work many times harder. With respect to the idea of focusing on the two civilizations at the same time, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has already talked about it at a meeting with the central delegation from India's Communist Party (Marxist Party) back in April of 1983. His famous words are, "To construct a socialist spiritual civilization, it is fundamental that the masses of people share the communist ideal and have morals, culture, and discipline" (The Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping Vol 3 p 28.) To let the readers understand why the Party Central Committee put so much emphasis on strengthening spiritual civilization back then, we should cite a passage from a written speech delivered by Comrade Chen Yun in June 1985: "When constructing the socialist material civilization, if we do not construct a socialist spiritual civilization at the same time, our material civilization may deviate from the right direction. If a unit or a leading comrade forgets or relaxes his grip on the construction of the socialist spiritual civilization, we will not succeed in constructing the material civilization. Even more serious is that we may deviate from the socialist and communist ideals. That can be very dangerous." (The Selected Works of Chen Yun (1956-1985) p 301.) We were forewarned, and with sincere words and earnest wishes too, but the facts were, back then bourgeois liberalism was beginning to run rampant and was getting a certain amount of support from the party general secretary, Comrade Hu Yaobang, who continuously diminished the construction of spiritual civilization and curtailed political ideology education. To those elements who were dissatisfied with the socialist system at that time, compared to the dazzling world and pleasures of Western capitalism, socialist and communist ideals were but illusions of the primitive men. They found no redeeming value in the then flourishing Chinese socialist modernization, and they believed that everything the Western world had to offer was perfect, and as a result, talks of all-out Westernization began to appear and words demanding the abolition of the communist leadership also spread; opinions that encouraged eating, drinking, and the pursuit of happiness and even the pursuit of money also appeared in the newspapers. In fact they were abandoning the spiritual civilization whose goal was to pursue communist ideals, morals, and discipline. This kind of bourgeois liberalism which rejected the ideologies of the four basic principles and wholeheartedly yearned for capitalism indeed poisoned the minds of the party members and cadres and the masses in a broad and profound way. In particular, when Zhao Ziyang was general secretary, he blatantly supported and indulged this kind of thinking and surrounded himself with many mainstay elements. The most striking evil consequence was the political upheaval and counterrevolutionary disturbance that erupted in the capital in 1989. Ideology may seem abstract, but it, like the political system, is the superstructure built on the economic base; its counteraction on the economy is strong, and it also plays an important role in guiding the political direction. To the communists and revolutionaries, the communist ideology we often speak of is the supreme value outlook; it is also the outstanding feature that separates them from other people. Communist party members must discipline themselves, propagate this most noble of ideologies among the people, conduct effective political ideology education, and get rid of some of society's unhealthy ideologies and workstyle and traditional practices. We still have a long way to go before achieving communism, but we must not abandon that ideal, for if we do, our nation will be like a body without a soul; it will quickly decay and will be rendered beyond help, and eventually we will be trampled by those who believe in hegemonism and will become the laughing stalk of the world. The above is the second issue, that is, we must emphasize material civilization and spiritual civilization at the same time, and if more problems should emerge in our spiritual civilization, we must make a even greater effort to strengthen that area. The third matter below has to do with the relationship between the productive forces and productive relations. The productive relations must adapt to the development of the productive forces. As the productive forces develop, the original productive relations must change; otherwise, they will obstruct the development of the productive forces. In the course of our socialist construction, we have inadvertently produced two erroneous tendencies: First, we believed that by continuously changing the productive relations, the productive forces would develop at high speed. The successful completion of the three transformations of socialism led people to have unrealistic ideas, and very soon after the start of the "Great Leap Forward," the nation began to install the commune system, believing that it would greatly improve the productive relations and speed up the development of the productive forces. The result was total disaster. But for a long period thereafter, there was another kind of erroneous tendency: We ignored any improvement in the productive relations and stuck to old conventions, and as a result, China's economy stalled. The general policy of reform and opening up proposed after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Party Central Committee in essence wanted China's productive relations to adjust to the development of the productive forces and promote a high rate of economic growth. Facts show that this decision by the Party Central Committee was entirely correct; the results have been outstanding. China proceeded with step-by-step reform and opening up, first in the rural areas, and upon gaining some experience, shifted the focus to the urban areas, slowly paving the road to a socialist modernization with Chinese characteristics. We still have a long way to go, but we have a lot of experience which we must continuously review and sum up. The Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, Volume 3, discussed this in detail and gave it a highly theoretical summation. Changing the productive relations is a very complicated matter. It involves the administration of political power and the workings of the economic system and often can trigger sudden changes in the overall situation. That is why on this matter we must oppose conservative tendencies that reject changes and encourage complacency, but we must also oppose rash moves and impatient approaches. The laws of development of all things require deep probing, repeated tests, and extensive practices, and only then can we understand the laws of their internal relationship. Many important people in the world have discovered the objective laws of natural science and social sciences. They have all struggled long and hard and have experienced many failures before succeeding. Whether our reform will succeed or fail is not determined by our subjective will; we must go through the test of actual practice, and we must go through repeated tests before drawing conclusions. This means we must constantly review our experiences, acquire more knowledge, and let knowledge set us free and not just think that things are inevitable. In other words, we must comply with the gist of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of constructing a socialism with Chinese characteristics and unify liberated thinkings with practicality and reality, and only in that way can we succeed in restructuring various systems and avoid mistakes. The fourth matter we want to discuss here is about upholding the public ownership system as the primary system among the socialist market economic mechanisms we set up in the early stage of socialism. In simple terms, the capitalist market economic mechanisms are built on the foundation of the private ownership system. It utilizes the law of value to regulate supply and demand and market prices. The socialist market economic mechanisms are built on the foundation of the public ownership system. In essence, we should use both planning and the market as means of regulation to guide the economy along the socialist path. For many years, the capitalist nations have been utilizing indirect planning and regulation, economic measures, and administrative interventions to supplement the market economy and ease the conflict between socialized production and private ownership of means of production, and in terms of organization, they have used enterprise groups and economic integration and other ways to concentrate their economic strength and in turn reduce the crisis elements in the market economy. This is progress in the way the capitalist nations control the way their economic system works. Ours is a socialist nation. From the beginning, we have implemented a highly centralized planned economic system, and back then, that system indeed played an effective role in promoting the rapid development of the productive forces. The First 5-Year Plan successfully centralized the financial and human resources to lay a tentative foundation for our socialist industrialization. That success was an integral part of the highly centralized planned economic system. But even back then, our party had already realized that over-centralization was not good for the economy, and it prompted them to suggest putting large projects under planning while giving small undertakings a free hand. Comrade Chen Yun spoke at the Eighth National Party Congress held in 1956 and proposed relaxing market control. He subsequently was responsible for drafting the provisions on improving the industrial, commercial, and financial management systems. They were never carried out because of the Great Leap Forward Movement. In 1979, Comrade Chen Yun spoke in no uncertain terms on the idea of using market regulations to supplement economic planning. That in fact marked the beginning of the restructuring of China's single-track planned management system. Of course, in the several years after reform and opening up began, we first combined economic planning and market regulations and then we decided to implement the socialist market economic system. It has been a gradual, step-by-step process. But it should also be pointed out that making a decision in principle with respect to a system and the actual practice of that system are two different matters. It takes time for the cadres to grasp the principles and apply them, and in practice, there are many things we must probe, experiment with, understand better, and continue to improve. In short, today's popular idea of getting rid of planned regulations completely is not right and can even be harmful, because if we did that, wouldn't we be returning to the early form of capitalist economic management? Shoudn't we give the confusion in our economic life caused by the relaxation of macro regulation and control in the last two years some serious thoughts? On this matter, there is another important thing we want to point out, and that is, today, some people are directly or indirectly advocating replacing the public-ownership system as the main system in the socialist market economy and minimizing the share of the state-owned economy. A handful of economists even believe that the public-ownership system is but a means while developing the productive forces is the true goal, which can be achieved by any other means. According to such theory, we do not need any kind of ownership system with respect to the means of production, because it matters not who owns them. To put it plainly, they want to abandon socialism to set up a market system for the early-to-intermediate stage of capitalism. As we said earlier, even the capitalist nations are utilizing indirect planning as means to regulate the economy. On this matter, neither The Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping nor the party Central Committee's resolution has ever abandoned the principle that the public ownership system must be the main system during reform and opening up. If the public-ownership system is not the primary system, and without the state-owned enterprises serving as mainstay in particular, what will be left of socialism? Where will reform and opening up be heading? Some people want to diminish and even disband the large state-owned enterprises, saying that they are inefficient, that they lose money, and that they are a heavy burden and should be discarded. We have many large state-owned enterprises. We began setting them up under the First Five-Year Plan; it has been more than 30 years, and during this long period, has anyone bothered to figure out how much money they have made for the state and how much they have contributed? Old workers who went through fire and water from the early days of the founding of the nation to just before the Cultural Revolution and who toiled night and day to lay the foundation for today's socialist economy have given their lives to the state and to the people. Shouldn't the state take care of them now? Today, there are some so called communist party members and state cadres who call themselves revolutionaries who won't find ways to curb the problem of people wining and dining on billion yuan's worth of public funds a year; they don't worry about how to stop the draining of state funds to the tune of 100 million yuan a day. Instead they want to get rid of the millions of old retired workers who have worked all their lives but who are getting a very small pension today. They don't think about the 80 million peasants and herdsmen in the poverty-stricken areas who don't have enough to eat or to keep them warm. They even boast that "state-run businesses are not as good as collectives, and collectives are not as good as privately-own businesses, and private businesses are not as good as wholly foreign-owned or joint venture businesses." Isn't it clear what these people want? Is it realistic to ask them to serve the people with all their hearts and minds? People who want to diminish or remove the primary role of the public-ownership system and attempt to change the nature of the state-owned enterprises, regardless of how they feel subjectively, are in fact trying to topple socialism. Practice is the only criterion in testing the truth. What kind of conclusion will history draw about these people? Everything will become clear in practice. Here we must say something about centralization and decentralization of power. In the past, power was over-concentrated in the hands of the central government, and all human and material resources were controlled by the relevant government departments. These defects have been in existence all along. In recent years in particular, abuse of power for private gains and the trading of power and money and other ill winds have swept the country, and many cadres, including a few leading cadres, who have a lot of power are making a lot of money and those with a little power are making a little money, and even those without power are taking advantage of the situation. Thus, handing down power to the localities and enterprises may be a necessity, but the question is how, how much, and whether the devolution of power will truly mobilize the proper kind of enthusiasm among the cadres and the masses. Here, we must put "proper" before "enthusiasm," because the lesson from the Great Leap Forward is that without proper leadership and strict control, enthusiasm can become recklessness. If this kind of recklessness should run amuck in the country, if the capital construction projects are jeopardized, if we pursue an realistic rate of growth, if we set up development zones regardless of conditions, and if we do what we want to draw up our own policies and rules and regulations, it will lead to chaos and jeopardize the central government's unified leadership. China is a vast country; unification is hard to come by, but localism and decentralism can spread quickly. If the decentralization of power is allowed to develop without restraint, it will be very dangerous. If we are not careful, everybody will set up blockades and engage in separatism, and then not only will we fail to create a market economy but there can be unimaginable political consequences. In summing up our war experience, Comrade Mao Zedong said, "If what should be centralized is not centralized, then those in high places must be derelict of duty and their subordinates are usurping their authority. This is not permissible in any kind of relationship between a superior and his subordinates, especially in military matters. If what should be decentralized is not decentralized, then those in high places must be hoarding power and their subordinates are without initiative. This too is not permissible in any kind of relationship between a superior and his subordinates, especially in a relationship of command in guerrilla warfare." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, 2nd Edition, Volume 2, pp 436-437) Comrade Mao Zedong's correct viewpoint on centralization and decentralization which puts strategies under central command while making the subordinates responsible for actual deployment in battle can also be used to guide our economic construction. What makes a modern economy different from a natural economy is that the former is more centralized and facilitates centralized command, which means we must emphasize macro regulation and control. Of course this kind of centralized command or macro regulation and control must be coordinated with the socialist market economic mechanisms, that is, we must work on public finance and taxation, banking and credit, interest rates and prices, the scope of capital constructions and key construction projects, industrial-agricultural and urban-rural relationships, regional distributions, the balance between the public and private economies, and the allocation of national income and so on. If things are very lively at the micro level, control must be tightened at the macro level. This may seem contradictory on the surface, but in fact, this is dialectics. If we tighten control at the top and bottom, we will stifle the economy; if both are let loose, it will lead to chaos. There are many lessons of this kind. Some cadres have trouble accepting macro regulation and control. The root cause of that is their inability to consider the whole situation. They do not take the whole economic situation into consideration and worry only about their own struggle for power and profit. This means the Party and the state must always take the whole situation into consideration and get rid of the improper, localized interferences and focus their attention on solving problems that affect the overall situation. Finally, I want to mention one more thing. Comrade Mao Zedong's famous saying, "Strategically we should ignore our enemies, but tactically we must focus attention on the enemies," not only can be applied to politics and to past struggles in the world but can also be applied to the economy and to today's tasks, because this is a fundamental principle. To retreat in the face of problems is not the proper attitude of a Communist Party member, but to ignore problems and charge ahead recklessly will not bring success either. I have only begun to study The Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, Volume 3. Here I am only offering some crude and superficial opinions based on my own past practical experiences. I welcome criticisms. Where there are disagreements, there can be discussions, because contention and debate broaden people's minds, and of course, ultimately who is right or wrong can only be determined through practice.
