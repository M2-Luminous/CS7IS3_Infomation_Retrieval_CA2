Experts at yesterday's inaugural convention of the Xinan Appraisal Center said that cooperation between economically advanced areas in southwest China has resulted in considerable economic growth. The region now boosts thousands of exporting enterprises which are getting increasing numbers of overseas production orders. Given the situation, the six southwest provinces and regions joined hands in establishing the Xinan Appraisal Center on the quality system of export-manufacturing enterprises to push for the IS09000-series international standard, which will link the region with the 50 countries that adopt this standard. Experts claim that the center is the largest appraisal center covering the widest geographic area among the 20 so far registered in China. It will effectively promote the quality management of exporting enterprises in the southwest region and increase the competitiveness of their products.
