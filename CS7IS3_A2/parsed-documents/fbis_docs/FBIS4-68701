EXPORTS During the period January-September 1993, as compared with the same period in 1992, the share of production of the fuel and power engineering complex declined somewhat, and amounted to 53.5 percent as opposed to 55.4 percent. The production share of the metallurgy complex rose from 14.5 percent to 17.1 percent. However, the share of non-ferrous metallurgy declined from 9.5 to 7.5 percent, while at the same time that of ferrous metallurgy increased and amounted to 8.6 as opposed to 5.0 percent. The share of exports of machine-building production (including deliveries along the line of military-technical cooperation) was reduced from 14.8 to 11.1 percent. Exports from sectors of the chemical and wood products complex increased from 9.1 to 11.2 percent. However, more significant changes were observed in the timber, woodworking and pulp-and-paper industries. For the first nine months of 1993 the sector's share amounted to 4.4 percent, as opposed to 3.1 percent for the corresponding period in 1992. But exports of chemical and petrochemical products rose from 6.0 to 6.7 percent. The share of product exports from the agro-industrial complex showed an insignificant increase--from 2.2 to 3.0 percent. Fuel and Power Engineering Complex Electrical Power Engineering In the overall volume of exports, the sector's share is insignificant. For the first nine months of 1993 it amounted to 0.3 percent in all, and remains practically at the level of the corresponding period in 1992. The value of electrical power exports for the first nine months of 1993 was calculated at $95 million, as opposed to $85 million during the period January-September 1992. As before, the main consumer of Russian electrical power is still Finland, whose share of the overall volume is at the level of 85-90 percent. Oil and Gas Industry The share of the oil and gas industry for the first nine months of 1993 declined somewhat with respect to the first nine months of 1992, and amounted to 52.0 percent as against 52.9 percent in 1992. The value of exports from the sector remained practically at the level of the corresponding period of 1992, and the sum total of exported production was $14.5 billion. Oil The share of oil (including gas condensate) continues to occupy a leading position in the structure of branch exports: during the period January-September 1993 it amounted to 44.4 percent; that is, it increased by 3.2 percent. The increase in oil export volume is taking place under conditions of a continuing production slump. During the first nine months of 1993, as compared with the same period in 1992, the decline in oil extraction amounted to 13.3 percent, and initial refinement of oil declined by 15.3 percent. In this connection, the increase in the export volume of oil was made possible primarily by virtue of significant reduction of exports to countries of the near abroad. Thus, oil exports to these countries during the period January-September 1993 declined, in comparison with the corresponding period in 1992, by 43.9 percent, or by 25.5 million tonnes. Gas Deliveries of gas to the export sector occupy second place in terms of value. The share of export gas in the period January-September 1993 amounted to 36 percent, and with respect to the corresponding period in 1992, declined by 2.0 percent. The decline in the value of export gas is connected with a decline in the level of both world and contract prices. While the volume of deliveries increased by 6.6 percent, their value declined by 5.2 percent. Petroleum Products The share of petroleum products in sector exports was reduced from 21 percent to 19 percent, which is associated with changes in the structure of deliveries, and with a decline in the level of world and contract prices. In all, during the period January-September 1993, petroleum products valued at $2.7 billion were exported, as opposed to $3 billion during the corresponding period of 1992; that is, exports declined by 10 percent on the average. In spite of the decline in the value of petroleum product exports, deliveries in physical terms increased by 44.5 percent, or by 8.1 million tonnes, which is also taking place against a background of reduced production volumes. Coal Industry The share of exports of production of the coal industry declined to 1.2 percent during the period January-September 1993, as opposed to 2.1 percent for the corresponding period in 1992. The value of exports amounted to $322 million, and declined by $250 million, or by 44 percent. There were significant changes in the structure for deliveries in the sector: in terms of value the share of exports of hard coal increased from 86 to 98 percent, and the export share of brown coal declined from 14 to 2.0 percent. Metallurgy Complex Ferrous Metallurgy The export share of the sector rose from 5.0 percent in the period January-September 1992 to 9.6 percent in January-September 1993. This is the highest growth among all the sectors. The value of exports increased nearly twofold and amounted to $2.7 billion as opposed to $1.4 billion for the first nine months of 1992. Eighty-five percent of the value of the sector's exports came from deliveries of steel and rolled metal. In the first nine months of 1993, their share was a little lower and amounted to 82 percent. Non-Ferrous Metallurgy The export share of non-ferrous metallurgy for the first nine months of 1993 declined in comparison with the same period in 1992, from 9.5 to 7.5 percent, while the value of exports decreased by $600 million. Changes have been made in the export structure of the sector over the past year. During the period January-September 1992, aluminum comprised 32 percent; nickel, 18 percent; and platinum, palladium and rhodium, 13 percent. During the period January-September 1993, the export share of aluminum amounted to 41 percent; nickel, 16 percent; and platinum, palladium and rhodium, 19 percent. Chemical and Timber Complex Chemical and Petrochemical Industry The share of chemical and petrochemical production showed insignificant increase--from 6.0 to 6.7 percent. The value of product exports from this sector amounts to $1.9 billion; that is, an increase of 13.9 percent. Timber, Woodworking and Pulp-and-Paper Industries The share of exports for products of the timber, woodworking and pulp-and-paper industries increased from 3.1 percent for the first nine months of 1992, to 4.5 percent for the first nine months of 1993. On the whole, exports amounted to $1.8 million; that is, a 49 percent increase. Negative trends in the export structure remain and became even more critical: these are connected with a reduction in the export of ready-made products, and growth in the export of raw materials. The share of non-processed wood materials rose from 35 to 41 percent; processed wood materials declined from 28 to 25 percent; and exports of wood pulp from timber were reduced to the level of 1992 (12 percent). Machine-Building The proportion of machine-building products (including deliveries along the line of military-technical cooperation) declined from 14.8 to 11.1 percent. In absolute terms, for the first nine months of 1993, exports of machine-building products declined in comparison with the corresponding period of 1992 by 23.5 percent and amounted to $3.1 billion. The decline in exports in rather significant and is approaching one billion dollars. As in the past, the leading position in product exports in this sector is occupied by motor vehicle deliveries. Their share increased from 26 percent in January-September 1992 to 31 percent in January-September 1993. Next comes deliveries of technological (including boiler) equipment, whose export share has grown from 20 to 27 percent. The share of the remaining kinds of machine-building production decreased slightly in the period January-September 1993, or declined to the level of the corresponding period in 1992. Changes in deliveries of basic groups of machine-building products for the first nine months of 1993, in comparison with the corresponding period for 1992, in order of decreasing export proportion in the sector, are shown in the following data: Means of Ground Transport --91.2 percent Technological Equipment --99.6 percent Aircraft --50.7 percent Electrical Equipment --71.6 percent Optical Instruments and Apparati --76.5 percent Rail Transport --42.8 percent Exports of Clocks and Clockworks --10.0 percent Light Industry As in January-September 1992, the light industry product export share was insignificant, and amounted to 0.41 percent as against 0.7 percent. Product exports in the sector declined from $193 million to $114 million, or by 40.9 percent Exports of cotton fabrics dropped by $40 million. Losses from reduced exports of products made from flax amounted to nearly $10 million. The share of deliveries of raw leather goods increased somewhat, from 3.0 to 12.0 percent; for wool, from 2.0 to 4.0 percent; and for clothes from textile products, from 10 to 17 percent. At the same time, not only their export share but also their export value increased--by 230, 13.3 and 4.3 percent, respectively. Food Industry The production share of food industry exports grew from 1.8 to 2.8 percent; in absolute terms the growth in exports amounted to nearly $280 million. A basic increase of $270 million was provided by virtue of increasing deliveries of fish. Exports of fish grew by 82.1 percent, including a $150 million increase in sale of fish to Japan; a $25 million sales increase to South Korea; and a $43 million sales increase to Norway. IMPORTS As in the past, purchases of machine-building products occupy the leading position in imports; however, their share is gradually decreasing from year to year, and according to data from January to September 1993, it amounted to 38.5 percent, as opposed to 40.7 percent for the corresponding period in 1992. The share in product imports from the agro-industrial complex decreased from 28.5 to 25.5 percent. However, the import dynamics of the sectors which make up the complex are taking different directions. For example, the share of agricultural products decreased from 14.8 to 10.8 percent, which is principally connected with a gradual decline in state grain procurement. The share of products from the food industry, on the other hand, increased by 1.0 percent, and for January-September 1993 was 14.7 percent as opposed to 13.7 percent. Significantly, the share of products from the chemical and timber complex decreased from 12.4 to 8.6 percent. Moreover, the proportion for chemical and petrochemical products decreased from 11.2 to 7.6 percent, while timber, wood-processing and pulp-and-paper products remained practically at the level of January-September 1992. In the period under examination, the share of product procurement from the metallurgical complex increased nearly twofold, and for the first nine months of 1993 amounted to 6.9 percent. At the same time, ferrous metallurgy products increased from 2.7 to 4.1 percent, and non-ferrous metallurgy products from 1.3 to 2.8 percent. A small amount of growth is seen in the proportion of products from light industry, and its share for the period January-September 1993 amounted to 12.3 percent, as opposed to 11.9 percent in the corresponding period of 1992. Machine-Building In January-September 1993, as compared with the corresponding period for 1992, purchases of machine-building products declined by more than $5 billion, and their share of the overall import volume decreased from 40.7 to 38.5 percent. As in the past, the leading place in imports of machine-building products want to purchases of technological equipment, whose share remained practically at the level of the preceding period, and amounted to 51 percent. Metallurgy Complex Ferrous Metallurgy The share of imports of ferrous metallurgy products rose from 2.7 to 4.1 percent. The year 1993 was characterized by an increase in procurement of ready-made products, in particular pipe, whose share in branch imports increased from 44 to 77 percent, and in terms of costs by a factor of 1.4. About 42 percent of imports fell to the procurement of pipe for oil and gas pipelines, while 35.6 percent was made up of import of pipe for drilling oil and gas wells. According to information from the Institute on Economic Problems of the Transition Period, production of drilling pipe in Russia has decreased to 8.0 percent of the level of 1992; that is, it has practically ceased. Therefore, it was necessary to make up for their lack on the Russian market by procurement from import. Non-Ferrous Metallurgy In imports, the share of non-ferrous metallurgy products increased from 1.3 to 2.8 percent, and this is the only sector for which import costs increased in the period January-September 1993 in comparison with the same period of 1992. The increase took place primarily as a result of an increase from 76 to 84 percent in the share of procurement of raw materials for the aluminum industry. The share of raw material procurement for production of zinc climbed from practically zero to 6.0 percent. Light Industry The share of this sector in overall import volume rose from 11.9 to 12.3 percent. On the whole, imports of products from light industry declined by $1.4 billion; however, the rates of decline in this sector, which amounted to 46.7 percent, lag behind the rates of decline for imports as a whole. During the period January-September 1993, the procurement structure for imports changed somewhat, and the share of basic goods was as follows: Clothing from Textiles --29 percent Shoes --18 percent Knitted Wear --13 percent Carpets --10 percent Leather Goods --9.0 percent Furs and Fur Goods --5.0 percent Agro-Industrial Complex Food Industry The share of the food industry increased from 13.5 to 14.7 percent. On the whole, food industry imports were reduced by $1.5 billion; that is, the rate of decline of procurement of food products amounted to 44.8 percent, which is somewhat lower than the rate of decline for imports as a whole. Agricultural Products The share of agricultural product imports declined rather significantly--from 14.8 percent in January-September 1992 to 10.8 percent in January-September 1993, which corresponds to a decrease of $2.4 billion, or 62.4 percent. Since the mid-1980's, procurement of grain had occupied one of the leading places in Russian imports; however, in 1993 grain imports began to decline in comparison with preceding years. Thus, in the period January-September 1993 the share of grain imports in total agricultural product import volume declined from 91 to 87 percent, which corresponds to a $2.2 billion reduction in procurement.
