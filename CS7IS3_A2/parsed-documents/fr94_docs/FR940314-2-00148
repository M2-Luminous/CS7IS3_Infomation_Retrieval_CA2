SUMMARY: This notice announces the acceptance, under notice 89&hyph;61, 1989&hyph;1 C.B. 717, of petitions requesting that para-nitrophenol, ortho-nitrochlorobenzene, and para-nitrochlorobenzene be added to the list of taxable substances in section 4672(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Publication of this notice is in compliance with notice 89&hyph;61. This is not a determination that the list of taxable substances should be modified. DATES: Written comments and requests for a public hearing relating to these petitions must be received by May 13, 1994. Any modification of the list of taxable substances based upon these petitions would be effective July 1, 1990. ADDRESSES: Send comments and requests for a public hearing to: Internal Revenue Service, P.O. Box 7604, Ben Franklin Station, Washington, DC 20044 (Attn: CC:DOM:CORP:T:R (Petition), room 5228). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Tyrone J. Montague, Office of Assistant Chief Counsel (Passthroughs and Special Industries), (202) 622&hyph;3130 (not a toll-free number). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The petitions were received on September 29, 1989. The petitioner is Monsanto Company, a manufacturer and exporter of these substances. The following is a summary of the information contained in the petitions. The complete petitions are available in the Internal Revenue Service Freedom of Information Reading Room. Para-nitrophenol HTS number: 2908.90.04.00 CAS number: 100&hyph;02&hyph;7 This substance is derived from the taxable chemicals chlorine, benzene, sodium hydroxide, nitric acid, and sulfuric acid. Para-nitrophenol is a solid produced predominantly by the reaction of para-nitrochlorobenzene with aqueous sodium hydroxide, followed by reaction with sulfuric acid to form para-nitrophenol from the resulting para-nitrophenoxide. The stoichiometric material consumption formula for this substance is: Cl 2 (chlorine) + C 6 H 6 (benzene) + 2 NaOH (sodium hydroxide) + HNO 3 (nitric acid) + 0.5 H 2 SO 4 (sulfuric acid) __> C 6 H 5 NO 3 (p-nitrophenol) + NaCl (sodium chloride) + 2 H 2 O (water) + 0.5 Na 2 SO 4 (sodium sulfate) + HCl (hydrogen chloride) According to the petition, taxable chemicals constitute 100 per cent by weight of the materials used to produce this substance. The rate of tax for this substance would be $4.85 per ton. This is based upon a conversion factor for chlorine of 0.54, a conversion factor for benzene of 0.60, a conversion factor for sodium hydroxide of 0.75, a conversion factor for nitric acid of 0.47, and a conversion factor for sulfuric acid of 0.59. Ortho-nitrochlorobenzene HTS number: 2903.69.00.00 CAS number: 88&hyph;73&hyph;3 This substance is derived from the taxable chemicals chlorine, benzene, and nitric acid. Ortho-nitrochlorobenzene is a solid produced predominantly by the nitration of monochlorobenzene. The stoichiometric material consumption formula for this substance is: Cl 2 (chlorine) + C 6 H 6 (benzene) + HNO 3 (nitric acid) __> C 6 H 4 ClNO 2 (o-nitrochlorobenzene) + H 2 O (water) + HCl (hydrogen chloride) According to the petition, taxable chemicals constitute 100 per cent by weight of the materials used to produce this substance. The rate of tax for this substance would be $3.89 per ton. This is based upon a conversion factor for chlorine of 0.47, a conversion factor for benzene of 0.52, and a conversion factor for nitric acid of 0.41. Para-nitrochlorobenzene HTS number: 2903.69.00.00 CAS number: 100&hyph;00&hyph;5 This substance is derived from the taxable chemicals chlorine, benzene, and nitric acid. Para-nitrochlorobenzene is a solid produced predominantly by the nitration of monochlorobenzene. The stoichiometric material consumption formula for this substance is: Cl 2 (chlorine) + C 6 H 6 (benzene) + HNO 3 (nitric acid) __> C 6 H 4 ClNO 2 (p-nitrochlorobenzene) + H 2 O (water) + HCl (hydrogenchloride) According to the petition, taxable chemicals constitute 100 per cent by weight of the materials used to produce this substance. The rate of tax for this substance would be $3.89 per ton. This is based upon a conversion factor for chlorine of 0.47, a conversion factor for benzene of 0.52, and a conversion factor for nitric acid of 0.41. Dale D.
