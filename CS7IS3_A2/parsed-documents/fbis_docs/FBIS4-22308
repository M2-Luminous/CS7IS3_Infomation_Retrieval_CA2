Butenko by unidentified ARGUMENTY I FAKTY correspondent; place and date not given: "Poor Subscriber...: In 1993 Postal Service Losses From Distribution of Periodicals Amounted to More than 62 Billion Rubles"] [Text] Increasingly items are appearing in the press that the postal service, by increasing its rates on distribution of periodicals, is making prices for newspapers and magazines unaffordable. Since this problem also concerns the multimillion audience of ARGUMENTY I FAKTY readers, we asked Russian Deputy Minister of Communications B.P. Butenko to clarify this situation. [Question] Boris Petrovich, we heard that the Judiciary Chamber for Information Disputes has made a ruling regarding postal service rates. Please comment on it. [Butenko] Unfortunately this document, prompted by articles in the newspapers IZVESTIYA, TRUD, and others, was not even coordinated with the Federal Postal Administration of Russia and was written in an extremely improper manner. The chamber discussed our rates, which in principle, according to the existing statute, it is not supposed to do. The entire document is built on emotions instead of the language of figures. We are accused of being a monopoly with respect to conduct of the subscription campaign. We say--take the subscription part. But nobody wants it--it is too hard. This is how we became an unwilling monopoly. [Question] Is there no alternative to the postal service? [Butenko] Foreign experience shows that delivery of printed material is the publishers' business. Over there the postal service works only on a contract basis and delivers only about 30 percent of subscriptions. In our country all newspapers and magazines traditionally are distributed mainly through the postal service. Although by the current law on the mass media the publishers are supposed to distribute their product themselves on a contract basis, that is, the postal service may be just one of the systems engaged in distribution. Therefore we, the communications industry, offer our skills and experience for setting up alternative structures. [Question] Still, why is it that nobody wants to seriously deal with this? Unprofitable? [Butenko] More than that--it is pure loss! Last year our losses from distribution of newspapers and magazines amounted to 62 billion rubles. Here is your answer. We are accused of rigging the figures, of postal subscription rates being unjustifiably high. But we are willing to provide objective information to any publisher at any time; we are willing to undergo any audit with respect to correctness of rate-setting. Another important point is that in setting local rates we recommend that these rates be coordinated with local committees on prices. We cover our losses with profits from other services and the state subsidy the postal service receives as a whole. [Question] This does not make things easier for the subscriber. After all, he is paying out of his own pocket, and increasing amounts every year. [Butenko] Readers should clearly understand that there are only two options. Either they have to pay what a newspaper or a magazine costs, including the entire publication process and delivery, or state subsidies are needed; this decision should be made at the government level. Subsidies should be targeted, and the population widely informed of this. [Question] By the way, why is it that postal service prices differ in different oblasts of Russia sometimes by a factor of five to six? [Butenko] There is nothing strange about that. Conditions are different everywhere; different delivery route distances, different gasoline prices, and so on. Besides, in some oblasts, where local authorities provide subsidies to the postal service, subscribers pay less. There is one more nuance: Readers pay in advance, but no one can tell with certainty what inflation will be over this period, while both the publishers and the postal service must make good on their obligations to subscribers. Instead of finding a way out of this situation, many publishers started looking for a scapegoat, and found us--the postal service. But this handling of the problem will only result in bitterness between potential partners and will not help the cause. Moreover, it may bring antagonism between postal service staff and publishers even at the local level. [Question] But, Boris Petrovich, you will not deny that local postal service systems do not have clear guidance in setting rates, and in some places they are pushing prices sky-high. Which immediately affects the number of subscribers. [Butenko] I think that the Federal Postal Administration will sort things out with these oblasts and will provide recommendations to local branches. Our task is to keep rates at a level people can afford. But the postal service is a state structure, and the subsidies it gets mostly go into those services the population uses frequently: delivery of letters, small packages, parcels. I want everyone to understand--there is nothing there to make us rich, but the postal service, as before, will try to deliver to the readers the latest news in newspapers and magazines in a timely manner. FROM THE EDITORS. There is no question that our communications industry is experiencing a lot of problems. Neither can its personnel boast of high salaries. We agree with B. Butenko that without government help, there is no solution. At the same time, however, we think that the postal service, too, can still do a great deal. ARGUMENTY I FAKTY is willing to work closely with the communications industry. The main goal is for subscribers to get their newspapers on time and at a reasonable price.
