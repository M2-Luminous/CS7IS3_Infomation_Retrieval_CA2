Ignoring or observing with reluctance the principles of democracy and violating legal and ethic standards in every possible way, the opposition newspapers are by their mendacious and trashy articles engendering among people a decadent mood and seriously damaging the on-going work on the organization of military mobilization. One of these newspapers--525TH GAZETA--which, divorced from reality completely, aims at sowing panic and fear among the populace and forcing people living in the border areas to abandon their homes. In the 20 November issue 525TH GAZETA writes: "The fate of the other districts awaits Agdzhabedinskiy, Terterskiy, Bardinskiy, Beylyaganskiy, Gyandzhinskiy, Khanlarskiy, Gazakhskiy, and Tovuzskiy Rayons." The newspaper goes on to report some mass exterminations, appalling dangers, earthquakes, and unknown diseases that will come crashing down on people. The intentions of 525TH GAZETA, which fills the pages of the publication with rumors and information totally unsupported by any facts, are clear. Could there be a greater provocation in a country with more than a million refugees, in a country with devastated cities and villages? What name can we give attempts to incite people to leave their homes and make them refugees? Could there be any greater treachery? It is well known what forces are behind 525TH GAZETA, which is filling its pages with rumors and giving itself over to verbal rhetoric, in the race for a sensation sacrificing such eternal concepts as "Motherland" and "Land." In order to seize power these forces are espousing the ugliest propaganda methods. At a meeting with leaders of political parties Geydar Aliyev, president of the Azerbaijan Republic, publicly exposed the dirty intentions of the opposition papers and called on them to embark on the path of truth. In order to conduct a decisive struggle against the aggressor and to restore our land, which is under the heel of the enemy, G.A. Aliyev declared, the news media should regard it as their main task to support and bolster the fighting spirit of the people, who have risen to the defense of their land. Everyone should now be serving this main goal and calling on the people by intelligent and truthful words for unity. The Press Office of the President of the Azerbaijan Republic expresses an emphatic protest against all publications of a provocative nature carried in the opposition newspapers, including 525TH GAZETA.
