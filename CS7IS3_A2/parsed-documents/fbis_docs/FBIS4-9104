They are mercilessly killing the people with everything they have, destroying their houses. Yesterday afternoon, the chetniks wreaked havoc in Gorazde with aerosol surface-to-surface missiles PAB-275. Houses were destroyed as if made out of cards. The roofs of all buildings within a radius of 200 meters were blown off and the walls fractured. Dozens of people were killed and wounded. Owing to the constant fire by chetniks from the surrounding hills, the casualties have not yet been evacuated from these ruins. According to reliable information, these missiles were launched from Pljevlje [in Montenegro, 60 km away]. This is yet another proof of the involvement by the so-called Yugoslavia in the aggression on Bosnia-Herzegovina. The crying and screaming of the seriously wounded were heard coming from these ruins throughout the night. The Gorazde valley is a valley of pain, screaming, and horror. The constant deadly pounding by those who do not distinguish between killing people and drinking water last night killed Dr. Muhamed Pasic, who, despite a rain of sniper bullets, went to give medical help to the seriously wounded in the 1 May district. This morning, the chetniks are continuing the realization of their bloody plan, wiping Gorazde from the face of the earth. The chetniks confirmed this morning that they only understand the language of force and that they are unable to live in peace. The inferno in Gorazde continues. Further human lives are being lost, so is the hope among the survivors that someone will finally demonstrate to the chetniks with force that the time of cavemen, barbarism, and unpunished crime has long gone.
