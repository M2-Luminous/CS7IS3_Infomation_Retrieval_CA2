The three petitions, presented separately, were signed by General Lino Oviedo on behalf of the Army, Jose Cespedes Zarza on behalf of the Air Force, and Vice Admiral Flavio Abadie on behalf of the Navy. The petitions request putting a freeze on the effects of the law's articles temporarily suspending military and police political affiliations. Politicians yesterday wondered about the issue of Armed Forces institutionalization if the Supreme Court freezes the effects of the law. According to court sources, the petition was signed by the previously mentioned commanders and by General Eduardo Gonzalez Petit, Pedro Concepcion Ocampos, Pablo Abadie, and all officers with the rank of lieutenant colonel and up. Gen. Oviedo, Gen. Cespedes Zarza, and Vice Admiral Abadie petitions' legal counsels are the attorneys Marcial Pio Flecha, Silvino Benitez, and Victor Hugo Ronzwisky respectively. The petitions asked the Supreme Court to freeze the effects of the law until it can decide on the law's constitutionality. Cespedes Zarza (Air Force), Vice Admiral Abadie (Navy), and Gen. Oviedo (representing the Army) signed the petitions separately. According to the attorneys, the three petitions have the same content--that is, the same legal argument. Court sources said the Supreme Court might accept the petitions and freeze the law's effect temporarily. [passage omitted]
