These microorganisms cause mainly inflammations of the meninx; they have a very severe clinical progression and a lethal conclusion. The former Soviet Union asked the former government for an analysis of the above microorganisms. Czech scientists supposedly never worked with the most dangerous infections such as smallpox, pestilence, or anthrax. According to Ales Macela, dean of scientific activity at the Jan Evangelista Purkyne Military Medical Academy in Hradec Kralove, conditions have never been established in the Czech Republic for handling of genetic material of microorganisms or for the production of a larger quantity of microbes, which would have been necessary for the development and production of a biological weapon.
