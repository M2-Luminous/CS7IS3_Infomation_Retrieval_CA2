He expressed this position in Moscow on Wednesday at the end of his meeting with the Co-Chairmen of the Geneva Peace Conference on Former Yugoslavia Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg. As Kozyrev said, "among the Bosnian Serbs there is a party of war, waiting for fresh air strikes to continue the war. It's people from this party who have been shelling hospitals and other civilian targets in Gorazde." However, in the interests of all the Serbs the war must be stopped on fair terms and the lifting of sanctions should be gradually pressed for, Kozyrev said. These interests of the Serbs and of the other conflicting sides should be given a real chance, he stressed. In his words, at Wednesday's session of Russia's Security Council the Bosnian problem was discussed in the same key and on the basis of the statement made by President Yeltsin on Tuesday. We will do whatever we can to stop the bloodshed in Gorazde, introduce disengagement troops and put an end to the confrontation there. Kozyrev disclosed that in a telephone conversation with the American Secretary of State Warren Christopher he had asked him to send to Moscow the US President's Special Envoy on Former Yugoslavia Charles Redman, whose expertise, as Kozyrev put it, is as essential as that of Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg. Regrettably, Christopher declined to give a clear-cut answer. So, the door remains open, Kozyrev said.
