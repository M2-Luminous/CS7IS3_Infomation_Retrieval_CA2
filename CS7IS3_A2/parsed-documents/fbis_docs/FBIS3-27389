Attending this forum were provincial leaders, including Ma Guoliang and Sun Kuiwen, leaders of the province's 11 poor counties and the cities and districts in these counties, and responsible persons of provincial level departments concerned. Comrade Sun Weiben pointed out: In the process of acquiring the new market economic structure, the policies, and scope and degree of economic benefits, such as reducing or remitting taxes, increasing loans, and striving for parity-price means of production, will be gradually reduced. If the ideas of helping poor counties shake off poverty and become prosperous still remain in the stage of asking for money, materials, and policies from the higher authorities, it will be very difficult to carry out the work of enabling poor counties to shake off poverty and become prosperous. The establishment of the new market economic structure has brought new opportunity for this work. If we promptly adjust our ideology and shift the planned economy to a market economy, we will be able to more rapidly attain the aim of enabling poor counties to end poverty and become prosperous. He said: The key to success is to do a good job in the two aspects of decontrolling and invigorating the markets and guiding enterprises to enter the market. To invigorate the markets, we must eliminate the obstacles. If we decontrol the management of thousands upon thousands of markets and enable them to develop production and create wealth independently, we will have no problem in helping poor counties end poverty. The problem now is that the traditional leadership concepts and management system have tied the hands of peasants and enterprises. When carrying out work, peasants and enterprises have to ask for favors from various departments, and if they fail to do so, they will be unable to carry out their work. There are too many official procedures and shackles. The way to solve this is to deepen reform, change government functions, and streamline and reorganize organs. Government departments should not manage things that are within the framework of the decision-making power of enterprises and laborers. Departments which have no work to do after changing functions and delegating powers should be merged into other organs or abolished. Those who extort money from enterprises and peasants or create difficulties for them should be investigated and handled upon discovery. He said: We must pave the road and build bridges for enterprises and peasants to enter the market. Since peasants have engaged in the natural economy and enterprises in the product economy for a long time, they cannot adapt themselves to the market as soon as it is decontrolled. Particularly, the quality of enterprises and peasants are relatively lower in poor counties. The contradictions between the scattered small production units and large markets are very prominent. It does not mean that the governments have nothing to do or that they have taken on an attitude of noninterference after creating benefits for the markets. They should guide thousands and thousands of peasant households and enterprises into the market and give prominence to the intermediate service work for peasants and enterprises. Comrade Sun Weiben noted: To help poor counties, we should adopt permanent measures, focus the work on supporting poor counties by carrying out explorative work and enhancing their ability to survive and develop under market conditions, relatively concentrate efforts on helping poor counties carry out some explorative pillar items in agricultural and industrial production, and enhance their self- development function. In addition to studying and formulating regular policies to help and support poor counties, we should also issue some relatively supportive policies in line with the explorative pillar industries and projects they have carried out. In formulating policies to help and support poor counties, the general guideline is to try to the utmost to decontrol enterprises. At the forum, Vice Governor Sun Kuiwen summed up the situation of carrying out the strategy of helping poor counties across the province shake off poverty and become prosperous and set forth demands on future work. He said: Since the convocation of the provincial on-the-spot meeting on helping poor counties shake off poverty held in Lindian County last year, the strategy of helping poor counties shake off poverty has been carried out in an all-round manner. Last year, the total output value of 11 poor counties increased 13.7 percent over that of the previous year, higher than the provincial average by 8.8 percentage point; their financial revenue increased 13.4 percent, higher than the province's county average level; and the average per-capita income of people in the rural areas increased 25.5 percent, higher than the provincial average by 17.1 percentage point. He called on poor counties across the province to strengthen confidence in shaking off poverty and becoming prosperous, deeply carry out the strategy of helping them shake off poverty, fully and rationally develop and use land resources, steadily develop large-scale agriculture, unceasingly raise the income of peasants, actively develop county-run industry, and continue to expand local financial resources. He called for efforts to further enhance consciousness and initiative in carrying out the strategy of helping poor counties shake off poverty, continue to support poor counties with policies, organize social efforts to jointly carry out this strategy, and strive to fundamentally change the outlook of poor counties after several years of efforts.
