This would not have been so bad had they not started believing that the negotiations on limited autonomy in Gaza and Jericho would bring the Middle East into a new era. Instead of reading the writing on the wall, they preferred to become immersed in daydreams about the end of days. It is characteristic that in the week of the Cave of the Patriarch murders, Jordanian diplomats found it hard to wriggle out of the Israeli and U.S. bear hug. A member of the Jordanian cabinet was invited to Washington to give the date of the Amman conference that is supposed to bring together thousands of company directors. A different delegation searched for escape routes from the trilateral forum which emerged at the Clinton-Hasan-Peres meeting at the White House. Soon, economic and environmental experts will drag themselves to Oman or Qatar, or perhaps Tunis, for another round of multilaterals. Morocco did not know how to get out of the desertification conference initiated by Peres and Vice President Al Gore. It can be assumed that Goldstein solved the problem for them. Since 13 September, U.S. Administration spokesmen have been reiterating the three targets they have taken upon themselves. First: advancement toward a comprehensive peace, or in other words, bridging the gaps between Israel and Syria. Second, recruiting the international community to rehabilitate the inhabitants of the territories so that the Palestinians believe that peace pays. Third, improving relations between the Arab states and Israel, mainly through efforts to lift the Arab boycott so that Israelis find that peace pays. Next week will be six months since the signing ceremony at the White House. What is left? Syria and Israel are more or less treading water. The Clinton-al-Asad summit meeting was wasted, and the Palestinians learned that it is much easier to exploit people under occupation than to rehabilitate them. The most striking achievement of U.S. diplomacy since the Madrid conference was the public relations campaign for the Declaration of Principles among the Jews, especially in America. Several minor Arab leaders who understood that Clinton would owe them a favor, made the Israelis several small gestures. The Americans, with their faulty understanding of inter-Arab politics, continued to exert pressure. They wanted the Arabs to lift the embargo even before the first Israeli soldier leaves Gaza, and pleaded with al-Asad to shake hands with Yitzhaq Rabin, although the latter tied himself to the Golan Heights through a referendum. President Clinton is urging King Husayn to accept Israeli leaders in Amman before a single uprooted family is returned to Ramallah and while Kahanists imported from America run around in Hebron as if they own the place. It appears that the Americans recently became concerned that the Hebron massacre might spoil their relations with the Jews. The President and the secretary of state apologize almost every time somebody forces them to say that it would be preferable that armed Goldsteins not roam around in Hebron. While this article is being written, three announcements came up on my facsimile machine: One announced Vice President Gore's participation in a fundraising dinner for Bar Ilan University at the Israeli Embassy in Washington. In a special gesture, on the day after the massacre, Gore announced that he had decided to accept an old invitation to receive an honorary doctorate from the National Religious Party's intellectual bastion. Immediately after that, came another White House announcement: The entire telephone conversation between Clinton and the family of the yeshiva student wounded in Brooklyn. And after that, more good news: The federal official in charge of U.S. heritage abroad announced that Ukranian President Leonid Kravchuk took time off in Washington to sign an agreement to look after the synagogues and Jewish cemeteries in his country. On the other hand, leaders of the Arab lobby in the United States who have repeatedly requested a meeting with the President since the massacre, have so far been turned down. A group of Arab activists in the "Builders for Peace" movement, another level in the upside down pyramid of the peace process, had to settle for a meeting with the vice president. It was reported that he was "pleasantly surprised with their good manners." The signs of friendship are touching, but the problem of the moment is the difficulty of building a peace process credible to both sides on such a transparent leaning toward Israel by the sole mediator.
