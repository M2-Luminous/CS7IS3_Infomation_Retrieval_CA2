The government organized the "The Nation and the Emigrants Conference" and limited its goals to the following: To begin changing ideas in order to reach an eventual normalization of relations between Cuba and Cubans living abroad. Cubans who call for the armed overthrow of Castro and who support the U.S. trade, economic, and financial embargo against Cuba that has been in effect since 1962 were excluded from the meeting. Participants include prominent Cuban emigrants who in some cases have expressed subtle sympathy for the Castro Government, and others who in the past have raised weapons against the regime but now call for a peaceful dialogue. This afternoon participants agreed that the conference will yield modest results, which they consider the initial gambit in a long game. As of this afternoon, President Fidel Castro had not attended the conference, which opened on 22 April with a speech by Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina. [passage omitted] Carlos Lage, secretary of the Council of Ministers and member of the Communist Party Politburo, will address the conference on Sunday, the last day of the meeting. According to the agenda, a "comment period" is scheduled following each speech, but according to several participants, the time set aside for dialogue has thus far been, with few exceptions, rather sedate.
