Ltd. (president: Yoshio Sakai; TEL 06-384-3371), a maker and distributor of battery rechargers, has developed a compact sealed-type battery recharger that is waterproof and designed to be used in electric vehicles. Calculations done by the company indicate that the battery recharger can provide enough power for an electric-powered light van to travel up to 10 km with one 15-minute charge, and 40 km with a one-hour charge. The company reported that this was half the time that conventional battery rechargers took. It plans to put the battery recharger into full-scale production by summer of next year in hopes of selling it to auto manufacturers. The price of the recharger is still undecided at this time. The newly developed battery recharger employs a direct high-frequency switching system, and has an 87 percent energy efficiency. The company said that it does not use a condenser to switch from AC to DC power. This enabled them to make the recharger lighter. It uses a 30-amp constant-current recharging system that enables recharging at places where single-phase 200V outlets are available. It has a built-in microprocessing unit that starts recharging automatically. The battery recharger weighs 17 kilograms, and at 50 cm x 26 cm x 56 cm, is one-third the size of a conventional recharger.
