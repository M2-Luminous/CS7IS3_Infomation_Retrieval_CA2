It should be noted that in the RAAS, for the purpose of elections, Article 84 of the existing Election Law divided our region into 15 districts. By means of universal, equal, direct, free, secret voting, the people will elect three councilmen in each until 45 members have been chosen to make up our Regional Council, this in accordance with Article 19 of Law 28, known as the Statute on the Autonomy of the Regions of the Atlantic Coast of Nicaragua. One unique feature is that in Zone 8, which includes Haulover, Rocky Point, Laguna de Perlas, Raitipura, Kakabila, Set Net, and Tasbapauni, the first candidate on all the lists presented by the political parties, alliances, and associations supported by the people must be Misquito. In Zone 9, which includes the Corn Islands, the first candidate must be Creole or "Criollo" or, as they say on the Pacific Coast, a Black candidate, a term that is pejorative in our region. In Zone 10, which includes the mouth of the Rio Grande, the first candidate must be a Sumo. In Zone 11, made up of Brown Bank, La Fe, San Vicente, Orinoco, Marshall Point and Wawashang, the first candidate must be a Garifono. In Zone 12, which includes the area of the Rama and the communities of Ramacay, Turswani, Dukunu, Cane Creek, Punta Aguila, Monkey Point, and Wiring Cay, the first candidate must be a Rama. Finally, in the area of El Tortuguero, the first candidate must be a Mestizo. The purpose of all this is to guarantee the presence on the Regional Council, which is the highest legislative authority by virtue of its resolutions and ordinances, of the six ethnic groups that survive in our region and that are, in sum, the following: the Mestizo, Misquito, Creole or Criollo, Sumu, Garifon ethnic groups, or peoples and their branches, who obviously wish to join in the development of the Atlantic Coast by preserving their own culture. In my opinion, the Supreme Election Council, together with the regional, municipal, and communal authorities, continue to conduct a civic crusade to see that all participants respect the existing Election Law, the regulation of election ethics and the statute on autonomy. They do so in order that the elections on the Atlantic Coast, which are obviously a prelude to the national elections in 1996, will become a civic event in which voters may freely debate their ideas and in which our people may vote for the government platforms that are the best supported and most viable. In other words, they wish to ensure that persuasion and conviction take the place of the threats and coercion of decades past and thus continue to build in practice the state of law that we coastal residents and Nicaraguans in general have dreamed of for centuries, bearing in mind the words of Jose Marti to the effect that men who love build and those who hate destroy. We coastal dwellers must not hate one another, when the idea is for all of us to join together in solving our problems: the lack of infrastructure, jobs, food programs, housing construction, clothes, medicine, health centers, and education, all in keeping with our social realities.
