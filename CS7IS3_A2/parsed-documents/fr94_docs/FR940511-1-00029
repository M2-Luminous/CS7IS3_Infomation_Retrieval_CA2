FR940511-1-00029 FR940511-1-00006 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;41&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; British Aerospace Model ATP Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain British Aerospace Model ATP airplanes. This proposal would require modification of the power supply for the communications system. This proposal is prompted by reports of loss of power to the communications system due to an electrical fault in the ground crew jack box or the handset of the public address (PA) system. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent the inability of the flight crew to communicate with passengers via the PA system and with air traffic control due to loss of power to the communication system, which may lead to unsafe operation of the airplane. DATES: Comments must be received by July 5, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;41&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.
