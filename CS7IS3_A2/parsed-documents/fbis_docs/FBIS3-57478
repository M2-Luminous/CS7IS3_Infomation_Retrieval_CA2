On the Russian Foreign Minister's Visit to Beijing"] [Text] Beijing -- The Chinese, it seems, are indeed genuinely happy at the three-day visit by our foreign minister, who arrived here on Wednesday [26 January]. Kozyrev promised to visit Beijing three months ago but was delayed. He was not the only one. The visit by Aleksandr Shokhin, head of the Russian side of the Russian-Chinese Interstate Cooperation Commission, has been postponed four times and now no one knows whether it will take place at all. Of course, it was our purely internal problems which were to blame for all of this. But Chinese diplomacy, which has recently been making progress in relations with the United States, Europe, and countries in the Asia and Pacific region, was painfully aware of a certain stagnation in dealings with Russia and saw no Russian interlocutors even as high as deputy foreign minister. However, the two states have things to discuss. It is a little over a year since Boris Yeltsin's visit to China, during which over 20 agreements were signed, the majority of which are not in operation. Some agreements have brought unexpected results. The accord on visa-free tourist exchange is in itself absolutely normal. But in practice it has transpired that sometimes it is only the tour guide makes it back to China. Another problem that Kozyrev will probably have to discuss in Beijing is connected with the agreement, now in abeyance, on the construction of a nuclear power station here with Russian assistance. The accord on this was reached a year ago and the Russian side, which is extremely interested in this major order for its now idle "Energomash" plant, promised China a substantial credit for this construction project. Since then the Chinese, who incidentally have an acute need for electric power, have not returned to this topic for a reason which perhaps our foreign minister will try to find out. Apart from everything else, during Kozyrev's visit to Beijing he is going to read a lecture on the fundamentals of Russia's Asia policy at the Institute of People's Diplomacy. This is of particular interest because there are those who think that Russia does not have such a policy.
