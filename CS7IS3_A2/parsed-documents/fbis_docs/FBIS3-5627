Hosokawa, replying to questions from Hiroshi Tachiki of the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) in the House of Councillors plenary session, said the government "will wait and see how the investigation develops." Nakamura, 44, who bolted from the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on Wednesday, is suspected of taking a 10 million yen bribe from Kajima in January 1992, investigative sources said. On Tuesday, prosecutors asked Tokyo district court to issue an arrest warrant for him. The court submitted a document to the cabinet asking for Diet permission to lift parliamentary immunity on Nakamura from arrest. The cabinet in turn passed it to the House of Representatives, to which Nakamura belongs. The Diet is currently in the middle of a 150-day regular session due to end in June.
