Tomiichi Murayama made the comment at a meeting of former SDP lawmakers at a time when the fragile coalition led by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata is preparing to hold talks with the SDP to lure it back into the fold. The SDP chairman told the meeting the proposed alliance with the LDP would be temporary, limited to governing until House of Representatives general elections which may follow a threatened no-confidence motion by the LDP against the Hata government. The SDP has indicated it may support a no-confidence vote. The SDP left the governing alliance in April after the establishment of a new parliamentary group by some coalition parties, excluding the SDP.
