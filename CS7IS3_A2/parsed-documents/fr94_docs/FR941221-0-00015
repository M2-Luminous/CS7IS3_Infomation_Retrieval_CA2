FR941221-0-00015 FR941221-0-00005 Philadelphia Gas contends that pipelines should be required to post marketing affiliate discount information contemporaneously with the discount offer to restore competitive equality between the Commission's capacity release system and the pipelines' sale of interruptible service. It asserts that LDCs are competitively disadvantaged because capacity release transactions must be immediately posted on pipeline EBBs, thereby enabling pipelines to undercut LDCs' release transactions, while pipeline interruptible transactions are not subject to a similar contemporaneous posting requirement. Philadelphia Gas further contends that posting prior to gas flow would benefit LDCs, and their customers, by permitting competitors of the marketing affiliate the opportunity to compete for a specific transaction. Discussion The Commission denies the requests for rehearing. The Commission's revision to Standard H in Order No. 566&hyph;A essentially maintains the same regulatory scheme that existed under Order No. 497. Pipelines are required to make any discounts offered to marketing affiliates contemporaneously available to similarly situated non-affiliated shippers. But pipelines are not required to post detailed information about marketing affiliate discounts until after the transportation transaction has begun. As the Commission found in Order No. 566&hyph;A, its marketing affiliate regulations should strike the proper balance between the need to provide information about marketing affiliate discounts and the need to ensure that affiliates can compete on a relatively equal basis with non-affiliated marketers. Posting marketing affiliate discount offers during the negotiating process could provide non-affiliated marketers with competitive advantages over marketing affiliates by providing the non-affiliates with important competitive information about marketing affiliate deals. Such information could provide non-affiliated marketers with the opportunity to interfere in negotiations between pipeline marketing affiliates and customers. On the other hand, non-affiliated marketers are not faced with a similar risk since information about non-affiliate deals is not publicly available to marketing affiliates. At the same time, posting of marketing affiliate information after gas flows still provides the market with sufficient information about marketing affiliate transactions to deter discriminatory treatment. The primary purpose of the posting requirement was to permit monitoring of marketing affiliate transactions, not to assist non-affiliates in their direct competition with marketing affiliates for particular customers. The Commission disagrees with the petitioners' contention that posting of discount offers to marketing affiliates after gas flows tips the competitive balance too far in favor of marketing affiliates. Non-affiliated marketers do not need to know of offers to marketing affiliates to negotiate with potential customers. During the negotiations, non-affiliates can request discounts from the pipeline, and, under Standard H, the pipeline is required to provide the non-affiliate with the discount if it has offered a discount to a marketing affiliate in similar circumstances. Similarly, an LDC, like Philadelphia Gas, is not disadvantaged by the after-the-fact posting requirement because it can request competing offers from non-affiliated marketers knowing the pipeline must provide the non-affiliate with the same transportation discount offered to a marketing affiliate. By requiring that marketing affiliate discount information is posted after gas flows, the Commission has established a mechanism to ensure that pipelines honor their obligation to provide appropriate discounts to non-affiliates. A pipeline is unlikely to deny a legitimate discount request from a non-affiliate because the pipeline knows that its discount to its marketing affiliate will almost immediately be posted on the EBB enabling the non-affiliate to detect potential discrimination. Posting within 24 hours of gas flow also is early enough so that a non-affiliate, which has negotiated its own independent deal with a customer, can still obtain the same discount for transportation, during the same time period, as the marketing affiliate. Thus, posting of marketing affiliate discount information after gas flows establishes the proper balance between the interests in providing sufficient public disclosure of marketing affiliate discount information to deter discriminatory treatment and ensuring that marketing affiliates can compete on an equal basis with non-affiliated shippers during the negotiation process.
