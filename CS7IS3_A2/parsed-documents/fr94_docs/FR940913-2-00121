SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background On April 14, 1994, the Executive Office of the President published in the Federal Register a notice of intent to form a 30-member policy dialog advisory committee to assist in the development of measures to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from personal motor vehicles. That notice set forth the purpose of the committee and its goals, and asked for suggestions from the public for members of the committee. The period for public comment in response to the notice ended May 4, 1994. Over 160 comments, suggesting more than 170 potential committee members, were submitted in response to the notice. As set forth in the April 14, 1994 notice, the policy dialog arises out of the President's Climate Change Action Plan, issued in October 1993. The committee will develop recommendations on the sets of policies that would, if adopted, most cost-effectively obtain a return to 1990 levels of greenhouse gas emissions from personal motor vehicles by the years 2005, 2015 and 2025, with no upturn thereafter. This framework of achievement of 1990 emissions levels in three alternative years is intended to focus the issues and the recommendations to be considered by the committee. Decisions on the amount and timing of reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from personal motor vehicles, and the policies to attain them, remain the responsibility of the federal government. The Administration has stated that it is committed to significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from personal motor vehicles. The committee will, as stated in the April 14, 1994 notice, include representatives from state and local governments; the automobile industry and related parties; labor; transportation fuels; and public interest groups, including the driving public. Thirty individuals have been tentatively selected to be members of the committee, though any formal appointments will be subject to final checks on availability and other issues. It is contemplated that these checks will be completed prior to the committee's first meeting on September 28. Announcement of the full committee membership will be made as soon as all members are appointed. II. Schedule for the Committee's Work The Committee Charter provides that the committee's work shall be completed, and its report issued, within one year of its first meeting, unless such period is extended by the President. The Charter also provides that the committee shall issue an interim report not later than six months after the date of its first meeting. III. Committee Procedures The following procedures and guidelines shall apply to the committee unless they are modified by the committee. A. Facilitator The committee shall be chaired by a neutral facilitator. Suzanne Orenstein, of Resolve, Inc., has been retained by the federal government to perform this function. The facilitator will not take positions about substantive outcomes of the committee's work. The facilitator's role is to chair committee meetings, help the committee process run smoothly, and help participants define and reach consensus. B. Support for Agreement The committee is charged to work toward a set of consensus policy options that committee members can, for the foreseeable future, support individually and on behalf of the constituencies they represent. C. Meetings Meetings will be held in Washington, DC and at other locations at the convenience of the committee. The Executive Office of the President will announce committee meetings in the Federal Register in accordance with the FACA. Such meetings will be open to the public as provided in and subject to the provisions of the FACA. D. Committee Procedures Under the general guidance and direction of the facilitator, and subject to any applicable legal requirements, the members will establish the detailed procedures for committee meetings which they consider most appropriate. E. Use of Electronic Communications Subject to the further decision of the committee, the committee's agendas, meeting summaries and related items will be available to the public through the Technology Transfer Network of the Office of Air Quality Planning & Standards of the Environmental Protection Agency.
