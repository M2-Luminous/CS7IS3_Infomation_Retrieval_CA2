This accusation was leveled by Tilman Zuelch, president of the Association for Threatened Peoples. Between 1985 and 1991 alone, military equipment worth 3.6 billion German marks was exported to Turkey. Together with Kurds, the Association for Threatened Peoples continued the vigil in front of the Defense Ministry in Bonn yesterday. They wanted to protest against Bonn's hostile foreign policy vis-a-vis the Kurds, a statement read. Zuelch accused the Bonn government of having given away free a large quantity of military equipment of the former People's Army to Turkey. It included 300 armored personnel carriers and 350 armored vehicles, 100,000 bazookas, 250,000 submachine guns, and 500,000 rounds of ammunition. Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel confirmed on Monday [28 March] that the Federal Government has been assured that German weapons are not being used in Kurdistan. The Turkish Government is doing "everything possible to keep this promise," Kinkel stressed. [passage omitted]
