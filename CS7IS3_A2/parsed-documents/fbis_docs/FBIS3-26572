Before the signing ceremony, Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing met with representatives of the five overseas firms: the Italian Agip, the French Elf, the Japanese Energy Corporation, the Japanese Petroleum Exploration Company and Texaco of the U.S.A. The contract is the second one on petroleum prospecting and exploration in the Tarim Basin. It is also the second one in China's world-wide public tendering for cooperation in exploiting China's land oil. Under the new contract, the foreign firms will for the next eight years shoulder all the expenses and risks in prospecting; when oil and gas fields are found, the two sides will jointly invest in exploration and production, and share the crude oil in proportions laid down by the contract. It is learned that since March 1 last year, when the China National Petroleum Corporation opened the first round of public tendering for the project, 68 corporations from 17 countries had applied for the tendering documents and 54 of them had sent representatives to Beijing to study relevant materials. The south-eastern area of the Tarim Basin open for cooperation consists of five sectors covered mainly by sand.
