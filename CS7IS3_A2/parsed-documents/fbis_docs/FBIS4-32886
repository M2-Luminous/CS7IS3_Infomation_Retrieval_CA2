Government sources confirmed today the resignations of Planning (Cordiplan) Minister Enzo del Bufalo and Transport and Communications Minister Cesar Quintini, and said Caldera is expected to announce his new cabinet by Monday [30 May] at the latest. According to political observers, Del Bufalo's departure is due to his "conceptual differences" with government economic proposals. Quintini was accused of "not touching the Perez corruption structures (referring to jailed former president Carlos Andres Perez) that rule the ministry," by his former deputy minister Rafael Iribarren, who resigned. Others who will leave their posts are the ministers for urban development and environment and natural renewable resources. Central Information Office Chief Guillermo Alvarez Bajares justified the change of ministers arguing that this is not a single party administration and its heterogeneity makes differences understandable. Alvarez denied that the removal of ministers proves the failure of certain policies and he pointed out that the president has the power to modify and restructure his council of ministers at any moment. The current cabinet, made up of 26 ministers, the federal district government, and the head of the Presidential Committee to Reform the State, had been restructured by Caldera on 31 January, two days before becoming president.
