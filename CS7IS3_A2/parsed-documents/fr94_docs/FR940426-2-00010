FR940426-2-00010 FR940426-2-00004 Matching Requirements Applicants will be expected to supply two thirds (2/3) of total project costs, with the Federal portion to be one third (1/3). The Department of Commerce will support only a portion of the direct costs of each project. Each applicant will support a portion of the direct costs (to be specified in the application). For purposes of this program, ``direct costs'' are defined as personnel, fringe benefits, travel, equipment, supplies, contractual, and other direct costs (e.g., rent and furnishings for an overseas office). A minimum of one half (1/2) of each applicant's support must be in the form of new cash outlays expressly for the project. The balance of the applicant's support may consist of in-kind contributions (goods and services). Applicants may charge companies in the industry or other industry organizations reasonable fees to take part in or avail themselves of services provided as part of applicants' projects. Plans to charge fees should be described in detail in the applicant's application. Type of Funding Instrument Since it is anticipated that ITA will be substantially involved in the implementation of each project for which an award is made, the funding instrument for this program will be a cooperative agreement. Eligibility Criteria Trade associations, nonprofit industry organizations, state trade departments and their regional associations including centers for international trade development, and private industry firms or groups of firms in cases where no entity described above represents that industry are eligible to apply for cooperative agreements under this program. For the purpose of this program, a ``nonprofit industry organization'' is defined as any nonprofit organization (such as chambers of commerce and world trade centers) made up of firms in an industry, or which is established or funded by and which operates on behalf of an industry. For the purpose of this program, a ``trade association'' is defined as consisting of member firms in the same industry, or in related industries, or which share common commercial concerns. The purpose of the association is to further the commercial interests of its members through the exchange of information, legislative activities, and the like. Eligible entities may join together to submit an application as a joint venture and to share costs. For example, two trade associations representing different segments of a single industry or related industries may pool their resources and submit one application. Foreign businesses and private groups also may join with eligible U.S. organizations to submit applications and to share the costs of proposed projects. Applications will be accepted from eligible entities representing any industry, subsector of an industry or related industries. Each applicant must permit all companies in the industry in question to participate, on equal terms, in all activities that are scheduled as part of a proposed project whether or not the company is a member or constituent of the eligible organization. Eligible entities desiring to participate in this program must demonstrate the ability to provide a competent, experienced staff and other resources to assure adequate development, supervision and execution of the proposed project activities. Applicants must describe in detail all assistance expected from the Department of Commerce or other Federal Government agencies to implement project activities successfully. Each applicant must provide a description of the membership of the eligible entity, the degree to which the entity represents the industry or industries in question, and the role, if any, foreign membership plays in the affairs of the eligible entity. Applicants should summarize both the recent history of their industry or industries' competitiveness in the international marketplace and the export promotion history of the eligible entity or entities submitting the application.
