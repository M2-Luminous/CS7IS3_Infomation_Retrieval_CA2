Almost 10,000 uprooted Kabulis are waiting on the Afghan side of Torkham for the gates to open, informed eyewitness when contacted by telephone. The figure appeared to be on the high side but the number of people who reached Torkham was substantial and had certainly grown to a few thousand by Wednesday evening. Pakistani border guards estimated that more than 66 vehicles which brought the refugees were also denied entry and now parked on the Afghans side of the border. The border was sealed on a day when Kabul was bombed at least seven times by Gen Rashid Dostam's warplanes and even the relatively safe Khairkhana area in northern part of the city was rocketed, killing 10 people and injuring many more. Habibullah Khan, political agent, KHYBER AGENCY, told THE NEWS that they had sealed the border on the instructions of the federal government, which apparently communicated the decision to the NWFP [North-West Frontier Province] government Tuesday. He said the Afghans possessing Pakistan's visa were being allowed to enter Pakistan. Beside Torkham, the second official crossing point between Pakistan and Afghanistan is Chaman in Balochistan province. The gates at the two border towns are opened at sunrise and closed by sunset. There is a large number of other passes and routes on the 1300-mile Durand Line which serves as a boundary between the two neighbouring states. The border is long and porous and cannot be policed. A federal government official, requesting anonymity, while confirming the sealing of the border, said the stage had come to implement an administrative decision that was long overdue. He said the decision was reached after exhaustive discussions and weighing all pros and cons. We are willing to provide the required support to the displaced Afghans in their own country, he argued. He said Pakistan with help from the UN and NGOs [non-governmental organizations] had sent tents, flour and other relief goods for the refugees in Jalalabad and would provide more help once these people were resettled in camps set up in Samarkhel and Dosaraka Hissarshahi. Earlier in Islamabad, a Foreign Office spokesman had denied reports about the closure of border. He, however, added that Pakistan and the UN were trying to resettle the Afghans fleeing the fighting in Kabul on Afghan territory. He also said 14,410 Afghans who entered Pakistan since the outbreak of hostilities on New Year registered themselves. An unspecified number of new arrivals, he added, had also come through other crossing points on the border. The federal government had taken a decision about sealing of the border in the past as well but it was subsequently withdrawn. It remains to be seen how serious is the government in implementing this decision. In any case, the Afghans wanting to enter Pakistan may use the other unofficial crossing points. As the stranded Afghans prepared to spend a chilly winter night at Torkham in miserable conditions, the closure of the border also blocked the routine flow of hundreds of the people from both countries across the border. The federal government decision took the NWFP government by surprise. Only a couple of days ago, the Foreign Office had said no Afghan refugee would be turned back at Torkham. A high-ranking provincial government officer, who wished anonymity, wondered at the logic behind the sudden decision. He recalled that 100,000 Afghans who crossed in to Pakistan after the battles of Kabul last year were all accommodated in NWFP without putting much burden on the government. He argued that most of them were settled in camps vacated by the repatriating refugees while a substantial number took up residence with relations and friends in Peshawar. The new arrivals, he pointed, too were from Kabul and would like to live in Peshawar or other urban centres in the province. Meanwhile, reports from Kabul said Dostam's aircraft bombed Rabbani government installations in the capital and in Charikar, Jebel-us-Straj and Bagram. The Television hillock was another target for these jet-fighters, which reportedly flew from Mazar-e Sharif. Radio Kabul, which had gone off the air on the first day of the ongoing battle for Kabul on January 1, resumed its broadcasts Wednesday on another frequency.
