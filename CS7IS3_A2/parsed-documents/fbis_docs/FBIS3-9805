Szilagyi; place and date not given: "The KDNP's Suggestion Is Not a Campaign Trick"] [Text] Janos Szabo Hatvani, director of the State Property Agency [AVU], also participated in the 28 March session of the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP]. At the meeting the KDNP's concerns about privatization were discussed, and the party's latest suggestion that no privatization contracts should be made until the new parliament takes office was also mentioned. [Szilagyi] The KDNP's latest suggestion regarding the change of ownership met with indignation in economic and financial circles. Why did the executive committee deem it necessary to suspend privatization? [Csepe] The executive committee was aware of the fact that, being a party with a small parliamentary representation, the KDNP cannot have the necessary amount of say in the decisions and privatization deals would not be stopped after its call. The main reason for our initiative is that the Christian Democratic concerns should not be forgotten about before the elections and later, when the new government is set up. It is to be feared that during the weeks when the public is busy dealing with the elections, and when it is no longer possible to draw attention to the irregularities through raising questions in Parliament, further bad and irreparable decisions can be made. [Szilagyi] According to the AVU director, the executive committee made a hasty statement that serves campaign purposes. [Csepe] I refuse this most firmly. We have not now begun to deal with this issue to win over the voters. The KDNP's current proposal is a reformulation of our former criticism. [Szilagyi] Have you prepared any analyses about what effects your initiative can have on the fate of enterprises awaiting privatization that are on the brink of bankruptcy, and how the proposal will affect Hungary's foreign image? [Csepe] The executive committee's statement was based on the KDNP's former privatization investigations and analytical assessments. My personal view is that it is useful to implement this proposal, with the provision that it should not be applied in those cases where the suspension would be damaging from a financial or economic point of view. [Szilagyi] According to our information, many KDNP members also had a negative view on this proposal. Many of them consider it damaging and unfavorable for the party's image. Did you coordinate this proposal with the party's other leading bodies and its parliamentary group? [Csepe] We did not widely discuss the proposal, this was a decision of the executive committee in its own sphere of authority. I do not think that it will become a source of tension in the party.
