Dams, minidams, and other hydraulic works in the territory have accumulated 328 million cubic meters. Their users were assigned 150 million cubic meters for this year, and have used 30 percent. An official said precipitation in May left lots of moisture in the soil, so it does not matter if there is no rain in the near future. [Begin unidentified official recording] We can state that the first semester of 1995 has its water guaranteed in the dams. [end recording] This is a relief for a province where heavy rainfall is followed by long dry periods. For example, following the deluge in May, there is hardly any precipitation in June; registered rainfall does not even reach the 3-mm mark. Nevertheless, a gradual increase in rain is expected by mid-September. [Begin unidentified official recording] That would practically fill the reservoirs to capacity by year end. [end recording] It is true that the capricious weather had harsh results in Guantanamo Province, but every cloud has its silver lining. No one will be able to justify his failure to fulfill goals due to the lack of water. There is enough water in the reservoirs. It is only a matter of using it efficiently.
