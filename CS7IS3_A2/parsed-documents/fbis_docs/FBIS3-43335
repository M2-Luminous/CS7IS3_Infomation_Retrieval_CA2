The FA -- a conservative grouping that includes the Inkatha Freedom Party, the Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front], the Conservative Party, Bophuthatswana and the Ciskei -- was responding to a government/ANC [African National Congress] proposal that the FA commit itself to the electoral process ahead of changes to the constitution. The proposal was made in talks between the three groupings on December 21 last year. In a statement issued a day after FA leaders met in Pretoria, the FA said it had already committed itself to an all-inclusive agreement through peaceful negotiations if its amendments to the constitution were included in a minimum package. It urged government and the ANC to proceed immediately with negotiations on its proposals. The statement said its constitutional proposals included provisions for self-determination of peoples on a territorial basis; the powers, functions and financial affairs of provinces; and separate ballot papers for elections for different levels of government. "The issue of a single ballot paper specifically undermines the democratic foundations of the system of proportional representation and the individual voter's right to choose. "The FA and its leaders reiterate that for any such agreement to be reached, it should immediately be effected through formal amendments to the constitution of 1993, failing which agreement and/or consequent implementation, there cannot be any commitment."
