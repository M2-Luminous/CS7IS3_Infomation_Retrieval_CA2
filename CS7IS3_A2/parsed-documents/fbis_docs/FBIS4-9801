Its main objective is to contain the country's inflation at moderate levels, similar to the ones in industrialized nations. The central institution has, as of this Friday, the authority to deny loan requests to cover the government's fiscal deficits, one of the factors which contributed greatly to high inflation rates. "Sharp and prolonged inflation rates are closely linked to fiscal deficits," President Carlos Salinas de Gortari said in his legislative effort to give autonomy to the Bank of Mexico on 17 May 1993. [passage omitted] The Bank of Mexico's autonomy is based on the bank's board of directors, which consists of a governor and four deputy governors who are to be proposed by the executive branch and ratified by Congress. On 26 March, Congress ratified the presidential proposal to appoint current Bank of Mexico Director Miguel Mancera Aguayo as the first governor of the autonomous institution for an eight-year term. [passage omitted] According to the law, Mancera will occupy the governor's post for three years and nine months, and the deputy governors will hold their positions in terms that vary from nine months, two years and nine months, four years and nine months, and six years and nine months. The deputy governors are Guillermo Prieto Fortun, who will occupy the position until 31 December 1994; Ariel Buira, until the same month in 1996; Jesus Marco Yacaman, until December 1998; and Francisco Gil Diaz, until December 2000. A board of directors position is a solid one, and the directors can only be removed in case of a serious misdeed.
