However, economic development will pick up gradually, DIHT General Manager Franz Schoser said when he presented the traditional DIHT spring survey of approximately 25,000 enterprises. In his view, there is no reason to give the all-clear signal for economic development because orders on hand in the companies are still low, production capacities are being insufficiently utilized, and the profit situation is unsatisfactory. For all of Germany, DIHT expects a growth of 0.5 percent at best. The DIHT spring survey has come to the conclusion that, for the first time in an extended period, there are slight trends of recovery in west German industry. This moderate confidence is primarily due to increasing exports. The resulting economic growth will, however, not be sufficient to bring the reduction of employment in western Germany to a halt by the end of 1994. The current stagnation of economic development at a low level continues to reveal the processes of structural adjustment in western Germany, in Schoser's view. Efforts to improve competitiveness and the quality of Germany as an industrial location have shown some success; however, painfully achieved cost reductions are all too often counteracted by additional burdens imposed by the state. This is particularly due to the wave of local taxes and fees, which has recently been steadily swelling. In addition, economic development is hampered by the relatively low purchasing power, which affects, in particular, the trade and service sector. Regarding the development of employment, there is not yet any easing of tension to be seen at the moment, not to mention a change in the trend. The forthcoming wage contracts are currently playing a key role in all plans for personnel by the companies. The investment climate, which has been rather frosty so far, has not yet warmed decisively, Schoser noted in Bonn. Positive corrections in the investment plans can be expected only if the revival of exports were to be stronger this year than expected. The current stimuli -- primarily from North and South America and from Southeast Asia -- are still too weak to act as an engine for the German economy, especially since demand from Germany's main export region, Europe, is weak. The assessment of the situation in eastern Germany, on the other hand, is generally more optimistic. The confidence dominating there is primarily based on a clear increase in orders received. According to DIHT's assessment, even quicker recovery of the east German companies is, however, still hindered by the excessively rising wage and ancillary wage costs, which are an oppressing burden. Many private companies also have an insufficient amount of capital. Even though investment activities will remain energetic in eastern Germany in 1994, especially in the construction sector, the marked investment dynamism of the initial period after German unification will abate slowly, because various large-scale investments have been concluded already. Bright Spot for Exporters DIHT still sees tremendous administrative obstacles in the new laender for exploiting investment potential -- for instance, in purchasing and utilizing real estate property. DIHT expects a bright spot for the east German exporters, whose prospects on the world market are gradually improving. Their importance for the overall German economy, however, still remains small. The reduction of personnel will certainly come to a halt by the end of this year, the DIHT predicts.
