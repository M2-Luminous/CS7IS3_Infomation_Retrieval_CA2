Lieutenant Colonel Munir al-Maqdah, a former Fatah military official who opposes the Gaza-Jericho Agreement, has stated that Yasir 'Arafat is to blame for the Hebron massacre because he signed the above agreement. Al-Maqdah announced: Our retaliation to this massacre will be very cruel. We will use all available methods. Let no one, inside or outside the occupied territories, blame us. Al-Maqdah called on 'Arafat not just to resign, because his resignation is no longer useful, but to take out his pistol and point it at his own head.
