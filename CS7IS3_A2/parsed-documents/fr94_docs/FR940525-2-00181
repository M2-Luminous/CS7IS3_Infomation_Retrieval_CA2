FR940525-2-00181 FR940525-2-00102 Petition for Waivers of Compliance In accordance with 49 CFR 211.9 and 211.41, notice is hereby given that the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has received from Texas Parks and Wildlife Department of request for waivers of compliance with certain requirements of Federal regulations. The petition is described below, including the regulatory provisions involved, the nature of the relief being requested and the petitioner's arguments in favor of relief. Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWX), Docket Number SA&hyph;92&hyph;4 The TPWX on behalf of the Texas State Railroad (TSR) seeks a waiver of compliance from certain Sections of 49 CFR part 231, Railroad Safety Appliance Standards. The TSR is requesting a permanent waiver of the provisions of 49 CFR 231.29 ``Road Locomotives with corner stairways'' which requires that road locomotives with corner stairways must be equipped with (a) uncoupling levers that can be operated safely from the bottom stairway opening step as well as from the ground level, and (b) the vertical handholds and horizontal and handholds as prescribed in 231.30(e) and (g). The TSR is also requesting a waiver of 49 CFR 231.30 ``Locomotives used in switching service'' which requires that each locomotive used in switching service be equipped with four side switching steps, each of which has a minimum width of 24 inches and a minimum depth of 12 inches for locomotives built after March 31, 1977, and for locomotives built prior to April 1, 1977, a minimum width of 18 inches and the minimum depth of 8 inches. The locomotive TSRR number 1 for which this waiver is requested is a 45-ton center cab, industrial switcher type locomotive. This type of locomotive has a side switching step and ladder configuration located at each of the four corners which are narrower and of less depth than those required by the Safety Appliance Standards. The railroad states that the construction of this locomotive does not permit it to be retrofitted with side switching steps different than it currently possesses. Locomotive TSRR number 1 is used primarily in shop areas to move dead locomotives and cars in the work area. Occasionally when the road locomotives are out of service, it is used on a light work train. The switchman will mount or dismount the locomotive only when it is stopped. Interested parties are invited to participate in these proceedings by submitting written views, data, or comments. FRA does not anticipate scheduling a public hearing in connection with these proceedings since the facts do not appear to warrant a hearing. If any interested party desires an opportunity for oral comment, they should notify FRA, in writing, before the end of the comment period and specify the basis for their request. All communications concerning these proceedings should identify the appropriate docket number (e.g., Waiver Petition Docket Number SA&hyph;92&hyph;4 and must be submitted in triplicate to the Docket Clerk, Office of Chief Counsel, FRA, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. Communications received before June 28, 1994, will be considered by FRA before final action is taken. Comments received after that date will be considered as far as practicable. All written communications concerning these proceedings are available for examination during regular business hours (9 a.m.&hyph;5 p.m.) in room 8201, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. Issued in Washington, DC on May 19, 1994. Phil Olekszyk, Acting Deputy Associate Administrator for Safety Compliance and Program Implementation.
