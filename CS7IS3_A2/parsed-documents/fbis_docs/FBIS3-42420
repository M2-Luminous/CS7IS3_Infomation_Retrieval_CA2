Power to the patrol ship, `Hetman Sahaydachnyy' from on-shore power sources was cut off recently. The disruption in electric power sources led to major expenditures of fuel and service life for the diesel engines aboard the patrol ship. This technical problem prompted the warship's transfer to another Sevastopol wharf. The ship was prevented from docking and establishing communications. "Guardsmen" cut the "Hetman Sahaydachnyy"'s mooring lines. As a result, the commander, Captain 3rd Rank V. Katushenko ordered the patrol ship to stand off at some distance from the "inhospitable" shore. Ukrainian sailors had to wait a whole day to find out whether or not the "Hetman Sahaydachnyy" would be able to tie up along side its new wharf. This conflict was eventually resolved, "but not without intervention of `higher authorities' in Kiev." The report concluded with the reminder that, "Sevastopol legally is the primary navy base for our state."
