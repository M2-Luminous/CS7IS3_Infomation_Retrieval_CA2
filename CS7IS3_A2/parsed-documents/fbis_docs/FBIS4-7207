Sato, 72, is a member of the coalition's core party Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party). Sato made three abortive attempts to win a seat in the lower house before finally being elected to the House of Representatives. He is currently serving his 9th term in the lower house. With the appointment Sato, a self-declared close aide of disgraced LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] kingpin Shin Kanemaru, returns to the political spotlight. It was Sato who in August 1992 read out Kanemaru's statement announcing his resignation from the LDP vice presidency over his acceptance of 500 million yen in undeclared donations from a scandal-ridden trucking firm. Sato, who hails from Hiroshima, is said to have adapted quickly to the post-Kanemaru era, distancing himself from the fallen LDP powerbroker. While serving as agriculture minister, Sato managed to break the deadlock in fishery rights negotiations with the former Soviet Union in 1985. In his LDP days, he gained experience mainly in the fields of transport and telecommunications. He has also served as National Land Agency director general.
