On his return from London, where he secured the support of the Cabinet, Mr Patten reiterated Britain's will to resume talks with China. But the British gesture was not greeted by the Chinese side. A senior official of Xinhua (the New China News Agency), Zheng Guoxiong, reiterated the call for the withdrawal of the whole Patten proposal as a prerequisite for China's return to the negotiating table. Mr Patten said there was a pressing timetable for implementing legislation for the coming elections and a "step by step" approach would give room for further talks. Noting that the Chinese side had changed its mind at the opening of the bilateral negotiations early last year Mr Patten said: "It's giving the Chinese side the time, if they wish to take it, to have second or third thoughts." Another reason for not moving the second and more sensitive part of the bill was due to the "legislative reality". "I don't think the Legislative Council would welcome it if, while they were considering this bill we were to bring forward another bill," Mr Patten said. Responding to the Cabinet meeting decision, Mr Zheng said he was not surprised at all by its support for Mr Patten.
