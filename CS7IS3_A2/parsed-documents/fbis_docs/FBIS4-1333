"As the leader of the National Party, I made a promise to guide our nation into a new era of freedom. I have kept that promise. I made a promise to end apartheid -- and I have. I made a promise to release Nelson Mandela and unban the ANC and others -- and I have. I made a promise to hold free elections where all the people could vote. I have kept that promise too. "The National Party has kept all its promises. "After the election we will have a government of national unity. This means that the political parties will share power. It is in the best interests of our country that the National Party should lead that government. If you help us to win a majority of votes, you will enable me to continue to work for our vision of a new, prosperous and peaceful South Africa. "We will have a great deal of hard work to do after the elections. We have to improve the living conditions of all our people. Because that is the key to peace and prosperity. We must build houses for the homeless. We must ensure a high standard of education for all our people. We must create job opportunities. "To do all this, we must make the economy grow through sound economic policies. We must have low levels of taxation, low inflation and low interest rates. And we must attract huge foreign investment. "Most of all we must restore respect for the rule of law so that violence, crime and intimidation can be driven forever from our society. We must ensure that all the people can live in dignity without fear, oppression or humiliation. "The only safe choice for all people who want peace, harmony and a prosperous future is to vote for a strong new National Party. "If you give me your help, I promise that we will build a great new South Africa. "And as you know -- we keep our promises. "Come, let us join hands and work together for a better life." "F W De Klerk "Be Sure of a Better Life "Vote for FW de Klerk and the new National Party "We've made the change"
