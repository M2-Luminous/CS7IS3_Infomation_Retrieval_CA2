Being aware of the real danger threatening the democratic freedoms, PPG is forced to become an underground, illegal party, declared Tausangi. According to him, having the majority in parliament, the Democratic Agrarian Party and the socialists will have no more reasons to say they have not enough power to improve the situation and blame the opposition for all failures. "We regret much that the socialists are frankly supporting the anti-people regime of Topal-Kendighelean", Tausangi asserted.
