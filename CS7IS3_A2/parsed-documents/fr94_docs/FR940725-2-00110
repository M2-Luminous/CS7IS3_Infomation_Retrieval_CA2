FR940725-2-00110 FR940725-2-00066 IV. Discussion The Commission finds that the proposed rule changes are consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements of Section 6(b). 18 In particular, the Commission believes the proposals are consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) requirements that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts, and, in general, protect investors and the public interest. 18 15 U.S.C. ยง78f(b) (1988). After careful review of the operation of the pilot programs, the Commission has concluded that the revised MIOER should help provide a safe and efficient mechanism by which index call options can be written in a cash account. As set forth in more detail in its order approving the pilot procedures, 19 the commission believes that the range of collateral permitted thereunder should provide market participants with greater flexibility, prevent settlement delays and eliminate many of the problems encountered under the original MIOER program. To the extent that the revised escrow receipt is a cost-effective means for institutions restricted to cash account transactions to manage portfolio risk, its implementation on a permanent basis should encourage broader participation in the index options market, thereby adding depth and liquidity to that market. 19 See pilot approval order, supra, note 10. Based on their experience with the pilot program, however, the SROs, along with OCC, have proposed certain minor refinements to the types of property acceptable as collateral for MIOERs issued to cover short call positions. As the Commission noted in regard to the recently approved OCC proposal, 20 these new standards will ensure that only liquid assets are eligible to underlie escrow receipts. Specifically, the Commission believes that the proposed rule changes are a reasonable response to OCC's finding that certificates of deposit and bankers acceptances present an undue risk to OCC because it has no means of ensuring that issuers of such instruments are financially sound. 21 Thus, the Commission agrees with the SROs that limiting ``cash equivalents'' to short-term United States government securities will enhance the integrity of escrowed collateral. Moreover, the changes to the definition of ``qualified equity security'' are consistent with the Federal Reserve Board's definition of ``margin security'' or existing OCC rules. 20 See OCC approval order, supra, note 5. 21 In contrast to its monitoring of MIOER issuers, OCC receives no financial information on banks issuing certificates of deposit or bankers' acceptances. Because of the potential exposure if the issuer fails and the instruments become worthless, OCC proposed eliminating them as eligible types of collateral. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26951 (June 21, 1989), 54 FR 26870 (June 26, 1989) (File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;89&hyph;04). OCC also found that few customers utilize such instruments. Id. Finally, the Commission has determined that the escrow receipt contains safeguards ( e.g., minimum collateral levels; the requirement that issuing banks or trust companies notify customers and OCC of reductions in collateral 22 that should help ensure the adequacy of the collateral posted and diminish the risks associated with MIOERs. To date, the SROs' experience with the pilot program supports the Commission's earlier conclusion that, absent extremely unusual circumstances, the value of the collateral should be greater than the cash difference between the current index value and the exercise price of the option ( i.e., the amount that must be delivered upon assignment). 23 The Commission therefore believes that implementation on a permanent basis is now appropriate. 22 For further discussion of value requirements and incentives for the industry to police itself, see supra, notes 14&hyph;15 and accompanying text. 23 See pilot approval order, supra, note 10. The Phlx proposal regarding the types of property acceptable as collateral for escrow receipts issued to cover short put positions 24 is identical to existing rules in other options markets. 25 The Commission finds that the Phlx proposal will provide sufficient investor protection while facilitating hedging transactions in both broad-based stock index options and individual stock options. 24 See supra, note 4. 25 See, e.g., NYSE Rule 431(f)(2)(H)(iv). The commission finds good cause for approving Amendment Nos. 1, 7 and 5 to the CBOE, PSE and Phlx proposals, respectively, prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof. These amendments merely conform the exchanges proposals with recently approved amendments to OCC rules. 26 Finally, the Commission did not receive any comments on either original CBOE, PSE and Phlx proposals or the comparable OCC proposal, both of which were noticed for he full statutory period. 26 For further discussion of the substance of these amendments, see supra, notes 16&hyph;17 and accompanying text. See also OCC approval order, supra note 5. Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the most recent amendments to the proposed rule changes. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rules changes that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to these amendments between the Commission and any persons, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. ยง552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filings will also be available at the principal offices of the CBOE, PSE and Phlx. All submissions should refer to File Nos. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;87&hyph;03; SR&hyph;PSE&hyph;87&hyph;21; and SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;87&hyph;05 and should be submitted by August 15, 1994. V. Conclusion It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 27 that the proposed rule changes permitting, on a permanent basis, the use of cash, cash equivalents, one or more qualified securities, or a combination of the foregoing, as collateral for escrow receipts issued to cover short call positions in broad-based stock index options, in lieu of margin (SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;87&hyph;03; SR&hyph;PSE&hyph;87&hyph;21; and SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;87&hyph;05) hereby are approved. 27 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1982). For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 28 28 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1990). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
