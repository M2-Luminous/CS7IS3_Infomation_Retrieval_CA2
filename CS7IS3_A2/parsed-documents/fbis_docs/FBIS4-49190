FBIS4-49190 "drchi086_a_94002" FBIS-CHI-94-086 Daily Report 4 May 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS General Spokesman Terms U.S. Copyright Threat `Unacceptable' Spokesman Terms U.S. Copyright Threat `Unacceptable' HK0405120594 Hong Kong AFP in English 1011 GMT 4 May 94 HK0405120594 Hong Kong AFP English BFN [Text] Beijing, 4 May (AFP)--Beijing on Wednesday slammed as "unacceptable" and "unfair" US threats of retaliation if China fails to take corrective action over violations of US patents and copyrights within 60 days. "It is unfair for the American side, in disregard of the tremendous efforts and positive progress China has made in protecting intellectual property rights, to threaten trade retaliation," a Foreign Ministry spokesman said. "This is unacceptable to the Chinese side," he added. U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said in Washington on Saturday that China, together with India and Argentina, was one of the worst violators of U.S. copyrights. "If a solution to U.S. concerns has not been reached with these countries within 60 days, or by June 30, they will be named `priority foreign countries' and investigations of their practices will be immediately initiated under section 301 of the Trade Act," Kantor said. By putting off a decision until June 30, Washington has effectively separated the copyright issue from the controversy surrounding renewal of China's most-favoured-nation (MFN) trade status with the United States. The decision on MFN, expected by June 3, has been linked to Beijing improving its human rights record. While foreign countries welcomed the promulgation in 1991 of China's first copyright law, many have continued to criticise the authorities here for turning a bind eye to violations and failing to extract sufficient compensation in cases that are brought to court. However, the spokesman stressed that China had recently taken "major measures" to strengthen enforcement procedures. "China has already sent investigation teams to look into specific cases of U.S. concern and have rectified the order of some enterprises concerned," he said. Vice Premier Li Lanqing said last month that China would also beef up patent protection by issuing a series of amendments to its 1984 Patent Law in the near future. A government spokesman said Wednesday that China's top legislative body -- the standing committee of the National People's Congress -- would review punishments handed out to copyright violators in a further bid to curb "rampant" infringements. While the 1991 copyright law has improved the situation, "piracy of books, audio and video tapes, and computer software has become quite rampant in recent years, in attempts to reap huge profits," the XINHUA news agency quoted Shen Zhengrong, National People's Congress spokesman, as saying. "This has affected China's foreign trade and cultural and scientific exchanges and cooperation with foreign countries," Shen said, adding that copyright violators should be severely punished.
