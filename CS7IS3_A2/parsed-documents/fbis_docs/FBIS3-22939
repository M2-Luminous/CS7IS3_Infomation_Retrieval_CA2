A National Counterterrorism Directorate (DINCOTE) spokesman explained that the EPL has rejected Guzman's leadership and claims it is the authentic representative of Maoist communism in Peru. Abimael Guzman, arrested in September 1992 and sentenced to life in prison, admitted the political and military defeat of his organization that took up in arms in 1980, and asked Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori to negotiate a peace settlement. According to the spokesman, the EPL leaders are: Alberto Ramirez Durand, alias "Comrade Feliciano"; Julio Cesar Mezzich; and a third chieftain whose identity is kept secret by government information services. The schism in the Peruvian terrorist band was confirmed in documents found by police when they arrested a group of 10 EPL members in the San Juan de Lurigancho district in Lima recently. In the documents, the dissidents call Guzman and his followers, "the opportunist rightist line" of the Peruvian Communist Party, the official name of Shining Path. In other messages, previously confiscated in several Peruvian jails, it was also established that the Shining Path members who are loyal to their leader call the EPL "the leftist execution line," the police source added. According to police, the arrest of the EPL terrorists has neutralized the terrorist offensive which was launched in Lima on 7 February, when a car bomb exploded next to the Air Force headquarters and a bomb was placed next to an Army garrison. The terrorists were arrested in the Cerro "Casablanca" area, where they had established a training camp for handling weapons and explosives.
