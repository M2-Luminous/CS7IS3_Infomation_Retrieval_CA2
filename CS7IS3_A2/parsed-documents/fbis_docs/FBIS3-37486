Several votes on various draft decisions by the Duma showed that the overwhelming majority of legislators rejected the president's draft in the form it was submitted. Quite a number of critical remarks were levelled at the presidential document during the debate. Some deputies claimed that the amnesty in question will aggravate the situation in the country, although data from Interior Ministry specialists refuted these claims. However, the prevailing demand was to divide amnesty into criminal and politico-economic and to adopt two documents: the presidential draft concerning criminal wrong-doings and the Duma's draft on political amnesty as well as amnesty to people convicted for economic crimes. "It was clear from the very beginning for the legislation committee that the president's initiative would not pass as it is," its Chairman Vladimir Isakov said at the end of the morning session. In Isakov's opinion, "lawmakers are now facing an alternative of whether to reject the presidential draft completely or amend it, taking two decisions: on criminal and political amnesties," he added. A two-hour interval has been announced in the Duma sessions. Factions will hold consultations to hammer out new draft decisions of the lower chamber. These drafts will be put to vote at the evening session. Under a political amnesty for the sake of national reconciliation, lawmakers understand, above all, an amnesty to people involved in the events of August 19 and 21, 1991, May 1 and October 3-4, 1993. Some claim that the question on amnesty to participants in the October events may be raised only after the parliamentary commission on their investigation completes its work. The presidential draft decision has already been published in the press. In the opinion of many deputies this fact makes them hostages of the present situation. "If we adopt the document, we'll be accused of rampant crime. If we reject the document, mass riots will take place in penitentiaries. The blame will be again laid at the Duma's door," said legislator Vassiliy Lipitsky.
