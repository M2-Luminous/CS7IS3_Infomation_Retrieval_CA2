He is not upset over the magistrates' accusations about Fininvest [Berlusconi business group] and the declarations made by [Judge] Borrelli seem obvious to him: What is happening, the kickback scandal and all that is involved is only the consequence of the "country system" as he calls it. "One could say that the leading businessmen have had to cope with a stack of laws -- explains the Senator [Bossi] -- with a system of compromises that guaranteed no real clash, foreseen as possible under the rules of competition." The Northern League leader drives his metallic-colored car to the umpteenth election meeting in Lavagna (Liguria) where he is expected at 9:00 PM. He knows little about the controversy that has exploded between the leader of Forza Italia and the head of the Clean Hands team. "It was the parties that controlled everything," he continued. "There was a real duopoly and not only in television; an entire economic system was divided between political oligarchy and the dynastic oligarchy of a few powerful business families." The moral of the tale is: "Now Berlusconi is protesting, he talks of a political attack, but to tell the truth I really do not know what he is protesting about. The judges are doing their job, and if they really dig deep down who knows what they will find.... There may also be a political maneuver behind this. The whole kickback scandal is political, otherwise there would be no explanation as to why, at a certain point of the investigation, they decided to attack the League, trying to corner us, by implicating us with the Sama trap, instead of calling on trial all those people that are now fleeing overseas in order not to end up in prison." [Archidiacono] Bossi, are you siding with the magistrates who are prying into Fininvest? [Bossi] No, I am saying that the system of corruption created a heavily interlaced plot. No leading businessman was excluded from this. And I mean no one, have I explained myself? I am saying that if the judicial authorities dig deep, they risk upsetting everything. However, at the same time the kickback scandal was created not to do justice but as an escape valve for a system of old parties in difficulty. I see nothing shattering about this last incident, rather it confirms that Berlusconi is a branch of the old regime: which could even be positive if he demonstrates (as he is doing) that he wants to change. [Archidiacono] I insist, the statements made by the Knight are resentful, he is talking of "political repression" at his expense.... [Bossi] I can well believe that he is shouting, he is afraid of being damaged and of losing votes. Already in the North he will get nothing because we from the League are there. Now he is also running a risk in the South. [Archidiacono] Martinazzoli [secretary of the Italian Popular Party, PPI] even maintains that Berlusconi is suffering from a "sudden attack of megalomania." [Bossi] I will not enter into controversies of this kind. I could not care less. Our alliance with Forza Italia is an electoral alliance precisely to avoid destruction by moderates like Martinazzoli. If I was asked who Berlusconi is, what I think, I would reply that in the end he is some one that has been able to set himself against the old regime.
