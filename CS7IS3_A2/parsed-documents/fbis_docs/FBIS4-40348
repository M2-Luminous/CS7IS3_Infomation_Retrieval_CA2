The announcement was made by Colonel General Vladimir Semenov at a news conference held in the main headquarters of Russian land forces on Wednesday. Russian peace-making forces will be introduced in the area in accordance with Georgian-Abkhazian agreements and Russian president's decree, Semenov emphasized. According to him, at present a task force of the Russian Defence Ministry led by Deputy Defence Minister Colonel General Georgiy Kondratyev is in the area, making a reconnaisance of the sites where the peace-keepers will be stationed and commanding points will be set up. They are going to demine these very sites. Asked if Russian servicemen will be guaranteed security, Semenov underlined that a full guarantee could not be given. The main conditions for such a guarantee lie in demining the terraine in the 12-kilometer strip and building engineering facilities at the peace- keepers' checkpoints, he added. Every effort will be made to prevent losses of Russian servicemen, he said. In case of attacks upon the checkpoints run by Russian peace- keepers, the latter will shoot to kill, he emphasized.
