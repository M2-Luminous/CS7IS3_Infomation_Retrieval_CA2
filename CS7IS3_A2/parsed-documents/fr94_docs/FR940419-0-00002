SUMMARY: The Department of Energy (DOE) today is amending the Financial Assistance Rules (Rules), 10 CFR part 600, to bring the Rules into compliance with Executive Order 12699 of January 5, 1990, Seismic Safety of Federal and Federally Assisted or Regulated New Building Construction.

Review Under Executive Order 12778. I. Introduction To comply with Executive Order 12699 of January 5, 1990, the DOE initially changed its Financial Assistance Rules on February 2, 1992. At the time the Rules were amended, the Uniform Building Code was the only code/standard judged to be ``substantially equivalent'' to the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program's Recommended Provisions for the Development of Seismic Regulations for New Buildings, 1988 Edition. On March 4, 1992, the Interagency Committee on Seismic Safety in Construction (ICSSC), acting in accordance with E.O. 12699, issued a recommendation to the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) finding that specified versions of three of the four model building codes reviewed ``provide a level of seismic safety that is substantially equivalent to the Recommended Provisions for the Development of Seismic Regulations for New Buildings, 1988 Edition (FEMA 222 and 223)'' (see appendix C of the Guidelines and Procedures for Implementation of the Executive Order on Seismic Safety of New Building Construction, ICSSC RP 2.1A, NISTIR 4852, June 1992). Following this ``certification,'' the DOE again proposed changes to the Financial Assistance Rules to permit the use of all model building codes found to be acceptable.
