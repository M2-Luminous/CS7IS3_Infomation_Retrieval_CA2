"Yes, I have," said a writer in Beijing in a satiric tone. Nowadays, some people have three eyes, with one eye looking at money, another looking at Deng, and the other looking at Chen. The reason Deng Xiaoping and Chen Yun have become the focus of attention is that the contradictions between them always have a great influence on the general situation. Another reason is that if one of them dies, the general situation will be more greatly affected. People believe both will greatly affect the money they have earned and the way they are earning their money. Thee two heads, who rarely meet, recently met in Hangzhou, but the meeting has been kept secret; only a small circle of top leaders have been informed. Wan Li, Bo Yibo, and Yang Dezhong Were Present at the Deng-Chen Meeting Deng Xiaoping and Chen Yun had their meeting on 8 January. They usually meet once or twice every year. This was proposed by the Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee in early November 1989 after Deng resigned his post as chairman of the Central Military Commission. They usually have their meetings in Shanghai or Hangzhou. After arriving in Hangzhou by special train on 8 January and having talks with Chen Yun, Deng Xiaoping returned to Shanghai on 10 January. Wan Li, Bo Yibo, and Yang Dezhong were present at the Deng-Chen meeting. On 13 January, Wu Bangguo, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and secretary of the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee, conveyed the spirit of the Deng-Chen meeting at a meeting of the standing committee of the municipal CPC committee, in accordance with a document issued by the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee entitled "The Common Views and Proposals of Comrades Deng Xiaoping and Chen Yun on the Current Internal and External Situations." "The People's Bearing Capacity Should Not Be Neglected When Working Out Measures for Economic Reform" Wu Bangguo said: During their recent meeting, Comrades Deng Xiaoping and Chen Yun discussed the current internal and external situations, especially the internal situation, each giving his views. They held basically identical views on a series of issues. Both held that it is necessary to make a full appraisal of the people's bearing capacity so that it is not neglected when working out measures for economic reform; that it is necessary to regard strengthening party building as a very important task at present and to attach great importance to political and ideological work (to which less attention has been paid); that it is necessary to continue carrying out the work of opposing corruption, encouraging the honest performance of official duties, and removing obstacles; that, in light of the fact that such poisonous influences as money worship and the mentality of putting money first, are seriously affecting the people's thinking and socialist morality, the leading cadres must set a good example for the people and learn what the grass-roots cadres and common people are thinking, what they want to resolve, and what they have the greatest complaints about; that social and political stability will continue to be crucial matters for the next five to 10 years; and that the sovereignty and security of the state should be put first at all times. Both the document of the CPC Central Committee Secretariat and the relayed report by Wu Bangguo said Deng and Chen had "basically identical views" on some issues, but not "entirely identical views." On what issues did they hold "basically nonidentical views" then? They said nothing about this, but Bo Yibo disclosed it. At a forum of retired veteran cadres on 13 January, Bo Yibo disclosed the differences between Deng and Chen during their meeting. Bo Yibo Discloses Differences Between Deng and Chen Bo Yibo said: Comrade Xiaoping and Revered Comrade Chen [xiao ping tong zhi he chen lao 1420 1627 0681 1807 0735 7115 5071] had a meeting. They talked for about two hours and had lunch together. Their talks at the luncheon were also about the current situation. Deng Xiaoping stressed that reform and development should not stop and that people should have no doubts about the correctness of the policy simply because some problems had emerged. The problem is that the central and provincial leading bodies must remain clear-headed. The pace of development should not slow down, or China will lag behind. At present, the leaders should further emancipate their minds. They must rid their brains of the word "fear," and shake off the trammels of book worship within the party. Xiaoping said that some problems do exist among some local leading cadres, such as local departmentalism and local sectarianism. The main reason is that they do not fully understand and comprehend the spirit of the central authorities' line, policies, and principles. Chen Yun's Five Criticisms Against Deng Bo Yibo continued: Our revered Comrade Chen stressed the necessity of absolute steadiness, saying that it would be a miracle if a healthy economic growth rate of seven percent could be preserved. At present, it is necessary to sum up some major and common problems in reform and opening up, and to study and resolve them one by one. He pointed out that in the current stage, conviction, morality, and style within the party are the crucial problems of the whole party and nation. Local departmentalism and local sectarianism, which exist to a serious extent throughout the country, have weakened the leadership and authority of the central authorities. Our revered Comrade Chen also pointed out that emancipation of the mind does not mean advocating and publicizing the spirit of "forcing a way forward" in disregard of our national conditions, the scientific spirit of seeking truth from facts. or laws, systems, and discipline. He pointed out that China should try to put an end to the passive state in Sino-U.S. trade and overcome right-opportunism in its U.S. policy. It should draw lessons from the fact that Britain has flatly violated the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the agreements reached between the two governments; China should adopt more resolute measures, including new decisions. In fact, Chen Yun was criticizing Deng Xiaoping in the following five fields: First, unsteadiness in reform; second, excessive economic growth; third, no summary of work; fourth, "three violations" in the practice of emancipating the mind advocated by Deng, that is, disregarding national conditions, scientific spirit, and laws and systems; and fifth, right deviation toward the United States. Chen Yun: "Once Leftism Is Criticized, Rightism Appears" Moreover, on another occasion, Chen Yun pointed out that rightism had appeared after "criticizing leftism," and sometimes, the criticism of leftism was wrong. During a meeting with Li Lanqing at the beginning of January, Chen Yun said: In our work today, it is particularly necessary to pay attention to social stability and remaining cool-headed. I still want to pour some cold water on hotheadedness. There will be trouble if turbulence is aroused because of our improper policies and measures and because of continuous infiltration, subversion, and propaganda by the United States. He also pointed out: It is necessary to exercise control over commodity prices and inflation, and to continue to do a good job in opposing corruption and building a clean government. It is necessary to carry out necessary political study and moral education. "What I am really worrying about is the practice of stressing one tendency to the neglect of another, such as stressing criticism of leftism to the neglect of the emergence of rightism. Sometimes certain correct practices are criticized and abandoned as expressions of the leftist tendency; this is a dangerous trend. I often remind some comrades among the central authorities that the phenomenon of one tendency concealing another has often appeared in the party's policies and practical work, but we have failed to draw lessons from it." During his meeting with Chen Yun, Deng Xiaoping stressed the necessity of "shaking off the trammels of book worship within the party." Did he refer to the trend of book worship in Chen Yun? One point is clear, that is, Chen Yun believed that Deng Xiaoping was not entirely correct in "criticizing leftism" (in fact, Deng only proposed to "prevent leftism"), because by "criticizing leftism," "rightism" had been encouraged. We can be sure of this. Another point we are sure of is that the differences between Deng and Chen are differences in principle. It seems that their contradictions are unsolvable.
