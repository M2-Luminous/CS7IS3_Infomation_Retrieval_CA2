FR940119-2-00040 FR940119-2-00024 [Docket No. PR91&hyph;1&hyph;001] Tejas Gas Pipeline Co., successor to Exxon Gas System, Inc.; Motion To Modify Settlement January 12, 1994. Take notice that on December 3, 1993, Tejas Gas Pipeline Company (Tejas), successor to Exxon Gas System, Inc., filed a motion for limited modification of the February 11, 1991, Stipulation and Agreement in Docket No. PR91&hyph;1&hyph;000. The purpose of the requested modification is to permit Tejas to seek to establish an appropriate rate before the Texas Railroad Commission (TRC) and to elect to utilize a rate based thereon for Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA) section 311(a)(2) service, pursuant to §284.123(b)(1) of the Commission's regulations, rather than filing with the Commission for rate approval under §284.123(b)(2), as required by the settlement. Further, on January 3, 1994, Tejas notified the Commission that on the same date, Tejas filed with the TRC for approval of the transportation component of a city-gate rate which it states will be eligible to be the basis for a rate under §284.123(b)(1)(i) of the regulations. Tejas states it will collect the filed-for rate subject to refund, effective January 1, 1994. Any person desiring to participate in this proceeding must file a motion to intervene in accordance with §§385.211 and 385.214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedures. All motions must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission on or before February 2, 1994. The motion is on file with the Commission and is available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;1182 Filed 1&hyph;18&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6717&hyph;01&hyph;M
