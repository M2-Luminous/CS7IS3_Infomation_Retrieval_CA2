About 8,000 troops were expected at Walmansthal, north of Pretoria, 2,500 at Bourke's Luck in the Eastern Transvaal and 1,500 at Hoedspruit in the Western Transvaal. Speaking at a media briefing in Johannesburg, Mr Masondo said the aim of the integration process was to ensure a stable security force which could protect the new South Africa. MK soldiers did not need any special motivation to report at the assembly points. "Those who want to be soldiers have no qualm about going to the points. As soon as a new South African defence force is created... MK will no longer exist," he said. Mr Masondo said the 16,000 troops included expatriates. MK assets such as military hardware and vehicles kept in other countries would also become part of the new defence force. MK soldiers would be trained over three to six months to play a non-partisan role in the new defence force, according to a code of conduct still to be finalised by the Transitional Executive Council. MK soldiers would not have to learn new military skills, although they would have to adapt to different technologies. Training would focus on building a new attitude and culture of peace and progress, Mr Masondo said. A new defence force commander would be determined by the new state president, he added. MK remained committed to reconciliation and peace, he said, assuring communities living near the assembly points that they would not be threatened by the troops. "The new South Africa will need a new military culture... of non-racialism, equality for all, particularly women, as well as good relations with the neighbouring states," Mr Masondo said.
