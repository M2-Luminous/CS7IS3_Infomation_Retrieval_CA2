FBIS4-1062 "drafr077_c_94005" FBIS-AFR-94-077 Daily Report 20 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA KwaZulu Pledges `Full Support' to IEC KwaZulu Pledges `Full Support' to IEC MB2004204594 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1913 GMT 20 Apr 94 MB2004204594 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [By Craig Doonan] [Text] Ulundi April 20 SAPA -- The kwaZulu government has pledged its full support to ensure an additional 500 voting stations are established in the territory before the elections, according to Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] Vice-chairman Dikgang Moseneke. Addressing the media after a five-hour meeting with the kwaZulu Legislative Assembly in Ulundi on Wednesday [20 April], Mr Moseneke said a tough job awaited the IEC in the six days remaining before the elections. But he added the IEC would try its "damndest" to ensure it was prepared for elections in the region. "It's going to be very tough. We are going to have to work very hard. We will literally have to camp in kwaZulu/Natal," he said. In contrast to the hostile reception afforded IEC Chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler last month, Mr Moseneke said the IEC had been met with "nothing less than co-operation in all areas". "We are delighted to serve this region without any impediments... We generally reached agreement on all aspects pertaining to voter preparation." IEC Commissioner Charles Nupen explained that an extra 500 polling stations had to be set up to supplement the 1,000 already planned. Another 13,000 people had to be trained to staff the new polling stations. He said there would be intensive training courses at the weekend, adding this required "a hell of a degree of commitment". Mr Moseneke added that traditional chiefs had also given their full support to the IEC's voter education programme provided they were informed of the IEC's presence in their areas. This was in stark contrast to the blatant rejection by some chiefs in the kwaZulu Legislative Assembly of Mr Justice Kriegler's request for similar co-operation last month. Mr Moseneke said the kwaZulu government had pledged its full co- operation including the use of human resources, transport and other logistic requirements. The kwaZulu Police would be involved in securing polling stations.
