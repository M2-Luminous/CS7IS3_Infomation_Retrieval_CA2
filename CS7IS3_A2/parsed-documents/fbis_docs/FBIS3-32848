He admitted, however, that some "irresponsible people" have invited the Armed Forces to do just that. The Guatemalan Armed Forces "cannot accept" a coup, Otzoy told the press. He participated in an event to hand out prostheses to people mutilated in the Central American war. The event was held in Santa Ana, 66 km from San Salvador, today. Last week, the media reported rumors of coup preparations in Guatemala to remove President Ramiro de Leon Carpio, who is facing growing political opposition and labor protests. Although Otzoy ruled out the Army's involvement in these plans, he said that "irresponsible people," who he declined to identify, have "knocked on the barracks' doors" with political motives. He added that if any officers are involved, they will be handed over to the administration of justice because "our laws clearly indicate that no military personnel can participate in politics." "We have already experienced the consequences of a coup," the deputy minister said. He said a coup would hurt the Guatemalan people, cause chaos, and prove "inconceivable" under the present circumstances. Guatemala's most recent institutional crisis took place last year on the occasion of then President Jorge Serrano's aborted self-inflicted coup. Serrano was later overthrown by the military.
