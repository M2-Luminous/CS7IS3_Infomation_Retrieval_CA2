Taking the opportunity to deliver a message to Syria, the prime minister said the Syrians could have prevented the incident in south Lebanon yesterday. Our correspondent Ya'el Ben-Yehuda reports on Rabin's remarks: [Begin recording] [Ben-Yehuda] The prime minister opened his remarks by saying that it is hard to talk about peace on a day when the bodies of four soldiers are being laid to rest. His conscience as prime minister and as defense minister, however, is clear, he said, because in addition to upholding security, the government is trying to attain peace on a path fraught with hardship and terror. He offered his condolences to the bereaved families and sent his wishes for a speedy recovery to the wounded. The prime minister accused Hizballah of sabotaging peace and held it responsible for the victims killed yesterday. He did not absolve Syria either. [Rabin] Syria could influence Hizballah and prevent it from continuing its activities. Syria does not control Hizballah; it is commanded by Iran and Lebanon. Nevertheless, Syria could use its influence to curb its activities. Syria could give its backing to the Lebanese Government by allowing it to deploy more troops in south Lebanon, as it wanted to do after Operation Accountability, thereby creating the conditions for tranquillity with a view to reaching a peace treaty with Lebanon, which entails certain arrangements concerning security and some guarantees concerning the Lebanese who have been operating alongside us. Syria has not done that, and I am afraid that in this respect, it has not shown by word or deed what we would expect of it if the idea is to establish confidence-building measures with a view to continuing the peace talks with us. [Ben-Yehuda] The prime minister was asked whether the delegation currently in Cairo has a mandate to conclude issues. [Rabin] The delegation headed by the foreign minister left for Egypt to conduct negotiations in order to reach agreement on key points in the implementation of the first phase of the Declaration of Principles, to finalize certain points in the Gaza-Jericho First agreement. I very much hope that an agreement will be reached -- some progress was made in Davos -- but this will only be the nucleus for future negotiations on a comprehensive agreement that includes all the elements enabling the beginning of the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho First agreement. [Ben-Yehuda] The prime minister emphasized that one of Israel's principles in the peace talks is that there will be no uprooting of settlements. We will retain responsibility for settlements, Israelis, and traffic in the territories. United Jerusalem is outside the negotiations, the prime minister stated. [end recording]
