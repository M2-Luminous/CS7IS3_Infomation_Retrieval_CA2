FBIS4-53224 "dreas096_d_94024" FBIS-EAS-94-096 Daily Report 12 May 1994 South Korea Air Force Receives Spanish Transport Planes Air Force Receives Spanish Transport Planes SK1205061994 Seoul YONHAP in English 0508 GMT 12 May 94 SK1205061994 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, May 12 (YONHAP) -- The air force took delivery of an undisclosed number of all-weather medium-sized CN-235m transport planes from Spain in a ceremony held at a base near Pusan Thursday afternoon, with Chief of Staff Gen. Kim Hong-nae and other ranking officers attending. The aircraft, manufactured by Casa Co. of Spain according to U.S. Air Force technical and operational requirements, will replace C-54 and -123 [as received] planes to improve the country's military transport capability. Gen. Kim, saying modern warfare hinges on military transport operations, exhorted the air force to train for early tactical deployment and operation of the new transport planes. The CN-235m can conduct all airborne operations such as drops of paratroopers, military supplies and flares in inclement weather and at night, as it is equipped with an inertial navigational system, a satellite navigational data receiver, a weather radar system and an electronic countermeasure system. It can carry 48 armed troops and 4,989 kg of supplies and fly for 10 hours at a cruising speed of 398 km per hour. Its maximum altitude is 9.14 km, cruising range 3,314 km and maximum takeoff load 16,465 kg. Casa started developing the CN-235m in 1980, test-flew it in 1983 and began commercial production in 1986. It has thus far sold 140 of this aircraft, including 41 for civilian use, to 16 countries. The air force, under a plan to improve its military transport capability begun in 1989, selected in April 1992 the CN-235m to replace the obsolete C-54 and -123 aircraft after a comparative examination of this model and Italy's G-222 model. When deployed, the new transport aircraft will carry out normal military transport operations as well as such special missions as anti-irregular warfare, rescue and airlift operations to special areas.
