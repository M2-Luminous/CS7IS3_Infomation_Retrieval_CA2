Party spokesman Lawyer Salim al-Suways said: The licensing of our party by the Interior Ministry at a time when the Arab homeland is undergoing difficult circumstances comes as a real test and a challenge, which we will face according to our pan-Arab constants by entrenching effective organizational structures capable of absorbing changes. We do not want to be just another number in the list of licensed party. Moreover, we do not want to become an elite organization; we seek to be a popular pan-Arab instrument. He added: We believe that the establishment of the Pan-Arab Action Front Party, which includes pan-Arab parties and figures, is an attempt to rebel against the deteriorating and fragmented situation of the pan-Arab forces in Jordan and the Arab homeland. This situation weakened these forces and robbed them of their political influence. The pan-Arab forces, which seek to achieve unity and democracy, should not remain divided and in conflict. While we assert that we are a channel for pan-Arab struggle, we hope to be the melting pot for pan-Arab forces on the road toward the establishment of a united pan-Arab front. Lawyer al-Suways added that the Pan-Arab Action Front Party is a result of the unity of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, the United Organization [al-tanzim al-muwahhad], the Jordanian Revolutionary People's Party, the progressive democratic and pan-Arab forces, the Arab popular liberation movement in Jordan, in addition to a group of independent national figures. The party formed a leadership council of 27 members and an executive committee of 11 members. It also formed a number of party bureaus. The party will continue to call on the national parties and figures to continue dialogue in order to achieve unity and form a broad pan-Arab front. It is worth noting that the party's executive committee consists of Muhammad al-Zu'bi, the secretary general; Ahmad Muhammad Ibrahim, also known as Abu-'Isa, assistant secretary general and head of the political affairs bureau; Shams 'Abd-al-Karim, assistant secretary general and head of the organizational bureau; 'Ali al-Hamshari, assistant secretary general and head of the information bureau; Salim al-Suways, the media spokesman; Mahmud al-Nawayisah, head of the cultural bureau; Majid Mahafizah, secretary of the executive committee; 'Adnan Mansur, official in charge of financial affairs; Burayk al-Hadid, head of the popular organizations bureau; Hani al-Dahlah; and Fayiz al-'Adwan.
