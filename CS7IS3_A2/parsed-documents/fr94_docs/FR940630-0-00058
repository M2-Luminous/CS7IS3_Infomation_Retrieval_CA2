FR940630-0-00058 FR940630-0-00018 Discussion of Comments and Changes Seven comments were received in response to the Public Notice. One comment addressed the dangerous location of the bridge, the distraction of high intensity lights, the inability to discern by radar between various types of vessels, the additional duties assigned to the remotely located operator, and the safe passage of vessels if the bridge operator cannot maintain visual and radio contact. The bridge owner questioned the comment's reference to the dangerous location of the bridge and reasoned that the proposed procedure will be more favorable to river traffic than the current operation. The bridge owner reported that current bridge operators are assigned non-bridge related clerical duties in addition to operating the bridge for the six to eight daily trains. The radar to be installed on the bridge is similar to the radar equipment used on vessels, and operators will be trained in its use. In response to the question about back-up power, the bridge is equipped with a standby generator that would power all systems, including the bridge itself, in case of a failure of commercial power. If the infrared detectors fail, it will be physically impossible to remotely lower the bridge. Standard Department of Transportation traffic warning lights will be used in lieu of high intensity lights. The Illinois River Carriers Association commented that it does not object to the proposal as described, but questioned if the bridge could accidentally be lowered on or in front of a tow. They also recommended that a trial period, monitored by the Coast Guard, be established for a specified time. The bridge owner has no objection to the trial period and advises they expect the Coast Guard will evaluate the operation. C&NW has reported the remote operator cannot ``accidentally'' initiate the lowering sequence. A series of commands from a dispatcher control console must be entered; all the remote operator can do is initiate the sequence for lowering the bridge. The system would have to run through the 10 minute advance warning cycle before the drawspan would begin to lower. If the infrared beam is broken, the lowering is automatically aborted, and the span returns to the fully open position. The entire lowering sequence, including the warning cycle, must be repeated before span will again lower. Divisions of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers in South Pekin, Illinois, and Chicago, Illinois, commented that an on-site bridge operator is needed to report collisions from barges to maintenance personnel, and that withdrawal of bridge operators would result in reduced maintenance and possible operation problems. The Coast Guard has established a program requiring vessel operators to report any contact with bridge structures. These incidents are reported to the bridge owner for investigation to determine the structural safety of the bridge. C&NW has responded that equipment would enable the remote operator to detect any malfunction in the operation of the lift span, resulting in maintenance personnel being dispatched to the bridge site. If equipment at the bridge site were vandalized, the bridge would not lower. Submittals from the United Transportation Union, the Transportation Communications International Union and divisions of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers in South Pekin, Illinois and Chicago, Illinois, commented on railroad operations and personnel issues, which are not within the scope of this regulation or the Coast Guard's jurisdiction. The Chairman of the Tazewell County Board expressed the Board's concerns for the safety of the operation if bridge is operated from a remote location, and the loss of four jobs and the impact on the involved families. A public meeting hosted by the Tazewell County Board was held on March 14, 1994; representatives of Chicago and Northwestern Railroad answered questions and addressed concerns about the navigational and structural safety of the bridge, and railroad operations and personnel issues.
