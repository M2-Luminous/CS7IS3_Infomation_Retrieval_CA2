And if he leads the Pact it is he that must provide the pointers, otherwise...." This remark by one of Segni's close aides last night reflected the dramatic day experienced by the center. In an interview with IL MESSAGGERO, [Italian Popular Party, PPI, Deputy] Rocco Buttiglione offered the following significant viewpoint: RAI [state radio and television service] and Fininvest "have come to an agreement to attack the center, but this exposes Italy to disaster." Buttiglione's anxiety reflects the real anguish currently pervading the moderate center of [PPI Secretary] Martinazzoli and Segni. Mortifying election figures are circulating -- the result of secret polls regarding whose reliability all doubts are justified, but whose psychological repercussions are obvious. The Pact and the PPI are in difficulty, both for general political reasons [Forza Italia leader] (Berlusconi's offensive) and because of the complex problem of the candidates. On this latter point their agreement is in serious trouble, and indeed there is a fierce conflict, as was shown by yesterday's meeting between Segni and Martinazzoli. The first and second aspects are more closely connected than they may appear. [Senate Speaker] Giovanni Spadolini yesterday went so far as to compare the present climate to that of 1948 -- "The climate described by Guareschi, with Peppone and Don Camillo." This was a paradoxical way of indicating the same danger as Buttiglione cited -- the disappearance of the center, crushed like pre-war Poland by the impact of two giants. Indeed, if Italy really does venture into the unexplored territory of bipolarity, between Berlusconi and [Democratic Party of the Left, PDS, Secretary] Occhetto, the moderates will have too small an electoral territory to be able to guarantee the survival of the species. On the other hand, there would be substantial political scope after the election if parliament failed to produce a definite majority. Thus the center's internal balance -- that is, the substantive relationship between the new Popular Party and the Pact -- would become the crucial factor, both in order to prevent the elections from proving a failure and above all in choosing what role to perform in the next parliament. Behind the conflict between Martinazzoli and Segni over the investigatees, the "new faces," and the unity of the future parliamentary group, one can perceive the outlines of a more troublesome political problem. Segni is trying to prevent the imprint of the new populist left from becoming decisive in the Pact-PPI alliance. Martinazzoli is concerning himself with defending the de facto hegemony of the Catholic-Popular Party group over the Segni group and will not accept any vetoes that would alter the characteristics of the relationship. From this viewpoint, the Mattarella case is symbolic. By attacking him, Segni is trying to bring down one of the leaders of the PPI's internal left, even at the cost of appearing like a "executioner," as Martinazzoli warned yesterday evening. What is at stake is not only the image but also the political proposal to be put to the voters. Segni can feel Berlusconi hard on his heels, as he starts to encroach on Pact territory, especially in the first- past-the-post constituencies of central Italy on which the moderate centrists are pinning their last remaining hopes. In order to withstand the increasingly tough struggle, the Pact leader needs to expand a little to the right. The main objective is to salvage his vote, and the subsidiary objective is to have sufficient strength and credibility to negotiate a possible future armistice with the expanding enemy. But there is also the problem of the future. Depending on the new parliamentary group's composition, on who constitutes it, this or that policy line will enjoy credibility. Segni still clings to his vision of a moderate rally that he can lead. Martinazzoli, custodian of the PPI identity, is willing to accept being confined to a small minority, but remains loyal to his option for the center-left. The former is looking toward the public tempted by Berlusconi, while the latter is thinking -- like Spadolini and Amato -- about the problematic balances in the next parliament.
