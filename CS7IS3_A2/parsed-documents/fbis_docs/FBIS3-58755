He said before the German World Economic Association today in Berlin that the "ossification of institutions and behavior patterns in our society" were delaying the necessary structural adjustments and jeopardizing the competitiveness of German industry. The far-reaching changes in the global economy were a challenge to the Western world. The technological advantage of the old industrial countries was shrinking. The European and German superiority in the quality of work could no longer be taken for granted. In Germany, said Rexrodt, the economy in the new eastern states was noticeably catching up with that in the West, "despite all prophecies of doom". It was particularly gratifying to note that the processing industry, which had so far "lagged behind", was now catching up. This could be seen from the increase in incoming contracts and strong production growth of just under eight percent in 1993.
