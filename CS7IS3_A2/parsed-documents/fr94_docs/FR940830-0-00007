FR940830-0-00007 FR940830-0-00003 Public Law 101&hyph;220, enacted December 12, 1989, amended section 608(b) of the Act to require that all peanuts handled by persons who have not entered into the Agreement (non-signers) be subject to quality and inspection requirements to the same extent and manner as are required under the Agreement. It is estimated that 5 percent of the domestic peanut crop is marketed by non-signatory handlers and the remainder of the crop is handled by signatory handlers. Under the non-signer provisions, no peanuts may be sold or otherwise disposed of for human consumption if the peanuts fail to meet the quality requirements of the Agreement. Regulations to implement Pub. L. 101&hyph;220 were issued and made effective on December 4, 1990 [55 FR 49980] and amended several times thereafter, and are published in 7 CFR Part 997. All such amendments were made to ensure that the non-signer handling requirements remain consistent with modifications to the handling requirements applied to signatory handlers under the Agreement. Violation of those regulations may result in a penalty in the form of an assessment by the Secretary equal to 140 percent of the support price for quota peanuts. The support price for quota peanuts is determined under section 108B of the Agricultural Act of 1949 (7 U.S.C. 1445c&hyph;3) for the crop year during which the violation occurs. The intent of P.L. 101&hyph;220 and the objective of the Agreement is to insure that only wholesome peanuts of good quality enter edible market channels. Under the non-signer and Agreement regulatory provisions, farmers' stock peanuts with visible Aspergillus flavus mold (the principal source of aflatoxin) are required to be diverted to non-edible uses. Each lot of shelled peanuts and certain lots of inshell peanuts, destined for edible channels, must be officially sampled and chemically tested for aflatoxin by the Department or in other laboratories listed in the regulations. Inspection and chemical analysis programs are administered by the Department. Under the non-signer provisions, the second sentence of paragraph (e) Seed peanuts prohibits the commingling of Segregation 2 seed lots with Segregation 1 peanut lots intended for human consumption. The difference between Segregation 1 and Segregation 2 lots is that Segregation 1 lots may contain no more than 2 percent damaged kernels and no more than 1 percent concealed damaged kernels, while Segregation 2 lots may contain more than 2 percent damaged kernels and 1 percent concealed damaged kernels. Both Segregation 1 lots and Segregation 2 lots must be free of visible Aspergillus flavus. This interim rule clarifies the handling provisions in paragraph (e) of ยง997.20 Incoming regulation to allow Segregation 2 seed peanut lots containing up to 3 percent total damaged kernels to be stored, shelled and commingled with Segregation 1 seed peanut lots if both lots were produced under the auspices of a State peanut agency which regulates or controls the production of the lots being commingled. The Committee meets in February or March each year and recommends to the Secretary such rules and regulations as may be necessary to keep the Agreement consistent with current industry practice. The Committee met on March 16, 1994, and unanimously recommended clarification of seed peanut handling regulations under the Agreement. Members of the Committee noted the impracticality of having separate storage bins for each of the various types and varieties of seed peanuts with up to 3 percent damage. It was noted that, if Segregation 2 seed lots with up to 3 percent damaged must be stored separate from Segregation 1 seed lots, ``foundation,'' ``registered,'' and ``certified'' seed lots would have to be segregated into separate categories. This could increase the number of separate bins and space needed to store seed peanut lots. The current regulations for both signers and non-signers do not specifically address commingling Segregation 1 seed lots with Segregation 2 seed lots. The Committee concluded that it is impracticable to require such Segregation 2 seed peanuts be stored and shelled separate from Segregation 1 seed peanuts. The Department has initiated rulemaking to implement such a clarification in handling requirements applied on signatory handlers. This interim rule revises ยง997.20(e) for non-signer seed peanuts and is intended to bring the non-signatory handling requirements into conformity with those specified in the Agreement. This rule clarifies handling requirements and will facilitate the movement of peanuts to market.
