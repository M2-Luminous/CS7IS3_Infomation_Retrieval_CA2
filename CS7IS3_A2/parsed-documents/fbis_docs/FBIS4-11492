The privatizations are an aspect of modernization; they will occur where they are required so that this process can have positive results, the minister added. The modernization process is a fact and it will be developed and implemented, the minister continued. Meanwhile, (Jose Maria Cabascango), leader of the National Confederation of Indian Nationalities of Ecuador, said the Indian movement is not opposed to the modernization of the country, but it is opposed to the indiscriminate privatization of state-owned companies. That is why, he remarked, we will continue to support the struggle throughout the country with mobilizations and assemblies. Minister Marcelo Santos asserted that the first day of the 48-hour strike occurred without major incidents, although there were some sporadic incidents in various areas in the country. Santos said the strike is progressing normally and the rights of workers and other sectors have been respected, particularly those of Indians who have blocked traffic between provinces. The minister stated the government is not expecting acts of violence, but the police and Armed Forces are ready to guarantee the peace and security of Ecuadorans.
