All the several-room flats of the street ensure conditions for the living of the dwellers on the highest level. The state has provided people gratis with these houses built at a colossal cost. The DPRK does not count money, if it is for the people. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il said that national fund must not be spared in providing people with a happy life, stating: "This is my arithmetic and the calculating system of the Workers' Party of Korea." When the construction of factories, hospitals, recreation facilities and other objects was projected, he acquainted himself first of all with their usefulness for the people before calculating its cost and, when he found them needed to the people, he saw to it that they were built on the highest level without delay. It was in September 1979 when the Pyongyang maternity hospital with a plottage of 43,000 square metres and a floor space of over 60,000 square metres was under construction. While acquainting himself with the progress of the project, he learned that it was designed to cover some corridor floors with artificial stones. He gave instructions to cover all the corridor floors and indoor stairs with marbles, asking where else marble should be used if not for the hospital which would be a palace for the "kings" of the country. He earnestly said jewels must be used for the designs, saying nothing must be spared for the children, no matter how much it might cost. Thus, the floor of the central entrance hall was covered with "a jewel carpet". A total of 35 tons of natural jewels were used in this. Under his benevolent care 20 years ago, a TV relay tower was erected for a few families in a remote village of lumberjacks in Chagang Province, a branch school built for two children on a beacon islet and a railway station set up for a few school children. It was under the boundless care of Comrade Kim Chong-il for the people that Pyongyang and local cities have taken on grand looks and many monumental architectures including the Changgwang health complex, the ice rink, the Chongnyu restaurant, the Grand People's Study House and the Hamhung dental preventive hospital have been built in the country.
