Radetskyy, who was addressing a press conference at the end of his visit to Germany, said that at present there is a bilateral control on such weapons. But it is ordered by Ukraine, as "it is her property, the minister emphasised. A tripartite agreement on nuclear weapons was signed and a time-table of its withdrawal and destruction was approved this year in Moscow through the U.S. mediation. "The Ukrainian side is consistently and sincerely observing" this time-table, he said. According to him, until now two train loads of nuclear warheads have been despatched to Russia. In exchange Ukraine was supposed to receive fuel for its nuclear power plants from Russia. But Russia has not fulfilled this condition for the time being. That is why we have been obliged to suspend the time-table of withdrawal, to clarify it and make it binding on Russia to honour its commitments," he said.
