Pawlak stressed the need for Poland's increased effort to join western structures, and above all for intensified strivings for NATO and the EU membership. He also discussed the question of Poland's participation in the "Partnership for Peace" programme. The prime minister confirmed in the presence of the ambassadors the Polish Government's guarantees for western investors and assured that the government would respect any agreements that were or will be concluded with them. Foreign Minister Olechowski told newsmen that the two-day session of Polish diplomats will centre on the question of Poland's security and her closer contacts with the European Union which are crucial elements of the Polish foreign policy which the ambassadors attending the meeting will frequently have to deal with. According to Olechowski, the meeting should help the ambassadors learn about the approach of the "state's top figures" to the problems of foreign policy. The foreign minister also said he expected information from the ambassadors on the existing possibilities in Poland's contacts with western countries.
