A criterion and method for VISSR focusing are proposed and the experimental results for frequency-spectrum analysis using fast Fourier transforms (FFT) on stretched digital cloud images received from the Japanese GMS-4 satellite are given. The tests show that this method is useful and practical for in-orbit focusing control of a GMS's VISSR. Figure 1, not reproduced, is a flow chart for VISSR focusing. Figure 2, reproduced below, depicts the system equipment. There are no tables. References 1.
