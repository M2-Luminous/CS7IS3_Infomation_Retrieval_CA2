What seemed to be only a "skirmish" between Fujimori and Lima Mayor Ricardo Belmont could become a major "war" which could even end up in court. Belmont received on 13 January the support of Cusco Mayor Daniel Estrada, who asked him to coordinate with other affected mayors "a common strategy to force back autocracy and arbitrariness." Socialist Alfonso Barrantes, former Lima mayor, has joined them and said that he is willing to work in "any position assigned to me to defend municipal laws." Belmont was unusually tough and has accused the government of "harming Lima more than terrorism does." He added that "more works have been interrupted than those we implemented in one year due to budget cuts. It is as though The Trebol (the biggest cloverleaf in Lima) was dynamited." The possibility that this conflict will reach the courts has even been left open, because the Popular Action Party (AP) has decided that its mayors will file an amparo against the law that cuts municipal revenues. Arturo Castillo, Association of Peruvian Municipalities (AMPE) president and Chiclayo mayor, is among the AP mayors. President Fujimori refused, meanwhile, to change his mind about his governmental decision and underscored that the government has not cut municipal revenues, rather, "has distributed them more equitably." He added that "what we did was channel more funds to poorer municipalities, which will then be able to carry out more works to benefit their peoples." He added that the municipalities whose revenues were cut "can get more funds from other sources because they control the regions that are richest in resources." Certain experts believe that Fujimori is playing a political game to thwart the presidential ambitions of both Belmont and Estrada, because they will be unable to deliver the works they promised and that they planned to use in their campaigns. The presidential elections will be held in May 1995. This is why 1994 is considered an "electorally decisive" year for politicians with governmental ambitions. Fujimori has yet to decide if he will run for reelection next year. Many believe, however, that he is at least trying to ensure that his eventual candidacy will have the best chance of succeeding.
