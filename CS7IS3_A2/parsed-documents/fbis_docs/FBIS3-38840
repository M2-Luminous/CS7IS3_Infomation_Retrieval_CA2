As NATO ambassadors met here, diplomats said that Canada was the main opponent of a U.S.-French proposal to threaten bombing raids if the Serbs do not withdraw their big guns from Sarejevo in seven to 10 days. Pro-Serb Greece has also come out strongly against the use of air strikes, but reluctantly went along with a European Community statement Monday to back the option to free Sarajevo from the Serbs' grip. Meanwhile Russia's Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev warned Wednesday that air strikes on Bosnia's Serbs would have "grave consequences" in a telegram to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. The alliance was considering action following Saturday's mortar attack on Sarajevo's market, which killed 68 people in the worst single incident in the 22-month old conflict. "It is time to act. We had enough words," NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner said after months of empty threats that have left the credibility of the West's Bosnia policy in tatters. The United States favoured a seven-day deadline for the Serbs while the French, who have UN troops on the ground protecting relief operations, are proposing a 10-day limit, one NATO diplomat said. [passage omitted] Any action by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation requires the unanimous approval of all 16 alliance members. The NATO diplomat said it would also need a final clearance from the United Nations. Diplomats said Britain had also presented a proposal with the main difference being over at what level to take a decision on airstrikes. They gave no details. A Western diplomat said Canada, which has expressed fears of reprisals against Canadian and other troops in the 10,000-strong UN force, had put forth a text backing the idea of a deadline but much more vague on any action to follow. Diplomats said NATO would likely avoid using the word ultimatum in their message to the Serbs. EC foreign ministers on Monday rejected the French proposal for a deadline and kept their call for air power vague. "Most of the members are coalescing around the French-U.S. proposal," said the diplomat, who asked not to be named. Another NATO source said "a majority, not everybody" supported the idea of a precise warning to the Serbs. [passage omitted] In August, the alliance authorised the use of its warplanes to end the strangulation of Sarajevo and other Serb-besieged Moslem communities if requested by the United Nations. NATO leaders reaffirmed the offer at their summit last month. But Butrus-Ghali has yet to give the green light for any air operations by NATO, which has 170 aircraft, including 80 warplanes, already deployed to enforce a no-flight zone over Bosnia.
