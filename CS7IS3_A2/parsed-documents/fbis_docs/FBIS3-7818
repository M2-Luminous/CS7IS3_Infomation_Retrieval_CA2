This is a result of an agreement between [UNPROFOR] General Jean Cot and General Milan Celeketic, reached today on the bridge itself. They also discussed other similar locations in the RSK; however, the details were left to future negotiations. According to General Jean Cot, the entire situation concerning the bridge should not have reached the dimensions it did. All future disputes will be resolved through talks. It is not the first time that I have talked with General Celeketic. Knowing him, I am sure that all misunderstandings will be resolved through negotiation.
