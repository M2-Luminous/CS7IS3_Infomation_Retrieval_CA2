In his letter to Vladimir Shumeyko, speaker of the upper house of the Russian parliament, he rationalizes the need for such a session by the fact that the former Supreme Soviet of Russia, which paid much attention to studying whether the power organs of the former USSR and the RSFSR observed in 1954 all the casuistic subtleties in turning Crimea over to the Ukrainian SSR's subordination, did not study at all the question of whether those organs were competent at all to complete such a transaction. "It is a well-known fact that the Crimean Autonomous Republic existed before World War II," A. Manannikov writes. "In 1945, the ranking officials, who did not bother even to honor the laws and the generally recognized rights and freedoms of their citizens, made a decision abolishing the Crimean republic. The criminal decision entailed the exiling from Crimea of a great number of citizens of Tatar, Greek, German, Armenian, Bulgarian, and other nationalities...." The author of the letter thinks that the decision on abolishing the Crimean Autonomous Republic as part of the USSR, and on a transfer of the territory thus "freed" from its legitimate owners to someone else, should be deemed invalid, signifying that "taking account of the opinion of the majority of the population of the Crimean Republic, measures should be taken toward an amicable agreement on restoring it to its lawful master, that is to Russia." Drawing an analogy with civil legislation, A. Manannikov quotes from Part III, Article 152 of the Civil Code: "If some property should be acquired without payment from a person who had no right to give it away, the owner shall have the right to claim it in all instances." And he concludes: "Authorities of the Ukrainian state have no more rights to claiming legitimacy for owning Tavrida [Crimea] than does a citizen who receives as a present from a thief some stolen property (fur coat, necklace, etc.)."
