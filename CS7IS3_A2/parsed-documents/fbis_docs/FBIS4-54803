They will continue their action until the Agriculture and Finance Ministries, the government, and parliament examine their problems and make official decisions on them. Today representatives from companies all over the country held a protest march. [Unidentified correspondent] The march began with a rally held in front of the Agriculture Ministry. The protesters believe that our country lacks the political will to resolve the problems of the land reform. For almost one month, their attempts to hold negotiations with the institutions responsible have been postponed with the excuse that the prime minister was ill and ministers were abroad. [Unidentified protester] Our first demand is that the contracts should be fulfilled and payments made on time, so that the small companies can cover their costs. Second, we demand that the contract prices should be indexed; they have not been indexed in line with inflation since 1992 so, owing to rising inflation, it is impossible to meet the costs of the land reform. The firms involved in land division do not oppose value-added tax, because they know that this is the best way to provide revenue for the budget, but they want the Agriculture Ministry to pay the money that is due to the taxation authorities, as the law provides. [Correspondent] After Agriculture Minister Georgi Tanev refused to receive the protesters, they set off to the Council of Ministers and National Assembly, where they handed over their declarations.
