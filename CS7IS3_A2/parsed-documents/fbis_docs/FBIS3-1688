Nebojsha Radmanovich, spokesman for the Serb military press center in Banja Luka, near where the four planes were downed, said that Serb planes did not fly today. NATO said two U.S. F-16 fighters first warned and then shot down four Galeb light attack aircraft early this morning near Banja Luka, the main Serb air base in northern Bosnia. This was the first Western military intervention in the 22-month-long conflict, and NATO's first combat action since it was founded in 1949. U.N. sources in Zagreb said the Serb planes had apparently attacked a Muslim-controlled ammunition factory in central Bosnia shortly before being shot down. Muslim radio in Sarajevo also reported that Serb planes this morning attacked Muslim targets in central Bosnia. But Serb military personnel said all their warplanes were under the supervision of United Nations observers, and that if the planes took off they could not escape detection by the observers. NATO jets have flown more than 1,000 sorties over Bosnia-Herzegovina since last April when the no-fly zone injunction took effect. NATO said it will continue to take military action against any plane that intrudes into the no-fly zone.
