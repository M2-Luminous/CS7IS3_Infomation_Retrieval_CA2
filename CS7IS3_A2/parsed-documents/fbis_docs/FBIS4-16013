The UN-brokered talks, attended by delegations from Georgia, Abkhazia and Russia, were convened to fine-tune the conditions under which the UN force will be deployed in the region following a ceasefire accord signed April 4. The talks are expected to last two days, diplomats said. The Russian delegation, which comprises high-ranking diplomatic and military officials and is led by First Deputy Defence Minister Georgi Kondratyev, will try to persuade the UN Security Council to accord peacekeeping status to Russian troops in and around the separatist region, diplomats said. Granting the request would make the Russian force, which has been stationed in Georgia as a buffer between the two forces, eligible for UN funding. The principle of a multi-national peacekeeping force was accepted by Georgian and Abkhazian authorities on April 4. The UN's special representative to the negotiations, Edouard Brunner, said Tuesday that it would be "premature" to release any information on their progress. The Security Council said Friday that the establishment of a peacekeeping forces inside Abkhazia was conditional on the current talks and others resuming April 19 on the future constitutional status of Abkhazia making "substantial progress towards a political settlement." Abkhazia declared its sovereignty in July 1992. But Georgia has refused to countenance changes to its borders and, with the backing of the international community, has proposed that the separatist republic be granted a "broad autonomy" while remaining tied to Tbilisi. The current round of talks are due to end at the end of April. Earlier rounds of peace talks took place in October, January and February. Separatists routed Georgian troops from the Abkhazian capital Sukhumi in September after 13 months of fighting which left more than 3,000 dead. The fate of some 250,000 Georgian refugees who fled Abkhazia after Sukhumi fell is the subject of separate negotiations currently taking place in the Russian Black Sea port of Sochi.
