According to a notice from the SSC, no transactions in standardized futures contracts for steel products and sugar will be permitted after October this year. But transactions in standardized futures contracts with a delivery date before October 1994 will be allowed to continue till completion. Transactions in non-standardized futures contracts for steel and sugar will be allowed to go on, but illegal operations will be forbidden. The notice suggests that the Chinese Ministry of Coal Industry should issue a notice to stop listing standardized futures contracts for coal products in all coal transaction centers and wholesale markets. The SSC notice says that no transaction centers have the right to list new futures trade items, without first getting approval from the China Securities Regulatory Committee (CSRC). It also forbids any financial departments to provide futures trade guarantee letters. The notice says that futures trade centers should not accept such letters of guarantee or take them as earnest money. The SSC announces in the notice that the CSRC has the right to order futures transaction centers to raise the earnest money ratio whenever futures trade prices suffer sharp fluctuations. According to incomplete statistics, there are now about 40 futures trade centers in China, of which 30 are in operation.
