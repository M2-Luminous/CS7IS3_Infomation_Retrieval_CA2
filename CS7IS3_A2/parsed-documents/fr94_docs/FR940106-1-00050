FR940106-1-00050 FR940106-1-00011 B. Statutory Basis and Purpose Section 303(c) of the Act requires that state water quality standards ``*␣*␣* be such as to protect the public health or welfare, enhance the quality of water and serve the purposes of this Act. Such standards shall be established taking into consideration their use and value for propagation of fish and wildlife. *␣*␣*'' Key concerns of this statutory provision are the enhancement of water quality and the protection of the propagation of fish. The ultimate purpose of water quality standards, as with the other sections of the Act, is to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters. CWA section 101(a). Under section 303(c) of the Act, a water quality standard for a specific waterbody consists of two components: a designated use for which a waterbody is to be protected (such as recreation, fish and wildlife, or agriculture) and a numerical or qualitative water quality criterion which supports the designated use. The Act gives primary responsibility for the adoption of water quality standards to the states. After adopting its initial water quality standards, a state is required, no less than every three years, to review those standards and, if necessary, modify them. Under section 303(c)(1) of the Act, the results of these triennial reviews are to be submitted to EPA for review and approval or disapproval. EPA's Water Quality Standards regulations at 40 CFR part 131 specify the requirements for water quality criteria. States must adopt those water quality criteria that protect the designated use. Such criteria must be based on sound scientific rationale and must contain sufficient parameters or constituents to protect the designated use. For waters with multiple use designations, the criteria shall support the most sensitive use. (see 40 CFR 131.11(a). In addition, a state's criteria must be consistent with the state's antidegradation policy. The federal regulations provide that, at a minimum, the state must maintain ``[e]xisting instream water uses [those existing in the waterbody at any time on or after November 28, 1975] and the level of water quality necessary to protect the existing uses. *␣*␣*'' 40 CFR 131.12(a)(1). In order to approve a state's water quality criteria, EPA must determine whether the state has adopted ``water quality criteria [that are] sufficient to protect the designated uses.'' 40 CFR 131.6(c). Section 303(c)(4) of the Act provides that the Administrator shall promptly prepare and publish proposed regulations establishing a new or revised standard in either of two situations: First, when the Administrator has disapproved a state standard under section 303(c)(3) and the state has not taken corrective action within 90 days; and, second, in any case where the Administrator determines that a revised or new standard is necessary to meet the requirements of the Act. Once promulgated, the federal regulations are applicable to the state's waters, and, if they are more stringent, have the effect of supplanting and supplementing the state's standards. However, it is EPA's longstanding policy that the federal regulations will be withdrawn if a state adopts and submits standards that in the Agency's judgment meet the requirements of the Act. In reviewing California's implementation of its water quality standards program, EPA has considered the provisions of section 101(g) of the Act, which restate the long-standing policy of Federal deference to state water allocation functions: ``It is the policy of Congress that the authority of each State to allocate quantities of water within its jurisdiction shall not be superseded, abrogated or otherwise impaired by this [Act].'' The General Counsel of EPA, in a Memorandum to Regional Administrators dated November 7, 1978, interpreted this statutory provision in the context of the water quality standards program and concluded that ``EPA should therefore impose requirements which affect water usage only where they are clearly necessary to meet the Act's requirements.'' See also Memorandum from Robert M. Perry, General Counsel, to Frederic A. Eidsness, Jr., Assistant Administrator for Water, dated March 17, 1983 (considering interplay of section 101(g) and the guidelines under section 404(b)(1) of the Act). These positions of the General Counsel are consistent with the existing judicial precedent interpreting section 101(g). The leading case interpreting section 101(g) in light of the other mandates of the CWA, Riverside Irrigation Dist. v. Andrews, 758 F.2d 508, 513 (10th Cir. 1985), held that section 101(g) is only a general policy statement which ``cannot nullify a clear and specific grant of jurisdiction.'' Id. at 513. The Court then examined the legislative history of the Act and concluded that ``where both the state's interest in allocating water and the federal government's interest in protecting the environment are implicated, Congress intended an accommodation.'' Id. See also United States v. Akers, 785 F.2d 814 (9th Cir. 1986) (adopting Riverside in the 9th Circuit on similar facts). As the discussion above indicates, EPA has attempted to accommodate the State Board processes procedurally, generally deferring to the State Board schedules for review and revision of its water quality standards, even though this State process has continued for almost a decade and has frequently exceeded the Act's required triennial review requirements. Similarly, EPA is in this proposal attempting to accommodate the State's interest substantively. Although the State Board, in the 1978 Delta Plan, adopted explicit flow criteria, EPA is refraining from proposing direct revisions to the flow criteria. Instead, EPA is proposing criteria that describe the habitat conditions necessary to protect the designated uses of the Bay/Delta. The State Board still has full discretion to develop implementation measures attaining those habitat conditions, and still retains full discretion over the allocation of water necessary to achieve the criteria. Finally, EPA has fully considered the record developed in the State Board's 1992 hearings on D&hyph;1630 and, to the extent possible, has incorporated the scientific information presented in those hearings in the proposed criteria.
