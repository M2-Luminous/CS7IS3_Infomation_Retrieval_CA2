We realized that the movement of people and goods between areas controlled by the two sides is still restrained. The population in towns are afraid of going far away, and those in the rural areas only come to the small urban areas to visit families with return travel permits issued by Renamo. Even demobilized Renamo soldiers return to areas under the movement's control where they settle themselves. Only in the "3 February" communal village, in Hlalalene, we met with a Renamo demobilized soldier, Eusebio Ernesto Monisse, who really returned home, coming from an assembly area in Magude District, where he was demobilized on 7 April. [passage omitted] In Manhica town, people still speak of bases such as that of Mirona and Macandzene and those of Calanga. Our sources said the main Renamo commanders who fought in these areas, such as Elias and Agostinho, and "Mabaioneta" himself, have not yet been confined in assembly areas. Some of the many hunters, most of whom are without licenses, who have been hunting in Magude District's Mapulanguene and other areas, assured us that the roads are already in good conditions, some Renamo soldiers allow people to hunt there, but no one is allowed to come near the Ngungwe base on the border with South Africa. One of the hunters said, "We don't know what is hidden there". He added that people hunt with AKM's. We also spoke to hunters who use traditional weapons, and they gave the same information. We learned that there is a similar situation in Macalawane, Xivimbanine, Maqueze, Mumbi and Chaimite areas of Chibuto District. The head of the Xipadja administrative region in Chibuto, who is still afraid of revealing his name, told us that in his area, the Chindzavane, Macosse, and even Hlanganine bases -- where the Renamo assembly area is located -- are still operating. He said, "There is still no contact between families residing in Renamo areas and those in administrative authorities". More than 50,000 people are currently residing in Xipadja. This year they are faced with famine. [passage omitted]
