FR940303-2-00158 FR940303-2-00087 DEPARTMENT OF STATE Office of the Secretary [Public Notice 1957] Extension of the Restriction on the Use of United States Passport for Travel To, In, or Through Lebanon On January 26, 1987, pursuant to the authority of 22 U.S.C. 211a and Executive Order 11295 (31 FR 10603), and in accordance with 22 CFR 51.73(a)(3), all United States passports, with the exception of passports of immediate family members of hostages in Lebanon, were declared invalid for travel to, in, or through Lebanon unless specifically validated for such travel. This action was taken because the situation in Lebanon was so chaotic that American citizens there could not be considered safe from terrorist acts. Although there continues to be improvement in the security situation, review of the situation there has led me to conclude that Lebanon continues to be an area ``*␣*␣* where there is imminent danger to the public health or the physical safety of United States travelers'' within the meaning of 22 U.S.C. 211a and 22 CFR 51.73(a)(3). Accordingly, all United States passports shall remain invalid for travel to, in, or through Lebanon unless specifically validated for such travel under the authority of the Secretary of State. This Public Notice shall be effective upon publication in the Federal Register and shall expire at the end of six months unless extended or sooner revoked by Public Notice. Dated: February 24, 1994. Warren Christopher, Secretary of State. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;4830 Filed 3&hyph;2&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4710&hyph;10&hyph;M
