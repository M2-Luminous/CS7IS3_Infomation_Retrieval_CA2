This was announced today in Geneva at the United Nations donors conference on Iraq. Since 1975 the Government of Iraq has been destroying villages in northern Iraq and moving survivors into collective villages. Some 4,600 villages and their agriculture have been destroyed. The grant will help "Save the Children Fund" rehabilitate 216 villages and provide shelter for 700 families. The project includes a voucher system whereby villages can exchange vouchers to obtain goods worth 410 pounds. Agricultural inputs and livestock will also be provided to help meet basic human needs. An official from the Overseas Development Administration [ODA] visited northern Iraq in March and was impressed by the commitment of the villagers to return to their villages and start farming again. Note for Editors The ODA's total expenditure on humanitarian aid to Iraqi civilians is over 66 million pounds since April 1991. This includes at least 4 million pounds to Save the Children Fund for a variety of projects.
