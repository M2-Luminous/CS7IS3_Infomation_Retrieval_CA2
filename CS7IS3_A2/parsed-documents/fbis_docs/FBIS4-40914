Before implementation, World Bank projects need to have analytic basis, which is being prepared by mentioned delegations. One of them will be dealing with a social investment program, mainly to alleviate the consequences of privatization and, particularly, to slow down the increasing unemployment rate. The other delegation will prepare a project of economic structural changes. Third will investigate the current economic conditions in the republic and prepare measures for economic improvements. In Vahram Nersisyan's opinion, some $50-100 mln are needed for general economic improvements in Armenia. Nevertheless, large credits are difficult to obtain, as sources of finances are not quite sure they will be able to get their money back consistently and in time. Credits for mentioned preparatory operations are given not to the government of the republic, but to executive organizations and their foreign specialists. In other words, the credit is given to Armenia, but the money is paid to foreign specialists, who work for development of projects for Armenia. The debt is, naturally, to be paid by Armenia. Armenia is not the only country in the region, which appeared in such conditions. The World Bank will give a similar credit to support structural changes in Azerbaijan, which will have to pay it back in the same way. According to the Armenian representative of the World Bank, these are "first window" credits. "Second window" credits will provide money to financial structures of the republic. Similar credits have been particularly received by Russia and Baltic republics. Armenia has never received such credits so far. Structural changes credit of $12 mln., $28 mln. credit for the earthquake zone and $40 mln. for the irrigation system project have been allocated for Armenia. The latter has not been affirmed yet, but $1.5 mln. have already been allocated for analytic work. Another $30 mln. of energy credit is to be acknowledged by the end of the year. Vahram Nersisyan promises that, if peace is stable, he will aspire to doubling and tripling the credits to Armenia so that it receives $200-300 mln. from the World Bank yearly.
