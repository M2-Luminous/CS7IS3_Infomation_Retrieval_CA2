SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The amendments made in this rule do not affect the information collection requirements for the Single Family Property Disposition program, which were previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act and assigned OMB control numbers 2502&hyph;0306. I. Background Title II of the National Housing Act (the Act) authorizes HUD to insure mortgages for single family residences through the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) single family mortgage insurance program. The disposition program for single family properties, acquired by HUD in exchange for payment of insurance claims, is authorized by section 204(g) of the Act. The regulations governing the disposition program are codified at 24 CFR part 291. On October 20, 1993, the Department published an interim rule, which subsequently became effective on November 19, 1993, amending certain provisions of part 291 to allow for greater flexibility in fluctuating market situations and to provide greater opportunities for affordable housing to families and to State and local governments or nonprofit organizations serving low- and moderate-income families. The purpose of the amendments was to implement the policy of President Clinton and Secretary Cisneros to expand access to affordable homeownership and help revitalize neighborhoods.
