The uprising which led to Imam Khomeyni's arrest by the monarchial regime and subsequent exile, was the first spark of the Islamic revolution, which 15 years later in February 1979, illuminated Iran and the world with millions lining the streets to welcome home their triumphant leader. Since then, the teeming millions have continued their faithful presence on the scenes, setting up new records at his funeral service in 1989, and yesterday, as in past years, they once again made their presence felt at his mausoleum. Hojjat ol-Eslam Mohammad 'Ali Ansari, head of the headquarters for organizing the fifth anniversary of Imam Khomeyni's departure, said the people of Iran who, by their presence on the scene from the outset, had carried out the directives of the father of the Islamic revolution will continue in the same path by obeying the orders of the leader of the Islamic republic Ayatollah Khamene'i. In today's ceremonies that was observed in an atmosphere permeated with grief and sorrow the mourners of Imam Khomeyni, beating their chests, wept on the anniversary of the great loss, and also praised the martyrs of the June 5, 1963 uprising for their valor and courage in confronting the oppressive monarchy. Praising the solid presence on the scene on the occasion of the anniversary of the June 5 uprising, Hojjat Ansari recalled the infamous storming of the Feizieh theological school by soldiers of the Shah who killed and wounded many students, and analyzed the crucial role of Imam Khomeyni from the beginning of the Islamic movement. He said at a time when the so-called white revolution of the Shah was being bandied about with demagogical slogans, Imam Khomeyni, fully knowledgeable about the plots being hatched entered the political scene and proved to the Muslims of Iran and the world that the Pahalvi monarchy was against Islam. On behalf of Imam Khomeyni's son Hojjat ol-Eslam Ahmad Khomeyni, Ansari thanked the people as well as foreign guests in Iran for their participation in Saturday's ceremonies. The anniversary of the June 5 uprising was also observed in other towns and cities throughout the Islamic republic Sunday.
