FR940526-1-00013 FR940526-1-00007 30 CFR Part 935 Ohio Regulatory Program AGENCY: Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM), Interior. ACTION: Proposed rule; public comment period and opportunity for public hearing on proposed amendment. SUMMARY: OSM is announcing the receipt of proposed Program Amendment Number 67 to the Ohio permanent regulatory program (hereinafter the Ohio program) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The amendment was initiated by Ohio and is intended to make the Ohio program as effective as the corresponding Federal regulations concerning postmining land uses. Specifically, the amendment proposes to clearly identify postmining land use categories, to clarify the comparison of premining and postmining land uses, to clarify that ``undeveloped land'' may be the designated postmining land use only if the premining land use is undeveloped land, to clarify that ``forestland'' and ``fish and wildlife habitat'' are distinct postmining land uses, and to eliminate redundant provisions more stringent than the Federal regulations for notice and approval of alternative postmining land uses by other reviewing agencies and for the design of postmining land use plans by an engineer. DATES: Written comments must be received on or before 4 p.m. e.d.t., on June 27, 1994. If requested, a public hearing on the proposed amendments will be held on June 20, 1994. Requests to speak at the hearing must be received by 4 p.m. e.d.t., on June 10, 1994.
