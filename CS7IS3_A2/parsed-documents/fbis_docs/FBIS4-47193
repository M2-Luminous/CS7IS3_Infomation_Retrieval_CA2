It was organized under the patronage of the Roskomdragmet [Russian Committee for Precious Metals], the chairman of which--Yevgeniy Bychkov--was elected president of the association. Yesterday the new organization obtained Certificate No. 32211 at the Moscow Registration Office, which signifies the de facto beginning of its work. The decision to create this association was adopted on 21 April at a session attended by its founders--the leading officials of six diamond organizations: three plants in the Kristall system (Barnaul, Moscow, and Smolensk), three very large joint ventures (Intertreyd, Kristalldiam, and Ruiz daymond), as well as the Almazyuvelireksport Foreign-Trade Association and the Federation of Trade Unions of Workers in the Mining and Metallurgical Industry. The new association's charter declares measures aimed at developing the Russian diamond industry and at increasing its competitiveness on the world market. This organization intends to render consultative assistance to all of Russia's diamond-cutting enterprises, regardless of their forms of ownership. Included among its potential clients are approximately 100 legal entities already having licenses to cut diamonds. The association sees its special goal as helping in the cooperation between diamond-processing plants of the CIS countries: Located in Kiev, Vinnitsa, Gomel, Yerevan, and Chardzhu are large plants specializing in the production of very high quality diamonds--the so-called "Russian cut," or "fine cut." After the disintegration of the USSR, these plants were no longer able to obtain a full supply of raw materials--basically, diamonds from Yakutiya. During the years 1992-1993 they began to obtain significant supplies of raw materials from foreign firms--for example, Belgium and Israel. Their products are already competitive with Russian diamonds on world markets inasmuch as the sector of high-quality diamonds is a comparatively narrow one. It should be said that contacts with the above-listed CIS plants have already been established by Almazyuvelireksport and the Yakutsk company entitled Tumaada Daymond. And two Yakutsk-Ukrainian joint ventures have been created. In the words of its executive director--Ararat Evoyan--the new association will take steps to make sure that the "Russian cut" being turned out by the CIS plants and the products of their Russian colleagues will be sold on the world markets within a framework of thoroughgoing cooperation. The Diamond Producers Association of Russia was founded as an analogy with such organizations in other countries, having the typical purposes of civilized lobbying for favorable customs and tax laws, as well as combating the producers of fake (infused) diamonds.
