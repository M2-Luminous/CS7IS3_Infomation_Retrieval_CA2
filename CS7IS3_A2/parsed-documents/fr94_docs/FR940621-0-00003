FR940621-0-00003 FR940621-0-00002 Agricultural Marketing Service 7 CFR Part 923 [Docket No. FV94&hyph;923&hyph;1FR] Sweet Cherries Grown In Designated Counties in Washington; Establishment of Minimum Size and Maturity Requirements for Rainier Variety Cherries AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule establishes a minimum size requirement of 11 row size (61/64 inch diameter) and a minimum maturity requirement of 17 percent soluble solids for Rainier variety cherries that can be shipped to fresh market outlets under Marketing Order No. 923. This final rule ensures that consumers receive cherries of acceptable size and maturity. This is intended to enhance the quality and image of Washington Rainier cherries in the fresh market, thereby increasing sales and improving returns to producers. This final rule was recommended by the Washington Cherry Marketing Committee (committee), which works with the Department of Agriculture (Department) in administering the marketing order covering sweet cherries grown in designated counties in Washington. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 21, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mark J. Kreaggor, Marketing Order Administration Branch, Fruit and Vegetable Division, Agricultural Marketing Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, room 2523&hyph;S, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456; telephone: (202) 720&hyph;5127; or Teresa Hutchinson, Northwest Marketing Field Office, Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS, USDA, 1220 SW Third Avenue, Room 369, Portland, OR 97204; telephone: (503) 326&hyph;2724. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement No. 134 and Marketing Order No. 923 (7 CFR Part 923), regulating the handling of sweet cherries grown in designated counties in Washington, hereinafter referred to as the ``order.'' The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This final rule is not intended to have retroactive effect. This final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. There are approximately 50 handlers of Washington sweet cherries that are subject to regulation under the order. In addition, there are approximately 1,100 producers in the regulated area. Small agricultural service firms, which include handlers of Washington sweet cherries, have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural producers are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $500,000. A majority of these handlers and producers may be classified as small entities. This final rule revises ยง923.322 to establish a minimum size requirement of 11 row (61/64 inch diameter) and a minimum maturity requirement of 17 percent soluble solids for Rainier variety cherries under the order. The committee recommended these minimum size and maturity requirements by a vote of 13 to 1. Section 923.52 of the order authorizes the establishment of grade, size, quality, maturity, pack and container regulations for any variety or varieties of cherries grown in the production area. Section 923.53 further authorizes the modification, suspension, or termination of regulations issued under ยง923.52. Section 923.55 provides that whenever cherries are regulated pursuant to ยง923.52 or ยง923.53, such cherries must be inspected by the Federal-State Inspection Service, and certified as meeting the applicable requirements of such regulations.
