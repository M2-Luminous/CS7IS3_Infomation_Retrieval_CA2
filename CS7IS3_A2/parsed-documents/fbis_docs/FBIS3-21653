"We insist that the US Government apologize over the involvement of its diplomatic staff in illegal-drug dealing," said the protesters, calling themselves the Salvation Front for Indonesia's Youth Generation (FPGMI). They also accused the US Government for influencing Indonesian youths with its "destructive culture", being unfair towards the Islamic world and forcing its interest on others. "The inconsistencies of the US in upholding justice and truth are reflected in its double-standard policy toward Islamic world," they claimed. The demonstrators interspersed anti-American chants with shoutings of "God is great" and sang a march. "US Embassy: we sell xtc (ecstasy), narcotics and morphine", "USA satellite of Zionism" and "Nato and USA are cowards, not heroes," said the banner and poster totting crowd. Two protesters then delivered a copy of their statement to an embassy staff, while the others peacefully and voluntarily dispersed before the police could make any moves to end the demonstration, which occurred in less than an hour. In the statement, the demonstrators demanded that the US Government honor and respect Indonesia's law and sovereignty by not abusing their priviledges. They also insisted that the US act honestly and fairly towards the Islamic world as well as refrain from using trade and economic issues for their own interests. In addition, they wanted the two members of staff caught in drug trafficking, Steven J. Bryner and Peter M. Karajin III, to be tried under Indonesian law. The two US diplomats who were arrested by the Indonesian authorities for the alleged drug trafficking, were recently brought back to the United States by the DEA officials. There were no arrests in the demonstration, witnesses said.
