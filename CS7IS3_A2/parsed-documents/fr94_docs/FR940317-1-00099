FR940317-1-00099 FR940317-1-00013 ยง536.92 Statutory authority. (a) The statutory authority for this subpart is contained in the Act of 13 September 1960 (74 Stat. 878, 32 U.S.C. 715), commonly referred to as the ``National Guard Claims Act'' as amended by Public Law 90&hyph;486, 13 August 1968, (82 Stat. 756), Public Law 90&hyph;525, 26 September 1968 (82 Stat. 877), Public Law 901&hyph;312, 8 July 1970 (84 Stat. 412), and Public Law 93&hyph;336, 8 July 1974, and the Act of 8 September 1961 (75 Stat. 488, 10 U.S.C. 2736) as amended by Public Law 90&hyph;521, 26 September 1968 (82 Stat. 874) and as amended by Public Law 98564, 20 October 1984. (b) For purposes of this subpart, the following terminology applies: (1) ARNG personnel. A member of the ARNG engaged in training or duty under 32 U.S.C. 316, 502, 503, 504, 505, or 709. (2) Claimant. An individual, partnership, association, corporation, country, State, commonwealth, territory, or a political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia presenting a claim and meeting the conditions set forth in section 536.20. The term does not include the U.S. Government, any of its instrumentalities, except as prescribed by statute, or a State, commonwealth, territory, or the District of Columbia, which maintains the unit to which the ARNG personnel causing the injury or damage are assigned. This exclusion does not ordinarily apply to a unit of local government that does not control the ARNG organization involved. As a general rule, a claim by a unit of local government other than a State, commonwealth, or territory will be entertained unless the item claimed to be damaged or lost was procured or maintained by State, commonwealth, or territorial funds. (3) State. As used in this subpart the term ``state'' includes self-governing commonwealths and territories of the United States; for example, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. ยง536.93 Scope. (a) This subpart is applicable in all places and sets forth the procedures to be followed in the settlement and payment of claims for death, personal injury, or damage, loss, or destruction of property caused by_ (1) Members or employees of the ARNG. (2) Noncombat activities of the ARNG when engaged in training or duty under 32 U.S.C. 316, 502, 503, 504, 505, or 709, provided such claim is not for personal injury or death of a member of the Armed Forces or Coast Guard. (3) An employee whose injury or death is incident to service. (b) A claimant dissatisfied with an administrative settlement under this subpart as the result of activities of the NG of a State, Commonwealth, or Territory is not entitled to judicial relief in an action against the United States. Whether he or she has a legal cause of action or may file an administrative claim against such political entity depends upon controlling local law. (c) Claims arising out of activities of the ARNG when performing duties at the call of the governor of a State maintaining the unit are not cognizable under this chapter or any other law, regulation, or appropriation available to the Army for the payment of claims. Such claims should be returned or referred to the authorities of the State, for whatever action they choose to take and claimants should be informed of the return or referral. Care should be taken to determine the status of the unit; members at the time the claims incident occurred, particularly in civil emergencies as units called by the governor, are sometimes ``federalized'' during the call-up. If the unit was federalized at the time the claims incident occurred, the claim will be cognizable under subparts C, D and F or other subparts pertaining to the Active Army. ยง536.93 Claims payable. (a) Tort claims. All claims for personal injuries, death, or damage to or loss of real or personal property, arising out of incidents occurring on or after 29 December 1981 based on negligent or wrongful acts or omissions, of ARNG personnel activity within the scope of employment, within the United States while engaged in training or duty under 32 U.S.C. 316, 502, 503, 504, 505, or 709 will be processed under the FTCA (subpart D). Such claims arising before 29 December 1981 will, except as modified herein, be processed and settled in accordance with the provisions of subpart C. (b) Noncombat activities. A claim incident to the noncombat activities of the ARNG while engaged in duty or training under 32 U.S.C. 316, 502, 503, 504, 505, or 709 may be settled under this subpart.
