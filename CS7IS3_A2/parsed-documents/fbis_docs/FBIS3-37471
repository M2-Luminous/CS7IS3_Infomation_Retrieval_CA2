Under the agreement, Russia will provide Armenia with 141.3 million U.S. dollars worth of goods in 1994. Energy supplies to Armenia will remain at about the 1993 level. Chernomyrdin stressed the need to boost trade between the two countries. He said Russia understands the difficulties facing Armenia but the question of Russian credits to Armenia was not discussed at the talks because "Russia's budget has not been approved yet." He added that "in any event only limited credits will be issued and only in extreme situations."
