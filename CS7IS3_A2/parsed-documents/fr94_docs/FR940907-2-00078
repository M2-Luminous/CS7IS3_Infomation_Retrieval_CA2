ACTION: Notice. DATES: This addition to the annual list of labor surplus area is effective September 1, 1994. SUMMARY: The purpose of this notice is to announce an addition to the annual list of labor surplus areas. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William J. McGarrity, Labor Economist, USES, Employment and Training Administration, 200 Constitution Avenue, N.W., Room N&hyph;4470, Attention: TEESS, Washington, D.C. 20210. Telephone: 202&hyph;219&hyph;5185. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Executive Order 12073 requires executive agencies to emphasize procurement set-asides in labor surplus areas. The Secretary of Labor is responsible under that Order for classifying and designating areas as labor surplus areas. Executive agencies should refer to Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 20 (48 CFR Part 20) in order to assess the impact of the labor surplus area program on particular procurements. Under Executive Order 10582 executive agencies may reject bids or offers of foreign materials in favor of the lowest offer by a domestic supplier, provided that the domestic supplier undertakes to produce substantially all of the materials in areas of substantial unemployment as defined by the Secretary of Labor. The preference given to domestic suppliers under Executive Order 10582 has been modified by Executive Order 12260. Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 25 (48 CFR Part 25) implements Executive Order 12260. Executive agencies should refer to Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 25 in procurements involving foreign businesses or products in order to assess its impact on the particular procurements. The Department of Labor regulations implementing Executive Orders 12073 and 10582 are set forth at 20 CFR part 654, subparts A and B. Subpart A requires the Assistant Secretary of Labor to classify jurisdictions as labor surplus areas pursuant to the criteria specified in the regulations and to publish annually a list of labor surplus areas. Pursuant to those regulations the Assistant Secretary of Labor published the annual list of labor surplus areas on October 19, 1993, (58 FR 53943). Subpart B of Part 654 states that an area of substantial unemployment for purposes of Executive Order 10582 is any area classified as a labor surplus area under Subpart A. Thus, labor surplus areas under Executive Order 12073 are also areas of substantial unemployment under Executive Order 10582. The area described below has been classified by the Assistant Secretary as a labor surplus area pursuant to 20 CFR 654.5(b)(48 FR 15615 April 12, 1983) and is effective September 1, 1994. The list of labor surplus areas is published for the use of all Federal agencies in directing procurement activities and locating new plants or facilities. Signed at Washington, D.C. on August 29, 1994. Doug Ross, Assistant Secretary. Addition to the Annual List of Labor Surplus Areas.
