We have not yet completely recovered from the strenuous day yesterday. And today, before I came to this meeting, I thought over what was really done, what the results of that day's work are,and what conclusion can be made from all that has happened. I would like to say that in very many aspects this visit was really a historic one and it was the first in the history of a free Latvia and a new democratic Russia. We were going to Moscow with certain doubts and it would be needless to say how carefully we were preparing. Perhaps, not everyone knows that the last three nights both Mr. Birkavs and myself spent in continuous consultations with various political forces and members of our government in order to work out this final version before going to Moscow. [passage omitted] As soon as the talks began, the anxiety concerning certain imperialistic thinking and possible pressure from the Russian side in fact to a certain extent disappeared from our minds. And the dialogue proceeded in a free, unforced and I would even like to say democratic form. [passage omitted] President Yeltsin, as far as he was able and willing, firmly and openly stated to me that now Russia does not have aspirations to have Latvia in its sphere of interests, that Russia does not think of any kind of regaining the governorship, and that Russia thinks that Latvia has to become a stable, free, and sovereign European state. During the whole course of the talks I did not feel that there was any tendency which would make me considerably doubt or reconsider what had been said. In discussions with President Yeltsin, at the beginning we touched on the issues of the fate of the two peoples, the fate of the Russian people and the Latvian people, about the huge deportations which affected the Latvian people, about the deportations of 1940 and 1949. And remembering this, President Yeltsin categorically condemned personally and on his government's behalf those mass deportations and said that he would also publicly state this everywhere where it could be heard and where one would be able to find out his views. It should be said that he kept this promise and with certain satisfaction I was listening to him when he was addressing the press and reporters. [passage omitted] We agreed that the agreements signed were a theoretical part, a part on paper, of the agreement, and practical steps have to follow now. These steps should be such that they do not offend either Latvia's honor or the honor of Latvian citizens, or the wrong done to the deported, or the principles of Latvia's sovereignty and independence. We agreed that the number of the military, the amount of pensions paid to them and their future fate will be strictly controlled. An agreement was reached with the Russian side -- the minister of defense and the minister of foreign affairs also took part in it, their names, Grachev and Kozyrev, are widely known to you -- about the creation of a repatriation fund and both Russia and Latvia, as well as other European states, will participate in the fund. Speaking about the withdrawal of troops from Latvia, I expressed doubts on whether Russia is ready to withdraw its troops by 31 August and I wondered whether their promises will not be fulfilled. A statement by the minister of defense said in response that they will do everything possible to have the troops withdrawn much earlier than 31 August. Although 31 August was left in the agreement, a verbal agreement was reached between us that the troops will be withdrawn before 31 August. Various figures and various dates were mentioned. I think that we can safely say now that this to a certain extent depends on both our Ministry of Defense and other ministries, whether they are able to get actively involved in this process. The agreement provides the foundation on which they can get to work. I got the impression that the troops will very soon leave Latvian territory. We have received full guarantees from the Russian side and once again a verbal assurance from Mr. Yeltsin that the issue of the status of a military base was an unfortunate erroneous process and that it is a lesson not only for Latvia to be more careful, but also a lesson for Russia itself to follow more carefully the drafting of its documents and the work of its executive and its corresponding departments. Once again an agreement was reached that that facility should be a military facility under civilian control [as heard]. There was no difference of opinion as to who and how controls it and that that site should never become a military base on Latvian territory. And it was also added that the Russian side does not have at the moment any grounds, any plans or any activity aimed at creating military bases in Latvia. [passage omitted] [Birkavs] Hello, esteemed viewers and listeners. Whether yesterday will be a historic day and whether it will stay in the people's consciousness as a significant positive step now depends on us. Practically today we can go to the new Skrunda facility and begin to dismantle it. But let us not perhaps hurry in this way, that involves considerable work. And for this purpose, the state coffers will immediately receive $3 million. These are practical matters, however, which we can easily tackle in the short term. We need long-term favorable economic relations with Russia. I therefore consider the signing of a protocol, which states that most favored nation status in trade comes into effect for Latvia and Russia on 1 June 1994, as one of the greatest results of yesterday's talks. In order to fully settle this issue and to sign corresponding documents, Russian Premier Chernomyrdin will come to Latvia in the second half of May and the corresponding documents will be signed. I would like to say to the residents of Skrunda and all the residents of the surrounding villages and rural districts who are affected by the Skrunda radar that my request from Russia on the issue of how much should the rent payment for Skrunda be is very simple: Pay the sum that is worthy of Russia. The sum on which we agreed may be assessed differently. It is two and a half times bigger than was initially promised by the Russian side, but it is considerably smaller than what I would like it to be -- it is $5 million a year. I promise that this money will be granted to the residents who will still be suffering from the radar for four years. [passage omitted] We are facing a new historic period and we should not look back so much, we should look forward. I invite all the critics of the agreement to carefully follow whether the clauses of the agreement are complied with. We will try to do everything possible to improve relations with Russia in the course of compliance with the agreement, but so that Latvian people do not suffer either. Thank you. [passage omitted]
