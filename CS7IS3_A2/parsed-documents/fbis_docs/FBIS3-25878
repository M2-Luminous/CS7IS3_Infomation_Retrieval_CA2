The proposed revisions will allow foreign workers to remain in Taiwan up to three years, one year longer than the current limit. COLA also proposed revisions which will allow foreign laborers to apply for jobs offered by employers other than the one that sponsored their entry into Taiwan. Currently, foreign workers are legally bound to their employers and cannot seek employment elsewhere on the island. Other revisions proposed by COLA include a measure which would require any enterprise facing a labor shortage to make a public announcement about the shortage so that domestic workers unions can take part in the recruiting process. If an employer is found to have made a false statement about the labor shortage, or fired workers after employing them, COLA will be allowed to punish the employer under the revisions. COLA Chairman Chao Shou-po said the revisions will address many of the problems which have plagued the department over the past few years. COLA officials said they wanted to extend the maximum allowed time for foreign workers because the current limit is too short. Workers now have to leave just after they have become familiar with their working environment, they said, which limits their contributions. And to prevent foreign laborers from leaving their work illegally, Chao instructed employers to deposit a certain share of the workers' wages in a special account, which is returned to the workers when they return home. The revisions will be sent to the Executive Yuan for review in March.
