His command, which is a local unit, does not have much information. Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Badawi said during an interview given to foreign journalists on 14 June that Thailand must be careful because the group will carry out its mission regardless of the status of relations between Thailand and Malaysia. Speaking to journalists on 21 June, Lt. Gen. Kitti said the Malaysian minister probably made the remark out of concern about relations with Thailand. He said the Malaysian side continues to feel that relations between the two countries further have to be strengthened. For example, the Trilateral Cooperation Project will not materialize without good cooperation among the countries concerned. According to a report from the Foreign Ministry, Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan has directed the Thai envoy to Kuala Lumpur to point out that Thailand allows free choice of religion and that followers of any religion carrying out religious activities within the scope of the law will be given due protection. Thailand has no intention of interfering in other countries' internal affairs, particularly in neighboring countries. Regarding the reported training of the aforementioned group in Thailand, Thailand wants evidence of such conduct and is ready to provide cooperation to deal with the matter.
