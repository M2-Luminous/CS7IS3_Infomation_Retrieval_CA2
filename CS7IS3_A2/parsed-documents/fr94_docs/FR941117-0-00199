FR941117-0-00199 FR941117-0-00013 C. Information Repositories 1. Background Under Rule 15c2&hyph;12, as adopted in 1989, NRMSIRs essentially serve the function of disseminators of official statements on behalf of Participating Underwriters. 148 The option of Participating Underwriters to transfer their final official statement delivery obligations to NRMSIRs has encouraged the development of NRMSIRs. 149 The three existing NRMSIRs are private vendors that gather and disseminate final official statements pursuant to Rule 15c2&hyph;12. In addition, although not required under existing provisions of the rule, they provide other current information about municipal issuers to the primary and secondary municipal securities markets. 150 148 Under Rule 15c2&hyph;12(b)(4), underwriters must deliver final official statements to potential customers for a 90 day period after the close of the underwriting period. The underwriters' 90 day delivery obligation is shortened to 25 days if the final official statement can be obtained from a NRMSIR. 149 Since the Commission adopted Rule 15c2&hyph;12, the Division of Market Regulation issued three no-action letters recognizing national information vendors as NRMSIRS, based on the standards set out in the July 1989 Release. See Letters from Richard G. Ketchum, Director, Division of Market Regulation to: Joseph V. Riccobono, Executive Vice-President, American Banker-Bond Buyer (Jan. 4, 1990); J. Kevin Kenny, President, Chief Executive Officer, J.J. Kenny Co. (Jan. 4, 1990); and Michael R. Bloomberg, President, Bloomberg, L.P. (Jan. 11, 1990). Recently, the Commission has received inquiries from additional information vendors desiring to be recognized as NRMSIRs. 150 NRMSIRs are not the only source of information in the municipal market. The MSRB has developed its Municipal Securities Information Library (``MSIL'') system, which presently collects information and disseminates it to market participants and information vendors. The Official Statement and Advance Refunding Document-Paper Submission System (``OS/ARD'') of the MSIL collects and makes available on magnetic tape and on paper official statements and advance refunding notices. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 29298 (June 13, 1991), 56 FR 28194. As a part of the MSIL system, the MSRB commenced operation of its Continuing Disclosure Information (``CDI'') pilot system in January, 1993. The CDI system is a central repository for voluntarily submitted official continuing disclosure documents relating to outstanding municipal securities issues. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30556 (April 6, 1992) 57 FR 12534. Neither the MSIL OS/ARD system nor the CDI system is a NRMSIR; the Commission has previously indicated that it would consider the competitive implications of a MSRB request for NRMSIR status. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 28081 (June 1, 1990), 55 FR 23333, 23337 n.26. As a result of the amendments, NRMSIRs will play an expanded role in the collection and dissemination of secondary market information. In addition to the collection and dissemination of final official statements, they will collect and disseminate annual financial information, as well as notices of material events. The Commission is sensitive to the need of NRMSIRs for flexibility, especially with respect to the timing requirements for the dissemination of notices of material events. The Commission will monitor developments in the municipal securities market as participants adapt to the changes in Rule 15c2&hyph;12, and fully expects that the current and potential NRMSIRs are capable of adjusting to their expanded role. The Commission is of the view that NRMSIRs, as private information vendors, will have sufficient economic incentives to serve their expanded functions resulting from the amendments to Rule 15c2&hyph;12, even in the absence of the more specific review requirement of the recommendation prohibition of the Proposed Amendments. 151 151 See, e.g. , Letter of PSA (noting that the suggestion made by some market participants that municipal securities dealers will not utilize information they have long sought is implausible), Letter of Ferris Baker Watts (information will be used if it is available).
