The attacking troops of the Vietnamese communists' puppets started their drive against the people and Democratic Kampuchea on 19 January. However, the people -- who are boiling with rage against the Vietnamese communists and have been robbed and ruined by these bandits -- joined the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] and closely collaborated with the latter in the counterattackg to protect the people's property and lives. At that time, a number of soldiers of the Vietnamese communists' puppets and of the Paras [troops of the Khmer People's National Liberation Front] -- who have deserted to live with their parents and due to their anger, lack of money, and hunger because their salary was robbed from them by their superiors -- joined the NADK and the people and chased away and swept the attacking troops of Vietnam's puppets along Route 6 in Siem Reap Province. One part of the force chased the attacking troops from Spean Koul to Pralay and Stoung. Another part of the force swept the enemy from Spean Koul, Lveng Russei, to Kompong Kdei. The attacking troops of the Vietnamese communists' puppets were routed; many were killed or wounded by mines, booby traps, and other [words indistinct]. This is a counter attack to protect the property and lives of the people, who have been constant victims of the enemy's plunder, burning, and oppression for the past more than 15 years. This clearly shows that the Cambodian nation and people will not let troops of the Vietnamese communists' puppets do what they want at will. People have to fight to defend their villages, property, and lives. They want peace and national reconciliation instead of fighting for the Vietnamese communists and Western powers. If these soldiers' leaders want to remain servants of the Vietnamese communists and the Western powers in order to have rank, honors, and money, let them fight themselves.
