FR940114-2-00148 FR940114-2-00091 Environmental Impact Statement: Contra Costa County and Solano County, CA AGENCY: Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), DOT. ACTION: Notice of intent. SUMMARY: The FHWA is issuing this notice to advise the public that a supplement to a Draft Environmental Impact Statement will be prepared for a proposed highway project in Contra Costa County and Solano County, California. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. John Schultz, Chief, District Operations ``A'', Federal Highway Administration, 980 9th Street_Suite 400, Sacramento, California 95814&hyph;2724, Telephone: (916) 551&hyph;1314. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The FHWA, in cooperation with the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), will prepare a supplement to the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) on a proposal to construct a new toll bridge across the Carquinez Strait at Interstate 680 between the City of Benicia and the City of Martinez. The proposed new toll bridge will be parallel to the existing Benicia-Martinez Bridge. The original DEIS for the Benicia-Martinez Bridge System (FHWA&hyph;CA&hyph;EIS&hyph;91&hyph;03&hyph;D) was approved October 17, 1991. The proposed improvements will provide a new five-lane bridge, including one auxiliary lane and one slow-vehicle lane, a new toll plaza and new freeway-to-freeway connectors between I&hyph;680 and I&hyph;780. These are considered necessary to improve operation and safety, relieve freeway congestion and accommodate projected traffic volumes. The proposed project limits include I&hyph;680, from 2000 feet south of the Marina Vista Interchange in Contra Costa County to Bayshore Road in Solano County, and I&hyph;780, from East 5th Street to include the I&hyph;680/I&hyph;780 Interchange in Solano County. The scope of the traffic study includes: (1) I&hyph;680 from Route 4 to I&hyph;80, (2) I&hyph;780 between I&hyph;680 and I&hyph;80, (3) I&hyph;80 between Red Top Road and the Route 12 East Interchange, (4) Freeway-to-freeway as well as local interchanges, and (5) Freeway ramp-end and local street intersections potentially affected by proposed improvements. Modifications to the I&hyph;680/Marina Vista Interchange and the I&hyph;680/I&hyph;780 Interchange will be required, and will be considered in the preliminary engineering and environmental studies. A Draft EIR/EIS for the Benicia-Martinez Bridge System Project was circulated and a public hearing was held in December 1991. One hundred thirty (130) written comments were received. Substantial comments involved: (1) Matching the scope of the project with the available funding, (2) providing for future rail transit on the new bridge, (3) location of the new bridge and toll plaza, (4) the direction of toll collection, and (5) construction impacts. Based on this information the decision was made to down-scope the project to the current proposal and prepare a Supplemental Draft Environmental Impact Statement. Alternatives under consideration include: (1) Taking no action, (2) providing for mass transit and (3) providing for multi-modal transportation modes including bicycle and pedestrian facilities. Incorporated into the studies with the build alternatives will be design variations of grade and alignment. Letters describing the proposed action and soliciting comments will be sent to appropriate Federal, State, and local agencies, and to private organizations and citizens who have previously expressed or are known to have interest in this proposal. A public meeting (open house/map display) will be held to provide information and discuss features of the project. In addition, a public hearing will be held. Public notice will be given of the time and place of the meeting and hearing. The Supplemental Draft EIS will be available for public and agency review and comment prior to the public hearing. No formal scoping meeting will be held. To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and all significant issues are identified, comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments or questions concerning this proposed action and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA at the address previously provided in this document.
