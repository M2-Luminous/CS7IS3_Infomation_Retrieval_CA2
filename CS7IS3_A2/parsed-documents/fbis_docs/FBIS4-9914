Hermosilla's comments were published by LA SEGUNDA today. Hermosilla explained that Cardoen will not appear before a Miami court "because in the United States there is no certainty as to when he would be tried. He could be in prison for years before the trial." The lawyer said: "Cardoen did not commit any crime. That is known in detail by the prosecutors. They met with us in Jamaica, last year in April, and we held a long conversation." Hermosilla recalled that his son, Juan Pablo Hermosilla, who is also a lawyer, is in the United States talking with Eduardo Palmer, one of the prosecutors in charge of this case, to gain some "advantage" for Cardoen, but he reiterated: "They know this is a lost case."
