Makarov: "One More Poll Has Been Conducted"] [Text] A poll conducted among officers of the Minsk Higher Military Engineering College showed that 52 percent of those surveyed do not see any prospects for their continued service, and 25 percent have already decided to leave the Belarusian Armed Forces. As many as 96 percent of the servicemen expressed their discontent with the legal status and material security of Belarusian officers (by the way, 67 percent of college officers do not have their own housing), and they believe that if Belarus continues to conduct such a military policy, our Army will end up without a future. In the opinion of those surveyed, their situation may improve if they are granted privileges, which officers in the Belarusian Interior Ministry and the Russian Federation Armed Forces are currently enjoying, including free passes for city and suburban transportation, reimbursement of fares for officers' and their families' holiday travels within the CIS, free medical treatment in spas, full compensation for rent charges, possibility of receiving preferential loans, etc. Regarding officers' attitude toward contract service, 30 percent of those surveyed disapprove of it, 34 percent refused to answer, and 36 percent support it, but only provided that the state fulfills its responsibilities.
