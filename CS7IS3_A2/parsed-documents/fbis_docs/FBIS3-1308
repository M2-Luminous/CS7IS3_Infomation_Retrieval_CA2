Heavy shooting could still be heard this morning from the districts of Kamenge, Kinama, and Cibitoke (where most of the inhabitants are Hutus), according to the AFP correspondent in Bujumbura. People have started fleeing from these areas to Zaire. The Burundian radio made several appeals for calm this morning. The UN special representative in Burundi, Ahmedu Ould Abdallah, said between 60 and 80 deaths were recorded last night. In a statement to AFP, Ould Abdallah pointed out that the dead included members of both ethnic groups as well members of the Armed Forces which lost at least five men. He described as "extremely exaggerated" the reports given by Rwandan radio last night stating that at least 1,000 persons were killed in Bujumbura over the weekend. "It is in the interest of some politicians to make people believe that things are not going well. There is no general insecurity in Burundi," he added.
