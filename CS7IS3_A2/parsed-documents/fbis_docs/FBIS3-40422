One of the criteria for the awards is whether the candidates have presented their findings in a readily comprehensible form. [passage omitted] Gerd Fuhrmann, working in the Juelich Research Center's Central Electronics Laboratory, developed a laboratory microtomography system that can be used, in conjunction with a computer, to make the entire three-dimensional structure of a sample visible without previous preparation. He exploited the scanning electron microscope's high-current electron beam, which, if directed onto a metal cutting edge [Metallschneide], generates an x-ray beam, which is passed through the sample under inspection. According to the material of which the object under inspection consists and its thickness, the x-ray beam is attenuated (absorbed), and the absorption, or the energy loss resulting therefrom, is measured behind the sample in special detectors. Details From Inside the Object A computer is then used to reconstruct the inner structures of the sample according to the computer tomography process, achieving unprecedented resolution. Details of bones, tumor tissue, or industrial materials down to a size of less than 5 micrometers (five-thousandths of a millimeter) can thus be displayed and distinguished. However, this involves evaluating and processing large quantities of data from the numerous detectors by sophisticated procedures. The microtomography system can be used anywhere where interference-free inspection of the inner structures of small samples is required: for pores and cracks in ceramics or fiber-reinforced composites, for airbag sensor tests, for measuring oil-water mix permeation of porous rock in mineral oil research, or for examining bone specimens for medical purposes. Fuhrmann demonstrated his development with an examination of tiny living beings, displaying the inside of a fly's head. It was possible to identify tubes leading from the mouthpart into the trunk of the body. "Electrons in the Overtaking Lane" is the title that Frank Mueller gave his doctoral thesis, in which he addressed problems encountered in highly compressed semiconductors. Unlike nonconducting insulators and metals, which are good conductors of electricity, semiconductors are materials in which the flow of free electrons can be controlled. As "ideal" semiconductors have no free charge carriers, however, foreign atoms with an excess of electrons must first be built into the semiconductor material, a process referred to as "doping." Foreign Atoms Becoming a Problem These foreign atoms are becoming something of a problem in the quest for faster and faster devices. As they pass through the semiconductor, the electrons are repelled by the positively charged atom and thus take a sort of zigzag course. Separating the electrons from the doping atoms in space helps: The semiconductor material is slowly vapor-deposited -- atomic layer by atomic layer -- onto a substrate; very precise junctions between the different semiconductor materials can be obtained by changing the deposition material abruptly. The free electrons tend to remain on the interface layer between the different semiconductor materials and can thus be separated from the doping atoms. Ideally, they then fly in a perfectly straight line. However, as no semiconductor material can be made entirely without impurities, what really happens is somewhat different: Electrons continue to be diverted by collisions. Frank Mueller wanted to measure this deviation, so he built a barrier into the electrons' race track -- the interface between gallium arsenide and aluminum gallium arsenide. The barrier only lets the electrons through at a very narrow point, the emitter, behind which there is a collector to catch the electrons arriving in a straight line. Electrons deviated by collisions miss this collector. The greater the distance between the emitter and the collector, the greater the attenuation of the stream -- indeed, there are more collision centers on a longer path. The distances between the collision centers can now be measured to approximately one-ten-thousandth of a millimeter. The jury selected these two researchers, along with Christian Plass-Duelmer of the Institute of Geosphere Chemistry and Dynamics, who studied the significance of the oceans as a source of light hydrocarbons in the atmosphere, from a total of 24 candidates. Five theses came from information technology alone.
