FR941020-0-00061 FR941020-0-00021 50 CFR Part 672 [Docket No. 931199&hyph;4042; I.D. 101294A] Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Modification of a closure. SUMMARY: NMFS is opening the directed fishing for Pacific ocean perch in the Eastern Regulatory Area in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). This action is necessary to use the total allowable catch (TAC) for Pacific ocean perch in this area. EFFECTIVE DATE: 12 noon, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), October 19, 1994, until December 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Andrew N. Smoker, 907&hyph;586-7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the GOA exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 672. In accordance with ยง672.20(c)(1)(ii)(B), the annual TAC for Pacific ocean perch in the Eastern Regulatory Area was established by the final 1994 specifications of groundfish (59 FR 7647, February 16, 1994) as 1,265 metric tons (mt). At the same time, the directed fishery for Pacific ocean perch in the Eastern Regulatory Area was closed under ยง672.20(c)(2)(ii) in order to reserve amounts anticipated to be needed for incidental catch in other fisheries (59 FR 7647, February 16, 1994). NMFS has determined that as of October 1, 1994, 1,139 mt remain unharvested. The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined that the 1994 TAC for Pacific ocean perch in the Eastern Regulatory Area has not been reached. Therefore, NMFS is terminating the previous closure and is opening directed fishing for Pacific ocean perch in the Eastern Regulatory Area, effective at 12 noon, A.l.t., October 19, 1994. All other closures remain in full force and effect. Classification This action is taken under 50 CFR 672.20 and is exempt from review under E.O. 12866. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq . Dated: October 14, 1994. Richard H. Schaefer, Director of Office of Fisheries, Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service.
