He said: A deputy spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of France released a provocative "statement" on February 3, claiming that there had been no success in the DPRK-U.S. talks and it was time to bring up the issue of taking "sanctions" against the DPRK at the United Nations Security Council. At a time when a serious crisis has been created in the situation of the Korean peninsula by a perfidious act of the United States, France freely cried for "sanctions" against the DPRK, though she must know well what such "sanctions" would mean. This was not aimed at preventing nuclear proliferation but at finding a pretext for resuming its nuclear tests by taking issue with the DPRK's "nuclear problem." Lurking behind this impudent act of France is also her sinister intention to foil the DPRK-U.S. talks, egg the United States on to a showdown with the DPRK and cause a military conflict in the Northeast Asian region including the Korean peninsula so that it may fish in troubled waters through the massive sale of weapons of destruction. This is clearly proven by the fact that France has sold large quantities of weapons to this region including South Korea in recent years. It is until some time ago that France sold a big amount of plutonium to Japan, not joining the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT] on the pretext of "modernization of nuclear deterrent." It is unbecoming to her to express "concern" over the fate of the NPT now. It is really the height of sarcasm for France, which possesses many nuclear weapons and now feels an urge to continue nuclear tests, to cry for "sanctions" against the DPRK, charging it with the "nuclear problem". We cannot but take a serious view of the fact that the France authorities, ignoring our sincere efforts for a fundamental solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, are resorting to bellicose acts against us. If France persist in such insidious acts without discretion, we will take necessary measures against them. France must look squarely at the situation and ponder on the matter.
