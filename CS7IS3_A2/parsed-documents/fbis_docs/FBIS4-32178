"It is easy to accuse somebody but hard to argue," she said at a press conference. She refuted the opposition claims by citing from documents showing the former government led by Vladimir Meciar was planning -- shortly before being ousted by a no-confidence vote in March -- to introduce a 20 per cent rise in the price of energy and increase the pension age to 65 for both men and women. The measures would meet the conditions required to qualify for an IMF loan. Meciar said at Jedlove Kostolany, west Slovakia, on Friday [17 June] that it was inhuman to send 65-year-olds into retirement when the average life expectancy for Slovak men was 67. At the same meeting Sergej Kozlik, deputy premier in the Meciar government, compared the commitments given to the IMF by the present government of Jozef Moravcik to a cowpat in a field: one person stops before it, the other treads in it. "Whose boots are going to stink now? The Moravcik government's!" Kozlik said.
