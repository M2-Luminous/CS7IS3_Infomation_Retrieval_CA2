The foreign minister, Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali, while briefing the committee on Pak-India talks in Islamabad today, said that the talks focused on the Kashmir issue. The Pakistan side emphasized that India must take visible steps to reduce repression in the Indian-held Kashmir, including deinduction [reduction] of troops from the valley, release of political leaders, and their unhindered access to the human rights organizations and foreign governments. The committee was informed by the foreign minister that although the talks failed to achieve any results, the fact that Kashmir remained the focus of attention during the talks and acknowledgment by India that Kashmir was a disputed area amounts to a diplomatic gain for us.
