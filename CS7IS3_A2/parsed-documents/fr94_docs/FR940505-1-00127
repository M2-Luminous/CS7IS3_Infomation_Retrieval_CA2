FR940505-1-00127 FR940505-1-00012 EPA expects to propose to regulate the emissions of hydrocarbons (HC), oxides of nitrogen (NO X ), and carbon monoxide (CO) from certain new nonroad SI engines that have a gross power output at or below 19 kilowatts (kW) (small SI engines). An SI engine is an internal combustion engine in which the air/fuel mixture is ignited in the combustion chamber by an electric spark and are generally fueled by gasoline. The scope of these rules are expected to encompass a broad range of small SI engine applications, including farm and construction equipment, which states are preempted from regulating under section 209(e)(1) of the CAA. Anticipated exclusions from the rules are detailed below. 1. Engines used to propel marine vessels as defined in the General Provisions of the United States Code, 1 U.S.C. 3 (1992). A ``vessel'' includes every description of watercraft or other artificial contrivance used, or capable of being used, as a means of transportation on water. 1 U.S.C. 3 (1992). 2. Engines used in underground mining or engines used in underground mining equipment and regulated by the Mining Safety and Health Administration (MHSA). See 30 CFR parts 7, 31, 32, 36, 56, 57, 70, and 75. 3. Engines used in motorcycles and regulated in 40 CFR part 86 subpart E. 4. Engines used in aircraft as that term is defined in 40 CFR 87.1(a). 5. Engines used in recreational vehicles. Recreational engines are those engines which have no installed speed governor and which have a rated speed of greater than or equal to 5000 revolutions per minute (RPM). Recreational engines are not used to propel marine vessels and do not meet the criteria to be categorized as a Class III, IV, or V engine under this rule. (c) Standards. Phase 1 Under the expected Phase 1 proposal, exhaust emissions from small SI engines cannot exceed levels for a given engine class as listed in the table below (``Phase 1 Small SI Exhaust Emission Standards''). Engine classes are specified both by engine displacement, as measured in cubic centimeters (cc), and by the type of equipment the engine will power_either handheld or nonhandheld. The emission standards that EPA expects to propose are considered Phase l small engine standards. Phase 1 Small SI Exhaust Emission Standards [In grams per kilowatt hour] 1Engine class 1Hydrocarbon plus oxides of nitrogen 1Hydrocarbon 1Carbon monoxide 1Oxides of nitrogen I 16.1 402 II 13.4 402 III 295 805 5.36 IV 241 805 5.36 V 161 402 5.36 Class I: engines less than 225 cc in displacement Class II: engines greater than or equal to 225 cc in displacement Engines powering equipment defined as handheld must meet Class III, IV, or V emission standards as follows: Class III: engines less than 20 cc in displacement Class IV: engines at or above 20 cc to less than 50 displacement Class V: engines equal to or greater than 50 cc indisplacement Phase 2 Standards are currently being negotiated for Phase 2 through the regulatory negotiation process and will cover exhaust as well as evaporative emissions.
