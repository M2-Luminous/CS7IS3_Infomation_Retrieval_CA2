In an urgent message sent to the UN Secretary General, Dr. Butrus Ghali, today from Bonn, the prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, said the agony of Gorazde is infinitely worsening the sufferings in Sarajevo. She said we share the anger and despair of the Bosnian leadership after the apathy of the UN on the world community. She hoped the Security Council will quickly approve Pakistan's resolution demanding air strikes against the Serbian artillery and withdrawal of Serbian forces from Gorazde. The Council must act quickly, she emphasized. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said the world community must wake up to the warning bell sounded by the vicious war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. She said Pakistan feels strongly that maintaining the unjust arms embargo against Bosnia-Herzegovina means to assuming a share in the responsibility for the plight of the defenseless people. Ms. Benazir Bhutto said to allow the Serbs to succeed in Gorazde will severely and perhaps irretrievably erode the credibility of the United Nations and compromise its vision of collective security. She said it will represent a leap backwards to the law of force and away from our aspirations for a world ruled by the forces of law.
