The new executive board gathers representatives from the three existing factions within the PS: the "New Left," headed by Escalona, considered the most orthodox faction; the renewed faction [renovados]; and the third position faction [terceristas]. The new PS leadership headed by Escalona has appointed three more vice presidents in addition to Isabel Allende -- first vice president and president until yesterday -- and Vivienne Bachelet, fifth vice president. Gonzalo Martner will be secretary general and Anibal Palma will be general under secretary. The new executive board members are Jaime Perez de Arce (from the third position faction) as second vice president; Marcelo Schilling (from the renewed faction); and Ricardo Solari as fourth vice president. The PS plenum unanimously approved the restructuring of the leadership by 79 votes in favor and four abstentions. Manuel Almeyda did not want to vote, and argued that the grassroots should have participated in the process. This decision was made following two days of meetings and debates that took place in the "El Canelo de Nos" center. [passage omitted]
