Althoff, general secretary of the League of German Electrical Engineers (VDE). "No one can get by any more without our technology -- without `vitamin E' (for electronics) large sections of the economy would be unfit for battle." And in fact German businesses -- from electronic plant construction and energy distribution through measurement, regulation and communications technology, the automobile industry and engineering to medical technology -- are leaders in the application of microelectronics. But for that very reason there is no real feeling of contentment. "About DM800 billion in sales and the jobs that go with it are dependent on the most immediate access to a key technology with compnents valued at DM5 billion. In technical competition in this area the user requires detailed knowledge about what is coming in good time to develop his own system. Anyone who obtains the specifications of projected electronics components even half a year later than the competition has an insuperable handicap." He said that without intimate knowledge about the possibilities of the semiconductors the user also increasingly loses his power of innovation. That is why Dr. Heinz Stephanblome, president of the VDE/VDI Microelektronik company, thinks that the possibility of purchasing chips en masse anywhere on the world market is a dangerous illusion: "Anyone who has integrated circuits developed in the Far East and purchases them -- even if it is through the numerous design and production branches -- will one day have to obtain help with installation, then finished mill bars and finally all their equipment from over there." For with increased integration more and more parts of the systems themselves are migrating to the chip. Says Althoff, "That is why the user needs proximity and confidence in his chip supplier." But Althoff is concerned: "The situation regarding the direct availability of microelectronics is very grim in Germany and indeed all over Europe." The USA (particularly for processors) and Japan (for memory) have clearly emerged as the centers for mass production of highly integrated chips. Only two European manufacturers (Siemens and Thomson) are represented in the top group, and even they only manage to maintain their position "by enormous expenses and cross-funding." Cooperative efforts, like that between the giants Siemens, IBM, and Toshiba, are one answer to the still growing financial burdens of chip development. The trio's new generation of memory storage (256 megabits) will swallow up a billion marks in development costs and two billion marks in production investment. But the Europeans still suffer under the handicap that they have no access to the mass markets and thus to mass production. "In this market it is not only a question of mastering the technical principles -- competitiveness is determined by costs," explains Althoff. But costs are not least a function of wastage, and that in turn depends on practical experience in mass production. But that is where Europe's chip factories are lagging -- when they entered the microelectronics field they were already several generations of circuitry behind and never acquired the production knowhow of the Asiatics. The only area in which they are maintaining good positions is in ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits), the client-specific circuits with generally low outlay and usually not the most current technology. But "the more possibilities the mass processor offers, the more the trend will be towards a standard chip with specialized software. This will make tailor-made circuits less significant." The general secretary of the VDE considers it improbable that German suppliers can close this gap with the production of the specialized software that would then be necessary: "The labor-intensive production of software is already partly passing to low-wage countries. This trend will intensify." The recognition that hardware production, with its capital-intensive, highly automated, and technically extremely demanding hardware production, would be more appropriate for Germany, is now of little use. "Both of them are drifting away at the moment -- and we are in a cleft stick. If motor vehicle electronics, traffic control and high-resolution television -- chip-hungry technologies par excellence -- pass over to Japan in the wake of entertainment electronics, telefax and other parts of communications technology, then we can all go home." He defines the danger for Europeans: "Loss of linkage is a creeping process the results of which we will not feel in their full rigor for another 10 or 15 years. But by then it will be far too late." And there is more: "Losing access to the basic technology of microelectronics would mean losing touch with a whole field of new technologies which are just beginning to develop," Althoff warns. "Anyone who doesn't have microelectronics doesn't have the procedures either." Here he is thinking of micromechanics, which microelectronics production technology uses for the production of tiny pumps or transmissions, and also of the new generations of power electronics components. "Anyone who wants to build a new, rapid locomotive needs power electronics. In international competition it can definitely make a difference if the Japanese get the technical data and ultimately the structural components ito their hands a few months earlier." For example, if micromechanics, with its pioneering application area of medical technology, still a strong German domain, were to be strongly supported in Germany, that would certainly be welcome. But he says, "That will only help for the period of development. Afterwards we will again need mastery of mass technology -- for instance a pump the size of the head of a pin with which you could administer insulin within the body has to be produced in great numbers." At the moment Althoff sees the way out of the cleft stick only in the political sphere: "We need a stronger technology policy, even a kind of industrial policy, if we want to plot a course for survival in time." He says that a whole package is needed, including tax advantages, help in forming pools in the production area and in the organization of sales with the goal of large inventories, and the removal of unnecessary obstacles. MITI still intervenes in the production cycle with specific objectives; American microelectronics obtain many incentives and financial resources from the military, their bulk purchaser: "We Europeans cannot hold back." He says that the EC is pursuing a more or less unclear policy in this area, one which makes life more difficult than necessary for the microelectronics industry. As an example Althoff cites the long-drawn-out normalization process in the new areas of communications technology (mobile radio, radio data transmission): "If these things had proceeded more systematically for European industry we would have been able to achieve larger market shares." For Germany in particular he wishes for improved acceptance of technology: "Instead of stirring up fears and allowing data protection to score theoretical triumphs, those in authority would do better to get rid of obstacles and over-regulation."
