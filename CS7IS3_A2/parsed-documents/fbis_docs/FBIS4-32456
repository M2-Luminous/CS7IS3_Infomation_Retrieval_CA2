This was also confirmed by Lieutenant Colonel Marinko Gajic, deputy commander of the Serbian army of Krajina, who explained the move as a measure of caution against increased Croatian threats to the effect that they would forcibly capture the water springs in this village. The source supplying Benkovac with water has been controlled by the Serbian army of Krajina until recently, but became part of the so-called zone of separation in accordance with the Zagreb agreement. This area is now under the jurisdiction of UNPROFOR's [UN Protection Force] Canadian battalion. Allan Roberts, spokesman for Sector South, told TANJUG's correspondent that the situation is being assessed "very carefully," and that consultations are being conducted at the moment, "so nothing specific can be said."
