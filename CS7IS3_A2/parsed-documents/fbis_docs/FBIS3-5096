Mr. Hata, what do you think of the U.S. decision to revive the Super 301 provision of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act? [Hata] For a long time, there have been moves among U.S. congressmen to submit a bill to revive the Super 301 provision. At the same time, the U.S. Administration has maintained that it would be better to issue a presidential executive order rather than enacting the bill in Congress. It has been reported since last month or earlier that the administration would decide to revive the Super 301 provision. [Kawabata] Do you mean that the Japanese Government has anticipated the revival of the Super 301 provision? [Hata] Yes, yes. The idea of reviving the Super 301 provision has been around in the United States for a while. The latest step the U.S. Government has taken is a procedure to revive the Super 301 provision. It is said that the revival of the Super 301 provision targets Japan because the Japan-U.S. framework talks ended in a breakdown, but it is not true. Our understanding is that the revived Super 301 provision will be applied to all other nations and will not target any specific nations. [Mochitsuki] Mr. Hata, U.S. Trade Representative Kantor has unequivocally told a news conference that the Japanese market is very closed. Has the United States decided to revive the Super 301 provision with Japan in mind? [Hata] Americans already have in mind that Japan is the top surplus nation among trade partners of the United States. In that sense, I think there are many venues for the United States to discuss the trade issue with Japan. For the United States, Japan is its second largest trade partner, second to Canada. Japan's imports from the United States equal the imports of France, Britain, and Germany combined from that country. I believe Japan is an important trade partner for the United States. [Watanabe] Mr. Hata, we just had a discussion in this studio. What do you think of a six-month moratorium for negotiations? [Hata] I think the United States probably intends to set a direction of settling the trade dispute within six months. My understanding is that the terms of the Super 301 provision are more reasonable than the past terms. In this connection, the Uruguay Round of GATT was recently concluded, and a new trade organization called the World Trade Organization will be created. Various trade disputes will be settled by the new trade organization, and this is an international rule for negotiating trade disputes. The United States intends to settle bilateral trade issues through the revival of the Super 301 provision after the Uruguay Round has just concluded. We deeply regret the revival of the Super 301 provision by the United States. [Mochitsuki] In reality, the Japan-U.S. framework talks ended in a breakdown. I think the talks did not end, but they should be resumed in the future. Japan is said to be ready to discuss the issue of numerical targets with the United States. [Hata] Yes. [Mochitsuki] What do you see as the prospects of such talks? [Hata] The moment the Japan-U.S. framework talks ended in breakdown, what I told officials from ministries and agencies was that, despite the breakdown of the Japan-U.S. framework talks, they should not be careless. I also told them that Japan is the world's largest trade surplus nation, and this is a problem, and opening the Japanese market will make the people's lives affluent. Japan should work to voluntarily open its market. The prime minister returned to Japan with the same idea. He called in cabinet members the day after he returned to Japan. Recently, key cabinet members met to agree to map out a package of measures in March to open the Japanese market. [Kawabata] If the United States raises the issue of numerical targets in future negotiations, will Japan say no to them again? [Hata] Rather than us saying no, U.S. Trade Representative Kantor has not said that numerical targets should be a yardstick and only one means to measure bilateral trade. [sentence as heard] The Hosokawa cabinet intends to promote administrative reform and deregulation. In other words, the cabinet is moving toward keeping it from intervening in the activities of the private sector. Japan, therefore, has told the United States that setting such numerical targets is no good at a time when the Japanese Government is making such moves. Japan also told the United States that setting such numerical targets would disrupt free trade and the Uruguay Round has just concluded. I am confident that the issue of the numerical targets will undoubtedly be resolved if the two countries trust each other and fully understand each other's recent actions. There are some other trade issues between the two countries. I think negotiations between the two countries on such trade issues as the insurance sector and government procurement came closer to agreement. I believe an agreement will be hammered out through negotiation. I believe the two countries should do so. [Kawabata] I would like to ask about future Japan-U.S. relations. Do you think that the breakdown of the Japan-U.S. framework talks has prompted the U.S. Administration to decide to revive the Super 301 provision? [Hata] I do not think so. I do not think that the U.S. Administration has decided to issue the presidential executive order because of the breakdown of the framework talks. [Kawabata] Some are pointing out that the revival of the Super 301 provision would affect not only bilateral economic issues, but all Japan-U.S. relations. [Hata] During a meeting with me, Mr. Kantor told me that although the Japan-U.S. framework talks ended in a breakdown, the United States has experienced many breakdowns in trade talks with European nations and Canada. Mr. Kantor also told me: Mr. Hata, do not worry about the breakdown of the Japan-U.S. framework talks. Mr. Kantor went on to said to me: No matter how well security, political, and international cooperation goes, bilateral economic issues will trigger frustrations among Americans. The bilateral economic issues will hurt bilateral relations. The two countries should settle the economic issues. He and I feared that if the economic issues are not settled, this would create a rift in relations between the two countries. I hope to resolve the economic issues in one way or another. An agreement document was exchanged between the prime minister and the President on cooperation between Japan and the United States in tackling environmental problems, the population issue, and AIDS. [Kawabata] I would like to ask about how the Japanese Government will deal with the revival of the Super 301 provision. In past negotiations on the Super 301 provision, Japan avoided facing sanctions from the United States by making concessions to the Untied States. Will Japan make concessions to the United States again? [Hata] No, Japan will not make concessions to the United States. The United States has not decided to revive the Super 301 provision to target Japan. I hope the two countries will discuss their trade issues in the WTO. My frank feeling is that the United States should have been cautious about reviving the Super 301 provision. [Tsuruo] The government intends to map out a package of measures on its own to relax the bureaucratic regulations and open the Japanese market. This package will be mapped out, but it is often said that bureaucrats are strongly resisting the relaxation of bureaucratic regulations. Mr. Hata, will Prime Minister Hosokawa display his leadership? [Hata] We are talking with various bureaucrats. Politicians and bureaucrats realize that if Japan is left untouched, it would be able to do nothing. The people are also realizing that deregulation will raise their living standard. Deregulation will create new projects, and the people are realizing that. I am confident that bureaucrats will work for deregulation, and I can say there will be no problem. Prime Minister Hosokawa is working on the issue with a firm resolve. I believe that deregulation will bring about a tangible effect. The United States intends to sell its goods in Japan and gain access to the Japanese market, and other nations intend to do so too. Japan should open its market to those nations and compete with them. I think that Japan cannot bypass this. [Kawabata] The government will map out a package of measures in March. Would you specify them? [Hata] I cannot specify them since the government is now working on them. [Tsuruo] Mr. Hata, what do you expect from private enterprises? [Hata] Private enterprises should be determined to compete with foreign firms. Private enterprises should purchase their goods from many foreign firms. If they make effort to that end, their efforts will be understood in the international community. [Kawabata] Mr. Hata, thank you very much for appearing on our interview program.
