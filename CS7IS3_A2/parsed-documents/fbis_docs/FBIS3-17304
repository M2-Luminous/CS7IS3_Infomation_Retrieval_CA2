In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday [23 March], he said that there are good prospects for such cooperation, especially for joint modernization of old military equipment. We should look for ways of cooperating in the military-industrial field. It would have been difficult to imagine this cooperation five years ago, but today it is quite possible. We made our first contacts at aerospace salons in Singapore and Paris and we should also use the [current] FIDAE-94 [expansion unknown] [exhibition]. We still do not know each other well. In the military-industrial sphere, we could start by exchanging information, David Shoval said. All of Israel's state, private, and mixed enterprises producing arms and military equipment are subordinated to the directorate headed by Retired General D. Shoval, which controls all of Israel's military exports. Retired General Shoval is in Santiago as one of the heads of the Israeli delegation at the international FIDAE-94 aerospace exhibition. On show from Israel's military industry are military trucks and service trucks, electronic arms, land, air and sea firing systems, and small arms weapons. According to the [retired] general, the most promising developments are in the field of infrared apparatus, [examples of which are] on show at the exhibition. Currently, nearly 80 percent of Israel's military production is exported, some going to South America, said David Shoval. During the exhibition, a deal was struck with Chile for the delivery of service vehicles for the Carbineers Corps. At the same time, military budgets are being reduced in practically all countries of the world and Israel is no exception. As a result, some of our enterprises have started to modernize old equipment and weapons and are cooperating with a number of foreign firms in this. We could begin such cooperation with Russia, in particular, by renovating the close-range MIG-21 fighters. "You have high technology, while we could install modern electronic equipment in old planes. Currently, thousands of old MIG's are out of use. If we brighten them up, it could be a mutually profitable business," David Shoval said.
