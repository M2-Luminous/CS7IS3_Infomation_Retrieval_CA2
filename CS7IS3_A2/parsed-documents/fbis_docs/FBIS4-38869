This information leaked out of the Council chamber where the question is being debated behind closed doors today. Boris Yeltsin's letter to the Federation Council stresses that the cessation of hostilities in Abkhazia and the signing of a cease-fire agreement and on separating the warring sides was achieved through the active involvement of Russia. However, the situation in the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict area remains "explosive". It has become clear that "without the deployment of peacemaking troops it is not possible" to effectively monitor observation of the agreements and the return of refugees, the letter says. The request to conduct peacekeeping operations in Abkhazia is contained in appeals by Shevardnadze and Ardzinba to the Russian Federation president in his capacity as chairman of the Council of CIS Heads of State. Boris Yeltsin's opinion is that peacekeeping would conform to the UN standards for this kind of action. The CIS heads of states' decision will be conveyed to the Security Council, which is being offered a UN observers' mission with the peacekeeping forces. It is remembered, the letter says, that "the basis for the CIS peacekeeping forces will be a reinforced contingent of Russian troops deployed at units already located in Georgia." Boris Yeltsin said he hopes that the Federation Council "will support Russia's peacekeeping efforts within the scope of its authority." However, according to preliminary figures, when the decision was put to the ballot it gained one vote less than the required number.
