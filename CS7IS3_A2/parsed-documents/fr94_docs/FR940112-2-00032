Ozark states that the filing is a general rate case submitted principally to comply with the terms of Ozark's settlement in Docket No. RP84&hyph;53. The filing reflects a base period encompassing the twelve months ending October 31, 1993, adjusted for known and measurable changes through the nine month period ending July 31, 1994.

Ozark states that copies of the filing were served upon Ozark's jurisdictional customers and interested state regulatory agencies. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with §§385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure. All such motions and protests should be filed on or before January 13, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding.
