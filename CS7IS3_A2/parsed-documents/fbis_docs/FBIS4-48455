FBIS4-48455 "drafr097_c_94007" FBIS-AFR-94-097 Daily Report 18 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA IEC Denies Political `Haggling' Followed Election Rsults IEC Denies Political `Haggling' Followed Election Rsults MB1805202794 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1925 GMT 18 May 94 MB1805202794 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] Johannesburg May 18 SAPA -- Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] Chairman Judge Johann Kriegler said on Wednesday he would be available to run South Africa's next election if he was asked. The judge was speaking at the IEC's final media briefing at the IEC's Johannesburg headquarters on Wednesday. He made his remarks as several hundred election monitors gathered outside the IEC's offices demanding a bonus of up to 7,000 R[rand] each for overtime worked and for having helped to provide a free and fair election. The day-long demonstration was just one of several that have occurred throughout the country in the wake of an election characterised by chaos and allegations of irregularities. The judge said he would recommend that a skeleton IEC be kept running until the next elections due in 1999 and that these elections should not be run by a government department. He said it was imperative that a voters' roll be prepared. Asked whether he would be available to run the next elections, Mr. Kriegler said: "Yes, if they want me again. I think I've learnt too much to fall down the drain. If they are unwise enough to ask me again, I would probably be available," he said. Mr Kriegler said he wanted to clear any mispreceptions that the final result came from haggling between the political parties and not from the IEC's own counting efforts. He said while parties had entered discussions on irregularities, the final results reflected what the IEC had counted. "The results we announced were totally and wholly based on our own count through our backup system," he said. His deputy, Pretoria Advocate Dikgang Moseneke, said he would not be available to help with the next elections. "It was a challenging job and we enjoyed it," he said. He said the IEC had delivered to South Africa a new president and a new parliament. "We did it," he said. Mr Moseneke, meanwhile, has been offered election monitoring posts in countries around the world, among them Mozambique, Denmark and Malawi. The IEC will prepare a final electoral and financial report by the end of June.
