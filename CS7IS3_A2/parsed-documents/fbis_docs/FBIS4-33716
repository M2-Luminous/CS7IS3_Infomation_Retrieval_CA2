The confirmation was made during a nearly two-hour meeting with Senator Eduardo Suplicy (PT-SP) [Workers Party -- Sao Paulo], PT deputies and representatives, and MST leaders. The admiral showed the report but did not permit anyone present to touch it. He read parts of it to confirm his guarantees that the content did not have any ideological or electoral biases. The minister stressed that the government has been internally hurt by the leak of the report. Another top-level government official said there has been a decision to find the person who leaked the document. According to PT attorney Luiz Eduardo Greenhalgh, who also participated in the meeting, Flores emphasized that the SAE is not interested in meddling in electoral problems because it is a consultation body for the president of the Republic. Flores denied that the movement has been given the dimension of a guerrilla movement and attributed the section of the document claiming there was a paramilitary training camp in Ranch Ipojuca, in Pernambuco, to obsolete evidence. He also made clear that the references made about the ranch were based on "reports" (unconfirmed facts) of something that occurred in the past. The minister characterized the press' dissemination of the report as "inflationary paranoia." Minister Flores told Landless Movement representatives that the SAE had the legal obligation to write reports on social movements such as the MST for the president. The document's dissemination forced Flores to explain the matter to the president the day after the document's first part appeared in the press. Gilmar Gerardo Mauro, one of the MST leaders, said that during the meeting Flores explained that the document only contained an explanation of the organization and its area of influence. Gilmar Mauro said at the meeting's end that he was convinced the MST "has nothing to do" with what it was attributed to them in the document. For him, the dissemination of that type of information "only increases tensions in rural areas." The MST leader also said he invited Minister Flores to visit Cacador University, which, according to him, is a training center where all types of courses and currents, including pastoral politics, are taught.
