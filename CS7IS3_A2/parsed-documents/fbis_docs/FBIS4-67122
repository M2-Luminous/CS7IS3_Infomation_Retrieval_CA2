The drugs were smuggled to Greece through the river Evros by a 39-year-old Turkish casino owner, Deniz Ozkan, and were handed over to his compatriot, escaped from a Patras prison last February. "He was on a five-day leave, as the law provides, but he never returned to the jail," Khristos Keramidas, Attiki's security police chief, told reporters. A few days ago, officers of the drug squad spotted the escaped prisoner in Passalimani, Piraeus. They followed him and found out that he was being hidden by a Greek convicted drug dealer Khristos Peroutseas, aged 36. The police stormed his apartment yesterday and arrested the two men, discovering one and a half kilos of heroin.
