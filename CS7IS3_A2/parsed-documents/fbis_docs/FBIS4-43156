First, the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] is experiencing an uplift; on the other hand, chancellor candidate [Rudolf] Scharping's Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] is in heavy turbulence. Second, the adventurous victory procession of the Republikaner is over. Third, the Greens are taking over the role of the Free Democratic Party [FDP] as the third strongest party of the Republic. The CDU is quite obviously benefiting from the improved economic situation and from Helmut Kohl's authority in European politics. The Greens are winning thanks to a clear opposition policy. The SPD is hardly likely to gain any consolation from the communal elections for the disaster of the European Parliament elections, says SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG. The SAECHSISCHE ZEITUNG of Dresden says: Nothing has been decided yet in the German superelection year. In the 126 days left until the Bundestag election, literally everything is possible. That is the main message of the European Parliament election, despite the clear victory of the CDU/CSU and the equally clear defeat of the SPD. If people had voted in October the way they did yesterday, the CDU/CSU would not have been able to govern in the way it does now. Its partner, the FDP, would not have attained the 5-percent threshold. In such a case, it could only have governed together with the Alliance 90/Greens, which is absolutely improbable, or entered into a grand coalition with the Social Democrats under a new Helmut Kohl chancellorship. But, in that case, an alliance of the SPD with the Alliance 90/Greens would have been more probable, claims the SAECHSISCHE ZEITUNG. The LEIPZIGER VOLKSZEITUNG views things thus: The heirs of the SED [Socialist Unity Party of Germany] are clearly profiting from the economic problems; they are finding support above all among those who have lost out on the change, especially the unemployed. In addition, they have succeeded in representing themselves as a kind of red CSU, the only eastern party to do so. Many in the west will fail to understand this, but they will have to live with this eastern German viewpoint and this party, though it remains to be seen whether it will enter the Bundestag. DIE WELT of Berlin says: Chancellor Kohl is experiencing a driving force for the decisive battle for the Bundestag in the autumn. Obviously his CDU has succeeded in overcoming the depression of the beginning of the year and stopping the advancement of the parties situated to its right. Right now, the rickety coalition partner FDP seems to be the only risk to his government's future. Challenger Scharping's bid for power is already pausing before it is ready to take a swing. His SPD had to witness the disastrous march of the SED's heir PDS [Democratic Socialist Party] in the east and the rise of the Greens in the west, which are on its left, says DIE WELT. The BRAUNSCHWEIGER ZEITUNG comments as follows: While the SPD possesses a willing coalition partner in the surprisingly strengthened Greens, whose admission to the Bundestag now seems sure, the FDP's stroke of bad luck is continuing. In the end, although Helmut Kohl could end up an election winner in October, he might not have a coalition partner, and would thus end up the loser after all. This imminent insecurity is probably clouding the chancellor's pleasure not only with his party's performance, but also with Austria's good election turnout and surprisingly unanimous yes to membership of the European Union, the BRAUNSCHWEIGER ZEITUNG believes. The NEUE OSNABRUECKER ZEITUNG reaches the following conclusion: The strong gains of the PDS, and this must be said with all due clarity, are no glorious chapter for the new laender. Even if they mainly represent a protest, understandable from the point of view of the labor market, it will not be so easy to quickly forget the causes of the economic misery. After all, it was the PDS' political forebears, the autocrats inside the SED, who ruined the former GDR ecologically and economically. To see them as emergency rescuers again is asking for trouble, the OSNABRUECKER ZEITUNG concludes. The KOELNER STADTANZEIGER says that Helmut Kohl is now ahead of Rudolf Scharping as the favorite in the race for the Chancellery. The Free Democrats have once again been catapulted out of the Strasbourg parliament. That is painful for the foreign minister's party. Even so, in the second-vote election campaign, the liberals can still hope to cross the 5-percent threshold in the Bundestag election. After yesterday's vote, the chances of a continuation of the Bonn coalition have even improved markedly, says the KOELNER STADTANZEIGER. Now a quotation from the KOBLENZER RHEIN-ZEITUNG: The upturn for Kohl and his peers, which could be observed parallel to the improved economic situation, is obviously continuing. On the other hand, the extent of the defeat is a disaster for the SPD and, above all, for its chancellor candidate Scharping. This is no longer a question of a slight loss of form that was talked about following Rau's defeat. Now Scharping's entire election strategy is probably at issue, states the RHEIN-ZEITUNG. The RHEIN-PFALZ, which appears in Ludwigshafen, notes: The SPD, lately beset with sudden attacks of weakness, and chancellor candidate Rudolf Scharping, who has acted clumsily once or twice, have made victory easy for the CDU. In addition, Scharping made a strategic error by dealing with almost nothing but labor and employment policy topics in his election campaign. He failed to show how he would handle foreign and security policy in Europe, the RHEIN-PFALZ says.
