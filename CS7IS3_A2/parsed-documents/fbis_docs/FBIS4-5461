FBIS4-5461 "dreas070_m_94009" FBIS-EAS-94-070 Daily Report 10 Apr 1994 Thailand Border Point Closed Temporarily Following Fire Border Point Closed Temporarily Following Fire BK1004090794 Bangkok THE SUNDAY POST in English 10 Apr 94 p 3 BK1004090794 Bangkok THE SUNDAY POST English BFN [Text]Sa Kaeo -- Governor Kasem Chaisit yesterday suspected arson as the cause of the inferno which devastated a border market in Aranyaprathet district Friday night. About 330 stalls and some 60 million baht worth of merchandise were destroyed in the two-hour fire. Fire trucks were unable to get into the market because of the narrow access to the site and some of them had to draw water from toilets to extinguish the blaze. The governor said the arsonists might be Thais or Cambodians who were enraged by the recent action taken by Thai authorities, upon the request of Cambodian officials in Banteay Meanchey Province, to repatriate all Cambodian traders who crossed the border to do business at Talat Rong Khrua. He said he was awaiting the report of police investigation. Emerging from an emergency meeting held yesterday with police and military officers, Governor Kasem said the border point at Khlong Luk-Poipet would be temporarily closed effective as of yesterday. Only authorized officials and aid workers of the United Nations agencies will be allowed to pass through the border. The governor said the closure of the border was necessary for security reasons because of the escalation in fighting between Cambodian factions across the border. He anticipated a rise in cross border smuggling by the so-called "ant army" as a result of the border closure which is expected to cost Thai traders 10 million baht a day in lost business. Several angry Thai traders who lost their property in the fire complained that they did not understand why the military prevented them from going into the market to retrieve their goods as the fire had not yet reached their stalls. Governor Kasem later asked for sympathy from the traders, saying that it was necessary for the troops to ban people from getting into the market in order to prevent "third hand" elements from causing trouble. He also said the scene of the fire was only 200 meters from the border line. Shortly before the fire, three artillery shells, fired from inside Cambodia, exploded behind a Thai military outpost killing two Cambodians and injuring three -- two of them seriously. The injured were rushed to Aranyaprathet district hospital.
