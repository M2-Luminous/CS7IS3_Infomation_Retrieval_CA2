FR940920-2-00062 FR940920-2-00027 These limits are necessary because for any given discharge rate, the dilution of drilling muds and cuttings is not as great in shallow waters as in deeper waters. However, at any particular water depth, greater dilution close to the discharge point will be achieved with a lower discharge rate. These maximum rates will ensure that the water quality standards will not be exceeded at the edge of the 100 meters mixing zone (Tetra Tech, 1994a). Previous permits have allowed the discharge of drilling muds and cuttings between 2 and 5 meters depth. However, computer modeling of the dispersion of the drilling muds conducted for this permit in 2&hyph;5 meters depth did not perform adequately (Tetra Tech, 1994a). The maximum depth of mud accumulation for these cases was 10&hyph;20 times greater than the water depth. Mud accumulations of this magnitude would effectively bury the drilling mud outfall, making any calculation of dilution values meaningless. Accordingly, EPA is proposing zero discharge of muds and cuttings in waters less than 5 meters deep. Areal Restrictions: Discharge of muds and cuttings are prohibited in the following four areas: (a) Between the shore (mainland and barrier islands) and the 5 meters isobath, (b) within 1000 meters of river mouths or deltas during unstable or broken ice or open water conditions, (c) Within 1000 meters of the Stefansson Sound Boulder Patch, and (d) Within 3 miles of Kasegaluk Lagoon or the passes of Kasegaluk Lagoon. For the specific requirements, see Parts II.A.3. of the permit. In accordance with 40 CFR 125.123 (c), the Director has prohibited these discharges because the Region has determined they may cause unreasonable degradation of the marine environment. Prohibition (a) has changed from previous permits as described in the previous section of this fact sheet. Prohibitions (b) and (c) are contained in the previous Beaufort Sea NPDES general permits (49 FR 23734, June 7, 1984 and 53 FR 37846, September 28, 1988). This is the first time that a provision concerning Kasegaluk Lagoon has been included in a general permit for offshore oil and gas exploration since the area has never been covered by an NPDES permit for exploratory oil and gas operations. With regard to (a) and (b) above, EPA has extensively studied the nearshore zone of the Alaskan Beaufort Sea in several Ocean Discharge Criteria Evaluations (Tetra Tech, 1994a; Jones & Stokes, 1983, 1984). These evaluations have clearly shown that these nearshore areas provide important feeding and migratory habitat for a large number of species including fish, waterfowl, and mammals. Further, these areas provide essential feeding and preferred habitat for species of major importance for subsistence and commercial fisheries. Concerning (c) above, the proposed permit does not authorize discharges within 1000 meters of the Stefansson Sound Boulder Patch as defined by Dunton et al. (1982). The ``Patch'' is a rare and unique biological community that is susceptible to adverse effects caused by discharged drilling muds and cuttings. As noted in (d) above, the proposed permit restricts activity near Kasegaluk Lagoon and its barrier island system. Specifically discharge is prohibited within Kasegaluk Lagoon and in the waters within 3 miles of the following passes intensively used by the beluga whales: Kukpowruk Pass, Akunik Pass, Utukok Pass, Icy Cape Pass, and Alokiakatat Pass. This restriction is in accordance with the North Slope Borough's Coastal Management Program (NSB, 1988). The NSB recognizes Kasegaluk Lagoon as a Candidate Area Meriting Special Attention (AMSA) and imposes the above restrictions. Kasegaluk Lagoon extends for approximately 140 miles along the Chukchi Sea coast. About 90 miles of the lagoon is south of Icy Cape and the rest is north of Icy Cape. Kasegaluk Lagoon is located in state waters of the Chukchi Sea and provides important habitat for spotted seals and beluga whales. Beluga whales are known to feed, calve and may molt in this lagoon (North Slope Borough, 1988; Frost and Lowry, 1993; Tetra Tech, 1994a). Spotted seals also calve in Kasegaluk Lagoon (NSB, 1988). The lagoon also provides important feeding, migrating, and rearing areas for marine and anadromous fish, as well as migratory birds. Kasegaluk Lagoon, the barrier islands, and the nearshore waters seaward of the barrier islands are an important subsistence area for the villagers of Point Lay (NSB, 1988). Subsistence activities that occur seasonally in the Kasegaluk Lagoon Candidate AMSA area include egg gathering, waterfowl hunting, sealing, fishing, walrus hunting, and whaling for belugas. This proposed permit and the Borough's management program recognizes the importance of the area for marine mammals, seabirds, and subsistence activities.
