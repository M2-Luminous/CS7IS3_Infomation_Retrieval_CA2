After graduating from the Law Department of Tokyo University, he entered the Ministry of Construction. After temporary transfers to Ibaragi Prefecture, Hyogo Prefecture, and the National Land Agency, he became Economic Affairs Bureau director general in 1988 and director of the Secretariat in 1990. He has held his present post since July 1993. Problems with bidding on public works have led to the arrest of regional government leaders and top executives of the nation's major construction companies. "The cause of the scandal lies in both defects of the system and the way the system is operated," said Vice Minister of Construction Shigeo Mochizuki, whose ministry is in charge of supervising public works bidding. Vice Minister Mochizuki was interviewed about bidding and other matters. Problems of the System and Problems of Its Management [Oguni] Recently, problems have been occurring so rapidly, one after another, that you almost get the impression that the entire Japanese archipelago has been completely contaminated by the corruption of construction companies. What do you think of the situation? [Mochizuki] I don't have the words to express how irritated I am by it. I'm thoroughly exasperated. The majority of the 520,000 companies and 6 million workers in the construction industry do their work honestly and seriously. With this kind of corruption scandal, though, the entire industry gets criticized, and that, the administration and I feel, is intolerable. One other thing. Since last year we've come out with almost 30 trillion yen in economic stimulus measures. Most, though, involve construction investment and public works that are to be carried out by the companies that have caused the scandal. As a result, the stimulus measures are not necessarily progressing very smoothly, as can be seen at some of the [construction] sites. [Oguni] First, about the role of the Ministry of Construction as the supervisory agency for bidding. If corruption exists to this extent, it means that, as you've said, there are problems in the bidding system, as a result of which you're studying open public bidding under certain conditions. In this process, what is your main focus? [Mochizuki] It's a fact that various things about the bidding system are now being questioned. However, I don't think that [the problems with] the bidding system and the current series of scandals are directly linked on an equal, one-to-one basis. The reasons for the scandals are, first, problems with the system, and second, the way the system is managed--in other words, problems with the morals of those who commission and those who are commissioned to do public works. The scandals occurred, I think, because these various problems having become so pervasive. Therefore, I don't think that the system is responsible for everything, although, when you look at it calmly, it does contain elements that contribute to the occurrence of such scandals, and those elements have to be corrected. That is the main focus. In Japan, ever since the Public Accounting Act of 1899, open public bidding has been the guiding principle on the books. However, it has come about that, especially in cases where there are special circumstances, a system of designated bidding is used. On the other hand, the contracts related to commissioning public works are different than those for buying and selling goods. When the contract is made, there are no products. The problem is thus how to guarantee that what the commissioning party wants will be finished within the work period, will be inexpensive, and will have the desired quality. Therefore, in a competitive system, the commissioning party, to get excellent work at a price as low as possible, will choose companies whose abilities can be trusted and get them to compete against each other for the work. That, based on our experience, is what has been found to be most appropriate. It's what the central and local governments and the related agencies have been doing. Actually, after the war, based on a directive from GHQ [Allied General Headquarters], Japan National Railways used open public bidding. The result was terrible problems and a very bitter experience. Since the bidding was free and open, all kinds of companies entered: ones with construction ability and ones without. To be more precise, there were irresponsible companies and front companies. Careless work was continually being done, so, to prevent it, it was necessary to employ an enormous number of supervisors and so on. In any case, it was a bitter experience. And due to experiences like that, we have come to use designated competitive bidding. That said, however, it is coming to be seen, from these latest scandals, that designated bidding has been conducted under the illusion that it is the commissioning party that has the power. Therefore, we have to rethink both the system and the way it is managed. So we're studying a system of open bidding conducted under certain conditions. However, the conditions would have to be able to guarantee such things as that reliable companies got the work and did it according to the desired specifications. The conditions would have to be objective; no arbitrariness could be allowed in. In this connection, we are currently attempting to introduce a new contract system. The Bitter Experience of Interference by Gangster Organizations [Oguni] What I keep thinking as I'm listening is, Why did you go to a system of designated bidders? Vice minister, you spoke in rather muted terms about the experience with companies that didn't fulfill the required conditions, but still participated in open bidding. To put it more bluntly, weren't those companies gangster organizations? [Mochizuki] Yes, there were those, and also paper companies. To put it briefly, it's a fact there was a bitter experience with ill-mannered companies, or company-like organizations, that interfered. [Oguni] Would there be a danger of that happening today if you had a completely open system of bidding? [Mochizuki] If we made the qualifications for participating in bidding such that companies without technical ability--I'm not just talking about gangster organizations--could participate, the overwhelming majority of serious companies would suffer and enormous confusion would result--which would not be in the best interests of the country. [Oguni] Even so, with a system of designated bidding there's the problem that it's hard for new companies to participate unless they make a considerable [preliminary] effort. That has especially been the situation for foreign companies. [Mochizuki] As you say, this is a big problem. How do you tell whether a company is reliable? The easiest way is from its track record. In the case of domestic companies, we can see their total record--not just their public works construction, but their private sector construction as well--so in that sense our approach are not exclusionary. Regarding the participation of foreign companies, though, you can't but doubt the logic of only looking at a company's record of work done inside Japan when Japanese markets have been internationalized. I think it is necessary to think about a more flexible, realistic system for evaluating companies. [Oguni] If it comes about that, in principle, the system is open except for some basic standards that have to be met and those standards are transparent, then the current situation will change considerably, won't it? [Mochizuki] Yes, probably. But I would like to emphasize that our position is not to try to bring about open public bidding, under certain conditions, for all public works. For example, in the case of regional public works, if you consider such things as the policy for helping small and medium-sized companies or the speed needed in recovering from a disaster, it's better to use companies that are closely linked to the region. However, for work like that which the major construction companies do and which has become the subject of an international problem, I think that open public bidding with conditions is better. Looking at examples from overseas, every country uses a bidding system geared to its particular circumstances. The U.S. system is said to be the freest. England used to have open bidding, but at a certain point they changed to designated bidding. The other main European countries have a system somewhere between the American and the British. However, even in the United States, which is said to have the freest system, a company's qualifications are strictly investigated. In the Japanese system of designated competitive bidding, an investigation is carried out at the beginning of the bidding process, whereas in the U.S. system it is at the end--as a result of having submitted a bid--that a check is rigorously carried out. In Japan, we have been conducting, since September, open public bidding on a trial basis with regard to more than 1 billion yen's worth of construction. To introduce it in earnest in the future, though, we would first have to put various systems in order. There's the problem of the registration system and ranking, and whether the methods of accident investigation and management investigation that have been used until now are fine as is or have to be adjusted and made more transparent. [Oguni] Then there's the problem of the way the system is managed. In the commissioning of public works, doesn't the party that gives the commission have an enormous amount of power? Wouldn't it be possible to make a little more equal the one-sidedness of the relationship between the commissioning party and commissioned party? [Mochizuki] It's just as you say. If there's not a relationship of equality, then the contract between the two parties won't be fair. Designating is not a power; it is a duty to the people. As persons who use the people's taxes, we are in the position of acting for the people when we designate bidders. Therefore, there must be no arbitrariness involved [in the designation process]. Otherwise, the relationship between us, the commissioning party and the commissioned party, will be one-sided. To give an example, there's the problem of companies that are designated to bid, but come to not want to bid but still have difficulty refusing to bid. In projects directly under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Construction, companies are free to refuse to be designated, and the same goes for the prefectures and the cities, towns, and villages. But if a company thinks, "If we withdraw, then we'll be treated badly and have trouble the next time around," it will not refuse. If we place ourselves in the position that the act of designating is not a matter of power but a duty, a responsibility, to the people, then the system will naturally change. For example, at the Ministry of Construction eight standards are used when designating a bidder (designation standards). Recently, those standards were made concrete and objective. In other words, we should adopt designation standards and make them open. In short, we have our own standards and we will be bound by them. Lack of Transparency in Cities, Towns, and Villages [Mochizuki] Recently, however, we examined the situation in the prefectures and in cities, towns, and villages, and found that some have designation standards and some don't. Only one of every four cities and one of every six towns and villages has standards and has made them public. We want this situation to be changed. The Ministry of Construction makes its designation process and the names of successful bidders public, but the cities, towns, and villages don't; it's a bad situation. [Oguni] Another thing. There is a "work completion guarantor system" that provides that, if the company that was number one in the bidding is unable to complete the work, the company that entered the second-place or the third-place bid will assume responsibility and undertake the work. But doesn't that create a "dango" atmosphere [an atmosphere that invites collusion]?" [Mochizuki] The bidders lower than second or third place don't win because they can't do the work inexpensively, so you can't expect them to stand surety for a company that can do it inexpensively. There used to be an element of mutual assistance to this system; [guarantor companies] had a sense like that of a loan guarantor who won't let a project be abandoned half way. Due to the way the society has become, however, the system has developed problems. Therefore, about two years ago, the Ministry of Construction revised its policy of choosing the work completion guarantor from among the designated bidders, to one of choosing from a broad range of companies that are at least the equal of the winning bidder. It is said that the work completion guarantor is chosen from the designated bidders in 17 percent of cities and 42 percent--an extremely high frequency--of towns and villages. This is an enormous problem. But from the commissioning party's point of view, if companies are ranked A, B, C, D, and E and you have B-class work guaranteed by a C- or D-ranked company, you're worried. So in that sense, these practices are easy to understand. But saying "Choose the guarantor from among the designated bidders" can promote "dango," and that has to be eliminated. [Oguni] Then there is the problem of human relationships. Friends who studied together in college, or perhaps had an upper classman/lower classman [senpai/kohai] relationship there, go to work, one as a technical official in the Ministry of Construction, the other in a general construction company. Also, when technical officials reach a certain age, they receive a post-retirement appointment [amakudari] in a general construction company. Because they've associated with each other since they were young, they might not realize how cliquish they are, but it seems to me that their relationships are a breeding ground for cliquism. What do you think? [Mochizuki] That view is often expressed these days, but for me it's painful to hear. A person naturally values throughout his life the people with whom he went to college. To deny it would be untrue. The point is, though, we are public servants, and we are aware of ourselves as such. To behave according to personal ideas and feelings--cliquism--is, in a word, impermissible. Using the Scandal as an Opportunity To Straighten Up [Oguni] So you can't tell a friend what to do? [Mochizuki] No, we can't. A system of civil servants cannot function properly if a person uses his position to pursue even the slightest personal interest, such as trying to get on good terms with a company for when he golden parachutes out of the government. Until now, when an official from the Ministry of Construction has retired and then gone to work at a general construction company, the company has had to sign an oath saying, "We won't involve him in business related to government agencies." As to what actually happens, however... Enforcement of the oath has been a topic of concern. [Oguni] Until now I've been asking about the relationship between civil servants and the private sector, but there is one other relationship: that between the commissioning party [civil servants] and politicians. All things considered, [civil servants] are in a strong position, but isn't the position of politicians even stronger? Companies use various means to influence politicians and make demands of them, which can result in bribery cases. The one-party rule of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] has ended and the political situation has changed, but what will happen with the relationship between bureaucrats (civil servants) and politicians? [Mochizuki] With regard to the work under the direct jurisdiction of the Ministry of Construction, I am certain that there is no intervention by politicians in the commissioning process. We have a Designation Investigation Committee whose chairman is not chosen in an election but is rather a civil servant--the head of a regional construction bureau or of a construction work office. As far as I know, the committee members have never instructed the officials in charge of designation to do this or do that. In particular, with regard to the public works worth 1 billion yen or more (work for the major construction companies), a committee chaired by the the vice minister double-checks the work of the Designation Investigation Committee. So the original plan is almost never changed. Perhaps civil servants related to the commissioning of public works and politicians related to it have different standpoints, although that's just a personal opinion of mine---because governors, as well as the mayors of cities, towns and villages, are both civil servants and politicians. So I wouldn't want to speak carelessly about different standpoints. But, in any case, what is important is having designation standards and having a Designation Investigation Committee and establishing total transparency. This latest scandal has been taken very hard, and seen as shocking, by everybody involved in commissioning public works. These problems existed before the changeover to the new government. However, the idea that it is time to straighten one's collar--to fix what's wrong with the system--now needs to become stronger than ever. At the Ministry of Construction, we will get the views of people in all fields and tackle the problems with determination.
