Keri report: "If the MSZP Forms the Government, the MDF Will Not Have a Place in It, Gyula Horn, Leader of the Socialists Says"] [Text] I do not wish to react to the statements of Viktor Orban [chairman of the Federation of Young Democrats, Fidesz] or other leaders of the Fidesz, Gyula Horn, chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], told our correspondent. As is known, Orban recently said that the parliamentary parties had made a mistake by letting the MSZP out of quarantine after two years, and society will suffer for this. Horn also said that if the MSZP came to power, it would be a deception of the electors to take the current Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] back into government. In connection with Orban's statement, Horn noted that he cannot do anything about such statements, but he finds it unfortunate that the Fidesz is adopting the style applied by some of the government parties. This does not suit them, Horn said, and at the same time, he believes that the Young Democrats will still have time to cool down. Rather Than Wrestling, It Is Confidence Gaining Horn does not believe Prime Minister Boross, either, who said that the elections will be decided between the MSZP and the MDF, and the liberal parties will wither away. At the same time, he thinks it possible that, in the long run, the liberal parties will fulfill a political role similar to that in Western Europe. This means that they will be parties with a marked character but smaller social support than they now have. However, Horn certainly does not assume that the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] would not have an important role in the May elections, and its results will be at least as good as those of the MDF. Therefore, Horn sees Boross's statement on this as a simple prediction, one that is solely meant to reassure the MDF, but which is unlikely to increase the number of their votes. About the election prospects, Horn also said that the MSZP is not wrestling with the MDF, but the MSZP would like to gain the confidence of the voters. They would find it desirable if they reached a result that expresses that Hungary does have a European democratic left wing. A left wing -- whether it is in government or opposition -- which cannot be left out of important decisions. This is our fundamental goal, rather than dealing with other parties' predictions of chances, Horn noted. He added that it is their feeling that most of the citizens have already decided for whom to vote, but this will only come to light at election time. Horn finds the increasing coarseness of the election campaign worrying. In reply to our note that a recent UJ MAGYARORSZAG interview called him the "most popular henchman," Horn said that if he took certain articles in the UJ MAGYARORSZAG seriously then he should indeed leave the country. What is published in this newspaper has nothing to do with honest information, he said. He finds it regrettable that newspapers that are presumably supported from state finances can allow themselves to take this tone. According to Horn, in the long run, a solution could be reached in the Hungarian press if all newspapers were privatized after the elections and the readers could then decide through their purchases if newspapers with this style are needed. At the moment, this newspaper can easily survive because its losses, which exist in spite of its declining print-runs, are presumably covered from state resources, he added. As for the so-called opposition press, he noted that, contrary to government propaganda, the MSZP's popularity is not to be attributed to the press. As an example, he also mentioned NEPSZABADSAG, because, as he said, this newspaper was not very good at reporting the MSZP's important proposals and parliamentary statements to the readers. There Is a Witness to Every Lie According to information received by NEPSZABADSAG, government circles have asked the activists of the National Federation of Political Prisoners [POFOSZ] and the Historical Justice Committee [TIB] to seek out evidence and witnesses in connection with Horn's activities in 1956 and 1957. In connection with this, Horn said that it is possible that this kind of action has been started. In his view, it is an old truism that it is always possible to find and pay a "witness" for every lie. In the past four years, they have tried to accuse him of all kinds of acts but all these slanders have proved to be lies. It is possible that new ones will be brought up, and I will reply to them; however, if I receive any very rude insults then I will use my legal rights, he said. According to Horn, it is necessary for the current government to prepare detailed accounts before it gives power to the new cabinet. This is important because, whatever kind of government comes to power, the new parliament must be clear about the country's real financial situation. From an opposition position, we were not able to find out many facts. For example, we do not know what kind of domestic and foreign financial commitments and guarantees the Boross government has taken on. Nor do we know exactly what kind of lasting effects the various government decisions will have and how Hungary's debt-servicing obligations may change. It is important to find all this out because these factors will significantly influence the next government's freedom of movement. This is one of the reasons it is important for the current cabinet to give a true report on the economy's real situation instead of the country being full of the propaganda of success, Horn stated. Should the Boross cabinet decide to distort the reality and deceive the new government and society, this will be discovered very quickly, within a few weeks, Horn said. He is convinced that expert committees will have to uncover the country's real situation while the coalition talks are being held. Social Cooperation Is Needed In Horn's view, after the elections, regardless of the result, social unity will be needed to remove the country from the economic crisis. He said that the other side also has honest people and the loudest people in the parties need not be identified with the given parties. There are many clever and sober people who are free from extremism in this country. Therefore, Horn is convinced that the new parliament and government will have the opportunity to integrate these forces. I am optimistic, and believe that, sooner or later, it will certainly be possible to create social unity in this country, Horn said. Talking about a possible grand coalition, Horn said that it would be equivalent to deceiving the electors if the MSZP, in case it comes to government, retained the MDF in government. However, even if the current government parties are put into opposition, we would like to achieve a normal dialogue and cooperation between the parliamentary parties, Horn said at the end of the interview.
