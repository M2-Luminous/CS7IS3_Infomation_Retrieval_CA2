The petition also asked that Denisov be allowed to leave Estonia unhindered. "The relations between the Estonian Government and the Russian nation in the near future depend on how Denisov's question is solved," Alexander Roshchitsky, the organization's spokesman, claimed. Russia's National Unity maintains that the organization has a fellow feeling for Estonians and wants to develop friendly relations with this nation. The organization claims the Russian people know Denisov as a "defender of the White House and of the Constitution" and regard him as a "national hero." Denisov was detained on Feb. 15 in the northeast Estonian town of Johvi. He worked in the early 1980's in the Kohtla-Jarve police forces. In recent years Denisov fought for the so-called Transdniester Republic in Moldova and was one of former Russian parliament speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov's bodyguards. Denisov arrived in Estonia illegally late in November. Estonian authorities so far have charged him only with illegal possession of firearms. Russia's National Unity has often been named a fascist organization. It is led by Alexander Barkashov, and members of the organization's shock troops are known as "barkashovtsy". In October 1993 "barkashovtsy", whose emblem closely resembles the swastika, defended the White House in Moscow side by side with the hardliners.
