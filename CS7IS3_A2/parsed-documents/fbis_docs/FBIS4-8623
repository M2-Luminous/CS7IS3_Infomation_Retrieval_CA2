They explained this with the stubbornness of the Pale leadership, ignoring the fact that they are only pawns in a big game. This time, too, all strings were in the hands of Belgrade. Milosevic's regime has placed Serbia in the most difficult situation in its long history. The process of turning a country fascist is drawing to an end. The last foreign witnesses, objective correspondents from CNN and AFP, are being removed. Others are also being checked out, if they are there at all. The regime has given up its efforts to improve its image in the eyes of the world public. Who could possibly get involved in that when everything else is going downhill. Objective reporting by foreign media has been declared, we quote, a media war against the Serbian people, end quote. Not against the regime, as it is, but against the people -- something foreign correspondents never insisted on. Serbia has simply found herself in the same situation that Germany was during the Nazi era, Russia during Stalinism, Albania during the time of Enver Hoxha, and Chile during the time of Pinochet, with, of course, much worse internal problems. The project of a greater Serbia, the greatest inspiration for Serbian fascism, has definitely failed, mainly because of a number of military defeats in Bosnia. There are even more troubles in their own home. A new wave of hyperinflation is on its way. This wave will finally destroy the last strongholds of the Serbian economy. The embezzlement of foreign currency from its own citizens is also drawing to an end. It is no longer possible to explain to the people who sold their foreign currency to the banks that these were automatically bought by some new rich men for the freshly printed super dinars, which will soon be completely worthless. To stay in power and divert the people's attention from the insoluble problems, Milosevic had to invent new enemies, much bigger and more dangerous than the previous ones. And who is more suitable at present than the biggest world power, the United States? Belgrade propaganda therefore produced a new puppet show in the public in the sense of (?evil) Americans, persuaded by evil Muslims, treacherously attacked the innocent Serbian people. Of course, they consciously concealed the fact that the action by the United Nations enjoyed the general support of the world and that the Russians complained only because they were not consulted. Vitaliy Churkin was angry because Karadzic's Serbs deceived him and denied their attacks on Gorazde. Moreover, they never mentioned the reasons for the attacks by the allied aircraft. They did not dare say that because of the committed chetnik crimes the world could allow hordes of bloodsuckers enter this suffering town and repeat what they had already done in Zvornik, Visegrad, and Foca.
