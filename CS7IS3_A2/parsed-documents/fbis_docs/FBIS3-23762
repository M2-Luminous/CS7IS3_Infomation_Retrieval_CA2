However, there is only one political figure in the limelight: Oblast Governor Boris Nemtsov. Yet there is another, no less prominent, person there, city mayor Dmitriy Bednyakov. The far from complete list of accomplishments of the city administration includes its privatization program, Russia's first city charter, development of unified banking principles, targeted social assistance, reorganization of residential housing, medical insurance. Today Nizhniy Novgorod is one of the few places in Russia where life is indeed getting better. [Kozlov] Dmitriy Ivanovich, it is no secret that Russia's economy is the aggregate of its regional economies. Since the resignation of Gaydar and Fyodorov all one hears is that the government is, allegedly, veering away from the course of reforms. What is your assessment of what's going on in Moscow from the vantage point of Nizhniy Novgorod? [Bednyakov] As I see it, the changes in the government will least of all affect the state of affairs in Nizhniy Novgorod. Although one cannot say, of course, that they will have no effect at all. If the government goes back to its previous credit policy and starts using the budget to "pump up" enterprises and entire branches of industry, this, doubtlessly, will cause a new surge of inflation, creating headaches for everyone. But all in all, today the regional economy depends on the economic policies pursued by the local authorities. [Kozlov] What, specifically, are the policies of the Nizhniy Novgorod authorities? [Bednyakov] I would note two basic elements. Firstly, there is full support of private enterprise and business expansion. If a person wants to earn money, and can, he should do so, and no one has the right to interfere. Provided, of course, that he doesn't break the law or avoid paying taxes. The second element is sufficiently effective social protection of those segments of the population which need this. These are young people, pensioners, large families, invalids, in short, all those for whom today's life is especially difficult. Balancing these two elements in the framework of a unified economic policy is the main concern of the regional authorities. [Kozlov] Many people say this, but so far successes are rather few. Privatization and joint stock programs are making some progress, but social programs are almost universally failing. Incidentally, Nizhniy Novgorod is known more as a "market beacon," but not a "social beacon." [Bednyakov] Indeed, we were the first in Russia to free bread and milk prices and eliminate coupons for virtually all goods and services. But these moves were invariably accompanied by measures for social protection of the population. Last September we--again the first in Russia--introduced low-income benefits. Last year the maximum subsidy was R23,000. This year it has more than doubled. And that is not counting aid for children, school lunches, etc. I think reforms in Russia will be successful if they have two sufficiently strong "wings": support for entrepreneurship and social protection of the poor. [Kozlov] That is so, but where will the money for this come from? [Bednyakov] There was a time when huge sums were taken daily from the city budget to subsidize milk and bread producers. When we freed the prices of these products considerable sums were made available, which, incidentally, we immediately began to pay out to those who were unable to buy milk and bread at the free prices. And this proved to be fairer. Formerly both rich and poor households received subsidies. Now they are addressed only to those who are unable to make ends meet, that is, the really poor. Incidentally, this helped to "correct" people's mentality noticeably. Now people are concerned not so much with getting low-income benefits for themselves as with the availability of goods on store shelves. I can state confidently that Nizhniy Novgorod already has a mixed economy. The picture is determined not so much by state enterprises as by private and joint ventures. [Kozlov] But Nizhniy Novgorod is also known for former "flagships" of socialist industry, GAZ [Gorkiy Automobile Plant] in the first place. Incidentally, how are things there? [Bednyakov] As of today, a closed sale of shares has been completed, an inter-regional check auction of GAZ shares has been held, and the plant is preparing for its first shareholders' meeting. Now GAZ is an open type joint-stock company. Of course, GAZ, like other large enterprises, is in a very difficult situation. It has to think of new types of products and how to market them. But in my view the situation at GAZ gives no grounds to fear that the plant may come to a halt soon and more than 110,000 workers will be left in the street. Although, of course, the GAZ management could be better. It seems to me that the conflict over GAZ, which has been so widely publicized in the press, is essentially a problem of management and of attracting foreign investment. Of course, Western businessmen do not want to see GAZ as a serious competitor on the market, hence their attitude towards the plant. We shouldn't fool ourselves. One could, of course, replace executives and improve the management, but that is no guarantee that Western monies will start flowing to us. They won't. Although GAZ, of course, definitely needs reforming on both the technological and managerial levels. [Kozlov] Dmitriy Ivanovich, what has the city gained from the once widely advertized privatization program? Do revenues from privatized enterprises contribute significantly to the budget? [Bednyakov] The state has finally given up doing things it wasn't meant to do and stopped controlling everything under the sun. The budget has indeed begun to receive real money, and in significant quantities. Local authorities have finally begun to deal with things all local authorities should: public amenities, roads, public safety, transportation, housing. We began the program with privatization of retail enterprises. Although there was an opposing point of view: to privatize large enterprises first. I think we took the right road. Now there already is a competitive atmosphere in the city. As of today, up to 70 percent of Nizhniy Novgorod's retail enterprises have been privatized. We are operating according to a somewhat unusual scheme: we sell not enterprises, but the assets of liquidated enterprises. The new owner is, thus, not required to rehire former workers. However, if people lose their jobs he must pay benefits. Neither is the new owner responsible for the acquired enterprise's debts. We view privatization like this: The idea is not to sell for the highest possible price, but to sell so that the new owner could start operating efficiently as quickly as possible. [Kozlov] But still, how are things with the privatization of large enterprises? [Bednyakov] In my view, this has not yet taken place. What has been called stock distribution [aktsionirovaniye] is essentially the commercialization of large enterprises. They appear to change the form of ownership, but they still remain state-owned. It seems to me that the country lacks a mechanism for privatizing large enterprises. There is no way to buy and sell large packets of shares of such enterprises quickly. Russia has no normally operating stock market, it still has to be set up. Once there is no way to operate with large packets of shares they fall into the hands of enterprise directors, who use them in their own interests. Real privatization will begin only when a potential large investor will be able to buy a large packet of shares of the enterprise he wants on the stock market. We are currently actively dealing with this problem. I head the oblast commission for organizing a stock market. A new influx of investment into the oblast's economy can come only through the stock market. All other possibilities have, as I see it, been exhausted. [Kozlov] What do you see as the main areas of work this year? [Bednyakov] Questions connected with reorganizing the housing sphere and public utilities. For over a year we have been working on problems of housing subsidies. Because, if monthly payments for housing exceed a certain percentage of a family's total income we must pay people a housing subsidy. From the purely technical point of view we have not yet resolved this question. How to ensure that a person getting this money will spend it solely to pay for housing? It is necessary, thus, to have special "housing" funds. The main task this year is to find a mechanism for reorganizing the housing market that would be fair, effective, and socially protect the majority of the population. We have already developed a special program spanning several years. [Kozlov] And how are matters with insured health care? [Bednyakov] Last year we began an experiment in financing health institutions according to the number of cured patients. It was tried out in several hospitals. It showed that doctors are morally prepared to work more efficiently. The main stumbling block is that as yet there are no political decisions on this score that would be associated with changing budget flows. So far they pass through the health care system, but they should be handled by hospital insurance funds, insurance companies, and so forth. An entire institution of medical insurance agents has to be created. Today it is impossible to approach this problem seriously. But we are moving in the right direction. We are planning to try introducing insured health care on the basis of the GAZ medical department. Doctors will receive budgeted pay, with everything over that coming from the enterprise, depending on the quality of their work. I think the move from free to insured health care should be very careful, without undue haste, but not too slowly, either. [Kozlov] What do you expect in the near future from the government, the president, and the federal assembly? [Bednyakov] The main issues that have to be clarified are taxes and the budget. The revenues of local budgets, in fact the very existence of territories, depend in many ways on the resolution of these questions. There is some apprehension that the new government will pursue a less reformist policy than one would like. Most of all I fear growing inflation, although inflation in itself is not as bad as the fact that the society gets used to it and people blend into the inflationary mechanism. This, doubtlessly, adversely affects all types of economic activity. We are not indifferent to the policies of the government, the president and the federal assembly. But, I repeat, since the reforms began, Russia's regions and territories have grown strong enough to handle many issues independently. Like we do in Nizhniy Novgorod. In that sense I am an optimist. According to the latest polls, 40 to 50 percent of Nizhniy Novgorod inhabitants list themselves as middle class. This gives hope that the reforms in Russia have become irreversible.
