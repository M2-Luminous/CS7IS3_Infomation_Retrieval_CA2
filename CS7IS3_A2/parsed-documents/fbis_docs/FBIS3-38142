She stated this while addressing a crowded news conference at the Congress Media Center of the World Economic Forum in the Swiss city of Davos yesterday. Benazir Bhutto said Pakistan, as a developing country, wants to spend its human resources and limited mineral resources to eradicate poverty, diseases, and illiteracy. The prime minister said Pakistan has really become a suitable country for investments, where foreign investment is not only safe but the percentage of profit is also very high. Investments can be taken out of the country without any hindrance. She said we are relaxing the rules and regulations on economy in order to promote investments in the country and also are lifting the remaining government controls. She said Pakistan is situated geographically on an important location between the newly independent Central Asian states and the Gulf countries and it provides the best and the least expensive route for access to these fast developing markets. Referring to Pakistan's steps for forging close commerical ties with Central Asian states, she said projects are on the anvil to establish rail and road links between Pakistan and Central Asian states. She said investors from Japan, Turkey, and Singapore have offered assistance in these projects. She said Pakistan has come ahead as a democratic, progress-loving, and Islamic nation. The recent elections, which have been recognized at the international level as the most fair and transparent elections in our election history, have made it clear that there is no place for retrograde and conservative tendencies in Pakistani elections. The prime minister made it clear that Pakistan's foreign policy is based on peace and justice in our region and stability in the world. She emphasized that durable peace cannot be established in an atmosphere of injustice, exploitation, and foreign hegemony. Referring to India's continued aggression in Jammu and Kashmir and its atrocities on the Kashmiris, the prime minister said India is constantly negating a meaningful dialogue to resolve this dispute in accordance with UN resolutions, which call for holding a plebiscite. In response to a question on Pakistan-India talks on the Jammu and Kashmir dispute and the support for appeal to observe total strike on 5 February, Ms. Benazir Bhutto said the appeal for a strike has been made to protest against India's continuous aggression on Jammu and Kashmir; its inhuman acts of atrocities on Kashmiri men, women, and children; and lack of initiative from the Indian side to resolve this dispute. She said that she agreed to the secretary-level talks between Pakistan and India as the talks were deadlocked for the past 18 months. This is the first occasion that India held talks on the Kashmir dispute as a separate item of the agenda, but India has not halted the series of atrocities in Jammu and Kashmir. She said Pakistan has earned its independence through political process as well as struggle and hence it cannot keep aloof from the struggle of the Kashmiris to realize their right of self-determination. India is also committing gross human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir. These facts prove that India is not desirous of any sort of initiative for resolving the Kashmir dispute. That is why an appeal has been made to observe total strike in Pakistan, Azad Kashmir, and occupied Kashmir [as heard]. Ms. Benazir Bhutto said Pakistan wants the resolution of this dispute on the basis of UN resolutions as it supports the objectives and activities of the United Nations. Pakistan had supported the UN resolutions on Kuwait, Somalia, and Bosnia and the activities carried out there under its auspices. Pakistan supports the peace accord reached between Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel. She said serious attention will be paid to Israel-Syria talks on Golan heights. The relations of Islamic countries with Israel in future will depend upon the outcome of these talks. On Bosnia, she said Pakistan has offered to provide assistance to Bosnian Muslims. She said herself and her Turkish counterpart, Ms. Tansu Ciller, will soon visit Sarajevo to express solidarity with Bosnian Muslims. She said the dispute in Bosnia should be resolved in accordance with the UN resolutions and Muslims should be protected from massacres and other crimes.
