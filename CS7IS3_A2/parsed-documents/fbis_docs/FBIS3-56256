History will provide once again an opportunity for the Tajiks, together, to contribute to the fate of this ancient nation. It is necessary for us to discuss comprehensively the new constitution, the main law of Tajikistan, and to put it to a nationwide referendum, and on its basis to hold elections for the highest bodies of power in the republic. These fateful political activities on which the sovereignty, the future of the state, and the present and future life of the people depend, have to be carried out until the end of the current year. Dear compatriots, our Tajikistan can not only overcome all the difficulties posed by the fratricidal war, as a result of which it has lost much, but it can preserve political unity, territorial integrity and its sovereignty. Today, our dear Tajikistan is flourishing, and the republic looks with hope to every one of its worthy sons who can contribute to this in this ancient land. The process of reconciliation and forgiveness continues in long- suffering Tajikistan. Fruitful negotiations with the different political forces of the republic have been under way for several months. Brother can not have offended brother. We all remember you, and we hope that you will return soon and will shake hands with your brothers. We hope that you will settle in the motherland of your ancestors and at the same time will contribute in helping our country flourish. We hope that you, our dear compatriots abroad, will take an active part in the future political and economic life of Tajikistan. The leadership of Tajikistan is ready to create all the conditions required for your return. We are ready to solve your economic, social and political problems fraternally, and to find decisions which satisfy everyone. We are ready to say welcome to all who want to return home and to create favorable conditions for them. We are confident that the sense of patriotism will envelop you and that you will overcome all obstacles to your return home. The Tajiks have one motherland and our task is to preserve and to love it. Each home, each family and each town are waiting for you. [Signed] Imamali Rakhmanov, head of state of the Republic of Tajikistan
