Under the title of "Pharisaism," journalist Felix Pita Astudillo recalls that today, 92 years after the United States installed a government in Cuba, it still wants to maintain annexationist ideas with the intention of annexing us, at any cost, into its new world order. After pointing out the crudeness of the message's content, which seems more like an electoral diatribe directed at Miami rather than at Cuba, Pita Astudillo notes that the Cuban people are not interested in the freedom advocated by the United States because it is inhuman and falls under the every-man-for-himself philosophy. The journalist notes that the wishes expressed by Clinton do not take into account the right to life, work, education, food, health, or housing in either Cuba or its neighboring Latin American countries. There is no reference whatsoever to the eradication of poverty, which requires well-balanced economic development and a better distribution of wealth, and it simply deals with age-old and worn-out references to individual civil liberties with a vague mention of the state of law. Pita Astudillo describes as cynical the argument in defense of the blockade, which is aimed at making it impossible for the Cuban people to attain prosperity and satisfy their basic needs as well as making us surrender through hunger. The GRANMA article notes that, in his message, President Clinton claims Cuba and the United States have a long history of cooperation and admiration. Pita Astudillo concedes that although this history is indeed long, it is filled with voraciousness and disdain toward the immoral dwarfs -- the term the North Americans used to describe Cubans in the last century. Finally, the journalist refers to the nerve it took to refer to Jose Marti as someone whose ideas are consistent with Clinton's policy, when it was precisely Marti who 105 years ago wrote: Cuba has never been seen by the United States as anything other than an savory possession whose only nuisance is its people, whom they view as impetuous, lazy, and loathsome.
