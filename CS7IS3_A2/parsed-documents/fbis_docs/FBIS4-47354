Kaminskiy, I.T. Kozlov, and S.G. Ashitko, All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Petroleum Refining; UDC 665.6(470).001.7] [Abstract] The former Soviet Union was always one of the world's leading petroleum exporters, and most of its proved oil reserves were located in Russia. In the mid-eighties, however, oil recovery in Russia began declining and will likely continue to decline until the end of the century. In the near future, Russia may thus anticipate an oil shortage. Because Russia had never experienced the oil crises encountered in many industrially developed countries, the development of energy-saving technologies and intensification of the degree to which oil is processed were never emphasized as in the West. At the beginning of the nineties, the depth of oil refining in Russia averaged just 65 percent versus 82-82 percent in developed countries. At the same time, many Russian petroleum products are inferior to their foreign counterparts from both ecological and performance standpoints. The use of leaded gasoline, in particular, is a serious ecological problem. Only 59 percent of diesel fuels produced in Russia may be classified as low-sulfur. Furnace residual fuel oil remains Russia's highest-volume petroleum product, and it accounts for 13-13.5 percent of the fuel used to produce electric power. The quality of motor, industrial, and transmission oils produced at Russian oil refineries is inferior to that of their foreign counterparts. Russian oil refining industry is capable only of meeting the fuel needs of its obsolete machine tool park, vehicle fleet, and inventory of mobile and stationary power generating units and is not equipped to handle the technological breakthroughs anticipated in such sectors. The technological structure of most of Russia's oil refineries cannot support production of the required amounts of products meeting current quality levels, much less future ones. The All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Petroleum Refining has been collaborating with leading institutes in the different petroleum product-using sectors to develop the first scientifically substantiated forecast of Russia's future petroleum product needs. The forecast developed to date indicates a face-paced increase in the number of diesel-fueled motor vehicles and increases in the quantity and quality of high-octane gasolines. The following changes in Russia's production and utilization of petroleum products were recommended: increasing use of winter grades of diesel fuels until it accounts for 30 percent of all diesel fuels used, reducing the maximum sulfur content of diesel fuel used in vehicles driven in cities or areas of high air exchange from 0.2 to 0.05 percent, increasing the quality of other petroleum products such as bitumen and coke, and increasing the depth of oil refining to 72-75 percent within the next 5 years and to 82-85 percent within the next 20 years. Meeting these goals will require the construction of new complexes to process mazut into motor fuels and the redesign of existing facilities. The enormous capital investments required for such massive construction/reconstruction can only be achieved with adequate government support of the sector. Machine building-related R&D and facilities that have been freed up as a result of conversion could be used to construct modern facilities permitting deeper processing of petroleum, which could in turn reduce expenditures of foreign exchange on imported petroleum products. The government must protect the sector's scientific research institutes to keep them from disappearing; restore destroyed scientific complexes of scientific research institutes, affiliates, and pilot plants; and modernize the sector's scientific research and design institutes and link them with machine building plants in integrated complexes.
