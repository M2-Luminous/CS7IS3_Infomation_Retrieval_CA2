FBIS4-57670 "drlat099_b_94008" FBIS-LAT-94-099 Daily Report 20 May 1994 Netherlands Antilles Haiti Announces Sanctions Against `Boat People' Announces Sanctions Against `Boat People' FL2005192294 Port-au-Prince Signal FM Radio in French 1030 GMT 20 May 94 FL2005192294 Port-au-Prince Signal FM Radio French BFN [Text] On 19 May, Haitian provisional President Emile Jonassaint, not recognized by the international community, announced his government is going to take sanctions against the clandestine departures of boat people for Florida. Jonassaint, who was speaking during a news conference at the National Palace, explained that a decree dated 1980, punishing clandestine departures from the national territory, was still in force. Furthermore, the provisional president said a U.S. invasion of Haiti would be a crime. What can we do against the Americans, against the United States? They can reduce us to ashes in one minute, Jonassaint exclaimed during a news conference. On the other hand, he announced that a Council of Ministers meeting would be held on 20 May to take immediate measures to provide food to the population after the total trade embargo goes into effect at midnight on 21 May. Sanctions were taken against Haiti in violation of the charters of the OAS and of the United Nations, Jonassaint exclaimed. He stated with indignation that he especially opposed the fact that during the vote of those sanctions against Haiti, the UN Security Council was presided over by the delegate from Nigeria, a country where a terrible coup d'etat recently took place while the international community said nothing. Asked about the diplomatic isolation of the country, he pointed out that Haiti has always been alone, ever since its independence in 1804, recalling that even the countries Haiti had helped -- several Latin American countries -- excluded the black republic from the Panama Congress in 1825. In addition, Jonassaint warned that if the resigning prime minister commits an infraction, he will come under the provisions of the law. Jonassaint referred to the call for civil disobedience launched last week by interim Prime Minister Robert Malval.
