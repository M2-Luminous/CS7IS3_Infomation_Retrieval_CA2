Chiang, heading a 15-member delegation, will leave Saturday [9 April] for a ministerial-level meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) scheduled to open in Marrakech, Morocco April 15. As a GATT observer, Taiwan has been invited to attend the meeting, during which the 118 contracting parties will sign the agreement reached during the Uruguay Round talks in mid-December, Ministry of Economic Affairs officials said. The GATT meeting will also make a final decision on the exact time for the establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO), they pointed out. Under the Uruguay Round accord, all GATT signatories are set to become members of the WTO, which will be given tougher enforcement powers to supersede GATT. During the GATT meeting, the officials noted, Chiang will hold bilateral meetings with his counterparts from New Zealand, Canada, Australia, and the United States on problems involving Taiwan's accession to the Geneva-based world trade regulating body. Taiwan, accepted as a GATT observer in September 1992, hopes to become a full member by the end of this year. Meanwhile, the 17 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Forum ministers will hold an informal session during their stay in Morocco, the officials noted. APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Mainland China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and the United States. Chiang will proceed to Egypt for a three-day visit after the GATT meeting.
