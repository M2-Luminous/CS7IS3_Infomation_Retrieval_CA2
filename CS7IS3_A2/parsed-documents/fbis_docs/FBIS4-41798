Chornovil said the information is based on reports from Rukh observers at polling stations. Earlier today, reliable sources told ITAR-TASS on Monday [27 June] that Kravchuk has taken the lead in 15 out of 24 Ukrainian regions in the nation's second presidential elections. He was supported by the residents of the western, central and partially eastern and southern regions of Ukraine. Kuchma has gained advantage over Kravchuk in the Crimea, the Donetsk, Lugansk, Dnepropetrovsk, Zaporozhye, Odessa, Kharkov and Chernigov regions. Since the Central Electoral Commission has not announced the preliminary results of voting yet, journalists have to base their reports on information provided by regional electoral commissions and other sources.
