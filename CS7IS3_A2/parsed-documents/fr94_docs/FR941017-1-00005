FR941017-1-00005 FR941017-1-00001 The second alternative considered was replacement of the existing regulation with an entirely new regulation. This is not an acceptable alternative because the provisions of the existing regulations form part of the licensing bases for many of the operating nuclear power plants and others that are in various stages of obtaining operating licenses. Therefore, these provisions should remain in force and effect. The approach of establishing the revised requirements in new sections to 10 CFR part 100 and relocating plant design requirements to 10 CFR part 50 while retaining the existing regulation was chosen as the best alternative. The public will benefit from a clearer, more uniform, and more consistent licensing process that incorporates updated information and is subject to fewer interpretations. The NRC staff will benefit from improved regulatory implementation (both technical and legal), fewer interpretive debates, and increased regulatory flexibility. Applicants will derive the same benefits in addition to avoiding licensing delays caused by unclear regulatory requirements. V. Major Changes A. Reactor Siting Criteria (Nonseismic) Since promulgation of the reactor site criteria in 1962, the Commission has approved more than 75 sites for nuclear power reactors and has had an opportunity to review a number of others. In addition, light-water commercial power reactors have accumulated about 1800 reactor-years of operating experience in the United States. As a result of these site reviews and operational experience, a great deal of insight has been gained regarding the design and operation of nuclear power plants as well as the site factors that influence risk. In addition, an extensive research effort has been conducted to understand accident phenomena, including fission product release and transport. This extensive operational experience together with the insights gained from recent severe accident research as well as numerous risk studies on radioactive material releases to the environment under severe accident conditions have all confirmed that present commercial power reactor design, construction, operation and siting is expected to effectively limit risk to the public to very low levels. These risk studies include the early ``Reactor Safety Study'' (WASH&hyph;1400), published in 1975, many Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) studies conducted on individual plants as well as several specialized studies, and the recent ``Severe Accident Risks: An Assessment for Five U.S. Nuclear Power Plants,'' (NUREG&hyph;1150), issued in 1990. Advanced reactor designs currently under review are expected to result in even lower risk and improved safety compared to existing plants. Hence, the substantial base of knowledge regarding power reactor siting, design, construction and operation reflects that the primary factors that determine public health and safety are the reactor design, construction and operation. Siting factors and criteria, however, are important in assuring that radiological doses from normal operation and postulated accidents will be acceptably low, that natural phenomena and potential man-made hazards will be appropriately accounted for in the design of the plant, and that site characteristics are amenable to the development of adequate emergency plans to protect the public and adequate security measures to protect the plant. The Commission has also had a long standing policy of siting reactors away from densely populated centers, and is continuing this policy in the proposed rule. The Commission is proposing to incorporate basic reactor site criteria in the proposed rule to accomplish the above purposes. The Commission proposes to retain source term and dose calculations to verify the adequacy of a site for a specific plant, but source term and dose calculations will be relocated to part 50, since experience has shown that these calculations have tended to influence plant design aspects such as containment leak rate or filter performance rather than siting. No specific source term would be referenced in part 50. Rather, the source term would be required to be one that is ``*␣*␣* assumed to result in substantial meltdown of the core with subsequent release into the containment of appreciable quantities of fission products.'' Hence, this guidance could be utilized with the source term currently used for light-water reactors, or used in conjunction with revised accident source terms, currently under development within the NRC staff as well as in the industry. The proposed relocation of source term and dose calculations to part 50 represent a partial decoupling of siting from accident source term and dose calculations. The siting criteria are envisioned to be utilized together with standardized plant designs whose features will be certified in a separate design certification rulemaking procedure. Each of the standardized designs would specify an atmospheric dilution factor that would be required to be met, in order to meet the dose criteria at the exclusion area boundary. For a given standardized design, a site having relatively poor dispersion characteristics would require a larger exclusion area distance than one having good dispersion characteristics. Additional design features would be discouraged in a standardized design to compensate for otherwise poor site conditions. Although individual plant tradeoffs would be discouraged for a given standardized design, a different standardized design could require a different atmospheric dilution factor. For custom plants that do not involve a standardized design, the source term and dose criteria will continue to provide assurance that the site is acceptable for the proposed design.
