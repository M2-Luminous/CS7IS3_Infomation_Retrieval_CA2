FBIS3-30296 "dreeu021__a94004" FBIS-EEU-94-021-A Document Type:Daily Report 1 February 1994 ANNEX Bulgaria Consortium President Denies Violating Embargo AU3101100194 Sofia BTA in English 0815 GMT 31 Jan 94 AU3101100194 Sofia BTA Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Sofia, January 30 (BTA) -- Speaking on the Nedelya 150 Weekly Political Programme of the Bulgarian national radio today, Multigroup President Iliya Pavlov did not deny his acquaintance with former communist functionary Ognyan Doynov, but said that Mr. Doynov and Multigroup had no commitments to each other. Mr. Doynov is believed to be in Austria now and the Bulgarian prosecutor general has filed an official request for his extradition to answer embezzlement charges. Mr. Pavlov described as fabrications and lies the allegations that Multigroup-affiliated companies have busted the Yugoembargo. As for his acquaintance with Ivo Karamanski (the owner of the Sevastopol Casino in Sofia and alleged Mafia boss now under arrest), the Multigroup president said he had no personal impressions as the two "represent different strata." The Austrian press alleged that Multigroup is a Bulgarian formation of companies-phantoms existing only as post office boxes in Switzerland. There are also rumours that these companies are laundering money of the former Bulgarian Communist Party. According to press stories, Doynov's brother, Emil Doynov, working as a consultant at the joint-stock company, was playing the intermediary between Multigroup and Ognyan Doynov. Newspaper stories alleged that Multigroup tops the list of the companies that have busted the UN embargo. The group was said to be involved in huge oil deals with former Yogoslav countries. It was even said that the raging gangsters' war in Sofia was ignited by a conflict between Ivo Karamanski and Iliya Pavlov. The group was reportedly expelled from G-13, a formation of big Bulgarian industrialists. Iliya Pavlov said that Multigroup has over 3,000 staff and the 1993 turnover was approximately $1,000 million, which is "put down in the records of some major European banks." There is no employee of the Doynov family in the holding group. Emil Doynov had only been temporarily employed as consultant for some deals with Poland in 1992, which "was an absolutely normal business," and if it is necessary and profitable for the holding group, it will employ him again, Mr. Pavlov said. Emil Doynov is a former Bulgarian trade attache in Vienna. Multigroup strictly observes the Yugoembargo, "all the more that it had active business contacts in this region before the enforcement of the UN sanctions," and these contacts will be renewed when the embargo is lifted, Mr. Pavlov said. According to him, undercover activity is unthinkable as the holding group is the most strictly monitored institution in this country. Mr. Pavlov dismissed as impossible allegations that G-13 members have criticized Multigroup. "When Bulgaria and the national capital are at stake, there should be no competition, G-13 means that we have to be united when the national interests are concerned," he said. Commenting on the difference between the strata that he and Ivo Karamanski represent, Mr. Pavlov said that Karamanski "is bodyguard or owner of a single casino, while Multigroup is a economic giant which could own 100 casinos if it wants to." Multigroup emerged three years ago, starting its activity as Multiart, a cooperative set up in 1988. The holding group works predominantly in the sphere of metallurgy, chemistry and machine engineering. It trades in coal, ores, salt, sugar, and develops investment projects. The difference between Multigroup and Multigroup Holding Group Inc., is that the latter holds the shares of all Multigroup-affiliated companies, Iliya Pavlov recently told the press. The holding group was registered in Zug, Switzerland, and has subsidiaries in the United States, Ukraine, Russia, South Africa and the Far East. The lending, financial and banking activity of Multigroup is performed by the Sofia Credit Bank, the Sofia Discount House and the Sofia Insurance Company, First Bulgarian Stock Exchange and the Macedonian Credit Bank.
