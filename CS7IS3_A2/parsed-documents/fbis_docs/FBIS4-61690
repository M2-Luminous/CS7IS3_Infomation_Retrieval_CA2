"They ought to be based solely on treaties." At the same time Ukraine's acting Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy said he regarded Crimea as an integral part of the Ukrainian state, and therefore believed that it was not necessary to conclude any special agreements. "We have nothing to divide; we are one family," he believes. Journalists were told the two sides discussed a number of economic issues and reached understanding on some of them. This concerns, in particular, the provision of funds, oil products and seeds to the Crimea. A decision was also made to examine all arising issues at the level of heads of relevant ministries and departments.
