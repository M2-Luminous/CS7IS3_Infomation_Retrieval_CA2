Unlike the National Party [NP] and the African National Congress [ANC], the DP met all the criteria needed to make the country and its citizens prosperous, Mr de Beer said. These included the fact that the DP was democratic, supported peace and stability, favoured free enterprise, trade and business and believed in small government, low public expenditure, low taxes and privatisation where appropriate. The DP also had no links with socialism and communism. Mr de Beer said that if the ANC and NP purported to be democrats it would be of the "instant" variety. It had become convenient for these two parties to change their tunes.
