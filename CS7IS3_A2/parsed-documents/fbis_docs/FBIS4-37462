The paralyzed and blind Yasin, however, refuses to sign this statement and will consequently remain incarcerated in Israel. Our military affairs correspondent Yariv Ben-Yehuda reports: [Begin Ben-Yehuda recording] The issue of Hamas leader Shaykh Ahmad Yasin's release was reviewed once more several weeks ago, and again it was decided not to release him. Israel is making Yasin's release conditional on his signing the statement all released Palestinian prisoners must sign on refraining from acts of or support for terrorism. This was divulged by a security source. So far, Yasin has refused to sign such a statement. Several Palestinian elements, some of them official, recently submitted requests for the release of Yasin, who has been imprisoned in Israel since 1988. All the requests were reviewed, but as long as Yasin refuses to sign the statement, he will remain imprisoned. The security source said Israel does not want Yasin to die in an Israeli prison, because this could have an impact on Hamas activity and could result in a wave of violence by other organizations as well. The state of Yasin's health, however, has not changed. As a result of a childhood disease, he is paralyzed throughout almost all of his body, but there has been no serious deterioration in his condition. [end recording]
