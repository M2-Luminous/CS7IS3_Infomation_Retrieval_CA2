He said that there has been no information to that effect given to the Foreign Ministry and he would like to check the accuracy of the report before answering newsmen. However, he said that it is the policy of the Thai Government that no Thai workers engage in trade with the Khmer Rouge. He noted that from what happened in the past, the Khmer Rouge provided facilities for Thai residents. Asked about U.S. sanctions against three Thai companies with workers in Libya, he said the United States claimed that the three companies were helping Libya set up a chemical weapons production plant. The foreign minister said that U.S. ambassador to Thailand David Lambertson had already met and consulted with him on the matter. Prasong said the ambassador confirmed that the sanctions were against the three companies only and do not apply to other Thai companies or the Thai people.
