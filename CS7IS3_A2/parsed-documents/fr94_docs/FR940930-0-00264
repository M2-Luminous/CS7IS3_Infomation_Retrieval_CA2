FR940930-0-00264 FR940930-0-00031 Regulatory Flexibility Act The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this interim rule before publication and by approving it certifies that this interim rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because this interim rule pertains to a limited number of single-family mortgage situations. It expands the options available to financially distressed mortgagors and does not adversely affect any mortgagor rights or interests under existing FHA-insured loan servicing regulations. Executive Order 12612, Federalism The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined that this interim rule does not have ``federalism implications'' because it does not have substantial direct effects on the States (including their political subdivisions), or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. The purpose of this interim rule is to implement the requirements and methods of pre-foreclosure sales as a means of assisting qualified mortgagors in avoiding foreclosure of their FHA-insured mortgages and of saving the Department money. Executive Order 12606, the Family The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, the Family, has determined that this interim rule does not have potential significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being.
