Born Smolensk Oblast 1942. Graduated from the Moscow Higher Combined Arms Command College (1963), and the M.V. Frunze (1973) and General Staff (1980) Military Academies. He has served in various command and staff positions. In August 1992 he moved from his job as first deputy commander of Moscow Military District to be appointed chief of the Main Directorate for Combat Training and deputy commander in chief of the Ground Forces. [Miranovich] Anatoliy Andreyevich, the Main Directorate for Combat Training is, it seems to me, the "lawmaker" when it comes to training specialists on various types of weapons. At least that was the case in the Soviet Army. Or are things different now? [Golovnev] Fortunately, the procedure of disparaging our Soviet past (something which some of the mass media have had some success at) has left Armed Forces combat training -- clearly, a little-known area to the writing fraternity -- virtually untouched. As before, we are elaborating draft field manuals and general military regulations along with a program for training officers and noncommissioned officers from various combat arms, and we are cooperating closely with combat training organs in the Navy, Air Defense Forces, the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] troops, and the Border Guards.... In short, the Main Directorate for Combat Training is a kind of coordination center for scientific and methodological ideas and developments in the combat training sphere. Services from the Russian Ministry for Emergency Situations, various scientific research institutes, and military academies -- including the General Staff Academy -- actively cooperate with us. Training in the Commonwealth countries' armies is virtually based on our developments. Such a role for our directorate is dictated by life itself. The organizational development of a new army, the changing of doctrinal views of the nature of modern warfare, the creation of force and troop groupings to meet that challenge, and the new priorities in military-technical policy all require a reinterpretation of certain canons of combat training. For instance, we have never before faced the problem of training units for peacekeeping forces. Naturally, we had neither the relevant training programs nor the training base. Now, as you are aware, we are fully tackling this issue. And not without success. [Miranovich] Which is something, regrettably, that cannot be said of the Ground Forces as a whole, most of whose combined and other units posted only satisfactory results in the last training year. And other branches of the Armed Forces have not turned in a brilliant performance, but put it bluntly. [Golovnev] You are right there. But, given that this is no worse than in 1992, when Russia announced the creation of its own Armed Forces, and that the process of the decline in the standard of combat training has nonetheless been halted, then.... Incidentally, for me to predict some kind of breakthrough in this area in the very near future would be, at the very least, unprofessional. [Miranovich] As KRASNAYA ZVEZDA's mailbag shows, many people see one of the reasons for what we could call the ailing state of combat training in our Army as being that it is by no means looked upon as a priority everywhere. Yet the regulations of the Russian Federation Armed Forces' Internal Service -- in whose elaboration you participated, incidentally -- stated that combat training "is the main component of the everyday activity of servicemen in peacetime." It also stipulates that proceedings will be instituted against commanders (chiefs) guilty of taking personnel away from exercises. What can you say about this? [Golovnev] Do you think that officers just take personnel away from exercises at their own discretion? Yes, there are cases when personal interests hamper some people in the performance of their duties. And they receive a principled assessment -- as provided for by the regulations. I can name a number of officers who have paid a high price for this. But let's call a spade a spade -- the reason why personnel are taken out of planned combat training is primarily due to manpower levels, which compel commanders to divert considerable amounts of forces and resources to ensure the everyday activity of combined and other units. The destruction of existing economic ties has sharply complicated the organization of material provision for the training process. The quality of training is suffering owing to the untimely elaboration and delivery by the Ministry of the Defense Industry of simulators for new types of weapons and equipment. And the cost of training has been rising considerably, since we have been forced to use equipment already in service. How soon will the situation change for the better? That depends on how soon we all agree that a state's might is also measured by the level of its Army training. [Miranovich] Would anyone really take issue with that? [Golovnev] It is hard to take issue with it. Consequently, we have no shortage of statesmen who have been campaigning -- like Vladimir Shumeyko, speaker of the Federal Assembly's upper house, has been doing in your newspaper (the 5 April issue -- G.M.) -- for the "Army to have everything as a priority." But stating the truth is not enough. Army training and, consequently, the might of the fatherland will not improve because of that. The situation will change depending on how soon the state can bring the Armed Forces up to full strength. We need to be talking today not simply about replenishing the thinning Army ranks with illiterate workers and peasants or "ignoramuses" who had never studied or worked anywhere before being drafted. It is a question of the need to revive the intellectual level of the barracks, which is now lower in this country than in the United States and some other NATO countries. And that, you understand, will take more than just one draft intake. And not only the draft intake.... A great deal will depend on how soon we introduce a viable organizational and staffing structure for combined and other units. On how soon our financing stops being dependent on all kinds of chance circumstances. On how soon viable logistical subunits appear in the forces. And so on and so forth. In no way does this mean that we, the military, are beyond reproach. We also need to look at how responsible and conscientiously we approach the task in hand, how enterprising we are, and so forth. Incidentally, commanders have now been given a free hand, they are being allowed to plan the training process with an eye to local conditions. It is time to seriously deal with the problems of combat training within the framework of moral and psychological backup for Armed Forces activity. [Miranovich] Incidentally, this was intensively discussed at the scientific and theoretical conference held recently at the General Staff Academy. [Golovnev] Yes, we need questing in this area. For well-known reasons we currently, as before, have no powerful ideological backup for combat training. At the same time, we need to somehow highlight such philosophical and moral values as the conviction of the need for a strong Russian state, and the understanding that military men cannot make such a clear impact anywhere in peacetime as they can in combat training. [Miranovich] Perhaps we should learn from the West? After all, many armies have already been through what we are currently experiencing. [Golovnev] A great deal has changed in our relationships with Western armies, including NATO armies. We have more contact. For instance, last year students from the United States and France visited the Moscow Combined Arms College. Students from the St. Petersburg Higher Combined Arms Command College hosted their counterparts from Belgium, and are now getting ready to travel there themselves on an exchange. Officers from Sweden are studying in a number of our academies. There are also direct contacts with the troops. The most vivid example is probably the exercises due in June between the headquarters of our 27th Motorized Rifle Division and the U.S. 3d Infantry Division -- preparations for which are now actively in hand. What does this experience show? It can be said that the general trend in Armed Forces combat training in the leading states is now to reduce (the figures are cited -- G.M.) the number of large-scale exercises and maneuvers involving actual forces. We are striving to do the same thing. For instance, we now plan no more than two exercises a year with companies and battalions. One of those will be a live-fire exercise. Regimental and divisional exercises are not held annually, as used to be the case, but biennially. But.... Whereas, so to speak, we have been forced into this, the NATO Joint Armed Forces command has different motives. It prefers to resolve many traditional training tasks and to study the questions of training and warfare under new geostrategic conditions using automated battlefield modeling systems. How effective are they? Judge for yourselves -- the use of automated battlefield modeling terminals at fixed-site and field command and control centers and during the U.S. "Certain Caravan" exercises in Europe made it possible to carry out large-scale military operations involving around 200,000 servicemen and more than 25,000 units of armored equipment. [Miranovich] Do we have nothing similar? [Golovnev] What is annoying is that we do [to-to i obidno, chto yest]. Our laser firing and engagement simulators [lazernyye imitatory strelby i porazheniya] have proved their worth superbly. They make it possible to simulate fire from tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, and small arms, and to record "kills" on both sides in two-sided field training exercises. But for all this to work and for the reduction in the number of very costly live-fire exercises (figures for 1991 cited -- G.M.) not to be to the detriment of troop training, we need a comprehensively automated tactical training system. The Americans use such a system at their specialized training centers. We also have one in the pipeline, so to speak. With its help the training process could be made immeasurably cheaper. But, once again, it all depends on money. [Miranovich] Anatoliy Andreyevich, the retargeting of the Armed Forces -- if I can put it that way -- to focus on resolving the new tasks stemming from the new military-political, geostrategic, and other realities will require, apart from anything else, a corresponding theoretical basis for their training. For instance, special tactical leadership had to be developed for the joint command-post exercise between Russian and U.S. peacekeeping forces to which you referred. And what about our field manuals, which are also probably obsolete, and other documents regulating troop training? After all, different types of training are clearly needed for men in ordinary divisions and peacekeeping divisions, for new recruits and experienced specialists, for men entering service under contract, and for women.... [Golovnev] Yes, our current field manuals have been in operation since 1989. But I would not say that they were hopelessly outdated. After all, changes in tactics are, as is well known, the result of certain breakthroughs in technical development, and are a kind of reaction to certain innovations in armed combat systems. If we proceed on this basis, then the current manuals can still be used for training -- which is, indeed, what practice shows. At the same time, directives have been issued making certain clarifications connected with Armed Forces reform and the change of normative acts on defense issues -- specifically to Part 1 (divisions, brigades, regiments) of the Ground Forces Field Manual. The chapters entitled "Foundations of the Soviet Military Doctrine" and "Political Work" have been removed from the manual. A chapter entitled "Moral and Psychological Backup" has been brought in, along with clarifications connected with certain aspects of provision. The place and role of new Ground Force formations -- motorized rifle and tank brigades -- in combined-arms combat have been defined. Normative indicators have been set for them. Moreover, it has been decided to rework formal documents containing regulations in 1994-1995 -- something that a special commission is currently at work on. As for the features of training different categories of servicemen, here we proceed on the basis of a single ultimate goal -- the readiness of subunits to fulfill their combat mission in all types of combat irrespective of the manpower acquisition principle used. Individual training has been introduced for those serving under contract. One or two days a month are given over to it. It is worth noting that the planning for individual training also takes account of the level of subunits' training, questions on which further work should be done, and...requests from the contract servicemen themselves. Individual training exercises mainly employ drills, group exercises, and practical work. As to women.... There is nothing special about their training. They train according to their speciality within a subunit or training group. In other words, however heterogeneous the military may be, the aim of training remains unchanged -- to teach people what they need in warfare.
