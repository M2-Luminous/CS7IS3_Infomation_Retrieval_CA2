FR940208-1-00037 FR940208-1-00011 The Agency is also proposing equipment and performance standards for all tank trucks and railcars loading at existing and new major source bulk gasoline terminals. Trucks and railcars loading at these facilities would be required to pass an annual vapor tightness test according to EPA Method 27. This requirement controls fugitive vapor losses at existing facilities and supplements the vacuum assist system at new facilities in providing the best control for vapor leakage during loading. Pumps, valves and other equipment at new major source bulk gasoline terminals and pipeline breakout stations would all be subject to the same work practice and equipment standards specified by the leak detection and repair (LDAR) program in 40 CFR part 60, subpart VV. LDAR requirements at bulk gasoline terminals include components of the vapor collection and processing systems. Existing major source bulk gasoline terminals and pipeline breakout stations would be required to perform LDAR for pumps and valves four times per year (quarterly LDAR). New major source facilities would be required to implement a monthly LDAR program for pumps and valves, and follow the other equipment standards for other equipment under 40 CFR part 60, subpart VV. Provisions of these LDAR programs allow new and existing facilities with demonstrated low leak frequencies for valves to decrease the frequency of monitoring. When promulgated, these standards will be codified under part 63 of title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). Proposed General Provisions of part 63 (58 FR 42760, August 11, 1993) to be located in subpart A, will, when promulgated, codify procedures and criteria to implement emission standards for stationary sources that emit one or more HAP's, and will provide general information and requirements that apply under the section 112 NESHAP promulgated under the CAA amendments of 1990. C. Effective Date for Compliance Section 112(i)(3)(A) of the Act requires compliance by existing sources within 3 years after rule promulgation, notwithstanding the provisions of sections 112(i)(1) and (2). Today's proposed regulation requires compliance by all affected sources within 3 years after promulgation of the rule. Finally, major source facilities in the bulk gasoline terminal and pipeline breakout station subcategories must implement LDAR programs within 180 days after promulgation of this rule. New major source facilities must comply with all provisions of the standards upon startup. D. Compliance Extensions Section 112(i)(3)(B) allows the Administrator (or a State with a program approved under Title V) to grant existing sources an extension of compliance of up to 1 year, upon application by an owner or operator of an affected facility, if such time period is necessary for the installation of controls. Additionally, under the early reduction provisions of section 112(i)(5), existing sources may be granted a 6-year extension of compliance with an otherwise applicable section 112(d) standard (MACT standard) upon demonstration by the owner or operator of the source that HAP emissions have been reduced by 90 percent or more prior to the date of this proposal, or the source makes an enforceable commitment to achieve such reduction prior to January 1, 1994. The general notice governing early reduction compliance extensions was published in the Federal Register on June 13, 1991 (56 FR 27338). E. Compliance Testing and Monitoring The tests required under the proposed standards include initial performance testing of the bulk terminal vapor processing system, vapor leak monitoring and repair of the vapor collection system before each performance test, and annual vapor tightness testing of gasoline tank trucks and railcars. Storage tanks at terminals and pipeline stations would require periodic visual and seal gap measurement tests. Continuous monitoring of an operating parameter would be required for vapor processing systems to ensure continuous compliance with today's proposed 10 mg TOC/l emission limit. At new bulk gasoline terminals, the vacuum achieved in the tank truck or railcar during loading would have to be monitored continuously to verify continuous compliance with maintaining the vacuum during truck and railcar loading operations. The schedule for performance testing is provided in ยง63.7 of the proposed General Provisions. The initial performance test is required 120 days after the effective date of the standards or after initial startup for a new facility, or 120 days after the compliance date specified for an existing facility.
