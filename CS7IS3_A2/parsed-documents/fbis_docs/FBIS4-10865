As is known, the Cachique Rivera brothers belong to one of the most important "firms" that supplies drugs to the Colombian Cali cartel. According to information obtained by Dinandro, they have become the drug trafficking leaders in Peru after the arrest of Demetrio Limonier Chavez Penaherrera, aka Vaticano. The alleged owner of the "enterprise," whose identity was not disclosed, was arrested when he was driving a luxurious metal blue Toyota Tercel vehicle, license number DO-3801, in a capital neighborhood. According to the source, Dinandro uncovered the front man after exhaustively and patiently investigating an accounting office in Lima. Despite the secrecy in the case, it was leaked that Dinandro's Finance Division, with the technical support of auditors, established that the financial movements did not match the activities carried out by this "front" enterprise. The source added that after checking the relationship between the arrested individual and the Cachique Rivera drug trafficking family, personnel from that "enterprise" were exhaustively investigated. Dinandro thus carried out the successful operation on 2 April when it was proved that the Cachique Rivera's front man was involved in "laundering: drug money. It is known that Dinandro Chief General Walter Taboada Milla has ordered that investigations into the case continue. Taboada said the Cachique Rivera gang is formed by four brothers from Tingo Maria -- Abelardo, aka Teniente; Adolfo, aka Alferez; Segundo, aka Capitan; and Nicolas, aka Mayor. According to the source, the Cachique Rivera family is headed by Abelardo, aka Teniente, the cruelest of the brothers, who -- according to the police -- heads the operations of the "firm" from Colombia. Segundo, aka Capitan, is in charge of running the "business" in the jungle. The other two, according to the source, are in charge of collecting the money from drug trafficking. Taboada said the arrest of these criminals is a matter of days. Peruvian and Colombian authorities are continuously exchanging information to find the "narcos." He ended by stating: "We are following them closely. They are constantly going to Colombia. We hope to arrest them in a few days." The sister in the Cachique Rivera family, Margarita, 30, was arrested on 20 March in Lima on an arrest warrant issued by the Lima court on charges of drug trafficking. [passage omitted]
