A.: In the USSR we began in Kiev with the Children of Chernobyl project. In 1990 our vessel sailed to Novaya Zemlya to protest against nuclear testing. At that time we were held in custody for more than two weeks. The second time we sailed there was last year to document the Russian Navy's dumping of nuclear waste and spent reactors from nuclear submarines in the sea. Our boat was arrested and our ship Solo was fired on and captured, moreover, in international waters. We were again held in custody for a week. As a result, a governmental commission was formed under the chairmanship of Alexei Yablokov, adviser to the President on matters of ecology. We secured what we wanted to achieve. Today, Greenpeace of Russia stands already quite firmly on its feet. Q.: Whose money does Greenpeace owe its existence to? A.: The system of our financing took final shape in the mid-1980s. We take no money either from governments and private companies or from any funds whatsoever. Individual donations account for 99 percent of Greenpeace's money and 1 percent comes from the sale of T-shirts and souvenirs. Every national organization, collecting individual donations in its own country, allots 22 percent for Greenpeace International. This money is distributed among the others, mainly those who are just beginning their work and do not yet have considerable funds of their own as in Japan, for example. Or else it is apportioned for large-scale international acts--today the biggest of them is under way in Britain where we want to close down the Thor factory used for recycling nuclear weapons. Huge sums have been allotted for this purpose, and victory is already just around the corner. Q.: What are Greenpeace's priorities in Russia? A.: We protest against the production of plutonium in the course of recycling used nuclear fuel. In general, nuclear power engineering is a threat for the whole world, not only for the inhabitants of areas adjacent to nuclear power plants. Q.: In other countries Greenpeace is fighting against the dumping of toxic wastes. They are taken to Russia--and here Greenpeace doesn't let them in. Am I right? A.: Quite right. We want to make sure that there should be no toxic waste in general. And this is quite feasible as technical ways to solving the problem already exist. Q.: It is impossible to carry out serious ecological work in a country without getting in touch directly with its power structures. How does it take place in Russia? A.: We are continuously working with the authorities. And, while not being a political organization, we secure any ecological victory we can at a political level. We worked with the Supreme Soviet and we will also work with the new structures in all the regions. If a person responsible for the adoption of one or another bill does not listen to our arguments, there is a need for recourse to pressure--through the press or from among that person's constituents. But for me it is absolutely unimportant what political views this or that deputy may have. We are delighted by the Constitution's adoption because presidential power has been very weak in responding to our actions. This is particularly visible in the localities where the governor appointed from Moscow has absolutely no idea about local problems and is not interested in their solution--in contrast to the now dissolved local Soviets. However bad they might have been, they were closer to the region's population. Q.: The following opinion of your organization exists: Greenpeace is good, of course, they are young enthusiasts, but they are often drawn into not altogether clean games, being used either in rival ``settlements'' or in politics. How do you respond to this? A.: Well, of course, in America Greenpeace is a ``hand of the KGB'' and in the USSR it used to be a ``hand of the CIA.'' In Sweden we are in general a ``hand'' of both the KGB and the CIA simultaneously. All this is rubbish. In this organization I have never encountered dependence on any political or economic situation whatsoever. Russia's Ministry of the Nuclear Power Industry says, for example, that Greenpeace wants to close Russian nuclear power plants in favour of German ones. For those who know how hard we have ``worked'' on German atomic power stations this is simply ridiculous. Q.: And the last question: what is the biggest headache for Greenpeace today? A.: The ozone hole. The latest information from American satellites is such that in 1993 it has increased more than was predicted. No way out has yet been found. For the time being we are not working on this issue in Russia although its ``contribution'' to the problem is enormous.
