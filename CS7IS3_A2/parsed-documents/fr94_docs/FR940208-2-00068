For more specific details, contact Greg Knight at (202) 606&hyph;5000 ext. 144; Maurice Salth at (202) 606&hyph;5000 ext. 103; or (202) 606&hyph;5256 (TDD). supplementary information: Background The National and Community Service Trust Act (Act), signed by President Clinton on September 21, 1993, amended the National and Community Service Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12501 et seq.). Under Subtitle E of the Act, NCCC was directed to accomplish the following: 1. Determine whether residential service programs administered by the Federal Government can significantly increase the support for national service and community service by the people of the United States. 2. Determine whether such programs can expand the opportunities for young men and women to perform meaningful, direct, and consequential act of community service in a manner that will enhance their own skills while contributing to their understanding of civic responsibility in the United States. 3. Determine whether retired members and former members of the Armed Forces of the United States, members and former members of the Armed Forces discharged or released from active duty in connection with reduced Department of Defense spending, members and former members of the Armed Forces discharged or transferred from the Selective Reserve of the Ready Reserve in connection with reduced DOD spending, and other members of the Armed Forces not on active duty and not actively participating in a reserve component of the Armed Forces can provide guidance and training under such programs that contribute meaningfully to the encouragement of national and community service. 4. Determine whether domestic national service programs can serve as a substitute for the traditional option of military service in the Armed Forces of the United States which, in times of reductions in the size of the Armed Forces, is a diminishing national service opportunity for young Americans. Under the provisions of Subtitle E, the NCCC is developing two residential programs, the National Service Program and the Summer National Service Program. Both programs combine the best of the Civilian Conservation Corps values, military training techniques, and innovative service learning models. The NCCC strategy includes accomplishment of the following activities: 1. Implement the residential programs for 1000 young men and women at four regional sites located in the Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, and West by 4th quarter FY94. 2. Operate a Summer National Service program on a military base in the Northeast region during FY94. 3. Expand enrollment and establish 4 additional camps by 4th quarter FY95. 4. Plan for a yearly capacity of 6000 corps members by FY2001. 5. Obtain corporate funding for half of FY95 program and for each year thereafter. 6. Implement a prototype recruiting and selection process using existing federal agencies. 7. Perform community service activities that help solve unmet needs in the education, environment, human service, and public safety areas. All community service projects must meet an identifiable public need, provide meaningful community benefits for service learning and skill development, encourage work to be done in teams of diverse individuals, and include continued educational and training for corps members in various technical fields. National Service Program Young people aged 18&hyph;24 are eligible to participate as corps members. Four regional campuses are being established; one in the Northeast, one in the South, one in the Midwest, and one in the West. Each campus will be located on a military installation. Corps members will be recruited and will enter into agreement to participate for a period of eleven months. The campus experience will be divided into two phases. During phase I, corps members will receive approximately six weeks of initial training. Phase II will include continued personal development, training, education, and the performance of community service projects. The corps members will be a diverse group reflecting the population of the United States. Corps members will represent almost all ethnic groups, cultures, genders, and come from both urban and rural areas.
