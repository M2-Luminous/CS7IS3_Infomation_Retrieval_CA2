It is likely to meet with a mixed reaction from journalists. The Court of Appeal set up by the president is the successor to the Information Court of Arbitration that operated during the election campaign. Five of the seven members of the new collegium worked on the Court of Arbitration under the leadership of Doctor of Juridical Sciences Anatoliy Vengerov, who has now been appointed chairman of the Court of Appeal for Information Disputes. The court should help the president to carry out his constitutional role as guarantor of citizens' rights and freedoms -- specifically in the sphere of information and the mass media. It will not examine disputes within the jurisdiction of the general civil courts -- in particular, defamation cases. In accordance with the Statute on the Court of Appeal it must promote the "safeguarding of rights and freedoms in the sphere of the mass media; objectivity and accuracy of reports concerning the public interest; the protection of the moral interests of children and young people in the media; and the observance of the principle of political pluralism in news and sociopolitical television and radio programs." The Court of Appeal will resolve disputes on the allocation of airtime to parliamentary factions. The statute gives the Court of Appeal the right to "order the rectification of factual errors in media news reports concerning the public interest," to make representations regarding the submission of written warnings to media sponsors and editorial offices and, following such warnings, to make representations for the activities of the media to be judicially wound up. The court has the right to reprimand journalists and to raise the question of instituting proceedings against them if they have violated "generally accepted ethical norms." This level of jurisdiction and the range of powers available to the Court of Appeal for Information Disputes makes it very similar to an organ of censorship -- albeit one after the event rather than before the event. Admittedly, such censorship would be useful, for instance, in the sphere of protecting public morality from chauvinist propaganda, violence, or pornography, but the court's direct dependence on the President's Administration also creates the threat that its censorship powers might be used for political purposes -- particularly in light of the vague criteria for "generally accepted ethical norms." In personal conversation Anatoliy Vengerov categorically dissociated himself from the claims that he is a censor, pointing out that, on the contrary, the Court of Appeal intends primarily to campaign for the extension of journalists' rights and their unswerving observance by officials, and to fight infringements of the media's freedom and, in particular, the way in which journalists' right to obtain socially important information is ignored. The Court of Appeal chairman advocated close cooperation between this state organ and journalists. From the journalists' standpoint, the fact that the Court of Appeal for Information Disputes is being set up is as yet hard to assess unambiguously. Some of the organ's functions could undoubtedly serve to promote genuine free speech. At the same time, under certain circumstances the Court of Appeal could also pursue a policy of actually restricting free speech and interfering in matters which would be better left to journalists themselves within the framework of the Law on the Press or a general civil process without the importunate help of special state organs. Incidentally, we as yet have no cause to rebuke the Court of Appeal for anything of the kind, and journalists are initially inclined to cooperate with it rather than to be in confrontation with it.
