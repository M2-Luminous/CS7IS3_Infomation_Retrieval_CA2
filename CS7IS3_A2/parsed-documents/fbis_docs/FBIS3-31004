A UN Protetion Force [UNPROFOR] spokesman said Rose had called for a battalion of Malaysian UN troops to be deployed in the capital to help with the operation, which must be completed within a 10-day NATO deadline ending on February 21. "General Rose has directed the Malaysian battalion which... arrived about a month ago or so to come here later today to assist interposition of UN troups between the two sides," he said. "They will be coming in significant number." The Malaysian battalion, comprising up to 1,000 troops, arrived in the region about a month ago. Part of it has already been deployed in the region of Jablanica-Konjic, in southeastern Bosnia. The order came on the second day of a ceasefire agreed Wednesday between Bosnian Moslems and Serbs, and in the context of a NATO ultimatum to launch air strikes if they do not demilitarize the city by midnight on February 20. The truce itself was apparently holding Saturday, with no reports of fighting in Bosnia overnight. The NATO ultimatum allows for air strikes if the truce is violated in Sarajevo itself, a UN-designated safe area. During the first day of implementation of the ceasefire Friday, Bosnian Serbs surrendered 13 artillery pieces or mortars, while Bosnian Moslem forces handed over five mortars, according to UN officials. The quantity of weapons was insignificant given the firepower both sides possess in and around the city, but peacekeepers said the handover was of great symbolic importance. At the end of the day Friday Rose said that "We've been moving troops into positions between the (front) lines and we've been accepting weapons under our control, into barracks on both sides." The threat of air strikes, which could be triggered before the 10-day deadline by a breach of the ceasefire in Sarajevo, was boosted Friday by the U.S. decision to send eight F-15E bombers to Italy to increase the NATO force. The planes, increasing the number of NATO aircraft in the region from 120 to 146, will be part of an improved fighter squadron being put together by Admiral Michael Boorda, NATO regional commander in charge of the Bosnia operation. Many of the same type of aircraft had been in the region several months ago when the NATO allies appeared to be getting ready to launch air strikes. Pilots at NATO bases in Italy, already being used as the base for Operation Deny Flight to prevent unauthorized air activity over Bosnia, say they are ready to implement the threat of strikes whenever necessary. "The decision is a political one. We are here to carry out UN orders," said Doug Yurovich, 37, at the Italian NATO base of Aviano. "From up there you can see the Serb positions clearly. We would have no problem in hitting the targets, once they are designated," he said. The developments came as peace talks between Bosnia's warring parties in Geneva were adjourned until after the NATO deadline with no progress reported. E.C. mediator Lord Owen said earlier Saturday in Geneva that a new U.S. diplomatic initiative in favor of the Moslem-led Bosnian government and the NATO ultimatum were encouraging the Moslems to hold out in the negotiations to see if Western forces would intervene militarily around Sarajevo. "Certainly they don't want to talk about the details of UN administration (of Sarajevo) for the moment until they see what happens. Probably the NATO deadline has to pass," he said.
