The summit held in the Burkinabe capital, seat of the community, ended there "to deal the final blow to a dying organisation", an official of the Senegalese Ministry of Economy and Finance told PANA. Set up on 2 June 1972 in Bamako, Mali by Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Mauritania, Mali, Niger and Senegal, and broadened with Benin joining in 1984, CEAO was a community of 51 million people spread over nearly five million square kilometres. During its 22 years of existence, the community has endured difficulties such as the non-payment of five months of salaries (October 1993-February 1994) to its 450 personnel. Lately, telephone lines and electricity were cut in its headquarters. However, the problems were predictable following the theft in 1985 of 6.5 billion CFA (1 U.S. dollar; 575 F CFA at today's rate) in what has become know as the "Diawara affair." The theft was from the Solidarity and Intervention Fund for the Development of the Community, a specialised unit of the CEAO. Of the 6.5 billion CFA said to have been embezzled by Moussa Ngom (former CEAO secretary general), Moussa Diakite (Fosidec director general) and Mohamed Diawara (businessman and former Ivorian minister), only 400 million F CFA have been recovered to date. Even though the "Diawara affair" was the starting point of the community's difficulties, its financial problems were worsened when the member states failed to meet their financial contributions. This led to arrears of some 65.5 billion CFA as at 30 June 1993. Cote d'Ivoire and Senegal, the two major contributors, owe the defunct community 50 billion CFA. Of this amount, Cote d'Ivoire owes 34 billion CFA. Only Benin was up to date with its contributions. However, CEAO, whose mission was to foster the development of economic activities in member states, had all the assets to succeed, according to some experts interviewed by PANA. In fact, with a gross domestic product of 4.3 billion dollars and 10 billion dollars in foreign trade (coffee, cocoa, timber, uranium, iron, oil, cotton, peanuts, water, cattle, tourism and cereals), the community was a real economic force the experts said. CEAO was strengthened in 1977 with the adoption in Abidjan of a nonaggression and defence assistance agreement. This was aimed at guaranteeing the security for the community. In order to achieve its task, the CEAO set up several specialised institutions such as the Community Development Fund, the School of Mining and Geology in Niamey, the Regional Center of Solar Energy in Bamako, the Center for Higher Management Studies in Dakar, the School of Fishing in Nouadhibou, Mauritania. However, hit by an economic crisis compounded by the 50 per cent devaluation of the CFA, decided on 11 January in Dakar, the member states preferred to sacrifice [words indistinct] and for the West African Economic and Monetary Union, set up three months ago and whose deadline for ratification is 30 April 1994.
