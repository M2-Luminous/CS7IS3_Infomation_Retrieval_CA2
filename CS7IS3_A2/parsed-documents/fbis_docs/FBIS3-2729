State-run large and medium-sized enterprises were given preferential treatment by having the rate for unified corporate tax reduced, while the most controversial value added tax (VAT) on land and property was expected to be delayed, Chinese sources said. The unified corporate tax introduced at the beginning of this year stipulates that all firms in China should contribute 33 percent of their earnings to the state coffers without any exception. The state regulations on the implementation of value added tax on land and property is scheduled to be published next month. However, the most controversial tax reform package in more than four decades of the communist rule in China has met strong opposition from the central planners and the business community, especially business people from the fastgrowing southeast regions. Chinese sources said both central planners and reformist regional officials joined hands to block the reform, although they stood on quite a different ground. In his government work report presented to the second plenary session of the Eighth National People's Congress yesterday, Premier Li Peng apparently sidestepped the implementation of the reform policy and failed to report on the timetable to introduce the VAT on land and property sales. Mr Li mentioned that the government was to introduce the tax reform package, but failed to detail implementation of the fundamental restructuring program in China. The government would "reform the tax system, institute a turnover tax with value added tax as the main component, introduce a uniform income tax on domestically funded enterprises," Mr Li said in the report. This was the only account on the tax reform. "Mr Li apparently gave himself room for amending the reform package and adjust the timetable for implementation," a Chinese economist said. Obviously due to the pressures from the coastal regions, especially the special economic zones and coastal open cities in which foreign-funded firms have been enjoying tax exemption and holidays, Mr Li applied the uniform corporate tax only to domestic firms. Initially, the uniform corporate tax would apply to all firms no matter what status they enjoyed. Central planners represented by Mr Li and his deputy and former planning minister Zou Jiahua wanted to give state-run firms better treatment, such as a lower tax rate or holiday, while coastal officials hoped to keep their preferential status to woo overseas investors, China analysts said. Despite having different targets in mind, both camps joined hands to block the reform package. Chinese sources said central planners had worked out measures to reduce tax rates for loss-running state firms. Late last month, a central document jointly issued by State Commission for Restructuring the Economy and the State Planning Commission said some state firms with poorer performance or lower profits would be given a lower rate of 27 and 18 percent in the corporate tax. This would be within a two-year period as a transitional measure to the 33 percent uniform corporate tax. Some enterprises would have tax rebate for those reduced tax payment until the end of 1993, if they obtained approval by governments at the provincial level and were examined by the Finance Ministry and State Administration for Taxation. For the sake of supporting old state-run industries, the document said they would not be asked to submit after-tax profits, provided the central department approved. The document also rolled back a reform policy on investment to allow direct investment in enterprises by the government. "Central and regional governments would inject more capital into those firms listed by allowing financial injection by the government instead of loans from banks in a move to increase the firm's capital," Chinese sources quoted the document as saying. However, Finance Minister Liu Zhongli yesterday sidestepped rumours that Beijing was to delay the VAT on land and property. "I have not learnt such a message so far," Mr Liu said. "However, all regulations and decrees issued by the State Council should be implemented. The state regulation on the implementation of value added tax is being worked out now," he said. Mr Liu's remark apparently confirmed the implementation of the policy, originally scheduled for the beginning of next month, would very likely be delayed.
