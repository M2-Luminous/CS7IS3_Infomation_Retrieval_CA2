The speaker, Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani, is chairing the session. The opposition, ending their boycott of the National Assembly, participated in the proceedings of the house today. Speaking during question hour, the prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, said strict action will be taken against those responsible for the fire incident in the parliament building. She said her government believes in the rule of law and nobody is above the law. Committees and commissions were formed in the past, but no action was taken. The prime minister said the present government has launched a moral crusade and nobody will be spared. The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, has welcomed the opposition's decision to end the boycott of the National Assembly and described it as a positive step. Talking to newsmen at the Parliament House in Islamabad this afternoon, Ms. Benazir Bhutto said she had advised the opposition two days earlier to end their boycott and fulfill their constitutional responsibilities as elected representatives. She said she would also respond positively and invite the opposition leader and leaders of other political parties for discussions on economic issues over a cup of tea. Replying to a question regarding her challenge to the opposition for submitting their resignations, the prime minister said she was confident that they would not submit their resignations to the speaker of the National Assembly. It was her assessment as a political leader. She said after last year's just and fair election, the politics of resignations has come to an end. Those who are elected do not resign. To a question about the Sindh situation, Ms. Benazir Bhutto said the situation in the rural and urban areas of the province is serious for internal and external reasons. External forces have trained youths in the interior of Sindh as well in the cities for the purpose of terrorist activities and have provided them arms. In the past, only administrative steps had been taken to face the situation. We have decided to tackle the issue politically. She said her government, which is the people's government, is going to take long-term and short-term steps to resolve the problems faced by the people of Karachi. These include provision of drinking water, more electricity, transport and hospitals.
