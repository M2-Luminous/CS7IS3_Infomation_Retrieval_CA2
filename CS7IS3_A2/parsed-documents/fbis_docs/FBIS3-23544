He completed a construction tekhnikum and then, as an external student, passed the exams for the Omsk Higher Combined-Arms Command School. He served 26 years in the Transbaykal Military District. He is a colonel in the reserve. Last April the military district of the Transbaykal Cossack Army recommended his transfer from the position of ataman of the Chita Cossack District to adviser to the head of the oblast administration for Cossack affairs. [Davidyuk] To my knowledge, Viktor Aleksandrovich, the position of adviser for Cossack affairs to an administration has been established for the first time in Russia. What brought this about? [Matafonov] We have a lot of things for the first time. I shall get back to that. It is just that they have begun considering us. We have developed from a group initiating the rebirth of the Cossack community into a powerful force. There is a Cossack population of more than 60,000 in the Transbaykal today. These are patriotic-minded people. Even the oblast authorities have turned to us. Right now a special group is being set up under the administration, which will work on a comprehensive program of economic and cultural rebirth for the Transbaykal Cossacks. [Davidyuk] We have never had a shortage of good programs. But so many plans have remained just on paper.... [Matafonov] That will not be the case with us. I am now working directly with top oblast authorities. In areas with a dense Cossack population the atamans are frequently deputy chiefs for social support for the population in the rayon administrations. What do we have to show for this. It is far easier to resolve all pressing matters--the allocation of land, for example. I am not even referring to the preparation of the youth to serve in the army. We are in many ways the first in this as well. The first Cossack subunit in the Russian Army has been created in the Transbaykal Military District. This is the Daurskiy Cossack Company based with the Port Arthur Regiment. People throughout the nation have expressed thanks to "your Cossack outpost." I believe that this positive undertaking will be supported also in other regions of Russia. Two Cossack outposts have been set up on the border with Mongolia and China. They guard the border jointly with the border troops. We have concluded an agreement on this matter with the district command element, although the legal aspect has not yet been completely worked out. I am confident that this will be done in the immediate future, however. A Cossack patrol has been set up and is operating by agreement with the oblast administration and the governing body of the Transbaykal Cossack Army. It accompanies every train into the border zone together with law-enforcement agencies. It combats crime in rail transport. [Davidyuk] In short, when the rider mounts a horse rearing to go, he had better find the stirrup at once, as the Cossacks say. From every indication, the Transbaykal Cossacks have done so, have they not? [Matafonov] Yes, they have. There have been many obstacles on the path, though. The main problem is obtaining the money. We cannot pay wages. Thank you, Col-Gen Valeriy Stepanovich Tretyakov, district commander. He is coming to our rescue. The local administration is also chipping in. But this is all just kopecks. We need a lot of money to do a real job. Take the construction of villages, for example. There are many people who want to acquire their own farms. Right now 28 families want to move here from Kazakhstan. They are hereditary Transbaykal Cossacks, the Lonshakovs. They want to build a village on the Argun river. It is on the border with China. We shall try to help them. We have asked the government of Russia for help in paying for rail cars to move their household goods.... Some officers released into the reserve also want to remain here. We plan to settle them along the Argun. There are fantastically beautiful places there, and hunting and fishing. It is our strategic mission to settle the border region. There are empty areas, the villages are deteriorating, and neighbors are glancing our way with increasing frequency. We welcome guests, of course, but they will not receive any land. The situation is tense there. The question of the islands in the Argun has come to the fore once again, and demarcation is underway. We are keeping a close eye on the situation, and we do not intend to be sideline observers. [Davidyuk] You have with you an officer's saber. Where did you get it? [Matafonov] It was given to me by the district commander. [Davidyuk] Are you a hereditary Cossack? [Matafonov] Our Cossack line on my mother's side, the Razmakhnins, is around 300 years old. My grandfather Vasiliy Ivanovich Matafonov commanded the 1st Cavalry Regiment in the Civil War. His life, by the way, is described in the novel "Zabaikaltsy" [The People of the Transbaikal] by the well-known writer Vasiliy Balyabin. We are bringing up the new generation in our line, our Cossack children, properly and responsibly. But I digress. Let us get back to public matters. We have reached agreement with local television people. We are going to have our own program. The same goes for radio. In general, you will not stop us now. There is probably no force which could stop a Cossack. Or do you not agree? [Davidyuk] Not agree with you!...
