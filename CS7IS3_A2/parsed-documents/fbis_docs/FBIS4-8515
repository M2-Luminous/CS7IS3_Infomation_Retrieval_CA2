Gorazde correspondent Enes Musovic reports that "the chetniks are still at the access points to Gorazde. They have fiercely begun the 17th day of their offensive on Gorazde by firing all available weapons on residential areas and defense lines.

In the course of their butchering, fascist rampage, the chetniks yesterday set ablaze the villages of Kucine and Zmijuki and massacred the women and children. We have no information on the number of slaughtered and imprisoned. The number of villages that have been burned in this offensive alone has climbed to 30, while casualties and refugees amount to several thousand." Mirza Sadikovic, correspondent from Bihac, says that "Karadzic's terrorists overnight continued to attack the Bihac commune. Buzim, (?Plavas), [name indistinct], and other villages in the area continue to be the target of artillery attacks. The aggressor also fired at the positions of the defenders on this part of the Bosanksa Krupa front and on the Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau and Grabez. Several times the chetniks attempted infantry breakthroughs in these areas, but they were decisively repelled. The members of the paramilitary forces of the Kladusa traitors also continued their activity.

However, the defense lines are still the target of destructive howitzer, mortar, and tank shells."
