"Israel is trying to undermine Lebanon and Syria's reputations," the head of the national anti-drug commission, Sultan Haydar, told AFP. He dismissed as "provocation" a report published on May 27 by the Israeli daily MA'ARIV alleging that Israel was developing a "biological weapon" to destroy Lebanese poppy fields to end drug-trafficking across the border. "There isn't a single plant of hashish or poppy in the Ba'labakk-al-Hirmil region (of the al-Biqa')," Haydar said. "For the third consecutive year the Lebanese armed forces, assisted by the Syrian army, have eliminated drugs from that region and violators are being punished," added Haydar, who is also an advisor to the agriculture minister. A delegation of the UN Development Program for the fight against drugs in Lebanon was to start a five-day visit in Lebanon on Monday to discuss efforts to eradicate the growing of hashish and poppy from the al-Biqa' Valley. A spokesman for the Agriculture Ministry said the delegation would visit the Ba'labakk region in the al-Biqa' to get first hand information on the joint Lebanese-Syrian efforts. According to MA'ARIV the Israeli police last year called on the most advanced genetic engineering techniques to develop a gene, based on poppy derivatives, capable of destroying up to 70 percent of the Lebanese crop. Israel's coordinator in Lebanon Uri Lubrani told MA'ARIV that once there is peace with Syria and Lebanon "and the opening of borders I don't even want to think about the catastrophe that could take place." An Israeli police spokesman has declined to confirm or deny the report.
