According to UN observers, on the morning of 10 May the Bosnian Army, the Russian Foreign Ministry statement notes, fired mortars at the central part of the city of Brcko, which is under Bosnian Serb control. There are dead and wounded among its civilian population. The provocative actions by the Muslim side in what is currently the most explosive region of Bosnia and Herzegovina, carried out, moreover, on the eve of the Geneva meeting on achieving a Bosnian settlement, could lead to the gravest consequences, the Foreign Ministry spokesman pointed out. In condemning this action Russia insistently calls on all the sides involved in the Bosnian conflict to show maximum restraint and self-control at this crucial moment. It is time finally to discard illusions of a possible military solution and to resume negotiations immediately and unconditionally. Russia will in every way promote precisely such a course.
