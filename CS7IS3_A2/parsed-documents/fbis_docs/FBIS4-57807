This position, however, does not prevent me from advocating the alternatives I deem convenient within the judicial system. I share with you the interest in preserving the separation of government branches, especially the autonomy of the judicial branch. This belief does not mean unanimity, nor does it obstruct the pursuit of legal or constitutional alternatives. Rest assured that the government refuses to let this case be overblown.
