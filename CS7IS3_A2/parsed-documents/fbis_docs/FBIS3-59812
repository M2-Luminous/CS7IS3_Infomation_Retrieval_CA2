Some of the constitutional articles refer to the duties of the vice president but do not specify such duties. Rather, they refer to them in general terms. The source of these jurisdictions is the president of the republic; that is, he assigns to his deputy whatever tasks he may deem necessary. Article 82 of the Constitution provides that if a temporary hindrance arises that prevents the president of the republic from carrying out his jurisdictions he will assign the vice president to act on his behalf. But Article 84 of the Consitution says that in case the post of president becomes vacant or he becomes permanently incapable of carrying out his duties, the People's Assembly speaker assumes the post temporarily. If the Assembly is disbanded, he will be replaced by the chairman of the Higher Constitutional Court, on the condition that neither will be nominated for the presidency, as Clause 2 of Article 85 provides, until the vice president assumes the presidency temporarily pending judgment is passed on charge of high treason against the president of the republic or of committing a crime, on the basis of a proposal submitted by at least one-third of the People's Assembly members. The indictment shall be passed by a two-thirds majority, something that is almost impossible to happen. On the basis of this, we draw the following conclusion: First: The appointment of one vice president or more is optional for the president of the republic and not obligatory as it is in the case of appointing the prime minister, his deputies, the ministers, and their deputies (Article 141). Second: It is the president of the republic who determines the jurisdictions of the vice president or vice presidents and relieves them of their posts. This means that the post of vice president, like that of the ministers, is appointed and relieved of his posts by the president of the republic. Third: The vice president, if there is one, has no jurisdictions other than acting for the president in case of a temporary hindrance that prevents the president of the republic from exercising his jurisdictions. Briefly, there is no justification for the appointment of one vice president of the republic or more under the present constitution, particularly since President Husni Mubarak did not wish to use his right to appoint one vice president or more. Rather, during the past 12 years he remained without a deputy, thus using his constitutional right to that. We believe that the new constitution could provide for the election of a vice president alobg with a vice president who would automatically take over powers in case the president is temporarily absent. He will assume the presidency until the expiration of the president's term, in case the post of president of the republic becomes vacant or the president will be permanently incapacitated.
