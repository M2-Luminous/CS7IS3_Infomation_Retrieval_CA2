The world body should consider "correctives to the effects of the sanctions," Secretary of State Cardinal Angelo Sodano said in an interview with Vatican Radio. The cardinal urged the setting up of a "system permitting independent and effective control of the humanitarian consequences of sanctions." He said the Serbian Orthodox patriarchate had sought the aid of Pope John Paul II in "drawing the attention of the international community to the serious consequences of the sanctions." The UN Security Council imposed economic sanctions against Serbia and its ally Montenegro in May 1992 for Belgrade's support for Serb separatist forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The legitimacy of decisions by the international community "never obviates the need for attention to the actual fate of civilian populations," he said. Sanctions "must never be a means of war or of punishment of a people." They must "remain a temporary means of pressure on governments whose actions endanger international peace...(and) always be accompanied by dialogue between those involved, not just in Serbia but elsewhere, in Iraq or Haiti." The Vatican has made regular contacts with Security Council members to examine the possibility of easing the negative effects of sanctions with regard to humanitarian welfare.
