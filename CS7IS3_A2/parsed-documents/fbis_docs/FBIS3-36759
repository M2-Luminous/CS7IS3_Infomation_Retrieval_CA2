"From the storm and stress of the first few years of reforms, we are going over to more thorough constructive work, which involves deeper structures and institutions of the economy. The government should be up to this work, and therefore it has taken a somewhat new form," Chernomyrdin said at a meeting in the Interior Ministry on Tuesday. "The president's policy of deep-going democratic reforms in Russian society, in its economy and political institutions will be continued and will be aimed at meeting the strategic interests of Russia," the prime minister said. He said only the president and Constitution, not any of the present or former members of government, were guarantors of the reforms, which meant the demands for the revision of that policy were aimed against the president rather than the government, he said. "I am proud that I come from the `Red' enterprise managers. What is really bad is that those who are now seeking power have no experience and would run experiments on the whole country," Chernomyrdin said to the stormy applause of his listeners. He admitted that the previous month had been marked by a new serious bout of inflation. He said inflation and the present grave financial situation were the number-one problem for the government, which would focus on "a reasonably tough policy of financial stabilization and measures to curb inflation as much as possible." The premier said the government would tightly control budgetary expenditures this year. "Most of the promises will be kept," and the government is determined to pay all its debts for 1993, he said. "The people will understand that we finally have to live within our means. The government will no longer deceive or delude anyone," he said.
