And major banks announced last night they would earmark special funds to help farmers procure raw materials. Chinese sources said in spite of the satisfactory harvests last year, the leadership was worried that the desired yields for staples such as grain, cotton and other foodstuff would gradually fall because of farmers' dwindling enthusiasm for these traditional pursuits. A key item on the agenda yesterday was the extent to which procurement prices should be raised. Moreover, to prevent the recurrence of the peasant riots last year, the authorities weighed the possibilities of further lowering agrarian taxes. In a circular yesterday, banks, including the People's Bank of China and the Agriculture Bank, said they would ensure that farmers get enough loans for supplies such as fertilizers and pesticides. "To ensure that farmers can carry out their seasonal work, loans to them should be distributed in good time," the circular added. Analysts said Beijing wanted to reimpose some form of production quotas on various provinces with regard to essential produce. However, regions, particularly industrialized provinces such as Guangdong, had raised objections. Last week, legislators from Guangdong were told they should no longer rely on grain from other provinces or on imports. [passage omitted]
