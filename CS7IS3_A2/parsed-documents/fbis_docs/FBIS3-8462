Here are excerpts from the conversation: [Begin recording] [Ladisic] What has been promised to you, President Izetbegovic, what do you expect from this federation in Bosnia and the confederation with Croatia? [Izetbegovic] I must say that this agreement is a result of our interests -- they did not have to bribe us or pay us to conclude it. However, they told us, the most authoritative instances -- they told both us and Croatian officials, I believe they told President Tudjman -- that Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia will have an open door to all forms of European integration. Step by step, of course, but this door will remain open and we will receive lavish support for the reconstruction of the war-ravaged parts of the country. We will receive financial aid. They were unequivocal in this. Of course, we Bosnians were told that Western forces would come and help out in the implementation of what has been agreed. [Ladisic] President Izetbegovic, would you agree to a single Bosnia-Herzegovina if the Serbs consented to remain in Bosnia-Herzegovina but made this conditional on the creation of a confederation between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia? [Izetbegovic] I believe I can give a brief reply to that: out of the question. [Ladisic] Does that mean that the creation of a new Yugoslavia under pressure from the world powers would also be out of the question? [Izetbegovic] I think there is too much speculation surrounding the world powers' ideas on the creation of a new Yugoslavia. As far as I could deduce from my contacts, such an idea is not being entertained by serious, responsible people in the West. I am not saying that certain individuals are not in favor of such a thing, but I believe that such an idea is not being voiced as a realistic possibility -- I have not heard anything to this effect so far, in any form. There has been talk about certain forms of cooperation between the states created on the ruins of the old Yugoslavia -- economic cooperation -- but nobody had even hinted at the creation of some state entity.
