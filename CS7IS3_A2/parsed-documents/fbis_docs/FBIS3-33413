Well, at least this is what Manuel Camacho [the commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas] called him. Commander Marcos, or subcommander if you prefer, who has become a full-fledged legend, today answered questions posed by domestic and international reporters during a news conference that lasted nearly two hours. Today, Commander Marcos got up early, invited radio reporters to come over to the San Cristobal de las Casas Cathedral, and talked with them from 0700 to 0900. The subcommander said he would talk about any issue presented by reporters, but he ended up saying what he wanted. He asserted that the achievement of democracy in Mexico has to start with the will of the entire nation and that national issues cannot be agreed upon at the San Cristobal de las Casas bargaining table. In this way, the subcommander changed his position from the one he held after the first peace and reconciliation meeting. At that time, and contrary to Camacho's position, Marcos stated that national-level issues would be included in the agenda. It seems Camacho has won yet another point.
