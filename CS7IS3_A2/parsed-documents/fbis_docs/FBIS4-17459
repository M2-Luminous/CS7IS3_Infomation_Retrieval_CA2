They were led by the two countries' defense ministers, Pavel Grachev and Vitaliy Radetskyy. Of the 833 Black Sea Fleet ships and vessels, 669 units will go to Russia, which makes up nearly 85 percent. The Ukrainian side will receive 164 ships and boats (15 percent). Moreover, proceeding from the previously reached accords, Russia will pay the Ukraine compensation for 255 vessels. No agreement has yet been reached on the problem of the separate basing of the fleets. Ukraine insists on siting the headquarters of its navy in Sevastopol, and does not rule out the basing of its ships there as well. Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian defense minister, stressed that this stance deviates from the agreement signed on 15 April in Moscow by Boris Yeltsin and Leonid Kravchuk. The Russian minister declared that it is unlikely that a start can be made on dividing up the fleet without resolving the problem of the separate bases. Pavel Grachev left Sevastopol for Moscow today.
