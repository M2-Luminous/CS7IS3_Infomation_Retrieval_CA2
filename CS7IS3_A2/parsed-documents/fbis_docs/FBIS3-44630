It relayed the guidelines of the national economic work conference and made initial arrangements for Beijing's 1994 reform and development based on the requirements of the "decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th Party Central Committee and the national economic work conference. Chen Xitong, secretary of the municipal party committee, attended the meeting, and Mayor Li Qiyan gave a report. Li Qiyan relayed the major guidelines of the national economic work conference and spoke on Beijing's 1993 economic work. He said: This year is the first year for the new municipal government to carry out its work. Thanks to the correct leadership of the party Central Committee, the State Council, and the municipal party committee and the support of the various democratic parties and friends outside the party, the people throughout the municipality have conscientiously studied Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, adhered to the party's basic line, and, based on Beijing's specific conditions, further emancipated the mind and comprehensively accelerated reform and opening up with new ideas and large-scale measures. Thanks to the good foundation laid by the previous government, the economy has developed in a sustained, rapid, and healthy manner, and it is certain that the goal of "making this year's achievements surpass last year's" will be attained. Li Qiyan said: Beijing's gross domestic product is expected to reach 84.5 billion yuan this year, up 11.8 percent in terms of comparable prices. We conquered the catastrophic drought unheard of in 50 years to make this year the 16th bumper harvest year in a row. Grain per-unit yield and total output set new records, the production of a wide range of farm and sideline products increased, and market supplies were ample. The output value of township enterprises is expected at 56.8 billion yuan, up 53.3 percent from the preceding year. In industry, we overcame numerous unfavorable factors to maintain a fairly high growth rate. Industrial output value is expected at 124 billion yuan. Economic benefits grew basically at the same pace with production, industrial technology advanced more rapidly, adjustment of industrial composition was accelerated, readily marketable new products increased, and product quality improved. The tertiary industry developed continuously, and construction of large commercial and service facilities and development of new trades were expedited. The proportion of the tertiary industry is expected to reach 46.3 percent, nearly 2 percentage points higher than in the preceding year. Local revenue is expected at 8.41 billion yuan, up 4.8 percent. Markets were brisk, and retail sales are expected at more than 54 billion yuan, up 27 percent. Li Qiyan said: Urban construction was expedited in the past year, and, with a large number of key water, electricity, gas, and heat supply projects, roads, and telecommunication projects completed, eye-catching changes took place in urban and rural areas. The expressway to the Shoudu Airport, the renovation of the east third ring road, Guangning Road, the Beijing section of Beijing- Shijiazhuang Expressway, and Migu road were completed and opened to traffic. The Beijing key post and telecommunication project passed state inspection. Construction of the large Jingtang Harbor, Beijing west railway station, and Gaobeidian sewage treatment plant, and other key projects proceeded smoothly. Houses totaling 10 million square meters in floor space are expected to complete in urban and rural areas, of which 6 million square meters will be residential houses. New achievements were also won in tree planting to green and beautify the city. Li Qiyan said: The municipality achieved new progress in science and education. Urban and rural people's living standard was raised to a new level. The increase in urban people's per capita cost of living income is expected to be 8 percentage points higher than price increase, and peasants' per capita income is expected at 2,123 yuan. New breakthroughs were made in the reform focusing on establishing the socialist market economy system and transforming enterprises' operating mechanism. The endeavor of opening to the outside world developed in unprecedented range and quality. Speaking on the initial arrangements for next year's economic work, Li Qiyan said: Next year is an extremely important year for comprehensively implementing the "decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th party Central Committee and establishing the socialist market economy system more rapidly. It is also a crucial year for accelerating the socialist modernization of the capital and striving for a fairly comfortable standard of living three years ahead of schedule. Based on the guidelines and arrangements of the national economic work conference, the municipal government has conducted repeated study of next year's economic work. The basic idea for next year's economic work is to emancipate the mind, seize the opportunity to accelerate reform, opening up, and economic development, and strive for the fairly comfortable standard of living three years ahead of schedule. Emphasis should be placed on the following work next year. First, focusing on establishing the modern enterprise system and macroeconomic regulating and control system, we should establish the socialist market economy system more rapidly. Second, We should open wider to the outside world to achieve a new breakthrough in using foreign capital. Third, we should optimize the industrial composition, improve economic efficiency, and maintain the good trend of rapid development in urban and rural economy. Fourth, we should have the greatest determination and devote utmost efforts to speed up construction of urban infrastructural facilities and raise the modernization level of urban and rural areas. Fifth, we should develop the advantage in our status as the national capital and accelerate scientific and technological progress and personnel training. Li Qiyan emphasized: To complete next year's work smoothly, leading cadres at all levels should keep their understanding in pace with the developing situation. They should, first of all, further emancipate their minds. In accelerating the establishment of the new system of the socialist market economy and the capital's modernization drive, we will face many unprecedented new tasks, and bold explorations are urgently needed. Whether the urban and rural economy, reform, and opening up of the capital can be developed greatly is determined by whether leading cadres at all levels can greatly emancipate their minds. Some leading cadres still fail to fully emancipate their minds. This problem remains conspicuous in some aspects. How should they further emancipate their minds? Based on Beijing's reality, leading cadres at all levels should further emancipate their minds concerning the endeavors of extending the degree of reform and opening wider to the outside world, with the focus on establishing the new system of the socialist market economy more rapidly. They should emancipate their minds to resolve the difficulties and problems in economic development and to meet the requirements for achieving sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development and the fairly comfortable standard of living ahead of schedule. When their minds are emancipated and when they truly proceed from Beijing's reality, they will have new ideas and adopt large-scale measures to promote Beijing's work continuously. [passage omitted]
