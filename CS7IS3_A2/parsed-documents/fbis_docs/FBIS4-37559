The appeal says: The Sanaa regime, as you know, has launched an attack on the people of the Democratic Republic of Yemen. It has destroyed villages, looted public and private property, and pillaged everything in the areas it has managed to occupy. Not even hospitals have escaped shelling and the theft of equipment which is subsequently dispatched to the north. The hospitals are then converted into weapons and ammunition depots. [Words indistinct] Ibn Khaldun Hospital donated by the fraternal State of Kuwait. [passage omitted] The situation in all the occupied areas, particularly in the villages and the areas where battles have taken place, shows signs of a health disaster due to the northern forces' abandonment of their dead, who are left to rot. Sometimes they (?bury) them in an inhuman way by using tractors but the wind removes the sand covering them. Bodies are exposed causing a great deal of (?distress). The Sanaa regime, which is not concerned about its own citizens, alive or dead, cannot be concerned about our citizens and cannot be a regime [word indistinct] the destiny of our people. [passage omitted] His Excellency Lakhdar Brahimi came as an envoy of the UN secretary general and we heard his initiatives with all seriousness. He did not need to waste his time with us. In fact he spent no more than 24 hours in the Democratic Republic of Yemen. He left the country after meeting the Brother President 'Ali Salim al- Bid, the brother prime minister, and his deputies in two meetings in which he found responsiveness to all his initiatives and proposals. He spent five days in Sanaa but was unable to convince the Sanaa regime to respond in a practical way to UN Security Council Resolution Number 924 or any other initiative. In Cairo he also spent two days trying to convince Sanaa about his initiative but to no avail, whereas he found from all of us responsiveness and serious [word indistinct]. [passage omitted] In view of the foregoing, we appeal to the world, represented by the UN secretary general, international organizations, and all countries to move speedily with the aim of achieving the following objectives: 1. Stop the barbarous attacks on the residential quarters of Aden and the destruction of vital installations in which hundreds have been killed and wounded. 2. Put an end to this crazy war which has no justification whatsoever according to religion, law, or norms. The Sanaa regime is challenging the whole world by means of this war. 3. Effect a complete withdrawal from the territory of the Democratic Republic of Yemen and prevent any troop concentration on its borders. 4. Force this totalitarian regime to pay compensation for all the material and human losses it has inflicted on the people, territory, installations, and equipment of the Democratic Republic of Yemen. It was this regime which declared war and launched the aggression. It has continued its aggression, rejecting all international resolutions and appeals and challenging international legitimacy. 5. Provide urgent (?medical) treatment and assistance for our citizens in the areas occupied in the Governorates of Lahij, Abyan, and Shabwah; protect the citizens there from repressive measures, looting, and pillaging of their possessions and public property; and oversee and repair water and electricity services. It should be stressed that such assistance must not be provided through the Sanaa regime but under the direct supervision of the international organizations. 7. [number as heard] We ask the Arab and Muslim countries and the friendly countries of the world to recognize the Democratic Republic of Yemen as a sovereign and independent state and to accept its membership in all organizations and bodies -- regional, Arab and international -- since the Sanaa regime lost all lawful, constitutional, and international legitimacy after declaring war on our Republic and after rejecting all the resolutions and appeals from the international community. The Sanaa regime cannot be trusted any more, even with the lives, possessions, and destiny of its own people in the north. How can we trust such a regime with our people in the Democratic Republic of Yemen? The Democratic Republic of Yemen is not a new thing, as it was, originally, a sovereign independent state. It attempted to set up a union with the Yemen Arab Republic neither committed itself to nor respected. It has now been confirmed that the Sanaa regime does not respect or uphold any local or international agreements and rules. Consequently it has lost all legitimacy and cannot make claims in the name of a previous unity, which it has itself destroyed, or under any other pretext. The Sanaa regime is not the inheritor of any history or legacy or religion. It has not been mandated with this. Consequently the declaration of the Democratic Republic of Yemen is a return to an original position and not a new thing or an invention. The Democratic Republic of Yemen is committed to the Arab League Charter and to the UN Charter as well as to all other international organizations. It is also committed to all legal agreements in force concluded during the period of the Yemeni Republic which apply to the territory and [word indistinct] of the Democratic Republic of Yemen. We pledge to preserve the interests of others in our country, and to cooperate and work seriously to achieve security and stability in the region and the world. The international community bears a political and humanitarian responsibility vis-a-vis the situation in our country. We are confident that it will assume that responsibility to achieve and preserve the interests of people and their political, economic, social, and cultural rights and ensure security and stability in the region and the world.
