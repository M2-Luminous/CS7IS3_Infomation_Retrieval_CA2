Yevgenyev "Commentary": "Fighting Monopolies: Act Two"] [Text] Someone has already made the following somewhat sarcastic comment about the "State Program for the Demonopolization of the Economy and the Development of Competition on the Russian Federation Markets": It will outlive the people who produced it. I must admit that the cavalry charge on Russian monopolies came to nothing. Attempts to put the 2,000 enterprises which dominate the national market on a separate register and change their economic behavior by means of state regulation have not worked as expected. No one was particularly frightened by the barrier in the form of profitability threshold. Enterprises learned easily to bypass it, generally by artificially inflating costs. It is time to adjust tactics. The main purpose of the program that has been formulated is to change the actual monopolized structure of our market which developed during the reign of the administrative edict system. The Antimonopoly Committee alone is not up to the job. The territories and sectors need to take part, and the legislative base must be broadened. The new program makes provision for all that. It does not duplicate but supplements the well-known Law "On Competition and on Restricting Monopolist Activity on Commodity Markets." The plan is to draft a whole package of legislative acts that will promote the development of competition in various spheres of economic life. And it is proposed to start with the Law "On Monopolies." As for so-called temporary monopolies, the intention is to bring pressure to bear upon them -- not by restrictions or fines (the well-known register ceased to exist 1 January) but by creating a competitive environment, taking each individual case on its merits. Sectors and territories formulating and coordinating their demonopolization programs are to decide how specifically this is to be done. If there is a metalworking plant in an oblast, for instance, which meets the oblast's needs, this does not mean that another one should immediately be built in the neighborhood. It may be more advisable to convert a former "secret institution" and create sound competition. But representatives of sectors and regions must decide what is better and more effective by coming face to face at a "roundtable." An Interdepartmental Commission for Competition Policy led by First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets has been set up to coordinate their interests. There is another reason for such extensive representation, Izabella Fomina, head of the State Committee for Anti-Monopoly Policy and Support of the New Economic Structures Scientific and Technical Administration, thinks. Imagine the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Fuel and Energy examining a plan for the demonopolization of their sectors, while their customers sit alongside and are able to evaluate all this because they deal with these highly monopolized departments' prices every day. Of course, you cannot tackle everything. That is why, along with general targets and recommendations, the program highlights the priorities -- transport (apart from railroad transport), communications, machine building, and construction.
