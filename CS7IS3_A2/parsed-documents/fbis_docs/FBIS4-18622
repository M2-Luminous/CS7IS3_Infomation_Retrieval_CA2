Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev had held out the prospect of this date, but since then Moscow is continuing to blow hot and cold about PfP. A day after the Foreign Ministry said that 21 April would "probably" be maintained, yesterday another interview appeared in which President Boris Yeltsin said that "Russia was not in a hurry." "We hope and expect that Russia will come and sign on 21 April, but that date has never been officially confirmed," a NATO source told us yesterday. In the interview with the INTERFAX press agency, Yeltsin said that cooperation between NATO and Russia "would have to be different in scope and content from cooperation with other countries." He was thinking of a "special agreement which expressed the place and role of Russia in European and world affairs and the military power and nuclear status of our country." This is where the problem lies. Russia does not want to be treated in the same way as the 14 countries from the former East Bloc which have so far joined the PfP. It is demanding a special partnership which, according to various statements, would mean among other things that NATO and Russia would jointly guarantee the security of the countries of Central and East Europe. The latter point is resolutely rejected by these countries, which want no new form of Russian guardianship. Many of these countries, led by the four Central European countries, are pushing for full NATO membership, which Russia is opposing strongly. NATO sources told us yesterday that in Russia there appeared to be some misunderstandings about the PfP, which the NATO summit of mid-January offered to all the member countries of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. The 16 NATO countries invited these countries to cooperate with the alliance on the basis of their needs and possibilities. The PfP offers an extensive menu containing various forms of political and military cooperation for this purpose -- from help with drawing up military budgets to joint peacekeeping exercises. Therefore cooperation takes place in various stages, according to a NATO source. "The first stage is signing a framework agreement, in which the country shows that it is ready to cooperate with NATO," the source said. "In a second stage the partners present a presentation document, in which they indicate the precise areas in which they want to cooperate. If agreement is reached on this with the NATO Council, then concrete cooperation can begin." "Special" The source said that in this sense every agreement between the sixteen allies and a PfP member is a "special agreement," because every agreement is specifically designed to match the partner's wishes, needs and possibilities. "Once Russia has signed the framework agreement, it can put forward a presentation agreement which takes account of its specific needs," the source said. The source did not think that the alliance would work out a special framework agreement for Russia. "The PfP was signed by the heads of state and government leaders of the 16 member countries," the source said. "I find it difficult to imagine that they would meet again to work out a special membership arrangement for Russia." The NATO sources stressed that the alliance, "in contrast to what is sometimes claimed in Russia," was seeking a security structure in Europe "with Russia, not without Russia." At present, studies are being made in NATO to see how the future relationship between Russia and the alliance should look. "Of course this takes account of the status of Russia as a big country, a nuclear power, and permanent member of the Security Council," the source said. At the end of February a delegation made up of the U.S., British and Spanish ambassadors to NATO flew to Moscow to convince Russia to join the PfP. In early March Kozyrev announced that Russia would sign the PfP framework agreement on 21 April. But, since then, the services of President Yeltsin have sown doubt on the issue more than once. At NATO headquarters in Evere they are now waiting to see whether Russia will become the fifteenth partner on 21 April.
