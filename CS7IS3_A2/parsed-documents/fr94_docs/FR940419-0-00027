FR940419-0-00027 FR940419-0-00009 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Coast Guard 33 CFR Part 165 [CGD01&hyph;94&hyph;025] RIN 2115&hyph;AA97 Safety Zone; New England Training Institute Conference Fireworks, Burlington Harbor, VT AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Temporary final rule. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone for the New England Training Institute Conference Fireworks in Burlington Harbor. This event is sponsored by the Burlington Department of Parks and Recreation and will take place from 9 p.m. until 9:30 p.m. on April 24, 1994. This safety zone is needed to protect the boating public from the hazards associated with fireworks exploding in the area. EFFECTIVE DATE: This rule is effective from 9 p.m. until 9:30 p.m. on April 24, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: LT R. Trabocchi, Project Manager, Captain of the Port, New York, (212) 668&hyph;7933. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Drafting Information The drafters of this notice are LT R. Trabocchi, Project Manager, Captain of the Port, New York and CDR J. Astley, Project Attorney, First Coast Guard District, Legal Office. Regulatory History Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking was not published for this regulation and good cause exists for making it effective less than 30 days after Federal Register publication. Due to the date this application was received, there was not sufficient time to publish a proposed rule in advance of the event. Publishing a NPRM and delaying the event would be contrary to public interest since the fireworks display is for public viewing. Background and Purpose On March 4, 1994, the Burlington Department of Parks and Recreation submitted an application to hold a fireworks program at Burlington Waterfront Park, Burlington, Vermont. This regulation establishes a temporary safety zone in all waters of Burlington Harbor within 250 feet of a point located on the southern corner of Burlington Waterfront Park at or near 44 ○28 ’45 ’ ’ N latitude 73 ○13 ’20 ’ ’ W longitude. This safety zone is needed to protect boaters from the hazards associated with fireworks exploding in the area. No vessel will be permitted to enter or move within this safety zone unless authorized to do so by the Coast Guard Captain of the Port, New York. Regulatory Evaluation This regulation is not major under Executive Order 12291 and not significant under Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). No vessel traffic is permitted to transit within 250 feet of a point located on the southern corner of Burlington Waterfront Park in Burlington Harbor. Due to the limited duration of the event, the extensive advisories that will be made, and the limited traffic in the area at this time, and the fact that vessel traffic can safely transit around this zone, the Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this regulation to be so minimal that a Regulatory Evaluation is unnecessary. Small Entities Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this regulation will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under Section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). For the reasons given in the Regulatory Evaluation, the Coast Guard expects the impact of this regulation to be minimal. The Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Collection of Information This regulation contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501).
