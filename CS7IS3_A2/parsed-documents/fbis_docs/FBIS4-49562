Although specific figures are not available, an official with the bank said BOC depositors usually account for about 65 per cent of the country's total individual foreign exchange savings. The official said bigger foreign exchange savings give the bank more capital for supporting domestic and foreign-funded ventures. The official said the bank's individual savings have been accelerating since the beginning of last year. In the past 16 months, deposits have risen by $4 billion, an average of $250 million a month. The official attributed the high growth to the country's opening to the outside world, which has given Chinese more access to foreign exchange. Domestic institutions and firms have assigned more people to work in overseas affiliates, and more labourers have been sent abroad on engineering projects. Meanwhile, more Chinese residents have gone abroad to study or tour the official said. The foreign exchange they bring back is the major source of the Bank of China's individual savings. The official noted that more foreigners and residents of Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan have entered the Chinese mainland. Part of their foreign exchange usually flows to relatives and friends in the mainland. Furthermore, Chinese self-employed businessmen usually put their money in banks in the name of individuals instead of firms. All these have created wider sources of foreign exchange. At the same time, though, limits remain on how foreign exchange can be spent, thus ensuring healthy bank deposits. Although the China Investment Bank has permission to sell $50 million worth of foreign-currency bonds to individual Chinese, these bonds have not yet been issued. With few alternatives for spending their foreign currency, many Chinese prefer to put the money in banks even though the interest rate is relatively low compared with renminbi deposits. Although the bank has raised the interest rate for foreign exchange accounts three times this year, the rate for one-year fixed-term savings in U.S. dollars is still only 4.3125 per cent, compared with 10.98 per cent for renminbi. The official said the devaluation of the renminbi has also induced Chinese to put their foreign exchange in banks to protect its value. The Bank of China started its individual foreign exchange savings in 1984. Its more than 8,000 outlets accept savings in six currencies: U.S. dollar, Hong Kong dollar, British pound, Deutsche mark, Japanese yen and French franc.
