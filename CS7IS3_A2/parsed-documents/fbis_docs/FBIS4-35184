In a commentary today, the paper adds that these attacks pose grave threats to the region in general and to the Middle East peace process in particular. Israel's impudence and arrogance are the result of the direct political support provided by the United States at the Security Council, the paper notes. AL-BA'TH rejects the feeble justifications made by Washington and other states supporting Israel at the Security Council to explain their positions on the Israeli crimes. The paper says these justifications try to hold the national resistance responsible for Israeli practices. It emphasizes that resistance is a legitimate and sacred right for anyone subjected to aggression and injustice. Concluding, the paper says: The deteriorating situation in southern Lebanon is an alarm that requires a swift international move to save both southern Lebanon and the peace process, which is facing a difficult impasse.
