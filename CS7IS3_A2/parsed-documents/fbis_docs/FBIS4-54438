However, he told journalists, the government's capacity for action was thorn-free. "This tension has a working nature only," he stressed, asked about relations between Privatization Minister Milan Janicina and Economy Minister Petr Magvasi. Janicina favors the rapid transfer of state property into private hands, chiefly by means of the coupon privatization method, while Magvasi, a Democratic Left Party (SDL) candidate, is for standard methods. In the background of the dispute, however, can be felt the influence of the left-wing in the leadership of state companies and that of the right in the privatization funds. Moravcik admitted that the privatization funds and the large state companies were a factor in privatization policy, but said he would not be inclined to directly relate the conflict of these interests to the relations between Ministers Magvasi and Janicina. The government has not yet made a definitive decision on how much of the state property, valued at over 200 billion crowns ($6.6 billion), would be privatized by the coupon method, which could gain votes before the autumn elections. At present a media debate is going on between supporters and opponents of the method. Asked whether the SDL was blocking the bankruptcies of loss- making state companies, Moravcik replied that the government had not yet decided what part bankruptcies should play in dealing with the problems of the Slovak economy. The government had to take the whole situation into account, he said, adding that an acceptable level of employment had to be maintained. Unemployment in Slovakia stands at 15 percent. In some areas, one in four of the working-age population is without work. On another controversial point -- the approval of conditions set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the provision of loans -- Moravcik said that the government was still considering specific inroads into the expenditures and revenue of the state budget. Last week Moravcik said that negotiations with the IMF had shown the necessity of increasing several taxes, and of limiting agricultural subsidies, in order for the budget deficit to remain below four percent of the gross national product. However, Agriculture Minister Pavol Koncos today rejected any sort of reduction in subsidies to farming, stressing that only parliament could decide on changes in individual parts of the budget. "On this point I differ with the premier," Koncos told CTK.
