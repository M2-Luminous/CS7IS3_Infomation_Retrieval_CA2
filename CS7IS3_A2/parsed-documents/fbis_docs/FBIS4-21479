The committee considered ways of decreasing Finland's carbon dioxide emissions to conform to the Rio pact. In addition to effective energy conservation and an enduring forest policy, the committee wants to modernize autos, increase research on energy, and restore drained marshes to their natural state. The generation of carbon dioxide emissions will also be prevented by cutting down on waste. The committee also proposes an increase in the protection of large timber stands and old forests and that trees be allowed to grow older than they are at present. Forests serve to absorb carbon dioxide, that is, trees bind the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to themselves. In the committee's opinion, making more efficient use of our forests would only slightly lessen the role of absorption. The committee estimates that the amount of growing timber in areas used by the forest industry will increase from 1.8 billion cubic meters to about 2.05 billion by the year 2000 if logging operations remain at their present level. The amount of carbon contained in the entire timber stand would increase from about 600 million tons to about 730 million. The average amount of carbon dioxide absorbed during this period would be over 40 million tons a year, whereas the figure was about 27 million tons in the late 1980's. Absorption problems will only arise if logging operations rise to over 70 million cubic meters a year. Rio Agreement Goes Into Effect Next Month According to the agreement on climate concluded in Rio in 1992, emissions of greenhouse gases must be stabilized by the turn of the century and restored to their 1990 level. The agreement is to go into effect in a month since 50 countries have ratified it. Ratification is pending in Finland, but parliament will decide on the matter this spring. The committee submitted its proposal to Environment Minister Sirpa Pietikainen (Conservative) on Friday [4 February]. ``It is not impossible to achieve this goal, although the target set for the industrial nations is a very exacting one. We need long-term decisions on energy taxes based on carbon dioxide,'' Pietikainen said. According to her, we must advance at the pace of the other industrial nations in adopting taxes so that Finland's ability to compete will not suffer. According to Pietikainen, just as with investments in [cleaning up] the environment made in Estonia and Russia, projects involving reforestation in developing countries will probably be chalked up to Finland's credit when each country's carbon dioxide balance sheet is determined. The countries that have ratified the agreement on climate will decide on the matter in future follow-up negotiations. Pietikainen estimated that the reduction of carbon dioxide in neighboring areas by perhaps 2 million tons would count in Finland's favor. The committee does not reject the alternative of additional nuclear power, even though parliament did decide to rule out construction of a fifth nuclear power plant. The chairman of the committee, Jorma Routti, stated that there would be a need for resorting to the nuclear alternative in Finland in the long run. Carbon dioxide is the most important greenhouse gas; the others are CFC compounds, methane, and nitrous oxide. Finland produced 58 millon tons of carbon dioxide emissions in 1990. All greenhouse gases totaled about 80 million tons. Nearly 30 million tons of carbon dioxide are bound in forests every year. No Simple Solution The increase in concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may alter the earth's climate and natural environment. There are no simple ways of solving the greenhouse problem: Simple solutions are not enough. The committee summarized its proposal in 17 points: - Implement a government energy conservation program. - Adopt taxes on carbon dioxide in such a way that our ability to compete internationally is not weakened. - Subsidies for investments that conserve energy. - Research and development on more efficient production of energy. - Modernize cars, more public transportation. - Research on community structure. - More natural gas. - An increase in the use of bioenergy, that is, wood. - Maintain a willingness to use more nuclear power if this meets with public approval. - Restoration of drained marshes to their natural state. - Reduce community waste. - Reduce the need for fertilizers, whereupon nitrous oxide emissions will decrease. - Increase the use of incineration technology and exhaust gas conversion devices. - See to it that forest carbon reserves increase and that the carbon stored in forests and marshes is not released into the atmosphere. - Support research on the total amounts of greenhouse gases and the amounts absorbed. - Active cooperation with Estonia and Russia to conserve energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. - Promote reforestation, restoration, and energy projects in connection with aid for development. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Carbon Dioxide Emissions Due to Energy Production and Use in Finland in 1990 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Source |Amount (millions of tons) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Industry |23 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Households |12 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Services |5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Traffic |12 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Other |2.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Source: Carbon Dioxide Committee's second report, 1994. | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
