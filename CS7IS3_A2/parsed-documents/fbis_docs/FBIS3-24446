A Director's View of Economic Policy in Russia"] [Text] Everything on earth obeys the main law of nature--the law of energy conservation. It would not be bypassed or skirted. Manufacturing lives by this law (as one of the forms of its manifestation) in the course of monetary servicing on the market. The formula is simple: The stock of goods times the price equals money times the velocity of circulation. It is impossible to violate this axiom. However, it appears that there are people in our society who, having made it to large official suites, believe that they can amend the norms of existence ordained by nature. Having pulled a snow job on the people about the economy's being reoriented toward a worthy life, these reformers, who actually operated to narrowly corporate, mercenary ends, staged a big game under the name "economic reforms." Well, the worthy life of the people is really ensured by an appropriate stock of goods. In the broad meaning of the word, this means an ecologically pure habitat, health care, dwellings, amenities in daily life and at the place of work, food, availability of services, and the spiritual content of life. The goal of a society is to have an abundance of all of this. Just one question remains: How are we to arrive at such a supply? This is where the "reformers" disregarded the law of the conservation of energy. Prices were decontrolled, and they shot up. Manufacturers did not profit by this, but rather the resellers and those above and around them did. The "reformers" calculated and "bolstered" this with requisite tax and price policies. The results were not long in coming. Given the high prices for materials and subcontracted supplies for their products, manufacturers needed additional funds. Where were they to be had? Of course, at a bank, with interest. The firm financial policy immediately inflated the bank credit rate to 213 percent a year! Once again, those into whose pockets this interest flowed through the banks ended up in the money. Let us move on. One must manufacture and sell his products very quickly in order to maintain manufacturing in the environment of high prices and a shortage of money. However, the "fathers of the reform" had thought about this move, too. Someone arranged things so that the processing of payments was slowed down to infinity. The funds retained by the banks were put to use yet again, and once again contributed to the profits of those who were originators of the "reformist idea" in question. However, the aforementioned sources of profiteering are but a secondary product of the excesses in the transformation of the economy. The primary, key result of experimentation with the country can be deduced from the already mentioned enduring equality of the energy balance in nature, and then in the opposite sense. The essence of it is such: Strictly in keeping with the law of the conservation of energy, a small amount of money times the low velocity of circulation divided by high prices brings manufacturing to zero (to being wound down and destroyed). This means loss of jobs and mass unemployment first, and subsequently the hemorrhaging of intellectual, highly skilled labor and the consistent reduction of the nation to a source of primitive labor on the world labor market. The disintegration of the state follows inevitably. I will say frankly that I do not believe in the ability of the presidential structures and the government to effectively adjust the economic course being pursued without coercion by the entire people. The repeated collective proposals by manufacturers from many regions of the country to the government to cooperate in developing and implementing a creative economic policy, made in vain over a period of two years, are grounds for my mistrust. So, is everything lost, and are we doomed as a nation? I believe that there still is an opportunity for rebirth, provided, of course, that we take immediate action to preserve the fruitful energy of the nation. First. Manufacturers representing all forms of ownership should unite around the banner of the Federation of Manufacturers of Russia (FTR) for joint, organized actions in the name of bringing back domestic manufacturing at a new scientific-technical level, and should support the declaration of the Second Congress of Manufacturers. Second. The Federal Assembly and the FTR should proclaim 1994 the year of a people's revision of economic reforms. Third. Having invited the administrations and deputies, the FTR and public organizations should organize the development of proposals for revising credit-financial, tax, price, and customs policies throughout the country. Fourth. The government and the FTR should refine and release to the public procedures for the collection of proposals, their honest processing, and open and systematic analysis with a view to adopting a people's law on a long-term economic policy. Fifth. Having invited public organizations, sectoral associations, and state structures, the FTR should immediately embark on organizing intrasectoral and intersectoral negotiations on putting price-setting in order. Special attention should be paid to setting the maximum cost of intermediary services regardless of the number of consecutive resales. It appears to me that the following three principles should form the foundation of the agreements, among other principles. The ratios of prices for goods and services may not differ substantially from those at the world level. Prices for natural resources as export products may not be lower than world-market prices (in this instance, labor, minerals, soils, the natural flora and fauna, water, and air should be considered the original reference). Finally, the cost of labor as a proportion of all products should be approximately in line with that in the world for a similar stock of merchandise. Such negotiations with the structures of federal power will certainly be difficult. The development of fundamental legal provisions for revising the reforms will certainly run into contradictions, into mutually exclusive arguments. One point is clear: The speeding flywheel of inflation will not be stopped in the absence of nationwide accord. If we fail to pool together the creative energy of Russians and channel it toward life-giving pursuits, within the shortest possible period of time we will be doomed as a nation and as a state. P.S. I finished writing this letter on 5 February. On 15 February, I read information in your newspaper according to which Prime Minister V. Chernomyrdin had come out for holding intersectoral price-setting negotiations. I mention this because otherwise it would turn out to be improper: I would appear to be plagiarizing Chernomyrdin's ideas.
