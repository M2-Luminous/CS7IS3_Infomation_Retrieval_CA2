The minister's spokesman, Karl-Heinz Schneider, announced today in a DDP/ADN interview that steps would be taken against any people participating in such actions "with the full severity of the criminal and aliens' law." The government and states had closely cooperated to prepare measures aimed at preventing acts of violence. This included the provision of a large number of Federal Border Guard (BGS) officers. In view of the possibility of violent clashes involving Kurds in Cologne, Mannheim, and other cities, Kanther called upon the peaceful Kurdish population not to follow the calls of violent Kurds. Bus companies were on no account to provide transport for the banned PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]. Kanther expressed his expectation that Germany's neighbors would prevent Kurds clearly bent on violence from crossing the border into Germany. At the same time, the minister asked travelers to show understanding for any delays caused by police measures. At railway stations, BGS and traffic police officers were also being asked to pick up recognized violent Kurds and prevent them from traveling further.
