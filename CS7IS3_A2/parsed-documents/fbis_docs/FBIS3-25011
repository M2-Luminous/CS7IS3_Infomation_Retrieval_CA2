Turnout appeared to be high among the country's two million voters in Sunday's first round of voting, ranging from 47 to 79 percent. The Assembly of the Togolese People (RPT) of President Gnassingbe Eyadema, who has ruled Togo since 1967, won seats in Bassar and Tone with 72 and 73 percent support respectively. Candidates from the opposition Togolese Union for Democracy (UTD), led by Edem Kodjo, led the first round in Danyi and Oti with 43 and 49 percent, and the Committee for Action on Renewal (CAR), led by Yao Agboyibo, carried a seat in Lome with 34 percent. Final results are due to be released by Wednesday, with a run-off poll scheduled for February 20. The National Electoral Commission admitted that "technical difficulties" were causing delays. Voter turnout was higher than in a presidential vote last August which all the opposition parties boycotted. This time only one radical group, the Union of Forces for Change (UFC), refused to participate. [passage omitted]
