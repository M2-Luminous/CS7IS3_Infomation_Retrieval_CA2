[Gorbachev] Do not fear the Zhirinovskiy phenomenon. The voters voted for his party in order to express their disapproval of the authorities in power until now. The result of the voting is merely a reflection of their disapproval of those at the head of the government. Do not think that fascist ideology enjoys such a great success in our society, and that a fascist ego dwells in the Russian soul. [WPROST] Do you sympathize with Yavlinskiy's group? [Gorbachev] I do nothing surreptitiously. I am closely watching Yavlinskiy's group, Travkin's Democratic Party of Russia, and the Civic Union. To be honest, the Union has lost its distinctness, even though realists, entrepreneurs, and economic activists, people who control the economic situation on a day-to-day basis, are connected with it. Very much depends on these people, and they are backed by the masses. However, on a Federation level, people from the Union are looking about them as if they do not know what to do. I find this very sad, and that is why I support Yavlinskiy, even though I should be supporting the Alliance. [WPROST] What made you decide to vote in favor of the constitution proposed by Boris Yeltsin? [Gorbachev] I am in favor of Yeltsin's draft, but it still requires a lot of hard work on it in the State Duma. There are two issues in particular that must be considered. First, there is no balance between the different types of authority at the Federation level. I support the idea of a presidential republic, which means a strong president and strong government. But I cannot come to terms with the pitiful situation in which our parliament has found itself. A strong president, plus a strong parliament and independent Constitutional Court -- that is the arrangement that best suits Russia's interests. Yet the president is keeping the candidacies for the Constitutional Court in his pocket. There is still the problem of the conflict between the center and the regions. The provinces are prepared to assume responsibility, but first they must be granted the relevant powers. How can one undertake privatization and bring help to the poorest sectors of society if one does not have any powers, for example a suitable fiscal policy? As far as the parliamentary election is concerned, it is difficult to consider it a free election. It has been called for by the very authorities that are taking part in it. These authorities will now appoint election commissions, and in the end they will count the votes themselves. [WPROST] Then why are you taking part in such an election? [Gorbachev] Because we must pass through all this as quickly as possible, for there is no return to the past. Let the authorities display their programs, then we will see what it is they want. A politician may convince his opponents, but he cannot escape from real life. And Russia's political reality is such that if the present ruling team does not alter its program, we are going to bear the consequences. But their are incapable of making changes. I can see how very undecided they are. President Yeltsin says "one cannot rely on force any longer," Gaydar says one can, and Prime Minister Chernomyrdin simply says "the era of shock therapy is over." They are all beginning to play for time. The prime minister fell ill just before the election. I wish him health, of course, but his sickness occurred at the best possible time. Gaydar attempted dialogue with the miners and withdrew straightaway. The miners stuck to their guns. And how many more collective interests like this are there? [WPROST] In that case, when will the next putsch take place? [Gorbachev] It is possible to avoid such an eventuality. This election has enabled various parties and groups to consolidate. Now the process of forming coalitions and joint programs will be faster. Perhaps that is the only favorable result of the election, although the new parliament will once again consist of a mixture of people from whom one does not know what to expect. All sorts of surprises are in store for is. [WPROST] Who is going to head the new government? Will Yeltsin want to choose between Chernomyrdin and Gaydar? [Gorbachev] For some time now, the president has kept a distance from Russia's Choice in order at appear as a neutral referee, the leader of the nation. Yeltsin has said that he will cooperate with all the parties that enter parliament. And yet his entire sympathies lie with Russia's Choice. He is also playing for time. [WPROST] Gennadiy Burbulis, strategist from Russia's Choice, has admitted that, in the long run, Yeltsin might be merely an unnecessary burden on the Democrats. [Gorbachev] Have you not noticed that the Democrats are distancing themselves from the president and turning themselves into an independent force? Notice what Gavril Popov said: "I have resigned from the post of mayor of Moscow because I do not want to become a second Rutskoy, a representative of authority without any powers. I do not agree with the president." They have started their own game and they do not need the president. But Yeltsin has noticed everything, and the conduct of the "democrats" is not escaping the attention of the Kremlin's advisers. [WPROST] Will you take an active part in political life after the elections? [Gorbachev] I am already doing so by talking to you. [WPROST] I meant political activity. [Gorbachev] The students union of Nizhniy Novgorod has suggested that I run for parliament. I have also received offers form Moscow, St. Petersburg, and the northern Caucasus. I refused, because I do not want to assume any state post. For the time being, I see no reason to alter my present status. And later? We will see. [WPROST] What is your attitude toward the present Russian president? [Gorbachev] That is not going to distract my attention. His attitude toward me should not concern you, and my attitude toward him even less so. We can discuss politics, you are most welcome to do so. After all, Russia requires a complete change of politics. Look where the policies pursued over the past two years have brought us -- the Bolsheviks are back in the Kremlin. Until now I have called them neo-Bolsheviks, but now I see that they are real. They are using the same methods of action, only under a different banner. The Bolsheviks of 1917 chased everyone off to the state farms, today's Bolsheviks are chasing everyone away from them. What kind of democrats are they? The individual means nothing to them, that is why I shun calling them democrats. [WPROST] What about the Army? [Gorbachev] The Army should not be brought out onto the streets. Everything should be resolved by political means. [WPROST] Would you not have brought the tanks out into the streets on 3 and 4 October? [Gorbachev] I tried to do that in March 1991, but I quickly realized how it would end. Therefore I ordered the soldiers back to their barracks. [WPROST] You are sneering at Russian domestic policy. What about foreign policy? According to Yeltsin, when Germany united in 1990, you reached an agreement with Western leaders that NATO would not expand eastwards. [Gorbachev] That is right. International agreements contain a clause whereby neither NATO, nor even the FRG itself, will deploy any forces on the territory of the former GDR [German Democratic Republic]. I think the question of the admission of Central and Eastern European countries to NATO has been wrongly presented. Perhaps it is because the Americans are needlessly afraid that their role will diminish. The Europeans should explain to them that Europe must decisively shape its own future with the participation of the United States and Canada. Such is the reality of international politics. Everything else is merely a game. However, there is something else that worries me more. Perhaps Russia has made people nervous because of its "imperial" way of behavior or because of some of the statements made by Russian politicians. Basically there is nothing behind these statements, but they have been made nonetheless. Representatives of the authorities have begun to compete with "patriots" to see who can best defend Russia's interests. They all realize that society is stunned by the collapse of the USSR and the socialist camp. However, the road to reconstructing the state follows a different course. Our friends in Central and Eastern Europe should be clearly told that Russia will never conduct warfare. Such activity should be rejected once and for all. We must build a common European home, and from both directions, east and west. Despite everything, structures common to the entire continent should be formed. [WPROST] We were building a common European home when you were still in office. [Gorbachev] There are mechanisms that exist on paper, there is the Paris Charter, and nothing should be added to them. However there is a lack of real instruments, various institutions, with the aid of which one might fulfill these plans. For example, Europe needs a security council. Expanding alliances is a bad solution, because it divides Europe instead of uniting it. Do we want to proceed from one division to another? Are 12 NATO member-countries to determine the fate of the entire continent?
