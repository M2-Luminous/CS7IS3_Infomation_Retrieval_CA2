In the two-day meeting, members of the PGCC did not reach an agreement for implementing of an article of Damascus Agreement which calls for cooperation with Syria and Egypt. The Damascus Agreement which was signed in the aftermath of the occupation of Kuwait by Iraq envisaged economic, political and military cooperation between the PGCC member states with Syria and Egypt. The agreement provided for the deployment of Egyptian and Syrian forces in the Persian Gulf for maintaining the security of the region. However, some of the PGCC members, having signed bilateral pacts with the U.S.A. and some of the western countries, are no longer inclined to see the Egyptian and Syrian forces in the region. The failure of the meeting is viewed by some political observers here to have stricken a serious blow to the Damascus Agreement.
