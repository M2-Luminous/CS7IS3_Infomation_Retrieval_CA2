The events of the first half of March 1994, and most of all the subject of the so-called "state coup" and the "introduction of a state of emergency," are indicative of the severe exacerbation of contradictions in the present political establishment and the beginning of practical preparations by various groups for the post-Yeltsin period... Despite his degradation as a political figure (for reasons of personal health and intellectual incompetence), Yeltsin nevertheless continues to play an important role in the existing political structure: He is a deterrent to influential political groups, preventing them from starting a ruthless "showdown" among themselves. ...The main principle of such a game consists of the following: The weakest groups (or group) must persistently try to clash with key political forces in order to weaken them as much as possible. The increase in confrontation between the main opponents makes it possible for "weaklings" to intensify their influence by playing one against the other. The game becomes especially effective if the president himself is involved (directly or indirectly). Taking Yeltsin's maniacal mistrustfulness into account, it would be rather simple to use him to play out such a maneuver... ...Yuriy Baturin-- assistant to the president for national security. Adequate knowledge and experience in problems of national security lacking. Main characteristics as an individual: tenacious and good memory, manipulator ("Physical and Technology Institute"--self-determination) type of mentality, pragmatic cynicism, and political immorality. Extremely ambitious, but is able to conceal this. A sanguine introvert. Has a high indicator on the F-scale. Presence of complexes that are characteristic of a schizophrenic type of personality. ...Baturin has a different status in the Kremlin structure that distinguishes him from Ilyushin and Sukhanov (Yeltsin's traditional inner circle), as well as from Filatov (who has support in the democratic environment). At the same time, Yu. Baturin uses the rivalry of Ilyushin and Filatov rather effectively. Yu. Baturin's "brilliant" resourcefulness, which enabled him to acquire colossal influence over Yeltsin, who is becoming decrepit, was in linking the concept of "national security" with the concept of Yeltsin's "security." Yu. Baturin took active part in preparation of the state coup in December 1992, worked on documents for the March coup (1993), and perfected the grievously known Edict No. 1400. He simultaneously reinforced his bureaucratic status. At the same time, Baturin, as a representative of an independent team, as before, is one of the weakest figures of the Russian political establishment. Considering Yeltsin's traditional hatred for and fear of the KGB, Yu. Baturin prepared an edict on reformation of the FCS [Federal Counterintelligence Service], which was already on the president's desk in the Kremlin on 2 March. Nevertheless, Yeltsin signed a document on the assignment of S. Stepashin instead of N. Galushko as director of the FCS (according to some information, Filatov lobbied for Stepashin). Literally on the second day, Baturin informed Yeltsin of the unsatisfactory work of the FCS, the lack of information from it that Yeltsin needs (although the last eight analytical documents from counterintelligence were held up on Baturin's desk). Simultaneously, he mentioned the negative attitude toward Yeltsin of a majority of FCS employees and reported on a speech being prepared by Skokov against Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin. On 5 March, Yeltsin arranged a dressing down of Stepashin and refused to meet with him personally in the future (!), and demanded that Stepashin report to him every day at 0900 by telephone. It was on Baturin's advice that Yeltsin congratulated women on 7 March in order to demonstrate to the whole country that he was healthy and able to function. Later, new rumors were also started, in particular about the possibility of a coup d'etat on 17 March; a "version 1" appeared that was absolutely absurd in its internal contradictions, etc. All serious observers realize that in the current situation neither the armed forces nor the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs) will resort to the use of force. Grachev, encountering the formation of at least four rival groups among the armed forces leadership, once again turned to the formula "the armed forces are outside politics." Even "hero of Russia" Yerin replied to a direct question from the president that he will carry out only a written order (but in his own circle he expressed doubt even about this). The "irreconcilable opposition" is significantly weaker today than before the October events, and therefore it will not be able to undertake anything serious. But what did Baturin achieve? First, nervousness and uncertainty among the politically active part of society have increased. Second, it seems the ground is being prepared for unexpected personnel changes "at the top," whose initiator very likely will be the "diffident" Yu. Baturin. Third, as a result of "the March games," Baturin's ties with some "young" leaders have been strengthened. It is not accidental that G. Burbulis cooperated with him actively during these weeks (in recent weeks G.E. finally realized that he can be transformed from a secondary to a tertiary political figure). ...Sixth, the action taken in March has hindered the objective process of forming coalition ties inside the ruling establishment itself, and it has made the leaders of different groups even more cautious. ...So, Baturin has remained a "weakling," but today he is already a much more influential "weakling."
