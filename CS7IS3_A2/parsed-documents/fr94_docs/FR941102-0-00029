FR941102-0-00029 FR941102-0-00005 FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 12 CFR Part 225 [Regulation Y; Docket No. R&hyph;0852] Applications Under Regulation Y AGENCY: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. ACTION: Interim rule with request for comments. SUMMARY: These rules are intended to implement the simplified notice procedures recently established under section 346 of the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 for bank holding companies proposing to engage de novo or through an acquisition in nonbanking activities. Because Section 346 implements this procedure immediately, the Board has proposed the following as an interim rule that will take effect immediately and will apply to all notices filed subsequent to enactment of Section 346. The Board also is seeking comments on the interim rule, and will amend the rule as needed to address the comments received. The Board is currently developing additional initiatives to reduce the regulatory burden associated with its application and notice procedures, and the Board invites comment on any suggestions in furtherance of these initiatives. DATES: Interim rule effective on November 2, 1994, comments must be received by December 5, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should refer to Docket No. R&hyph;0852 and may be mailed to William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 20th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20551. Comments also may be delivered to Room B&hyph;2222 of the Eccles Building between 8:45 a.m. and 5:15 p.m. weekdays, or to the Board's Security Control Room inside the Eccles Building courtyard on 20th Street (between Constitution Avenue and C Street, NW) anytime. Comments may be inspected in room MP&hyph;500 of the Martin Building between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. weekdays, except as provided in 12 CFR 261.8 of the Board's rules regarding availability of information.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 4 of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 1843) (BHC Act) prohibits bank holding companies from acquiring or retaining shares of any company that is not a bank or engaging in any activity other than managing and controlling banks, except under certain circumstances. The primary exception permits bank holding companies to conduct activities and acquire companies engaged solely in activities the Board has determined to be closely related to banking and a proper incident thereto. See 12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8). Section 346 of the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 (Pub. L. No. 103&hyph;325, section 346, 108 Stat. 2160, 2239 (1994)(``Section 346'')) amends section 4 of the BHC Act to establish a new notice procedure for obtaining Board approval under sections 4(a)(2) and 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act. 1 Under Section 346, a proposal requiring Board approval under section 4(a)(2) or 4(c)(8) may be consummated 60 days after providing the Board with a complete written notice of the proposal, unless the notice period is extended as provided in the statute. Section 346 also permits proposals to be consummated at anytime during this notice period if approved by the Board during this period. 1 Section 346 establishes a notice procedure for situations in which prior Board approval is required under section 4(c)(8) or 4(a)(2) of the BHC Act, and was not intended to impose any new approval requirements on transactions that may otherwise be consummated under section 4 of the BHC Act without Board approval. The proposed interim rule would replace the current application procedure of section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act with the new notice procedure. 2 The rule would streamline the current procedure for obtaining Board approval for nonbanking proposals in several respects. In particular, the proposed revisions would: 2 All applications and notices to engage in nonbanking activities that were filed with a Reserve Bank prior to September 23, 1994 will continue to be processed under the existing rules. •Establish a simplified notice procedure for action on proposals to engage de novo or through an acquisition in a listed activity (i.e., an activity on the Regulation Y list of permissible nonbanking activities 3 ) within 30 days of receipt of the notice by the Reserve Bank; 3 12 CFR 225.25. •Establish a notice procedure for action on proposals to engage de novo or through an acquisition in an un-listed activity or a new activity within 60 days of filing of a complete notice;
