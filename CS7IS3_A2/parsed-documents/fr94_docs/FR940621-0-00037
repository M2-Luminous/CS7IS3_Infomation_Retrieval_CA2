FR940621-0-00037 FR940621-0-00017 Section 43.13(a) requires persons performing inspections and other maintenance to use the manufacturers' instructions or other instructions acceptable to the FAA Administrator. The aircraft owner or operator is responsible for ensuring that the ELT is included in these inspections and is maintained accordingly. To provide guidance on improving ELT maintenance, Action Notice A 8310.1, recommending a specific supplemental inspection procedure for ELT's, was issued to all FAA field personnel in September 1988. This information was also included in the February 1989 issue of Advisory Circular 43&hyph;16, General Aviation Airworthiness Alerts, and reissued in Action Notice A 8150.3 on July 23, 1990. This Action Notice applies to ELT's authorized under both TSO&hyph;C91 and TSO&hyph;C91a. To summarize the notice, the inspection procedure can be accomplished by making a close examination of the ELT, its battery pack, and antenna. The signal emissions and G-switch must also be checked. If the ELT's antenna is radiating a signal, it can be heard on any frequency through a low-cost AM radio held about six inches from the ELT's antenna. The aircraft's VHF receiver or a check with an airport control tower may also be used to verify the ELT signal on the 121.5 Mhz frequency. An airplane's VHF receiver is located very close to the ELT, and it is sensitive; therefore, it does not check the integrity of the ELT together with its antenna. Consequently, using the airplane's VHF receiver does not provide the same level of confidence in verifying the ELT signal as using the AM radio or tower check. The ELT transmits on the emergency frequency, therefore, the signal check must be conducted within the first five minutes after any hour and it must be limited to three sweeps of the transmitter's audio signal, in order not to send false alarm signals. To check the G-switch of most TSO&hyph;C91 ELT's, the unit is removed from its mounting and given a quick rap with the hand in the direction of activation indicated on the ELT case. For TSO&hyph;C91a ELT's, however, a throwing motion is used, coupled with a rapid reversal. Finally, although the antenna and G-switch checks are not measured checks and do not quantify the adequacy of the G-switch or the power output of the antenna, they do provide an acceptable level of confidence that the ELT is functioning properly. In response to NTSB recommendation A&hyph;87&hyph;104, the findings of the FAA/NASA report, and the comments to this rulemaking, the FAA is clarifying what must be done for an ELT to be considered in ``operable condition'' as found in ยง91.207(a)(1) by adding a new paragraph (d). Although paragraph (d) is new, it is written in accordance with current regulations and guidance, as discussed earlier under, ``ELT Maintenance Requirements_An Explanation''. Specifically, the new regulation ยง91.207(a)(1)(d), describes how to inspect an ELT under Part 43, Appendix D, paragraph (i), and requires that it be accomplished within 12 calendar months after the last inspection. The Appendix D requirements are non-specific in nature because they apply to all components of the radio group, which includes the ELT's. The 12-month requirement accommodates those airplanes maintained under either an annual or a progressive inspection program and could be accomplished under the provisions of any other program approved by the Administrator under ยง91.409. The FAA has determined that this clarification is not an additional requirement that would entail additional rulemaking and an economic evaluation. The FAA has determined that this additional information should be included in part 91 to reinforce to airplane owners and inspectors what the FAA expects when an ELT is inspected. ``Approved'' as Opposed to ``TSO-Approved'' Three commenters express concern over the meaning of the word ``approved'' in the proposed language of the ELT rules. One commenter indicates that this rulemaking procedure may ``establish a precedent for future mass terminations of TSO authorizations, without going through the rulemaking process.'' Another commenter requests that the FAA refer to a particular TSO number instead of using the generic language, ``approved TSO.''
