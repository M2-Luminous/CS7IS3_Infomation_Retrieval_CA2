An official of the municipal commission of foreign trade and economic cooperation said that Tianjin, the leading manufacturing center in north China, currently has 840 U.S.-funded businesses with a total American investment of 710 million dollars. American investors have taken Tianjin as an ideal place to invest in since it was one of the first group of coastal cities in China to open to overseas investors, he said. Tianjin experienced what he called an "American investment wave" in 1993, he said. The city last year approved 513 U.S.-funded firms involving 340 million dollars in total American investment. American companies invest in a wide range of sectors, including manufacturing industry, farming, international trade, banking, information, hotels and real estate. Manufacturers account for at least half of U.S.-funded companies in Tianjin, he said. A number of multi-national companies, including Motorola Electronics, the Coca-Cola Company, Kraft General Foods International Corporation, the International Telegraph and Telephone Company, the AST Company, IBM, the Otis Elevator Company and the Smithline Beckman Corporation, have opened businesses in Tianjin. The China head office of AST in Tianjin is rated as the largest foreign investment project in China's computer industry, the official said. The Tianjin branch of the Chase Manhattan Bank of the United States is the bank's first branch in China. Local economists agreed that Tianjin's appeal to American investors lies in its good infrastructure, a whole range of industries, a competent technical force and a workforce with a high sense of discipline. In recent years, products from U.S.-funded companies in Tianjin have become increasingly popular in Tianjin and the rest of China. They include Otis elevators, Motorola beepers, Smithline medicines and Coca-Cola. Most products from these companies are sold in the Chinese market, according to the economists. This serves as another factor attracting American investors, one official said. Michael E. Lin, vice-president of a multi-national company of the United States, said: "If you want to invest in China, you must seize every second, because losing an investment opportunity means losing a big market." The third factor encouraging American firms to invest in Tianjin is that most operational U.S.-funded businesses are profitable. Government statistics show that these Tianjin businesses generated a total of 860 million yuan in profits and taxes in 1993, nearly 30 percent of the total made by all foreign-funded firms in the city. Four of the ten foreign-funded firms chosen as the most efficient enterprises in Tianjin in 1993 are U.S.-funded companies, the official of the municipal commission of foreign trade and economic cooperation said. Most U.S.-funded companies have already recovered their investment, he said. For example, the Motorola (China) Electronics Company has generated 84 million yuan since it opened a year ago and has decided to spend another 100 million U.S. dollars to expand production. The Tianmei Food Company, a joint venture between a local company and the Kraft General Food International Corporation of the U.S., has generated 200 million in profits and taxes since it opened six years ago. As a result, each partner has earned 20 million yuan in net profits, the official said. The American firm decided last year to increase its shares to 60 percent from 50 percent. The joint venture is now building a new factory in the Tianjin economic and technological development zone to quintuple its annual production, he said.
