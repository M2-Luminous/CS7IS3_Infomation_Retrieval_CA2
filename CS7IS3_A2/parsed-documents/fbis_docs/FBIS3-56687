Portanskiy under the general heading: "Russia and United States Try To Avoid `Aluminum War'"] [Text] The general calls for assistance for the reforms in Russia, often repeated in the West, are one thing, but talk on the entirely specific question of trade with Russia are something else entirely. The Americans are suggesting to us that we make a commitment to almost the whole world voluntarily to restrict exports of our aluminum to a certain level. This agreement will allegedly be temporary -- until the situation on the world market is put right. Here a program of investment in our aluminum industry is offered. With this option Russian experts believe that the question will soon arise of what we are to do without production -- we will have to reduce it. That will not be long in causing a whole range of adverse consequences for us. Export deliveries will be reduced and social tension will be intensified in whole regions where aluminum production is concentrated (let us recall the recent success of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia during the election campaign in Siberia -- A.P.). The likelihood that our profit level will be preserved as a result of the increase in world prices for aluminum after the reduction in the dumping of Russian metal on the external market is in reality not great. Because various countries have accumulated a considerable amount of aluminum, which will immediately be put on the market. From the political viewpoint in our foreign trade we will acquire a most unpleasant precedent which will subsequently probably be repeated with our other export goods. But refusing a voluntary limit on aluminum exports will probably mean for us the start of the antidumping procedure mentioned by [U.S lawyer] Larry Friedman. Although it is quite hard to prove dumping in practice, the results of a possible investigation are virtually predetermined -- they will not be in our favor. We are now caught in a sandwich, as the Americans say, or between the hammer and the anvil, as the Russians say. Nonetheless, the Russian side intends to advance at the forthcoming talks in the direction of its main idea -- putting the blame for the state of the market on all producing countries and seeking a formula for an overall stabilization of the aluminum market. Within the framework of this formula there can be a number of options for resolving the problem. One of them is investments in our aluminum industry on condition that payments are subsequently made to investors in this metal. The main merit of this option is that it opens up a prospect for the increase in the consumption of aluminum for civilian purposes inside the country -- something for which Russia has such a great need -- and that will at the same time favorably affect the state of the world aluminum market.
