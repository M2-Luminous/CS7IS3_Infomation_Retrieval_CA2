FR941012-0-00095 FR941012-0-00011 The need for and the use of leg protection was one of the issues raised in the hearing notice and has been discussed above in the Major Issues section. The evidence in the record, as discussed above, strongly supports the need for a requirement for leg protection for each chain saw operator in order to protect that operator against being injured by contact with a moving saw chain. OSHA points out that the requirement for using leg protection applies to each employee who operates any chain saw at any time on the job. This requirement includes the employee who is a regular chain saw operator as well as the employee who occasionally uses a chain saw. Some commenters emphasized the need for any employee who uses a chain saw, even occasionally, to wear leg protection (Tr. W1 193, W2 61, 115). Other commenters said OSHA should provide an exception for employees who operate chains saws only occasionally (Ex. 5&hyph;20, 5&hyph;59). The Agency believes that an employee who operates a chain saw for any duration needs leg protection. OSHA also notes that there were no comments received saying leg protection was too burdensome for infrequent operators or for short duration use. In this paragraph, OSHA also has included an exception to the leg protection requirement for employees working from bucket trucks and, in some instances, for climbers. OSHA has allowed the exception for those working in bucket trucks, because the bucket work platform provides the necessary protection for these chain saw operators. With regard to climbers, OSHA has retained an exception in the final rule for certain situations. Climbers are not required to wear leg protection when the employer demonstrates that a greater hazard is posed by wearing leg protection in the particular situation. As the final rule makes clear, this is not a blanket exception for climbers. The employer must evaluate the particular situation to determine whether there is a greater risk to the climber by wearing leg protection. OSHA points out that the employer will bear the burden of demonstrating that leg protection poses a greater hazard for the climber. OSHA received one comment that said leg protection should not be required because it was a hindrance during tree climbing (Ex. 5&hyph;7). The fact that leg protection may be a ``hindrance'' is not in itself a showing that leg protection poses a greater danger. When the hindrance is just that climbing goes more slowly when leg protection is worn, the employer has not made the requisite showing that leg protection poses greater safety hazards. However, when the employer shows that in wet conditions leg protection would substantially increase the likelihood of falling, it may be appropriate in that case for the climber to refrain from using leg protection. In such cases, OSHA believes that alternative methods for protecting the legs, such as light and pliable pads sewn into work pants, should be used whenever feasible. Foot protection. At paragraph (d)(1)(v) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the employer assure that each employee wear foot protection, such as heavy duty logging boots. This provision requires that the foot protection be waterproof or water repellant, cover and provide support for the ankle, and protect the employee against chain-saw penetration. This paragraph allows employees to wear sharp, calk-soled boots, or other slip-resistant boots, when the employer demonstrates that they are necessary for the job, terrain, timber type, or weather conditions. However, this alternative foot protection must otherwise meet the requirements of this paragraph. OSHA notes that when the logging boot itself does not provide protection from penetration by a chain saw, the employee must use some additional foot protection, such as a foot cover, to provide that necessary protection. Information in the record indicates such devices are commercially available in the logging industry, therefore, this provision should not prove burdensome (Ex. 5&hyph;14).
