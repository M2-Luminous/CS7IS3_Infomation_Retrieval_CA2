A glance back at the three previous summits makes it possible for us to see that the Ibero-American nations have focused their discussions on various subjects usually recommended by the host country. Guadalajara (Mexico, 1991) marked a very special occasion because, for the first time, all of the Iberian-origin countries on the American continent were convened under the banner of joint support for the unity and integration of our peoples and to lay the forum's fundamental groundwork on topics such as plurality, diversity, and the people's right to peacefully create institutions and the best political system possible. Certainly, the idea of this meeting had been conceived within the framework of the festivities organized by Spain in 1992 to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the "discovery" of America. Mexico, however, had the good idea of convening the first such meeting in the region -- a move that guaranteed continuity and the fulfillment of unity and integration at a time when NAFTA caused concern among some people about Mexico's future role in Latin America. Madrid (1992), in the already mentioned context of its festivities, underlined the contribution and implementation of cultural and educational cooperation projects. It was in Salvador de Bahia last year, however, where for the first time the Ibero-American Summit discussed development with a social emphasis, and it did so at a time when Brazil was proposing in the United Nations an "agenda for development." On focusing its attention on "economics, integration, and commerce" in June, Cartagena de Indias seeks to give the forum a new dimension beyond common history, language, and culture. The meeting seeks to turn the association of peoples into an economic opportunity for all. In this context, Cuba has always longed for a united Latin America -- a Latin America of which Bolivar and Marti had dreamed -- and integration as a function of the most precious interests of our peoples. Great are the challenges and efforts found on this difficult yet vital path. Cuba has pointed these out more than once. To achieve the desired regional dimension, it is necessary to bring together all ongoing regional processes. At the same time, we must defend our joint positions on political, economic, and social matters of interest, particularly those related to regional integration and incorporation, from a point of fairness, of Latin America and the Caribbean into international relations. It is also essential to give this process a broader scope and greater depth through the gradual integration of the productive and service sectors, but without playing down the importance of scientific, technological, health, and educational cooperation as vital instruments of an irreversible and permanent integration process. This process, conceived as a means to improve the welfare of our peoples through the integration of the social sector and actions that give it a human dimension, would be the adequate framework for Cuba to put at the service of regional cooperation its progress and experience in the field of social development for the solution of collective problems that, above ideologies, require urgent measures. Of continual concern for the Cuban delegations attending the three previous summits have been both the prevailing enthusiasm for neoliberalism and the enormous optimism in terms of its results. On each occasion, Cuba has made known that it respects, but does not share, these viewpoints, because they do not favor the development of our peoples or stimulate a revision of dependency as a function of the interests of the current centers of power. For this reason, the unanimous recognition, even by the Inter-American meeting, of the extreme poverty and social imbalance situation experienced by most of the countries south of the Rio Grande is clear proof of neoliberalism's failure in the region. Cuba will attend the Cartagena de Indias summit with these ideas in mind and with the purpose of contributing to the strength of this important forum at a time when the hemisphere summit convened by the United States undermines the permanence of Ibero-American summits as a mechanism for a concerted effort. False Agenda The new U.S. Democratic administration is trying to exploit the success attained with the approval of NAFTA with the intention of casting a positive image of its policy throughout the continent and recovering lost ground. This explains the lack of definition regarding the topics to be discussed in the meeting. By definition, Cuba cannot oppose this convocation, because there are indeed numerous problems to be discussed regarding relations between the United States and Latin America. This is not a bad idea, provided the meeting serves to discuss undeniable existing disagreements. If we are to be honest, Latin America and the Caribbean know they cannot have great expectations for the possible results of the meeting. Past Washington-convened meetings have proven to result in much ado about nothing. The attempts to once again exclude Cuba show a U.S. policy of discrimination against our country, and they run against international trends in which collective wisdom advises against making contrived exclusions. Such exclusions have not been made in the meetings under the Ibero-American framework, the Security and Cooperation Conference in Europe, or the Asian-Pacific summit. The Hemispheric Summit should not be used as a tool of specific U.S. interests but, rather, as a tool of the interests of all participating countries. For this reason, it would be good for the summit's date, venue, agenda, and participants to be decided by mutual agreement and not by a unilateral dictate from Washington. What merit can Miami claim for hosting a meeting of the nations of the continent, other than the city's well-known record of violence; the lack of freedom of expression imposed by the intransigence and terrorism of the Cuban-American extreme rightists; and, as a bad joke, the fact that it serves as the main organizational center for the continent's drug traffickers? The people of the region should concentrate their efforts in promoting an agenda to discuss the true problems of Inter-American relations to prevent any one country on the continent from being excluded, to keep alive the Ibero-American movement, and to keep Washington from once again making our decisions for us.
