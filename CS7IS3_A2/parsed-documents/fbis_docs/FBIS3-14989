Speaking at a news conference in Moscow on Monday, Samsonov said that the troops will be reinforced by additional contingents of CIS states which are providing peace-keeping assistance to the republic under inter-state agreements. The decision to this effect was adopted by the CIS defence ministers at their two-day meeting in Moscow last week. Samsonov stressed that the decision on measures to stabilise the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border adopted by the defence ministers will be transformed into a law at the upcoming session of the CIS heads of state. Under the existing agreements, Kyrgyzstan will reinforce its contingent in Tajikistan and Kazakhstan will send in a battalion in the near future. If Afghan mujahideen and the Tajik opposition launch a large-scale offensive on the border in the spring or summer, "the available peace-keeping troops will not be enough to repel it," Samsonov said. Asked about disagreements between the military delegations of CIS states, Samsonov said that the decision on the stabilisation of the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border was signed by all delegations, except Belarus.
