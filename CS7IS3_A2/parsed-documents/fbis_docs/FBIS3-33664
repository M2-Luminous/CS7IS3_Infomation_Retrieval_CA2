Zeroual will be sworn-in tomorrow. [passage omitted] Zeroual, the president-designate and national defense minister will assume several tasks in his capacity as head of state. These tasks have been fixed by Article 13 of the document of the national consensus platform [recently reached at the national conference in Algiers]. Nasira Mennan reports: [Mennan] The head of state has several authorities and prerogatives: He is the commander-in-chief of all the Armed Forces of the republic; he is in charge of national defense; he decides and guides the foreign policy of the nation; he presides over the Council of Ministers, appoints and puts an end to the job of the prime minister, makes appointments in the civil and military state functions, and signs presidential decrees. He has the right to pardon, to reduce, or replace sentences. He may consult the people through referendum on any issue of national interest. He also appoints the ambassadors extraordinary and envoys abroad. [passage omitted] [Announcer] Zeroual, the head of state and minister of national defense, has an enormous responsibility, particularly leading the country to safe shores. Chaabane Bounakel reports: [Bounakel] The appointment of Zeroual as head of state and minister of defense is considered an important political event and a turning point in national political life. The man is known for his honesty and sincerity, and he has secured the respect of the public and the political class with its various tendencies. Zeroual is assuming a heavy task, and he should receive the understanding, support and backing from all social and political partners. This is a national matter that binds all and cannot bear a retreat. Just as his withdrawal from the scene was a rejection of blessing a weak political system after the eruption of the October [1988] events, and the bad management of the economy, the abandonment by the state of its social role, the deviation of some administrative organs, the domination of a narrow partisan view amid the public, the return of the man at this precise moment and after the convening of the national consensus conference, all the more since he is both head of state and defense minister, his return at this moment is in itself considered the main guarantee for the national public in the first place, second for political and social partners, and third for the regional and international public. For Algeria in a national consensus, which has not been easy to attain, it has indeed found its way toward the transcending of the trial and to move assuredly from the stage of the single political party system to a new national system that entrenches genuine democracy. The matter is not easy: Just as the military establishment has provided categorical proof and evidence of its goodwill not to spare any effort to get out of the crisis, the political classes, particularly those deeply nationalist and determined to meet the challenges, transcend the crisis and give momentum to the wheel of the real change the people want, these classes should drop any worn out positions and practices. This double appointment is not at all a review of the withdrawal of the national people's army from the political army as much as it is a respect for the will of the people to get out of the crisis, and a way of avoiding the Army becoming a tool in the framework of the political conflicts of any side. The military establishment is a national school that forms tough men, and these men will assuredly not retreat from answering the call of the homeland.
