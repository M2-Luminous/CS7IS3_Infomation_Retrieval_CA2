The major issues related to this program are discussed in the preamble to the NPRM. Significant changes resulting from public comment since publication of the NPRM include_ (1) eliminating the separate minimum share for Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Republic of Palau; (2) removing the requirement for an annual comprehensive needs assessment; (3) deleting the requirement that distance learning be in connection with a training course; and (4) deleting the requirement that distance education for rehabilitation workers occur at individual job sites. Analysis of Comments and Changes In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRM, 16 parties submitted comments on the proposed regulations. An analysis of the comments and of the changes in the regulations since publication of the NPRM follows. Major issues are grouped according to subject, with appropriate sections of the regulations referenced in parentheses.
