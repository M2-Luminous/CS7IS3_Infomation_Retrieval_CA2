Ceslovas Jursenas, in an interview with Interfax on Monday, expressed the hope that Grachev had been stating his own rather than President Boris Yeltsin's position. "Any delays with the troop withdrawal, and especially the deployment of an additional contingent, would not only be a clear manifestation of pressure on what is a sovereign state but would also mean disregard of the opinion and position of the world community and a violation of provisions enshrined in the documents of the United Nations, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and other influential international organizations," Jursenas said. "It is not pressure but negotiations based on principles of equality and mutual respect that are the only way to solve problems," he said.
