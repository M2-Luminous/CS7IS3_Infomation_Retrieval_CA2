Bouvard and NAA Secretary-General Peter Corterier who arrived in Bratislava today at the invitation of Slovak Parliament Chairman Ivan Gasparovic met with Slovak President Michal Kovac and Premier Jozef Moravcik to discuss the security situation in Europe. Bouvard said that the Partnership for Peace initiative was not a universal solution but a practical and pragmatic model which provides Central and East European countries with the possibility of joining NATO in the long-term. Cortier said that World War Two had showed that a security vacuum in Central Europe was a weak link in European security. Bouvard said that Russia's relationship towards NATO should be special given its position in Europe. It was not, however, acceptable for the entry of individual countries into NATO be decided in Moscow, he added. Tomorrow NAA representatives will take part in a seminar on security in Central Europe in Tatranska Lomnica, east Slovakia. Gasparovic and Slovak Defense Minister Pavol Kanis are to deliver speeches at the seminar.
