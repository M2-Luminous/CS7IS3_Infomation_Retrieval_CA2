This was stated by Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali in Islamabad yesterday. He said the peace plan has been formulated on the basis of proposals by influential Afghan leaders, which provides a common basis for establishing peace in the war- ravaged country of Afghanistan. The foreign minister said that he will visit Kabul on 25 May for this purpose. He said that he held talks with Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal, Crown Prince Turki, and leaders of other countries after receiving requests from Afghan leaders. He said that he held a similar exchange of views with UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali to secure his assistance in establishing peace in Afghanistan. Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali also announced that Pakistan will establish a mission in (Hayat) and a consulate in Mazar-e Sharif. This indicates the importance Pakistan attaches to these places, which link Pakistan with Central Asian countries.
