This comment was made on 23 March by Socialist Youth President Mauricio Bugueno, who said his party has shown that it is capable of politically leading the coalition and that it has been able to face the situation better than other parties, including the PDC. Asked if he believes the PDC has lost the political leadership of the coalition, Bugueno said the PDC is in a situation of "perplexity and confusion" and that this is proven in some way by the comments made by PDC President Gutemberg Martinez, who said the Socialist Party's current strategy is to become a political choice. Bugueno said that such a statement is absurd. Despite the comments by PDC Senators Andres Saldivar and Juan Hamilton denying the PS' leadership of the coalition, PDC leaders at the national, provincial, and municipal level and the militants see with concern that their party is not creating political events or leading the coalition; on the contrary, the party is involved in infighting for leadership that is unnecessarily wearing down the party. [passage omitted] The PS' talks with the RN [National Renewal] on political reforms have been interpreted as a good political strategy. This led the PDC to talk with the Independent Democratic Union (UDI) on corruption and administrative integrity, which is an issue also being discussed by the PS with the RN. [passage omitted]
