He said this will facilitate Portugal's participation in peace operations in an European theater. Fuzeta da Ponte was speaking to RTP after a meeting in Brussels dominated by the crisis in Bosnia. He was interviewed by Pedro Oliveira. [Oliveira] As for Portugal's contribution to international peace efforts, Admiral Fuzeta da Ponte stressed the need to proceed with the modernization program for the Portuguese forces. In an interview with RTP, Fuzeta da Ponte began by reiterating Portugal's Euro-Atlanticist vocation. [Begin recording] [Da Ponte] I believe that the government -- and the country -- have clearly defined that we are a Euro-Atlantic nation. Therefore, our Euro-Atlanticism means that we have great responsibilities toward Europe, and that is what we are dealing with. But Atlanticism means other responsibilities that go beyond Europe proper and that follow on from Portugal's own history and its Atlantic aspect. I am referring, as I said, to our participation in terms of support to our former colonies. We are in Mozambique, we are and have been in Angola -- and continue to be -- everywhere, this is a national feeling [word indistinct]...[pauses] that seems to identify with the state's opinion that we should be represented there. In Europe, we must have prepared forces on a par with the European forces. I would say that in terms of the three branches of the Armed Forces the last steps, taken recently, point to certain equipment that favors, on the other hand, we have to prepare the personnel so they can move that equipment [sentence as heard]. It is to this effect that our efforts are pointing. [Oliveira] Even so, in your opinion are there shortcomings in the Portuguese Armed Forces that should be tackled? [Da Ponte] Naturally there are restrictions, everyone knows there are restrictions, we are not the only ones to have them. But I think that the pace of our modernization leaves us all a little unhappy. We would like to move faster, and why? Because as you know our Armed Forces were equipped for an old colonial war and only recently have we come out of that vision and begun to alter the structure, the means, and the legislation to that effect. My dissatisfaction, shall we say, is that we cannot do this any faster because of the restrictions that are perfectly compatible with national needs. [end recording]
