After a two-hour meeting with the Serbian president, Draskovic told reporters that a stable government can arise from the present parliament -- where political forces are equally balanced -- only if the post of assembly president goes to an opposition deputy. He recalled that Depos holds the largest number of seats among the opposition parties. The SPO leader said he is convinced that the Socialist Party of Serbia "will not give up the position of republican assembly speaker." He added that he agreed with the Serbian president that there can be no ruling party and opposition in the struggle against hunger, poverty, the sanctions, and the war. We should coordinate political strategy on these issues, which are common objectives, stressed the SPO leader. Draskovic said that he reached agreement in principle with the Serbian president that a spirit of tolerance should prevail in the new republican assembly where, he said, facts should be at loggerheads, not people and parties. The SPO leader underlined that he cannot say he is a greater optimist after the meeting with President Milosevic, but that he is not a greater pessimist either. He said that he never shouted "Saddam, Saddam" [the slogan of the 8 March 1991 antigovernment demonstrations in Belgrade when protesters shouted "Slobo-Saddam"], and that his criticism is not aimed at the person, but at the politician's behavior and actions. He said he is satisfied with the talks with Milosevic, that the meeting was frank and dynamic, and he described the president of Serbia, whom he met for the first time, as a congenial and witty man.
