An agreement in principle has been reached with Latvia that the state maritime border will proceed as a continuation of the state land border while the boundary of the economic zone will run parallel to the sea shore. According to Domarkas, such agreement is a result of bilateral compromise. The principle concepts of the agreement, however, will have to be endorsed by the parliaments of both countries. A possibility to set up yet another special zone next to the border of the economic zone in which both parties could exploit the sea shelf was also discussed in Liepaja by the representatives from the Lithuanian and Latvian Ministries of Foreign Affairs. Domarkas hopes that the treaty on the Lithuanian-Latvian sea border would be given final coordination by the Lithuanian and Latvian prime ministers on 19 January in Riga, where a tripartite meeting of the leaders of the three Baltic states will be held.
