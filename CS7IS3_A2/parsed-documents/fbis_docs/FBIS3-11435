Benoit has presented himself as an ally of President Aristide, but has condemned the behavior of certain leaders whose main objective is to (?obtain) the post of prime minister. Benoit says that what is going on within the FNCD is normal because the FNCD is a front that brings together many organizations with different political views: [Begin recording] This is normal. It is good that discussions are going on within a political group. This shows that there is no one organization -- I could say -- to have attached its tentacles...[rephrases] that is setting the tone and making everybody go along with it. It is normal for people to hold differing views in a situation of crisis involving several levels of understanding. [passage omitted] [end recording] We remind listeners that Conacom supports the new plan set up by parliamentarians in Washington, pointing out that this plan is inspired by the Governors Island agreement, the New York pact, and the Miami conference. In the opinion of Victor Benoit, it is therefore a good plan.
