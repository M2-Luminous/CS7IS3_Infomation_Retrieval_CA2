Sukach, Ukrainian Academy of Sciences Institute of Semiconductors, Kiev, Ukraine] [Abstract] The effects are examined of neutron irradiation on changes of the distribution profile of zinc atoms in gallium lattice points (Zn[.sup]Ga[/]), previously generated by thermal diffusion. Thus, this work deals with establishing the relationship between the irradiation dose F and the boundary shift of previously generated p-n-junction. Light emitting diodes (LED) based on GaAs[.sup]1-x[/]P[.sub]x[/] (x=0.37 - 0.41), obtained by zinc diffusion were examined. Depth of the p-n- junction in the initial LED was W[.sup]0[/]= 2.5+/-0.5ï¿½m. Control of changes in the position of the p-n-junction with irradiation (F = 10[.sup]10[/] - 5x10[.sup]13[/] cm[.sup]- 2[/]) was performed by analyzing dC/dV- characteristics. Changes in the zinc distribution profile and expansion of the compensated region with increased F were recorded, indicating that the p-n-junction boundary is shifting into the n-region. Curves were obtained showing the relationship between the value of the p-n-junction boundary shift as a function of F. Figures 2, references 7 Russian.
