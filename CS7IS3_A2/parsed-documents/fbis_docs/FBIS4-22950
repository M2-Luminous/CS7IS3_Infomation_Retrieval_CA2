Gorbatova (Samara); UDC 614.7:001.5(470.4)] [Text]Present-day life in our country is characterized, on the one hand, by a complicated economic situation, a serious lag behind progressive nations of the world in the area of scientific-engineering and technological decisions, and, on the other hand, exacerbation of the ecological situation, and absence of appropriate steps to protect the environment. In other words, the socioeconomic situation in the Russian Federation is characterized by absence of stable development and viable environment. In the Central Volga Region, there is a considerable concentration of industry, concentration and integration of agriculture and urbanization. The priority industrial sectors are oil refining and petrochemistry, the chemical industry, vehicle manufacture, and power engineering with multifactored formation of working conditions, attraction toward superficial sources of water, first of all the Volga River, with the great demand for water of technological processes, considerable amount of polluted sewage and discharge of waste into the atmosphere. All this has led to intensification of anthropogenic impact on the environment (water, atmospheric air), more complicated relations between man and the environment, and worsening of working conditions at industrial enterprises, which made it necessary to develop at the Samara affiliate several scientific directions of hygienic research, both basic and applied, on problems of ``Scientific bases of environmental hygiene,'' and ``Scientific bases of industrial hygiene and occupational pathology,'' with development and reinforcement of ties with practical health care. We are referring, first of all, to investigation of the link between condition of the natural and industrial environment, on the one hand, and health of the population of the Central Volga Region, on the other hand, with determination of cause and effect relationship between environmental factors and human health, patterns of formation of human health and elaboration of scientific bases for primary prevention of morbidity. Regression-correlation functions have been established between incidence among children of neoplasms, acute pneumonia, chronic bronchitis, congenital abnormalities, allergies and level of atmospheric pollution, both by individual chemicals and the sum thereof. The demonstrated nature of morbidity, as well as prenosological changes in the physical condition of children were similar and unrelated to the type of industry or specific pollutants. Prepathological changes were manifested in the form of diminished pulmonary ventilation, diminished functional capacity of the nervous system (extended latency period of oculomotor response), cardiovascular system (reduced stroke volume with exercise), and depression of B-system of immunity (low titer of heterophil antibodies in saliva). The effect of pollutants was assessed with consideration of their combined effect on health on the order of partial summation. The demonstrated changes in health status of children served as the main criterion for assessing hygienic efficacy of water-protective measures at oil-refining and petrochemical enterprises. On the basis of methodological procedures developed at this affiliate, it was established that the priority anthropogenic chemical pollutants in Volga water reservoirs (Volgograd, Kuybyshev), which are sources of drinking water supplied to the public, have an adverse effect on human health. There was a rise in noninfectious morbidity, with a shift of maximum values to a younger age, and impairment of female reproductive function. Determination was made of quantitative characteristics of the link between level of chemical pollution of reservoir water and drinking water, on the one hand, and morbidity among the inhabitants of the regions studied. There was a close correlation between the toxic potential of water and diseases of the nervous system and sense organs, genitourinary disease, allergies, skin and subcutaneous fatty tissue diseases. It was shown that chemicals with first and second class hazard rating contained in drinking water made the chief contribution to formation of morbidity among the public. Establishment of a link between presence in water of anthropogenic chemical pollutants and public health made it necessary to refine methods for assessing the quality of water in superficial sources. Along with means, we used analysis of degree of deviation of parameters of anthropogenic chemicals from the standard in order to assess the sanitary condition of Volga reservoirs. Data on seasonal averages and, particularly, mean concentrations over periods of many years of pollutants are smoothed by the sanitary situation of a reservoir and do not necessarily inform the health inspector accurately about the real danger of pollution to health of the public, and they merely indicate the minimal possible hazard. In-depth analysis of morbidity involving temporary work incapacity (TWI], course of gestation period and parturition in more than 45,000 female workers, investigation of infant health in the early neonatal period revealed that the problem of labor safety for female workers (operators, laboratory technicians) exposed to a set of toxic factors, and health protection for the next generation is left virtually unsolved at enterprises of the chemical industry (Tolyatti, Chapayevsk). Interruption of pregnancy occurred most often at the early stages of gestation and mainly among those who had little work tenure (47.7 percent of the cases for operators and 55.3 percent for laboratory technicians). In view of the frequent miscarriages, the mean age of women at the time of birth of their first child is 23.8 years for operators and 24.3 for laboratory technicians. In general, women who are pregnant should not be hired as laboratory technicians or come in contact with toxic agents for the duration of pregnancy. Total days of TWI during pregnancy constituted 9843, which is tantamount to stopping production involving 400 female workers. Various chemicals are found in biological media of pregnant women (blood, placenta, perifetal water, milk): dimethyl formamide, toluene, dioxins. Impaired neonatal homeostasis causes birth of children with low birth weight. Intrauterine fetal hypotrophy constituted 15 percent. Penetration of toxic agents into fetal blood leads to development of defects in various locations. Combined developmental defects are not uncommon, and they constitute 36.1 percent among neonates of Chapayevsk. In premature fetuses, as well as spontaneously aborted fetuses there are gross development defects and their incidence is 50.8 percent. The results of the study indicate that there is an urgent need for a legislative solution to the matter of procedure for granting authorized leave at the early stages of pregnancy to women employed in chemical enterprises, as well as preferential pension benefits for women working as ``laboratory technicians,'' and adding the latter to the list of occupations in which work is not allowed during pregnancy. Analysis of morbidity involving TWI among workers at motor vehicle plants (VAZ, KamAZ) revealed that acute respiratory infections are in first place in the morbidity structure of these two plants, diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue (osteochondrosis) are in third place; this is related, in the former case, to the adverse epidemiological situation observed in recent years, as well as (in the latter case) to work in uncomfortable, contrived positions. In second place is hypertensive disease at VAZ and acute tonsillitis, sore throat and pharyngitis at KamAZ. These differences can be attributed to the greater intensity and stress of work at VAZ, and this has been taken into consideration in elaborating hygienic recommendations to optimize working conditions. The increased importance of the chemical factor and its effect on human health have determined the direction of work in the field of preventive toxicology: development of sanitary standards for toxic substances (PDK [maximum permissible concentration], OBUV [approximate safe level of a substance]) in environmental objects and work zones, expert toxicological evaluation of new chemical compounds introduced to the national economy and everyday life. This involved the use of modern methods for faster standard setting, studies of pathogenetic aspects of intoxication (lipid peroxidation, condition of cardiovascular system), long-term and deferred effects, use of mathematical models. Existing standards continue to be a reliable foundation for maintaining optimum conditions in the work environment, preserving purity of water sources and the urban air environment. Work on upgrading sanitary legislation was activated because of the increasing anthropogenic effect on the environment (water reservoirs, air) of the Central Volga Region, tense sociohygienic situation at enterprises in cities of this region, and poor tendencies as to working conditions on the main assembly conveyers. Many thousands of workers engaged in assembling passenger vehicles and trucks using mechanized instruments are exposed to the combined effect of a set of deleterious industrial factors: different combinations of noise, local vibration, toxic agents, monotony, static and nervous-emotional stress. Cases of vibration sickness have been recorded among the workers; the incidence of musculoskeletal pathology and other diseases involving TWI is growing. There has been no decline in personnel turnover related to unsatisfactory nature and conditions of work. Consequently, the Sanitary Rules for Working on the Main Assembly Conveyers in Motor Vehicle Plants, a draft of which was developed in 1991, are important. Analogous developments remain timely for other sectors of machine building. With the increase in anthropogenic burden on water sources and change in most important pollutants, there has been a decline in practical value of State standards for sources of water supply and drinking water because of the incomplete record-keeping and use in sanitary surveillance practice of indicators of organic and specific chemical pollution, diminished importance of indicator microorganisms. In particular, it was noted in studies at the Volga reservoirs that bacteria in the E. coli group provide much information for assessing water quality and direction of self-purification processes, as compared to their lactose-positive variants. In this regard, research is both interesting and necessary for development of rating criteria of water quality and patterns of water source self-purification processes as related to the prime pollutant, ecological-hygienic system for rating water quality, refinement of sanitary-chemical methods of monitoring water quality in supply sources (on the example of the Volga reservoirs). Joint work with practical health care agencies in oblasts supported by the Samara affiliate (Samara, Ulyanov, Penza) remains an important element in carrying out research work. The nature of relations between the research institute and practical institutions of the SES [sanitary- epidemiological service] has changed radically in recent times. Territorial SESs have equal rights to work on scientific projects as subcontractors. This serves as a foundation for carrying out such labor-intensive studies as investigation of the health status of the public as a function of environmental pollution, it is instrumental in more effective and reliable practical implementation of hygienic and ameliorative recommendations. Data on the socioeconomic development of the Central Volga Region and results of studies of recent years indicate that further intensification is needed for hygienic research to avert the negative impact of environmental and industrial factors on the health of the people. An applied direction is related to the continued search for evidence of a link between the public's health and nature and intensity of work zone pollution. But only development of basic research, full disclosure of the pathogenesis of reactions of both individuals and the population to chemical pollutants will enable us to single out the high risk groups, elaborate the scientific bases for clinical supervision and come closer to controlling the health of the people. In future studies, which are closely related to the priority direction, it is planned to develop and refine the guidelines for hygienic monitoring of environmental objects in order to optimize it, improve organization and performance of analytical monitoring of levels of priority chemical pollutants in environmental and industrial objects, identify the mechanisms of the adverse effects of industrial factors on the health of workers, improve hygienic regulation of chemicals, the combined, integral and associated effect on the body of deleterious environmental and industrial factors.
