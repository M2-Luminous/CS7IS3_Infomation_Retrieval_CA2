Before the talks started, the two sides reached an understanding on confidentiality of the contents of the talks. Now, without prior consultations with the Chinese side, the British side has published in the white paper entitled Representative Government in Hong Kong, by which it has unilaterally released the contents of the talks, and in which it has distorted and attacked China's position. This move of Britain was designed to shirk its responsibility for the rupture of the talks. The Chinese side therefore cannot but bring to light the facts in order to help people know the truth. The British Side Stubbornly Clung to the Constitutional Package Which Contravened the Joint Declaration, The Principle of Convergence with the Basic Law and the Agreements and Understandings Reached Between the Two Sides The 1994/95 elections in Hong Kong are to produce the three-tier political structure -- the Hong Kong Legislative Council, Urban and Regional Councils and district boards. The Hong Kong Legislative Council was established according to letters patent. In the long history of over 140 years after its institution in 1843, all its members were appointed by the governor of Hong Kong. In 1985 after the Sino-British Joint Declaration was signed, it began to have indirectly elected members and in 1991 direct elections started. In the current 60-member Legislative Council, 3 were official members, 18 were appointed by the governor, 18 directly elected from geographical constituencies, and 21 indirectly from functional constituencies. The Joint Declaration between the government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on the question of Hong Kong signed in 1984 contains explicit stipulations for the development of the political structure in Hong Kong. Since then the Chinese side spent four years and eight months in drafting the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China on the basis of extensively soliciting opinions of the Hong Kong people and subsequently promulgated it. Meanwhile, the two sides discussed specific matters concerning the development of the political structure in Hong Kong, and reached a series of agreements, understandings and consensus. The Basic Law was well received by the general public in Hong Kong. The British side also made commitments on several occasions to convergence of the development of the political structure in Hong Kong with the Basic Law before 1997. However, in his first policy address delivered in October 1992 after he took office, Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten proposed a constitutional package, which spelled out, among other things, specific arrangements for the 1994/95 elections. The package contravened the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the principle of convergence with the Basic Law and agreements and understandings already reached between the two sides both in its contents and in the way it was produced. Annex II of the Joint Declaration stipulates that the Chinese and British Governments should enhance cooperation in the second half of the transitional period in Hong Kong and jointly work out measures to ensure a smooth transition leading to 1997. As the 1994/95 elections will have a direct bearing on the transition, there must be agreement between the Chinese and British Governments on the electoral arrangements through consultations. Before October 1992, the Chinese side had suggested that the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group begin at an early date its consultation on this issue. However, without prior consultations with the Chinese side, the British side suddenly and unilaterally made public a constitutional package in gross violation of the above-mentioned provisions of the Joint Declaration. The Basic Law states that the political structure in Hong Kong shall develop "in accordance with the principles of gradual and orderly progress" and "in the light of the actual situation" there. Annex II of the Basic Law and the relevant decision of the National People's Congress set out clearly the specific ratio and number of directly elected members of the first, second and third Legislative Councils of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to be gradually increased. Chris Patten, however, has introduced in its package drastic changes to the existing political structure in Hong Kong and attempted to apply direct elections to all the members of the Legislative Council in 1995 in disguise. The package has also tried to change the nature of the election by functional constituencies and contained proposals obviously contradictory to the Basic Law on many specific issues. This package has also contravened the series of agreements, understandings and consensus already reached between the two sides, especially those reached by the exchange of letters between the two foreign ministers in early 1990. After it was made public, the package naturally met with strong opposition from the Chinese Government and provoked sharp criticism among Hong Kong people. Under these circumstances, the British Government was forced to ask for talks with the Chinese Government on the 1994/95 electoral arrangements in Hong Kong. Proceeding from the overall interests of effecting a smooth transition and maintaining prosperity and stability in Hong Kong, the Chinese Government agreed to such talks with it and the two sides reached agreement on the basis for talks, i.e. Observance of the Joint Declaration, the principle of convergence with the Basic Law and the agreements and understandings already reached between the two sides or the three principles in short. The Chinese side wished to see agreement reached in the talks at an earlier date so as to realize a smooth transition and smooth transfer of government in Hong Kong in 1997 through cooperation between China and Britain. To this end, the Chinese side made unremitting efforts in the talks. During the first three rounds of the talks, the Chinese side made it plain that as the two sides had agreed upon the three principles as the basis for the talks, it believed it important for the British side to first of all confirm the agreements, understandings and consensus previously reached between the two sides, for this was the only way to enable the talks to move on the right track. If it was reluctant to do so and wanted to amend or overturn them, then it would be impossible to ensure compliance of future agreements. Therefore, the Chinese side produced an eight-point text which it wished to be confirmed (see Annex I). The British side had all along refused to confirm some of the agreements and understandings already reached between the two sides. For the rest, it tried to avoid confirming their substance by paying lip service with no intention to observe and implement them when it came to concrete matters. In the rounds four to nine of the talks, the Chinese side put forward proposals on several major issues in accordance with the three principles. It proposed to focus on the electoral arrangements for district boards and municipal councils before moving on to discuss the 1995 Legislative Council elections. But it was rejected by the British side. During this period, the British side moved to offer some new views different from Chris Patten's package. But in essence, it stuck to the substance of the package on some major issues. From the 10th to the 13th round of talks, the Chinese side made further adjustments to its proposal in order to push forward the talks. But as the British side refused to reverse its position of contravening the three principles, the talks progressed rather slowly. Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen once again proposed during his meeting with Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd in New York in October 1993 that the electoral arrangements for the district organizations, i.e. the district boards and two municipal councils, and for the Legislative Council should be discussed in two phases. Starting from the 14th round, the Chinese side once again called for separate discussions of the electoral arrangements for the district organizations and for the 1995 Legislative Council and spelt out its views. The British side agreed to China's proposal at first. But when the two sides were close to an agreement, it insisted on including the voting method for the 1995 Legislative Council into the understanding on the electoral arrangements for district organizations. When its unreasonable demand was rejected by the Chinese side, it unilaterally discontinued the talks at the 17th round and submitted to the Legislative Council part of the question under discussion between the two sides, which directly led to the termination of the talks. The British Side Attempted To Interfere in the Affairs Falling Within the Scope of China's Sovereignty The topic of the Sino-British talks was arrangements for the 1994/95 elections in Hong Kong. This was first proposed by the British side and then agreed upon by the two sides. This was also the objective of the talks. However, at the outset and later, the British side insisted on discussing with China the following three issues: There should be consultation between the two sides about Hong Kong membership of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR]; the Chinese Government would support universal suffrage for the election of the Legislative Council in 2007, if that was the wish of the Hong Kong SAR; and the method of forming the election committee in 1995 should be used for the future selection committee for the first chief executive of the Hong Kong SAR and election committees for its subsequent chief executives. The Chinese side made it clear that all the three issues raised by the British side went beyond the arrangements for the 1994/95 elections in Hong Kong and should therefore not be covered by the talks. With regard to election of all members of the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong SAR by universal suffrage after 2007, Article 68 of the Basic Law and Paragraph 3 of its Annex II contain provisions to this effect (see Annex II). It is a question to be decided by the Hong Kong SAR itself and it needs no guarantee by the Chinese Government. As for the 1995 election committee as the model, the selection committee for producing the first chief executive of the Hong Kong SAR and election committees for its subsequent chief executive have different functions from those of the election committee which would elect members of the Legislative Council in 1995. The decision of the National People's Congress [NPC] on the method for the formation of the first government and the first Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region adopted in April 1990 (see Annex III) and Annex I of the Basic Law (see Annex IV) have all clearly provided for how to produce the selection committee for the first chief executive and the election committees for the subsequent chief executives. To replace or revise the relevant provisions is out of the question. On the question of consultation between the two sides on Hong Kong members of the preparatory committee, it is entirely within China's sovereignty to organize the said preparatory committee. According to the relevant NPC decision, the chairman and members of the preparatory committee to be set up in 1996, including those from Hong Kong, should be appointed by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Apparently, the Basic Law and the NPC decisions have explicit provisions for all the three issues. They are matters within China's sovereignty. The motive of the British side in raising these questions is obvious. Agreements and Understandings Reached Between the Two Sides on the Election Committee Must Be Observed In early 1990, the foreign ministers of China and Britain exchanged seven messages on how to make the 1995 Hong Kong Legislative Council elections converge with the Basic Law so as to guarantee a smooth transition in 1997 and reached agreements and understandings on a series of issues, including the composition and ratio of the election committee. With regard to the election committee for 1995, Foreign Minister Qian made it clear in his letter dated 8 February 1990 that "the provisions on the composition and ratio of the election committee as specified in Paragraph 2 of Annex I of the Basic Law (draft) must followed, because Annex I was approved by a two-thirds majority of the membership of the drafting committee at its eighth plenary session. The Chinese side is of the view that the above-mentioned composition and ratio are appropriate and need no alteration." In his letter of reply dated 12 February, British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd agreed with the Chinese proposal by saying that "I agree in principle with the arrangements which you propose for an electoral committee, which could be established in 1995. The precise details of how this should be done can be discussed between our two sides in due course." Thus the foreign ministers of the two countries did reach an unequivocal agreement and understanding on the composition and ratio of the 1995 election committee. According to provisions of Paragraph 2 of Annex I of the Basic Law, the election committee shall be comprised of members from the following four sectors: the industrial, commercial and financial sectors; the professionals; the labour, social services, religious and other sectors; members of the Legislative Council, representatives of district-based organizations, Hong Kong deputies to the National People's Congress, and representatives of Hong Kong members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, with each sector taking up one fourth of the total membership (see Annex IV). However, Chris Patten's plan proposed that "the 1995 election committee should draw all or most of the members from the directly-elected district boards". This directly contradicted the agreement and understanding reached between the two foreign ministers in early 1990. During the talks, the British side flatly denied the fact that there had been agreement or understanding between the two sides on the election committee. After patient reasoning by the Chinese side, it only agreed to part of the Chinese proposal that the composition and ratio of first three sectors of the election committee may follow the relevant provisions of Paragraph 2 of Annex I of the Basic Law. But it still insisted that the fourth sector should be composed of representatives of the district-based organizations in the place of those as set out in Paragraph 2 of Annex I, which meant a significant change to Paragraph 2 of Annex I of the Basic Law. The election committee should have a broad representation. This was a common understanding reached between China and Britain a long time ago. The British side, on its part, was not opposed to the principle of balanced participation either. According to its proposal, however, Hong Kong deputies to the National People's Congress, Hong Kong members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] and members of the Legislative Council would be completely excluded from the election committee, contrary to the provisions of Paragraph 2 of Annex I of the Basic Law. The election committee composed in such a manner would obviously impair its broad representation. The British side insisted all along that "the election committee should be composed of people who had themselves been elected... in Hong Kong". Actually it knew full well that with Hong Kong still under the rule of the British Government before 1997, it was not possible to have the NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee members elected in Hong Kong. As provided for in Paragraph 2 of Annex I of the Basic Law, Hong Kong deputies to the NPC and members of the CPPCC National Committee will all be members of the election committee. Since the term of the Hong Kong Legislative Council and its members elected in 1995 may extend beyond 1997, the 1995 elections would be special. Therefore, the Chinese side could not accept exclusion of the Hong Kong deputies to the NPC and members of the CPPCC National Committee from the 1995 election committee. The Chinese side further pointed out that the election committee was only a transitional arrangement. Its original purpose was to make it possible for those representative figures who enjoyed prestige in the society in Hong Kong but were unwilling to participate in direct elections to serve on the Legislative Council and play their role there. The election of the election committee would be indirect, not direct. The Chinese views and position on the election committee were very straight-forward, i.e. to act strictly in accordance with the agreements and understandings reached between China and Britain so that conditions could be created for the Legislative Council of Hong Kong and its members elected in 1995 to become the first Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and its members. The Chinese side offered its specific views on the election committee as follows: The election committee would be comprised of members from four sectors. Representatives of the first three sectors would be produced by a voting method similar to that of functional constituencies while the fourth sector would be composed of members of the Legislative Council, representatives of the district-based organizations, Hong Kong deputies to the NPC and representatives of Hong Kong members of the CPPCC National Committee as prescribed in Paragraph 2 of Annex I of the Basic Law. Members of the Legislative Council and the representatives of the district- based organizations mentioned here referred to those who would be members of the Legislative Council and representatives of district organizations after the SAR Government was formed in 1997 and they would not be in place at the time of the 1995 Legislative Council elections. Therefore, the Chinese side proposed that they be substituted respectively by members of the present Legislative Council and the representatives of the members of the district boards, regional and urban councils to be elected in 1994/1995. As for the size of the election committee, the two sides had never reached any agreement or understanding. The nature and functions of the election committee that would elect 10 members of the Legislative Council in 1995 would be different from those of the selection committee that would produce the first chief executive of the Hong Kong SAR and those of the election committees which would produce its subsequent chief executives. The election committee should have a broad representation and be easy to organize and operate. In view of all this, the Chinese side proposed that the desirable size of the 1995 election committee could be around 600. The British side did not take exception to it. The Original Purpose of Election by Functional Constituencies Must Be Upheld The functional constituencies system was first recommended to the Chinese side by the British side. The Chinese side on its part, taking into account the reality in Hong Kong, accepted this recommendation by incorporating it into the Basic Law. In fact, China and Britain had long reached an understanding which regarded the functional constituencies system as a form of indirect election. The basic position held by the Chinese side in the talks was as follows: first, election by functional constituencies should conform to the original purpose of introducing this system and the understanding reached by the two sides thereon. It is indirect election, and must not be turned into a form of direct election on an occupational basis. Secondly, the evolution of the system should follow the principle of gradual development. On these grounds, the Chinese side suggested during the talks that the 1995 elections should follow the principle guiding the 1991 elections. Those which used the corporate voting method and those which used the individual voting method should continue to do so. However, according to the British proposal, corporate voting would be totally abolished. Even the representatives of corporate bodies would only vote on their own behalf, rather than on behalf of their corporate bodies. It wanted to expand the electorate of functional constituencies to include the entire working population of Hong Kong and thus turn the system into direct election on an occupational basis. This approach obviously ran counter to the British Hong Kong Government's original intention in instituting the functional constituencies system. It contradicted its own principles and the understandings reached between the two sides. The Chinese side also stated that the evolution of the functional constituencies system should follow the principle of gradual development. The seats returned by the functional constituencies would increase from 21 in 1991 to 30 in 1995, which in itself was a big progress. With the increase of the number of seats, the electorate of functional constituencies would surely expand accordingly. Yet the British side insisted on a drastic expansion of the electorate from less than 100,000 in 1991 to 2.7 million voters in 1995. Its subsequent revised proposals still aimed to bring up the electorates to 900,000, which would mean a nine-fold increase. This certainly could not be termed as "gradual development". While pointing out the irrationalities of the British proposal, the Chinese side showed flexibility in order to advance the talks. With regard to the electorate of functional constituencies, it agreed to increase the number of corporate representatives provided that the principle of corporate voting was adhered to. With regard to the nine new functional constituencies in 1995, it proposed at an earlier stage of the talks that they should be: the Hong Kong Chinese enterprises associations; labour, agriculture and fishery; textiles and garment; importers and exporters association; kai fong [neighborhood] welfare associations; insurance; maritime and sports. Later, to accommodate the views and concerns of the British side, and to facilitate the talks, the Chinese side made several adjustments to its own proposal which would have the following new constituencies: the Hong Kong Chinese Enterprises Association, insurance, labour, agriculture and fishery, textiles and garment, importers and exporters association, wholesale and retail, transport, sports, entertainment and culture. This fully testified to the sincerity and cooperative spirit of the Chinese side. After a period of talks, the two sides had narrowed their differences over the electorate question and had reached a degree of consensus on such specific questions as what constituencies would have more seats in 1995. We had expected that the British side would have shown the same flexibility and cooperative spirit after seriously studying the Chinese proposal. However, up to the last minute, it still clung to its basic position which was not in conformity with the British Hong Kong Government's original intention in instituting the functional constituencies system, or the "guiding principles" it had all along vigorously recommended to the Chinese side, or the reality in Hong Kong and the wish of people from various walks of life in Hong Kong, or the principle of "gradual development". Surely, this was not acceptable to the Chinese side. Taking account of the special importance of mainland-funded enterprises to the socio-economic life of Hong Kong, the Chinese side proposed the forming of a constituency of Hong Kong Chinese Enterprises Association. As the functional constituencies system was designed to let those sectors which play an important role in "maintaining prosperity and confidence in the future of Hong Kong" have "full representation" in the Legislative Council. [sentence as received] At present, there are three main categories of Hong Kong's businesses: foreign invested businesses, those owned by Hong Kong residents of Chinese origin, and mainland invested businesses. The first two have already been represented in the Hong Kong Legislative Council. Only the last category is not. If the 1995- elected Legislative Council is to be carried beyond 1997, it would be unreasonable to discriminate against the mainland-funded enterprises and deny them of their representation in the new legislature. Given the need to strengthen the representation of the "labour sector" in the Legislative Council though it already had two seats, the Chinese side proposed that the labour sector be given one extra seat from the proposed nine new seats. Like the existing two seats, the electorate of this new seat should comprise of the more than 400 trade unions registered in Hong Kong. But the British side, contradicting the original purpose of forming functional constituencies, tried to lump together employees of one sector with employers or professionals of another in an attempt to cause conflict and discord. The Chinese side believed that this idea proposed by the British side was undesirable. The British side proposed a "civil servant sector" in the ninth round of talks, which was designed to make a fundamental change in the civil servant system in Hong Kong, undermine the principle of political neutrality of civil servants and create confusion and discord among them. This grossly contravened the principle of convergence with the Basic Law. The British proposal was rejected by the Chinese side and met with strong discontent expressed by the Hong Kong people, including the civil servants. The British side had to give up this proposal in the end. The British side repeatedly asserted that the irregularities in the 1991 functional constituency elections were due to the use of corporate voting and that by changing all the corporate voting into individual voting these irregularities could be redressed. This is not a convincing argument. In relation to the problems which cropped up in the functional constituencies for the regional council election in 1991, the Chinese side pointed out: 1) the regional council was rather special functional constituency with only 36 constituents and would remain so in the 1995 elections; 2) this constituency voted by individuals during the 1991 election. The British side was trying to blame corporate voting for the irregularities caused by individual voting. The incongruity is clear for all to see. What is more, whatever problems which may occur in the course of elections should be resolved in a realistic manner and should not be used as a pretext to change the original purpose and special role of functional constituencies. Even the British proposal could not solve the problem it raised. The Question of Through Train Can Only Be Solved Within the Framework of the NPC Decision and Basic Law The so-called "through train" mainly means that members of Hong Kong's last Legislative Council may become, upon confirmation by the Hong Kong SAR Preparatory Committee, member of the first Legislative Council of the Hong Kong SAR of the People's Republic of China upon China's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on 1 July 1997. The decision adopted by the National People's Congress in April 1990 prescribes in Article 6 that: "If the composition of the last Hong Kong Legislative Council before the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is in conformity with the relevant provisions of this decision and the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, those of its members who uphold the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China and pledge allegiance to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, and who meet the requirements set forth in the Basic Law of the region may, upon confirmation by the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, become members of the first Legislative Council of the region." It is clear that there are explicit provisions for the criteria for the confirmation of the Legislative Council members. The NPC decision makes it clear that the composition of the last Legislative Council through the 1995 elections should conform to the NPC decision and the relevant provisions of the Basic Law. Otherwise, "conformation" of these members would be out of the question. The Chinese side proposed that the two sides first consider and agree on the question of conformity between the "composition" and the relevant provisions of the NPC decision and the Basic Law, for it was of crucial importance to the discussion of the confirmation of the Legislative Council members. To discuss the question of conformation before it was determined that the composition of the Legislative Council conformed with the Basic Law and the NPC decision, as insisted by the British side, would be illogical and make the discussion devoid of the necessary basis. The British side considered the criteria set forth in the NPC decision not objective and clear enough. So it proposed its own. It believed that a pledge of allegiance as required by Article 104 of the Basic Law would be sufficient for a member of the 1995 elected Legislative Council to continue to serve on the first SAR legislature. On more than one occasions, the British side stated that it had no intention to deprive the preparatory committee of its functions as set forth in the NPC decision, to trespass the constitutional power of the NPC and the preparatory committee, or to alter or revise the provisions of the Basic Law or the NPC decision, nor had it any intention to seek transition of all or some of the members of the Legislative Council. In the interest of a smooth transition, the Chinese side agreed that members of the Hong Kong Legislative Council under British rule, upon confirmation by the preparatory committee, could automatically become members of the first Legislative Council of the Hong Kong SAR of the People's Republic of China in 1997. Given the different nature of the two governments before and after 30 June 1997, there was no precedent to the Chinese agreement. It fully testified to the sincerity of the Chinese side for cooperation. The Chinese side held that the confirmation of members of parliament should reflect the principle of the state sovereignty and there were clear-cut provisions in the decision of the National People's Congress on criteria for confirmation. In the NPC decision the task of confirming the members of the Legislative Council was entrusted to the Hong Kong SAR Preparatory Committee to be set up in 1996. The Chinese side could only act in accordance with the provisions in the Basic Law and the NPC decision and was not in a position to amend them, for it should not infringe upon the power of confirming the members of the Legislative Council vested in the preparatory committee by the National People's Congress. In the view of the Chinese side, the British proposal that a mere oral statement by the 1995 elected members of the Legislative Council would be sufficient to make them members of the first Legislative Council of the Hong Kong SAR was in effect designed to strip the preparatory committee of the power of confirmation and render the confirmation meaningless. The British position also contradicted its own statements. Article 104 of the Basic Law contained provisions on the normal procedures that the chief executive, principal officials, members of the Executive Council and of the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong SAR must go through when assuming office. It had nothing to do with the terms for confirming the members of the Legislative Council. Continued service of members of the Legislative Council on the first Legislative Council of the Hong Kong SAR was a matter involving two governments different in nature, and members of the Hong Kong Legislative Council could become members of the first Legislative Council only after being confirmed by the preparatory committee. Prior to this, they were not qualified to go through procedures of oath taking according to Article 104 of the Basic Law. Therefore, the oath taking procedures cannot substitute confirmation of members of the Legislative Council by the preparatory committee. In brief, the Chinese side could only discuss with the British side the confirmation issue within the context of the Basic Law and the relevant NPC decisions. The Chinese side took note of the wish of the British side that the Chinese side make an explanation of the criteria for confirmation and recommendations to the relevant bodies. It expressed its willingness to explore an appropriate solution within the context of the Basic Law and the NPC decisions. To this end, the Chinese side offered some explanatory remarks on the criteria for confirmation contained in the NPC decision. It spelled out as follows: members of the first Legislative Council of the Hong Kong SAR of the People's Republic of China must (1) pledge allegiance to the Hong Kong SAR of the People's Republic of China; (2) love China and love Hong Kong, uphold and abide by the Basic Law, support the resumption by the People's Republic of China of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong as of 1 July 1997 and be committed to a smooth transition and transfer of government in Hong Kong in 1997 and its long-term prosperity and stability; (3) support the principle of "one country, two systems." Any act of violating the Basic Law, participation or playing a leading role in any action aimed at subverting the central government of China or changing the socialist system in the mainland would be regarded as failure to uphold and abide by the Basic Law and contravening the principle of "one country, two systems". (4) Meet the requirements set out in the relevant provisions of the Basic Law. For example, a member of the first Legislative Council must be a permanent resident of Hong Kong and should not have committed any criminal offense. It was in the spirit of seeking a settlement that the Chinese side put forward the above views. In fact, the talks between the two sides on the "through train" was still going on, and the two sides could have continued their exchange of views and worked out an appropriate solution. But the British side used the media under its control to publicly distort the views of the Chinese side outside the talks. A thorough and balanced study of the Chinese explanations would have enabled one to come to a just conclusion. The Chinese Side Made Tremendous Efforts for Agreement on Arrangements for District Organization Elections To push forward the talks, the Chinese side put forward a proposal as early as the fourth round of the talks that the two sides first reach agreement on the arrangements for the elections of the district boards and municipal councils and then move on to the discussions on the arrangements for the Legislative Council elections in 1995. This proposal was not accepted by the British side. In the discussions that followed, it refused to move away from Chris Patten's constitutional package, which was the cause of slow progress in the talks. In order to achieve a breakthrough, Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, during his meeting with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd in New York on 1 October 1993, once again proposed to discuss and settle the question of arrangements for the district organization elections first. Mr. Qian said in explicit terms: As matters related to the district organization elections are relatively easy and time is pressing, the two sides may discuss them first and try to reach agreement. The 1995 Legislative Council elections are more complicated and there is still some time left to allow the two sides to discuss them at a later stage. This was what the Chinese side meant by separating discussions on the two phases of the elections in accordance with the principle of "starting from the easier part and then moving on to the more difficult part". On that occasion, the British side did not express agreement. During the thirteenth round, it said it could accept the proposal on condition that the voting age be lowered from 21 to 18, the voting methods proposed by the British side be adopted and appointed membership be abolished. While welcoming the long-awaited British agreement to discuss arrangements for the district organization elections first, the Chinese side pointed out that to set preconditions was not a constructive approach. The Chinese side raised three major issues of concern at the preliminary stage of the discussions on the arrangements for district organization elections: 1. In the last few years of the transitional period, the nature of the district boards and municipal councils as not being organs of political power and their current functions should remain unchanged so as to converge with the relevant provisions of the Basic Law. 2. In order to converge with the Basic Law, the Chinese side asked the British side to amend the relevant provisions in the Hong Kong election ordinance so as to enable Hong Kong deputies to Chinese people's congresses at various levels to stand for elections in Hong Kong. After long procrastination, the British side finally agreed to this request. 3. Appointed membership in the district organizations. Both the chairmen and the members of the district boards and municipal councils were opposed to the total abolition of the appointed membership. In view of this wish of the people of Hong Kong and considering the actual operation of the district boards and municipal councils, the Chinese side believed that to keep the appointed seats was in conformity with Hong Kong's reality and could enable those concerned to play a positive role in safeguarding the welfare of the residents of their districts. It therefore maintained that the existing appointed seats in both the district boards and municipal councils should be kept. The British side, however, insisted on a total abolition of all these seats on the ground that the appointed membership of the Legislative Council would be abolished in 1995. The Chinese sides said that there was no automatic link between the appointed membership in the district boards and municipal councils and the Legislative Council elections, because the two were different both in nature and functions. Nevertheless, in order to move the talks forward, the Chinese side offered to be flexible to a certain extent on the proportion of the appointed seats provided that the British side agree in principle to maintain the appointed membership. The British side refused to make any concession. In face of this situation, the Chinese side made another effort by agreeing to reduce the proportion of the appointed seats from the current figure of over one third to one fourth of the total members in accordance with the principle of gradual development. Again it was rejected by the British side. Considering that this was the only difference left between the two sides on the 1994 elections and desiring to reach an early agreement with the British side on the district organization elections, the Chinese side put forward at the fifteenth round another proposal which accommodated the positions of the two sides and bypassed their difference. According to this proposal, the two sides would state in an understanding: "The British side stands for the abolition of the appointed membership in the district boards and the municipal councils in the 1994/95 elections while the Chinese side stands for the maintenance of an appropriate proportion of the appointed seats. The number of appointed seats in the district boards and municipal councils will be left to Hong Kong SAR Government to determine, on its own, after 30 June 1997 in accordance with the provisions of Article 98 of the Basic Law." In fact, by this proposal, the British side did not have to retain appointed seats before 30 June 1997 and after that date the Hong Kong SAR Government may, in accordance with the provisions of the Basic Law, retain an appropriate proportion of appointed seats as the people of Hong Kong had wished. This proposal of the Chinese side was entirely positive and constructive. During the discussions on appointed membership in district organizations, the Chinese sides also expressed agreement to lowering the voting age from 21 to 18 and indicated that it would take no exception to the "single seat, single vote" system proposed by the British side for the district board and municipal council elections. This shows that the Chinese side had actually accepted most of the British proposals on the three issues of voting age, voting methods and appointed membership in relation to the district board and municipal council elections. Since two other related questions were basically resolved, i.e., confirming that the nature and functions of the district organizations would remain unchanged and commitment to remove provisions barring Hong Kong deputies to the Chinese people's congresses at various levels from standing for elections, the two sides were close to agreement on all issues related to the arrangements for the district organization elections. If the British side had the minimum sincerity, the two sides would have been able to reach agreement on this question after the fifteenth round of the talks. What the British side did was to raise new demands in its response to the Chinese proposal through diplomatic channels before the sixteenth round. It asserted that the "single seat, single vote" voting method for the district board and municipal council elections must also be applied to the geographical elections for the 1995 Legislative Council. The Chinese side pointed out that it was inappropriate to include this point in the present agreement. The Chinese side had made major concessions to the British side on the three questions of concern to it related to the district organization elections. Now the British side raised new issues. It was really going too far. During the sixteenth and seventeenth rounds, the British side insisted on including the provision that the Legislative Council elections would also use the "single seat, single vote" method in the memorandum of understanding on the arrangements for the district organization elections. It explained that by insisting on this method in the Legislative Council elections, it wished to have a balanced agreement out of both practical and political considerations. The Chinese side believed, however, that none of the British explanations was tenable. 1. To address the British concern about "balance", the Chinese side submitted to the British side the draft text of a verbal understanding (see Annex V) during the seventeenth round of the talks, proposing to confine the three questions of voting age, voting methods and the removal of restrictions on Hong Kong deputies to Chinese people's congresses to the elections of the district boards and municipal councils and to leave all questions related to the Legislative Council elections to a later stage. This new proposal aimed at seeking a solution was rejected by the British side out of hand. 2. The British side alleged that the legislation on the voting method for Legislative Council elections needed to be passed as early as possible; otherwise, there would have to be two separate legislations on the question of voting methods, which would be a waste of time. In the view of the Chinese side, to have two separate legislations was only a technical question. There was no natural link between the voting methods for the district board and municipal council elections and those for the Legislative Council elections, not to mention there had been separate legislations on these two sets of elections. Since Legislative Council elections would not be held until September 1995, there was not much time pressure. It was not necessary to drag the question of the voting methods for Legislative Council elections into the understanding on the district board and municipal council elections now. It was entirely possible and proper to leave this matter to the later discussions between the two sides on Legislative Council elections. Otherwise, it would only complicate the talks. While saying that there was not much time left for the district board and municipal council elections, the British side insisted on dragging the issue of the voting methods for Legislative Council elections into present discussions, which could well be settled at a later stage. By so doing, it was placing obstacles to the talks and trying to delay them. The Chinese side found it difficult to understand. 3. The British side alleged that a motion on using the "single seat, single vote" system in the 1995 Legislative Council elections had been adopted by the Legislative Council and that leaders of the two main parties in the current Legislative Council all supported this method. The Chinese had always regarded the Hong Kong Legislative Council as Hong Kong governor's advisory body in legislative matters. If the British side insisted on following the views of the Legislative Council in the talks between the two governments, it would be totally unacceptable to the Chinese side. As far as the Chinese side was concerned, this was a matter of political principle. The British Side Deliberately Scuttled the Talks As the British side had insisted that it be written into the memorandum of understanding on district organization election arrangements that the "single-seat, single-vote" voting method be applied also to the Legislative Council's geographical elections in 1995, the Chinese side, at the beginning of the 16th round of the talks, refuted this unreasonable British demand as an artificial complication. But the British side made counter-charges that the Chinese side had retrogressed from its previous position on the question of appointed membership. In response, the Chinese side reiterated its position enunciated during the 15th round and pointed out that there was no retrogression at all of the Chinese position. It suggested in unequivocal terms that should the British side go along, the two sides could reach agreement. Evidently, the British accusations of Chinese retrogression of position were merely aimed at misleading the public and absolving itself from the responsibility for its reluctance to reach agreement with the Chinese side. In fact, it was the British side that had retrogressed. Take for example the elections for the district boards and the municipal councils. The British side gave approval to the Chinese proposal for a settlement of the question of appointed seats after the 15th round, accepting almost all the wording proposed by the Chinese side. At the 17th round, the wording of the British proposal on the same question was on the whole similar to the Chinese proposal. But later, the British side unexpectedly questioned the legitimacy of the Chinese Government in representing the unborn government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to discuss with the British side on appointed membership of the district boards and municipal councils. It went so far as to accuse the Chinese side of causing an erosion of the autonomy promised to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region under the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. This was entirely unjustifiable. The first draft of the five points of understanding proposed by the Chinese side during the 15th round contained a sentence which read: "The government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will determine on its own the number of appointed seats of district boards and municipal councils in accordance with the provisions of Article 98 of Basic Law." The words "on its own" were later taken out for the sake of terseness, without altering the original meaning. By the time the talks broke down, the British side stated repeatedly that failure to reach an understanding with the Chinese side on district organization elections was due to the Chinese refusal to have the voting method of the Legislative Council included. But now, the British side switched to listing the so-called Chinese refusal to totally abolish the appointed seats as an important cause. Such inconsistency could hardly justify the British position. During the 17th round of talks, the Chinese side made one more major effort and submitted to the British side the draft text of the above-mentioned five points of understanding on "complete separation" of the discussions on the election arrangements for 1994 from those for 1995. However, this constructive proposal of the Chinese side was promptly rejected by the British side, which read out a so-called "carefully thought-out" statement announcing that the British side was unable to continue its discussions with the Chinese side on an understanding of the first phase. Subsequently, the Chinese side formally reminded the British side that as early as 7 April 1993 when the two sides agreed to hold talks, the Chinese side stated that, should the British side submit the so-called "constitutional bills" to the Legislative Council for deliberation before the two sides reached agreement through talks, that would mean the breakdown of the talks and the Chinese side was not to be held responsible for it. The British side turned a deaf ear to the Chinese warning. On 10 December, the governor [of] Hong Kong published a draft legislation of the first stage constitutional package and submitted it to the Legislative Council on 15 December, thus scuttling Sino-British talks on electoral arrangements in Hong Kong. Concluding Remarks From the above-mentioned facts, one can see that the British side had no sincerity in the talks on the 1994/95 electoral arrangements in Hong Kong. Although it agreed at the first to base the talks on the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the principle of convergence with the Basic Law and the existing agreements and understandings reached between China and Britain, it refused to keep its words during the talks. It was this trick of paying lip service played by the British side that prevented the talks from moving on the right track. The British side had attempted, at the very outset of the talks, to include in the agenda the three items that fell within the scope of China's sovereignty, thus setting obstacles to the talks. Soon after the beginning of the talks, the British Hong Kong authorities carried out electoral arrangements which ought to be agreed upon by the two sides through consultations. Finally, it concocted some excuses and left the negotiation table. Furthermore, it submitted the first part of the "constitutional package" to the Legislative Council, leading to the breakdown of the talks. Now, the British side has not only refused to withdraw the first part of the "constitutional package", but has even gone further by announcing that it would submit its second part to the Legislative Council as well. It is determined to shut the door to negotiations once and for all. It is the British side which shall bear full responsibility for the rupture of the talks. The Chinese proposals for the 1994/95 electoral arrangements are based on the three principles guiding the Sino- British talks. They are designed to facilitate a smooth transition in Hong Kong and ensure its residents a happy and peaceful life. They are conducive to the convergence with the Basic Law and reflect the general wish of the people of Hong Kong. However, the British side has made unjustifiable accusations against China on these proposals, saying that the Chinese proposals would make it difficult to "maintain the rule of law" and could lead to "possible manipulation of elections". In fact, it is the violation of the Basic Law that would cause disruption of the rule of law and it is the British side that is attempting to manipulate elections. The British side has criticized the Chinese proposals concerning election by functional constituencies, asserting that they may cause "corruption and vote-rigging". These allegations are totally untenable and also reflect their disrespect for the voters and present members of the Legislative Council elected by functional constituencies. The British proposal concerning the electoral methods for the functional constituencies not only runs counter to the original purposes of the functional constituencies, but also fails to follow the principle of gradual development. The British insistence on the elimination of the appointed seats in the district boards and the two municipal councils is against the wishes of the majority of the Hong Kong [HK] people. On the issue of "through train" or confirmation of the Legislative Council members, the British side has tried to deprive the Preparatory Committee for the HK SAR of its actual confirmation right. It has up to now refused to acknowledge the agreements and understandings reached between the two foreign ministers on the question of the election committee. All this fully reveals that the true intention of the "constitutional package" the British side clings to, taking advantage of the remaining years of the British rule in Hong Kong and waving the banner of "democracy", it tries to create division and confusion, place obstacles to a smooth transition in Hong Kong and turn the last elections of the three-tier structure to be held before 1997 in Britain's favour so as to maintain its influence over Hong Kong for as long as possible after 1997 and to manipulate the political situation there. The core of the controversy between China and Britain over the political structure in Hong Kong is not whether democracy should be promoted or whether there should be "openness and fairness" as claimed by the British side, but rather whether international commitments should be honoured, whether there should be convergence with the Basic Law, and whether a smooth transition in Hong Kong should be achieved. The whole controversy was started by a shift of Britain's Hong Kong policy. Facts will prove that this policy shift will not serve the British interests and will hurt Hong Kong as well. The Sino-British talks have broken down as a result of the British disruption. The Chinese side deems it necessary to reiterate in all seriousness that in accordance with the provisions of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the British administration of Hong Kong shall come to an end on 30 June 1997 and the Chinese Government shall resume the exercise of its sovereignty over Hong Kong as of 1 July 1997. The last district boards, the two municipal councils and the Legislative Council which form part of the political structure of Hong Kong under the British administration, will stop functioning along with the conclusion of the period of the British administration. The political structure of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region after 1 July 1997 will be built in accordance with the relevant decisions of the NPC of the People's Republic of China and the provisions of the Basic Law. Hong Kong will soon return to the embrace of its motherland. Nobody can stop it. The Chinese Government and people are confident and capable of resuming the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong as scheduled, implementing the policy of "one country, two systems" and the Basic Law and ensuring long-term prosperity and stability in Hong Kong. Annex I Chinese Draft of Points To Be Confirmed by the Two Sides In late April 1993, the representative of the Chinese Government, Vice Foreign Minister Jiang Enzhu, and the representative of the British Government, Ambassador Robin McLaren, in accordance with the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the principle of convergence with the Basic Law and the relevant agreements and understandings reached between the two sides, held two rounds of talks on Hong Kong's 1994/95 electoral arrangements. 1.

Both sides confirm that, before 1997, Hong Kong's political structure should develop gradually on the basis of the Joint Declaration and the reality in Hong Kong and should converge with the Basic Law. 3. Both sides confirm that before 1997 the "executive-led" political structure should be maintained in Hong Kong so as to converge with the Basic Law. 4. As the 1994/95 elections in Hong Kong bear on the smooth transition to 1997, the Chinese and British sides shall conduct serious consultations with a view to reaching consensus. 5.
