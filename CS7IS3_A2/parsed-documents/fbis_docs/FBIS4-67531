The forest protection and management regulations, a revision of 1987 regulations, divides Guangdong's forests into ecological and public forests and commercial forests, to which different rules will apply. The ecological and public forests include those for wind shelter, water and soil conservation, recreation and sightseeing, and protection of plants and animals. This area of forest land must account for no less than 30 percent of the total forest area and will be maintained under the government budget. It will be free from commercial felling, the new law reads. Forest resources, including timber, fuel and economic forests, fall under the category of commercial forests. According to the new regulations, the felling of commercial trees will be controlled by quotas and a licensing system. Commercial forests could be subject to rent, transfer and mortgage. The new law encourages the development of forests through means other than governmental investment, such as the use of overseas funds or stock companies. The publishing of the new law was preceded by the province's announcement last year that its forest coverage had reached 53.7 percent. Forest officials said the new law is aimed at consolidating and expanding the province's achievement in afforestation, and establishing a new forest management system that fits with a market economy. The new law stipulates that the province will keep its forest coverage above 50 percent and that all cities and towns allow for 30 percent of urban areas to remain green land. The new law also contains detailed articles on punishment for offenses.
