Gen. Valeriy Patrikeyev, commander of the collective peace-keeping forces in Tajikistan, the sociopolitical situation in the Republic is gradually returning to normal. Making this statement at a news conference today, he linked this positive development with the constructive policy pursued by Tajikistan's leadership and with the efforts of the collective peace-keeping forces stationed here. This was the first public appearance before the press of the new commander, who replaced his predecessor on the post, Col. Gen. Boris Pyankov. Valeriy Patrikeyev went on to emphasize that he had reached these optimistic conclusions following two weeks of officially studying the situation in Tajikistan and holding numerous meetings and discussions with the Republic's residents from virtually all regions, as well as with Tajikistan's top leadership. At the same time the Russian general described as expedient the decision of the council of CIS heads of state held in Moscow on 15 April to extend the mandate of the collective peace-keeping forces until 31 December 1994, in view of continuing tensions on the Tajik-Afghan border. In the general's view, the intransigent Tajik opposition has not renounced its plans to destabilize the situation on individual stretches of the border; armed provocations against Russian border guards are continuing, as are attempts by armed fighters to break into Tajik territory. The situation is particularly alarming in the Pamir sector, where enemy personnel and hardware concentration is continuing in the Afghan provinces bordering on Tajikistan. In the words of the commander, the obvious purpose of this provocation is to attempt to break through the border on a mass scale with subsequent deep penetration into the Republic's territory in order to conduct combat operations against the present government. However, all these attempts are doomed, the commander said. The collective peace-keeping forces and the national armed forces have sufficient resources to deal decisively with all these ventures. At the same time Gen. Patrikeyev expressed himself in favor of political settlement of the Tajik conflict, noting that the military option was a dead end. "My dream is of the collective peace-keeping forces becoming redundant in the Republic with regard to their participation in hostilities. And I will do all I can in my capacity to settle the conflict by peaceful means," concluded the commander of the collective peace-keeping forces.
