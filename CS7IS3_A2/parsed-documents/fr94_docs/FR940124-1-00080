FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John Kolotos. Telephone: (202) 708&hyph;7888. Individuals who use a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD) may call the Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) at 1&hyph;800&hyph;877&hyph;8339 between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., Eastern time, Monday through Friday. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In order to approve a postsecondary education institution to participate in the student financial assistance programs authorized under Title IV of the HEA (Title IV, HEA programs) and many other Federal programs, the Secretary must determine, in part, that the institution satisfies the statutory definition of an ``institution of higher education.'' Under the HEA and other Federal statutes, one element of that definition requires an eligible institution of higher education to be accredited or preaccredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Secretary as a reliable authority as to the quality of the education or training provided by the institution. Another element requires an eligible institution to be legally authorized to provide an educational program beyond the secondary level in the State in which it is located. Thus, the statutory definition of an institution of higher education provides the framework for a shared responsibility among accrediting agencies, States, and the Federal government to ensure that the ``gate'' to the Title IV, HEA programs is opened to only those institutions that provide students with quality education or training worth the time, energy, and money they invest in it. The three ``gatekeepers'' sharing this responsibility have traditionally been referred to as ``the triad.'' While the concept of a triad of entities responsible for gatekeeping has had a long history, the triad has not always worked as effectively as it should to ensure educational quality, nor has it served as an effective deterrent to abuse by institutions participating in the Title IV, HEA programs. For several years, certain institutions participating in the Title IV, HEA programs have failed to provide students with education or training of an acceptable level of quality; they have also failed to treat students fairly. In addition, they have failed to meet acceptable standards of financial responsibility and administrative capability and to adequately protect Title IV, HEA program funds entrusted to them. The institutions that have engaged in these abusive practices are not restricted to a particular sector of higher education. Rather, the abuses have been found in all types of institutions participating in the Title IV, HEA programs, including those in the private non-profit and public sectors of higher education as well as those in the proprietary sector. At the same time, gatekeeping functions have not been carried out effectively. For example, some accrediting agencies have not taken sufficient care to ensure the quality of the education or training provided by the institutions or programs they accredit or to protect student interests when they accredit particular institutions or programs. Moreover, some States have also not taken sufficient care to ensure the quality of the education or training provided by the institutions they authorize or license to operate in the State or to protect student interests. Finally, the Federal government's management of its responsibilities to determine eligibility and to certify institutions to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs has not always been adequate to prevent abusive practices at institutions that participate in those programs. Consequently, in the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;325, Congress amended the HEA to provide for a new part H of Title IV entitled ``Program Integrity Triad.'' Under that part, States and accrediting agencies are required to assume major new oversight responsibilities, and States, accrediting associations, and the Secretary are linked to create a stronger and more coordinated evaluation of institutions that participate or wish to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary believes that the most appropriate approach to this coordinated evaluation of institutions by the three components of the triad is a complementary one with each component focusing its evaluation on its obligations within the context of the HEA. Thus, the focus for accrediting agencies is the quality of education or training provided by the institutions or programs they accredit. For States, which already had responsibility for determining that institutions have the legal authority to operate within the State, the HEA added a new focus: reviewing institutions that trigger certain statutory review criteria. The focus of the Secretary's evaluation of institutions is the administrative and financial capacity of those institutions to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs.
