Since the Kim Yong-sam government set sail, however, military generals from Pusan and South Kyongsang Provinces [PK], which is President Kim's hometown as well as his political base of operation, are increasingly apparent. Moreover, generals from the PK region occupy key positions in the military where there is the possibility of exercising influence on those from these regions. Officers point out that this is greatly hindering military harmony and morale. Military authorities state: "The government's military personnel reform is focused on excluding the members of Hanahoe. However, to choose generals from the Pusan and South Kyongsang Province region regardless of their capability and temperament is the same as when the Hanahoe monopolized the military in the past." They also express the worry that intervention in military personnel changes by Chongwadae [presidential offices] aides and authority figures is the same as when Chongwadae's Security Service intervened in the past. Currently, Chongwadae and the Ministry of Defense is influencing the military. Those from the PK region occupy an absolute advantage over those from other regions in key posts in each military headquarters. Pak Kwan-yong, Chongwadae's chief secretary, graduated from Tongnae High School in Pusan; and Chong Chong-uk, assistant to the president for foreign and national security affairs, graduated from Pusan High School. Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae graduated from Kyongnam High School, where President Kim also graduated. Regardless of a small number of military officers from this school, during personnel changes last spring military officers, including Brigadier General Pyon Ho-in, who graduated from the 24th class of the Military Academy, was promoted to major general and now occupies a position in the key division of the capital district. While appointing generals to take command of a division of the capital district, almost all of those who graduated from Kyongnam High School were promoted. Those who graduated from Kyongnam High School include Major General Chon Sang-pae from the 22d class of the Military Academy, who is the chief of staff of intelligence of the ROK Army Headquarters; Maj. Gen. An Song-yong from the 23d class of the Military Academy, who is the commander of a division in the capital district; and Pak No-suk from the 24th class of the Military Academy, who is the chief secretary of the Chief of Staff of the ROK Army. In the past military government the main current of the military was the TK faction, as well as those who graduated from Pusan High School. Even in the Kim government, those who graduated from Pusan High School occupy key positions including the Chongwadae and the military. Gen. Yun Yong-nam from the 19th class of the Military Academy, who is the commander of the three armed services; Yu Chong-kap, who was promoted to lieutenant general in April, is the director of intelligence headquarters under the Defense Military; Maj. Gen. Han Sung-ui from the 22d class of the Military Academy, who is the policy and planning officer of the Defense Ministry; and Yi Ui-se from the 22d class of the Military Academy, who is the commander of an intelligence command, are all from Pusan High School. Military figures from Pusan and South Kyongsang Provinces are regarded as those who hold key positions under the current government through school and regional connections. Lieutenant Gen. Yi Yu-su from the 20th class of the Military Academy, who was promoted to head of the field Army; Maj. Gen. Cho Yong-nae from the 177th class of the class-A officers' candidate school; and Maj. Gen. Kim Hui-sang from the 24th class of the Military Academy, were promoted to divisional commander by the new government. Four to five high-ranking cadres, including Commander Yim Chae-mun from the third class of the Reserve Officers' Training Corps of the Defense Security Command, are from Pusan and South Kyongsang Provinces. The Kim Yong-sam government is inclined to exclude almost all of the TK figures from military personnel changes. In October's regular personnel change, not one person out of the 20 from the TK region were promoted to lieutenant general and major general. In the April personnel change, only one person out of the 13 was promoted from this region. A Defense Ministry colonel expressed dissatisfaction by saying: "Whenever the opportunity arises, the military supreme command states that military morale is higher than ever before. Nevertheless, mainly officers from the president's hometown are chosen for key posts and promotions. It seems that the military as a force for a possible coup d'etat is still recognized." Another problem is that Chongwadae aides and the president's closest aides are interfering in military personnel changes. People who have a good knowledge of military personnel reveal that since the inauguration of the Kim regime, outside pressure for military personnel changes takes places with each passing day. An unidentified general said: "Since the last period of last year, the president's direct family members, who have no relation with the military, have been meeting with high-ranking military generals and interfering in military affairs, including personnel changes. A popular joke among the generals these days is that if you have not met any of the president's family members, you are an impostor."
