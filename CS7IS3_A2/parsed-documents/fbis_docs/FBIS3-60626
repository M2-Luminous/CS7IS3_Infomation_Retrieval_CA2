Functionaries from the Orientalism Institute, the Far East Affairs Institute, and the Human Affairs Institute of the Academy of Sciences of Russia, and professors and doctors from the Philosophy Department of the Moscow University were invited to the meeting. DPRK Ambassador to Russia Son Song-pil and embassy staff were present. Ambassador Son spoke first. The ambassador said that our country has achieved great results of socialist construction in all sectors under the wise leadership of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. He exposed details of the vicious maneuver by the U.S. imperialists and international reactionaries aimed at stifling [apsal] our socialist system under the pretext of the suspicion of nonexistent nuclear development, and noted: As the world knows, our country has neither the will nor the ability to produce nuclear weapons. Even if we can produce them, for what would they be? The nuclear problem was raised in our country as the United States posed nuclear threats to us by deploying about 1,000 nuclear weapons in South Korea and conducting the Team Spirit joint military exercise, a nuclear war exercise. Therefore, in order to fundamentally solve the nuclear problem of the Korean peninsula, talks must be held between the United States, the nuclear problem maker, and the DPRK, its victim. Pressure or threats will not work with us. The ambassador pointed out that the United States has been delaying the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks while demanding unjust conditions, and said: We proposed a package solution method, which requires that the United States and the DPRK decide what each side should do to resolve the nuclear issue and implement their duties at the same time. If the United States accepts our proposal and the DPRK-U.S. talks are successfully held, the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula will be fundamentally resolved. After exposing the fact that Japan and the South Korean authorities are viciously maneuvering to break up DPRK-U.S. talks, the ambassador stressed that their maneuver is aimed at accelerating their own nuclear weapons development and nuclear armament by using the suspicion of our nuclear development as a pretext. The ambassador urged the United States to abandon its insidious purpose and accede sincerely to the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks, and he continued: Our position is clear. We will not hold talks while being under pressure. The United States must clearly know who its dialogue counterpart is. If the United States breaks up DPRK-U.S. talks and continues to pose the nuclear threat to us, we will take a corresponding measure [ungdanghan chochi] of retreating the suspension of the effectuation of our declaration to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. We are ready for both dialogue and war. We have a firm economy, a strong national defense, and the might of single-hearted unity of the people who are united firmly around the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. No force in the world can break up this single-hearted unity. Today, our revolutionary cause pioneered by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has brilliantly been succeeded to the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. Our people will firmly unite around the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il in the future too, will defend the banner of socialism to the last, and will brilliantly consummate the socialist cause in our country. Speeches were made by (Kavalyov), professor and doctor of Moscow University; (Vanin), chief of the Orientalism Institute of the Academy of Sciences of Russia; and other participants at the meeting. They congratulated the Korean people on their results achieved in the revolution and construction under the banner of socialism, and entirely supported our principled position toward resolving the nuclear issue. They extended the greatest honor and gratitude to the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, the creator of the chuche idea, and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, the successor of the great leader's revolutionary cause.
