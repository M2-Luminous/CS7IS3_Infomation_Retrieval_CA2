Branding this as a premeditated and deliberate move to push the North-South relations to a more acute phase of confrontation and war from the beginning of the year, a MINJU CHOSON news analyst says: It goes without saying that the suspension of the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises will lose its meaning in case a greater war game than the "Team Spirit" is staged. If things go like this, the "nuclear problem" will remain unsolved on the Korean peninsula indefinitely, to say nothing of detente and peace. By more desperately resorting to war moves, the Kim Yong-sam group reveals once again that it is a group of warlikers and traitors outdistancing the preceding military dictators. Politics is in confusion in South Korea. Through several working contacts between the DPRK and the United States, the third round of talks was put on the order of the day and it was agreed to settle the issues in a package deal as proposed by the DPRK. Driven to a miserable position under such situation, the traitor Kim Yong-sam is getting hysteric in North-South confrontation and staging feverish war games from the beginning of the year and is scheming to stage a war game surpassing the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises in summer. This is intended to threaten the DPRK and put a spoke in the wheel of the DPRK-USA talks, the key to the solution of the nuclear problem and peace on the Korean peninsula. The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique must look straight at the reality and act with discretion.
