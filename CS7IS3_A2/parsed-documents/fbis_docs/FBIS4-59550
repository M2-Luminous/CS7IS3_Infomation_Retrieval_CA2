"The priority is not to capture Aden but to put it under blockade, by controlling its entries and surrounding heights," Basindwah, a northerner loyal to the president, told the Qatari newspaper AL-SHARQ. The northern army would not try to capture Aden, a stronghold of Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, to "save human lives and vital economic facilities" in the southern port city. "Toppling the separatist clique within the Yemeni Socialist Party" of al-Bid "is the responsibility of the people, the leaders and the unionist militants of the YSP and their armed forces," Basindwah said. His comments came as Salih's forces, fighting an all-out war against al-Bid's since May 5, were reported Sunday to be advancing on Aden. Basindwah repeated that al-Bid and his followers should be brought to court "for plotting against the unity" of Yemen. North and South Yemen merged into a single state four years ago. He reiterated the north's rejection of an Arab military intervention to stop the fighting, saying this would mean a "recognition of an entity led by the rebels."
