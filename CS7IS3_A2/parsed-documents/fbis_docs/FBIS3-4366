Explaining how her family spent Lunar New Year, Deng said: "During his stay in Shanghai, my father played bridge with his colleagues." In the interview, she also revealed that she has devoted herself to writing after resigning from a research office. She is in Japan to attend a commemoration of the publication of the Japanese edition of her book My Father, Deng Xiaoping which has been published in China and Hong Kong. Touching on her father's health, she said: "My father quit smoking New Year's Day 1989 at the urging of doctors. He drinks two small glasses of Shawxing liquor at meals and takes medicine. Although I do not know what kind of medicine he takes unless I ask the doctors about it, I assume the medicine is a vitamin." In the interview, the Chinese leader's daughter added: "My father stayed in Shanghai from mid-December last year to February this year during this Lunar New Year. He enjoyed his stay in the city, dining with his grandchildren. He played bridge three times with his colleagues. He appeared to have won only one game." She raised the subject of dancing while speaking of the Lunar New Year, saying: "I am very good at dancing. Will you dance with me?" Asked to comment on reports that she works as "secretary to her father," she said with a sweet smile: "The reports are incorrect." In the interview, she stated: "My father's hearing is very poor, and it is my duty to translate what he speaks in the Sichuan dialect into Mandarin. Another duty is to record my father's remarks." During the interview, she also said: "I am my father's hearing aid." She went on to say that she hands over records to her father's secretaries, and therefore she is the "secretary to my father's secretaries."
