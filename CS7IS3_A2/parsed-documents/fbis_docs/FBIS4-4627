I would like to thank the co-prime ministers and the Cambodian people for extending us a warm welcome and showing the hospitality and sentiment of a close neighbor. I would also like to thank you for your kind words on the Vietnamese nation and people, our traditional friendship and cooperation, and the good-neighborly relations between our two nations and peoples. On this occasion, we would like to share our pleasure at learning that the king of Cambodia has recovered from his illness and will return to Cambodia -- together with his sons, daughters, nieces, and nephews -- to celebrate the upcoming Cambodian traditional new year. I would also like to share my pleasure in noting the achievements made by the Cambodian people, under the clear-sighted leadership of King Norodom Sihanouk and the Royal Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia, on the path toward attaining peace, national reconciliation, and a prosperous and happy life. I am convinced that these encouraging achievements will open new and favorable conditions for the Cambodian people to build their country into a peaceful, independent, neutral, unified, nonaligned, and prosperous nation, thereby meeting the earnest aspiration of the Cambodian people and their friends around the world, including the Vietnamese people. Vietnam and Cambodia are two close and neighboring countries. Our nations share a longstanding traditional friendship. We have shared weal and woe over the past several decades. The Vietnamese people have consistently and highly valued the fine sentiment and wholehearted support and assistance extended to them by King Norodom Sihanouk and the Cambodia people. We always consider the consolidation and development of our relations of friendship and cooperation with the Cambodian people a major policy of our nation. We are very pleased to note that our fine and proven relationship has satisfactorily developed in the new situation through various lively events, such as exchanges of visits by high-level delegations from the two countries in the recent past. On this occasion, I would like to assert the aspiration and unswerving determination of the Vietnamese Government and people to do their best in strengthening and developing relations of friendship, cooperation, and good neighborliness with the Kingdom of Cambodia. We are convinced that with goodwill and effort by both sides, Vietnamese-Cambodian relations -- built on the basis of respecting each other's national independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity; and of equality and mutual interest -- will be further consolidated and developed for the happiness and prosperity of the people in each country and for regional peace, stability, cooperation, and development. On the occasion of the Cambodian traditional new year, Chol Chhnam Thmei, on behalf of the Vietnamese Government and people I would like to convey my best wishes to King Norodom Sihanouk, Queen Monique, and the Royal Cambodian Government and people. [applause] At this happy moment, in the spirit of our fraternal friendship, I would like to propose a toast to the good health of King Norodom Sihanouk and Queen Monique and to the good health of the co-prime ministers and the Vietnamese and Cambodian leaders. I wish the Cambodian people even greater achievements in their cause of building Cambodia into a peaceful and prosperous nation; I hope the traditional relations of friendship, cooperation, and good neighborliness between Vietnam and Cambodia are further consolidated and developed; and I wish good health to all of the distinguished guests here. [applause]
