President Mandela is representing South Africa officially for the first time at both meetings. Estelle Pienaar filed this report: [Begin Pienaar recording] Key developmental issues for Africa, and in particular southern Africa, tops the agenda in Harare. The Zimbabwean capital today played host to the meeting of the Global Coalition for Africa and will tomorrow be the venue for the meeting of the Frontline states. The body was founded as a front of neighboring countries against South Africa. Now that South Africa has shed its apartheid burden, and is back with a vengeance in the international community and the brotherhood of African countries, the organization has lost the very reason for its existence. However, it's believed that Zimbabwe is keen to see the establishment of a new organization to replace the Frontline states. But other parties feel that such a body would have little value as most of the issues affecting southern African countries could be dealt with by the Southern African Development Community, SADC. Zimbabwean newspapers report that the name Frontline States is expected to be dropped in preference for something that sounds less confrontational. Whatever the outcome of tomorrow's meeting, the future of southern Africa will hopefully never be as divided as its past. In recent years the world has increasingly turned its back on Africa. Any organization which unites South Africa with the rest of the sub-continent in the interest of regional peace, stability and economic growth, might just provide the impetus to prove that this region can survive, and indeed prosper.
