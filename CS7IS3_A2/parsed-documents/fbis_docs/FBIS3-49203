Had there been no testimony by the brave convoy crew members, which have just returned from Nova Bila, the knowledge about the position of about 80,000 encircled Croats would be based on assumptions and the censored information from the Political Department of the Croatian Defense Council, but in this way it was clearly said before the Croatian national audiences that the Croats would inevitably be expelled from the Lasva Valley if the conflict continued. The cooperation of the people with the army and their courage and readiness to make sacrifices are not enough to defend the century-long Croatian existence in central Bosnia. After the loose cooperation between the Bosnian Croats and the Muslims broke, the Muslims made the plan to control this area, and this plan has been being carried out for months. After the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina had occupied Travnik and Bugojno, it became clear that they wanted to encircle the enclaves in central Bosnia. The occupation of Gornji Vakuf, the ousting of the Croatian Defense Council forces from Kakanj, and taking over the control over Fojnica were the three stages in which the ring around Lasva Valley was closed in. These operations made it possible to create a very deep encirclement, which in its narrowest part is 40 km long. If it was not situated in an impassable mountainous region, which restricts the use of military equipment, first of all of armored units, the breaking up of this ring would be much easier. What is more, such a mountainous region is ideal for the organization of defense; it is easy to set ambushes and destroy the enemy's logistics. The mountains, a bad communication network, and winter conditions are factors that support the Muslim army since they require deployment of infantry forces, which is one of the Muslim advantages. Any intervention by Croatian Defense Council forces with the aim of breaking the ring around the Lasva Valley and reaching the positions of the encircled Croatian units in Vitez would require the deployment of large units that will also have to secure the corridor through which help is transported to Novi Travnik, Vitez, and Busovaca. Instead of the expected breaking out of the encirclement toward central Bosnia, the Bijeli Put convoy crew was informed about the horrible truth, which was transmitted neither by the official agency of Herceg-Bosna nor by the Croatian Television correspondents: Gornji Vakuf was occupied by Muslims, and the Croatian Defense Council units were pushed approximately one and a half kilometers toward Prozor, which means that the ring was even tightened. The 6th Corps of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina was entrusted with the defense of the southern blockade line, which could be broken out by the Croatian Defense Council units from Herzegovina, and the 3d Zenica Corps of the Bosnian Army was entrusted with the destruction of the Croatian forces in Vitez. The blockade of the Croatian Defense Council units along the inner rim of the encirclement is performed by the Bosnian Army units from local villages, whereas the striking force of the Muslim Army is composed of the 352d Mountain Brigade and the 7th Muslim Brigade from Zenica, known for its extremism and the use of Islamic religious symbols. The 17th Krajina Brigade of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina, founded in Travnik by the Muslim refugees from the Bosnian Krajina, also belongs to the striking force of the Zenica Corps. This brigade played the decisive role when Travnik was taken over by the Muslims. It is difficult to say how many Muslim soldiers are directly involved in the conflict with the Croats of the Lasva Valley, but independent sources estimate that there are approximately 15,000 Muslims soldiers there. The advantage of the Muslim forces is their considerable maneuverability and the ability to make groups along certain directions. Although Serbian media report on "extensive Muslim offensives," it can be said that the Muslim forces apply in this area the tactics of exhaustion by a long-lasting blockade, accompanied by low-intensity conflicts which might seem local the first sight, but the Croatian Defense Council gradually loses control over its territory. Since time in the present situation works for the Bosnian Army, its commanders adapt the intensity of the attacks to their needs. In this way they have the initiative all the time -- they choose the modality, the time, and the place of an attack according to the defense position of the Croatian Defense Council. Although the 3d Corps of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina attacks in all directions, the center of their attacks are two directions in the Lasva Valley. Supported by the Kruscica Mountain, which is parallel with the Lasva River Valley, they launch their attacks at the town of Vitez with the aim of creating a connection with the Muslim forces encircled in Stari Vitez, which would enable them to reach the right bank of the Lasva. Through attacks in the second direction, which extends from Zenica via Vjetranica to Dubravica, they want to cut off the Croatian area between Novi Travnik, Vitez, and Busovaca with the aim of reaching the left bank of the Lasva and merging with the southern group of the Bosnian Army units. According to published but not yet confirmed reports, the Croatian forces have been pushed back to an area not wider than 200 meters at its narrowest point. This means that the Lasva Valley has been practically cut in two. The latest Muslim breakthrough happened after the attack against the Krizanici villages, in which around 60 local Croats were either killed or are missing. The communication between Busovaca in the east and Vitez in the west is now possible only under constant sniper and mortar fire coming from the positions of the 3d Corps of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Under these unfavorable conditions, including the imbalance of forces and bad weather conditions in an unfavorable area, decisive resistance is offered by the three Vitez brigades of the Croatian Defense Council, whose commander is the famous Tihomir Blaskic. The "Stjepan Tomasevic" brigade from Novi Travnik, the brigade of the "knights," and the "Nikola Subic Zrinski" brigade lost many of their members and are inferior to the aggressor. The proportion of forces regarding the number of soldiers fell from two to one to five to one in favor of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The offensive of the forces loyal to Izetbegovic which started on 18 December even continued during the Geneva and Brussels peace talks. It stopped only on Christmas Day, but was resumed with varying intensity after the holiday. Apart from central Bosnia, there are conflicts between Croats and Muslims also north of Mostar. There are clashes there for control of Dreznica, a village and a small river of the same name. The Dreznica flows into the Neretva River some 15 km north of Mostar. Lower intensity clashes are reported also from southern positions of the 111th Zepca Brigade of the Croatian Defense Council. The inhabitants of Usor are lucky that the representatives of the War Presidency of Tesanj, which consists of both Muslims and Croats, declined to carry out the order given by the Sarajevo Headquarters of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina according to which the members of the 110th Usor Brigade of the Croatian Defense Council should have been put under the command of the 7th Operative Group of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The war alliance and human lives are temporarily preserved. The encircled 80,000 women, children, old people, some soldiers, the wounded, and the sick in central Bosnia are still exposed to attacks by the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina, although Slobodan Praljak, a movie director and the Croatian Defense Council commander for this area, was replaced by General Roso, a professional soldier, a former commander in the Foreign Legion, but this could have not changed the balance of forces. Even a much more powerful army than the Croatian Defense Council could not occupy the inaccessible mountains of central Bosnia. From the military point of view these positions are untenable in the long run. The civilians can be rescued -- by evacuation -- only if a cease-fire is reached. An open intervention by the Croatian Army with the aim of liberating the encircled people is quite a possible and practicable solution, in spite of the threats of sanctions, because almost 100,000 human lives have to be rescued!
