The U.S. government has announced a new nuclear non-proliferation policy, and vigorous international discussions are expected over the management of plutonium. We interviewed STA Atomic Energy Bureau Director Hiroto Ishida concerning the goal of Japan's plan and the likely course of future debate. Facilitate Mutual Understanding Question: Why did Japan propose its own plan for the international management of plutonium? Reply: ``As far as overall atomic energy activities are concerned, including Japan's use of plutonium, we carefully follow the security measures of the International Atomic Energy Agency, and we strive to provide the maximum amount of various kinds of information. As a result, I believe that beyond a shadow of a doubt we have created a system for the peaceful use of atomic energy, and we shall continue to do so.'' ``However, the peaceful use of plutonium has become a topic of concern with the operation problems at THORP, England's reprocessing plant, and with the start of construction on the reprocessing plant at Rokkasho Village in Aomori Prefecture. There is also the problem of dismantling Russia's nuclear arsenal. It is important that we strive to create a system to facilitate mutual understanding concerning the use of plutonium throughout the world.'' Question: How do you think the international discussion over plutonium management will proceed? Reply: ``Last year in December the IAEA invited seven nations--England, France, China, Russia, Germany, Japan, and the U.S.--to the first informal meeting on plutonium management, and a second informal meeting will be held this month. The positions of the various nations should become somewhat clearer at that time.'' ``We ourselves do not think that the STA's international management plan will be the final product. The most important thing is that Japan should take a positive approach by presenting a proposal for international review. We want to make Japan's intentions clear.'' U.S. Concerned About Surplus Question: How have various countries reacted to Japan's plan for plutonium management? Reply: ``We have not reached the stage where specific feelings are clear. Basically, there is a common understanding that it is important to strive to increase openness in the use of plutonium, but when it comes to specific policies, we can expect a variety of opinions depending on the situation each country finds itself in.'' ``For example, as we have learned in the nuclear non-proliferation policy announced by the U.S. government in September, the commercial use of plutonium will not be an option in the U.S., at least for the time being, and naturally we can expect the U.S. to take a strong position on preventing nuclear proliferation.'' ``As far as Japan is concerned, the peaceful use of atomic energy is guaranteed within the framework of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. We will pursue both nuclear non-proliferation and the peaceful use of plutonium. It is important for Japan to increase our openness as seen from the outside so that the world will recognize we are using plutonium in a peaceful manner.'' Question: We have heard that there is a good chance the U.S. will propose a plan with strong regulations for plutonium management. What do you think? Reply: ``I think that is only natural, but the U.S. has a greater interest in the problem of excess plutonium.'' Question: Some people say that Japan has presented a plutonium management plan as preparation for an excess of plutonium in the future. Supply/Demand Balance Maintained Reply: ``I suppose there are people who are saying that, but we do not think so. We will maintain the balance between plutonium supply and demand to the end. Both the suppliers and the demanders may have their plans, but things do not always go according to plan. What is really important is carefully making plutonium and carefully using it all up rather than forcing some kind of delicate balance.'' [boxed material] Perspective Alarm at Stronger U.S. Regulations Japan's peaceful use of atomic energy was made possible because of the nuclear non-proliferation system centered on the U.S. and former Soviet Union. This system is now in flux as Japan approaches the era of full-fledged use of plutonium. The reason Japan quickly put together a plutonium management plan was that the government decided it must strive to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation system on its own. Japan and the U.S. both have the same objectives in nuclear non-proliferation, but their situations are slightly different. The U.S., which has abandoned the commercial use of plutonium domestically, is leaning toward a policy that will add regulations to the use of plutonium. Japan is alarmed that those regulations will restrict her development of atomic energy. In that respect, Japan's concept for international plutonium management sends a strong message to the U.S. It will be interesting to see how Japan forms ``alliances'' with England and France, countries that also use plutonium.
