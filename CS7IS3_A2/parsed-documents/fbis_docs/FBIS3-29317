The ministry report includes the following points: 1) The survey does not conclude that the close ties between Japanese dealers and auto makers impede the signing of contracts with new agents; 2) the large gap between the prices of American cars sold at home and overseas can be attributed mainly to the large profit-margins of importers or costly advertising, but not to the influence of Japan's distribution system. There has also been criticism that the ratio between foreign-made and domestically-made cars sold by Japanese dealers is very low. In rejecting this U.S. criticism, MITI says: "There are many types of dealer engaged in selling both foreign-made and domestically-made cars. The number of Japanese dealers selling different brands of imported cars -- no matter in which country they are manufactured -- reaches 18 percent -- about the same percentage as that of U.S. dealers."
