Wang Fengchao said he would try to visit Hong Kong this year if he had the time. In his news conference given this morning to the media before a meeting with the Preliminary Work Committee Political Affairs Panel, Wang Fengchao, promoted from second department director to deputy director late last February, said that China would act according to the provisions of the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law, safeguard Hong Kong's executive sovereignty together with Hong Kong people, and properly handle preparations in various areas. After 1997, a high degree of autonomy will be allowed according to the policy of one country, two systems to lay a foundation for Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong. He continued: China's wish is cooperation with Britain in the latter period of transition and working for a stable transition and smooth political changeover according to the Basic Law. However, he pointed out, as Britain has refused to cooperate politically with China, turned its back on the relationship of cooperation with China, persisted in its course, got itself in deeper and deeper, and ruined the basis of cooperation. Without an atmosphere of cooperation, it is difficult for work in other areas not to be affected. This is something China did not want to see and the responsibility lies entirely with Britain. Regarding "setting up another kitchen," Wang Fengchao said Britain did not recognize the agreements and understandings for the transition it made with China and set up another kitchen; because of this China could only "set up another kitchen" based on the blueprints outlined by the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. On the current division of labor within the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, he said Deputy Director Wang Qiren has been transferred to the Bank of China as its president. There are now three directors. Director Lu Ping oversees general affairs; Chen Zhiying takes charge of the work of Sections 1 and 3, that is Hong Kong and Macao affairs. Wang himself is responsible for the work of Section 2 (that is Hong Kong political and social affairs) and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Research Desk. Wang said that he felt the heavy burden of responsibility after he became deputy director. Fortunately, he could see the direction clearly.
