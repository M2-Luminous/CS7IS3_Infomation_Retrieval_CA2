Approximately the same thing is happening to the Belorussian [Belarusian] economy -- it seems as though the Vyachaslaw Kebich government sees its sole task as being to make sure that the landing (which will be anything but soft) does not happen before the presidential elections. All the emergency braking systems available to the Council of Ministers have been brought into play. At a routine session of the Supreme Soviet Presidium 18 July [as published] a decree was passed under pressure from ranking government officials on the allocation of loans to the Council of Ministers. The National Bank of Belorussia [Belarus] is obliged to grant the government 50 billion rubles [R] in both May and June out of the revenue received in the first quarter. It is interesting that this revenue came to just R36.6 billion. So there is nowhere for the money to come from, except from the printing presses. But even that is not all. Commercial banks have been instructed (!) to allocate the Council of Ministers loans totaling R400 billion in May-June. Hardly anyone is likely to be taken in by the bashful formula "allocate" -- the mechanism of voluntary coercion was elaborated back in the years of developed socialism and still functions well to this day. Stanislaw Bahdankevich, chairman of the National Bank, announced at a press conference that the money supply in the Republic had increased 28-fold since January last year. It is not hard to guess that the Belorussian Government's next economic crisis will lead to a fall in the Belorussian ruble's exchange rate. Why is the government taking this action and where will the money go? The widely publicized agreement on monetary system unification is still not having any results. And nor could it -- that has long been clear to economists. But, as Stanislaw Bahdankevich noted, "not all of us in the government are familiar with economics." On the eve of the elections, the prime minister's team, which has staked a great deal on unification, would like to have at least some positive effect to show the voters. The removal of customs duties as of 1 May has not led to any reduction in prices. The hundreds of billions -- some freshly printed, others virtually confiscated from commercial banks -- will be used to pay workers at budget-funded institutions. Under no circumstances does the government want to leave voters without any money on the eve of the elections. And although this golden rain may be expensive, it will make it possible for the prime minister to become president.
