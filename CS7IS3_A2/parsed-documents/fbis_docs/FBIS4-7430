During the interview, Mr. A admitted he had appeared as an armed policeman in the program, had been investigated by the authorities after the program was aired for disclosing state secrets, and had subsequently fled to South America. He also revealed that his mother, who is a public security cadre, was the one who actually borrowed the video footage; she and a number of others who helped in filming the Asahi program were later arrested. He also admitted that this affair has had serious consequences. Mr. A acted as coordinator (interpreter and guide) who sub-subcontracted for Asahi's subcontractor production which conducted location shooting in Fuzhou in Fujian Province, China. Mr. A's interview was conducted for approximately one hour with Tadao Kasahara, president of "Damu" [name as published], the production which produced the news program in question. On 2 April, TV Asahi used up all its air time for "The Scoop" to look into the above program in question. It admitted the special program had been fabricated. However, the interview with Mr. A was the first time Asahi admitted fabrication after trouble occurred in China over how the video footage was obtained. TV Asahi will now have to deal with the consequences.
