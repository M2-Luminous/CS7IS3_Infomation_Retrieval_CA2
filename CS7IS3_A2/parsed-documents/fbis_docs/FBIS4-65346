The question of who should succeed GATT Director General Sutherland also remains open. Since the signing of the GATT agreement on 15 April, the outcome of the Marrakesh talks was officially discussed by the Council of the UN Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD]. Differences of opinions also surfaced at the first meeting of the Preparatory Committee [Prepcom] of the planned World Trade Organization [WTO]. However, the UNCTAD Council adhered more or less to what the ministers had said in Marrakesh. The final result was once again lauded as "historic." The WTO-Prepcom dealt mainly with procedural matters such as the appointment of chairmen of subcommittees. Further chairmen are due to be appointed over the next six weeks, so that the formation of the WTO may begin at all levels afterward. Thorny issues such as Director General Sutherland's plans to resign; whether WTO headquarters should be in Geneva or Bonn; the chances of ratifying the Marrakesh results, especially by the Americans; and the WTO's spheres of activity; were discussed in a more intimate circle because of their controversy. Peter Sutherland, the "savior of the Uruguay round of talks," has confirmed during informal consultations that he does not intend to be chairman of the WTO. But neither has he given the required six months' notice to quit the GATT chairmanship. Therefore one assumes he will stay on until GATT changes into the WTO which, according to the current schedule, should occur on 1 January 1995. He says that his decision is dictated by "personal motives." Not everyone believes this. Needless to say, there is now a debate on the subject of Sutherland's successor. The developing countries, which will now form the GATT majority, want to have the GATT chairmanship, and the Latin American countries, which were in the lead already after the demise of Sutherland's predecessor, the Swiss Arthur Dunkel, also seem to have good chances of getting it. Regardless of this, Sutherland also has the power to hold negotiations on the new GATT chairmanship. Participants in these negotiations would include Andras Szepesi, Hungarian chairman of the GATT member countries committee, and the chairmen of the WTO-Prepcom subcommittees. Most GATT officials and employees in the diplomatic missions of the 125 GATT member countries take a gloomy view of Bonn becoming WTO headquarters. They would not like to leave their comfortable surroundings on Lake Geneva. But the official reason why Bonn should not be WTO headquarters is that the WTO would be cut off from its related organizations in Geneva, with whom it must remain in close touch when discussing certain matters, such as the GATT-WTO conversion. For example, UNCTAD has been charged with examining and explaining the economic effects of the Marrakesh agreement. In Bonn, such a concentration of tasks would not be possible because there are no other world trade organizations there. Last week, the Federal Government made a sudden offer to GATT and suggested Bonn for WTO headquarters. A decision will probably be reached in Geneva in the coming weeks. The Swiss offer that is currently being discussed between the Swiss authorities and GATT Director General Sutherland also has to be considered. [passage omitted]
