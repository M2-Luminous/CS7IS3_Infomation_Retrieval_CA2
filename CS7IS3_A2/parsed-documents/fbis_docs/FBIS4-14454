He addressed those present at the round-table discussions in Moscow in which U.S. businessmen also took part. Dubinin said that financial stabilization is becoming a reality. Inflation rates are reducing and by the end of the year, he believes, inflation will not exceed 5-7% a month. We are entering a new stage of economic development, he said. Deals in rubles are becoming more profitable. This makes it possible to stabilize the currency rate though we do not face the task of making the currency rate fixed, he said. Dubinin said Russian reforms are aimed at achieving financial stabilization and the overcoming of inflation. Shock therapy did not work, said Dubinin. The key to success in the anti-inflation policy is in the draft budget, he said. In line with the draft budget, the deficit for 1994 will not exceed 10% of GNP and only 50%, he said, will be covered by Central Bank emission, while the other 50% will be covered by government bonds and the attraction of foreign loans. Russia will not agree to accept loans with high interest, he said. Dubinin also said that the talks will continue with the Paris and London clubs of creditor countries on restructuring Russia's external debt. Dubinin called on representatives of U.S. industrial circles to cooperate to raise money from the United States which could be used for investments into the Russian economy.
