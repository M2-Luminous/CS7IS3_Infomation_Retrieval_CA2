FR941206-0-00153 FR941206-0-00019 A second example is the recently proposed NESHAP for off-site waste and recovery operations (59 FR 51913, October 13, 1994). This NESHAP would apply to owners and operators of facilities, with certain exceptions, that manage wastes or recoverable materials which have been generated off-site at another facility and contain specific organic HAP. The rule would apply to operations managing solid wastes as defined under RCRA (hazardous and nonhazardous wastes) as well as operations handling recovered materials excluded from the RCRA definition of solid waste (e.g., recycled materials containing organic HAP, used oil reprocessed for sale as a fuel). As a result, certain off-site waste and recovery operations with organic HAP emissions, but exempted from regulation under the RCRA air standards, would be required to use air emission controls under this NESHAP. In contrast to the NESHAP now being developed under CAA section 112, the EPA has already achieved progress toward full implementation of RCRA section 3004(n), which requires a ``cradle to grave'' approach to hazardous waste management that addresses protection of air, water, and groundwater. Air standards have been promulgated for TSDF treatment process vents (subpart AA in 40 CFR parts 264 and 265) and for TSDF process equipment leaks (subpart BB in 40 CFR parts 264 and 265) in addition to the development of these air standards for TSDF tanks, surface impoundments, and containers. There is no benefit to delaying implementation of air standards for TSDF tanks, containers, and surface impoundments to a future rulemaking under amended CAA section 112 when the EPA can proceed now with the promulgation of effective air standards under RCRA section 3004(n) for these air emission sources. The RCRA air standards adopted today do comply with RCRA section 1006(b). This section requires that the air standards be consistent with and not duplicative of CAA standards. Although RCRA section 1006(b) requires some accommodation with existing regulatory standards, it ``does not permit the substantive standards of RCRA to be compromised.'' Chemical Waste Management v. EPA , 976 F.2d at 23 (D.C. Cir. 1992). It is obviously reasonable for the EPA to view the RCRA section 3004(n) mandate as a standard which cannot (or at least need not) be compromised. Similarly, the CAA Amendments of 1990 require that air standards developed under the CAA be consistent with RCRA rules. To conform with the dual RCRA and CAA requirements that standards be consistent, the air standards developed under RCRA section 3004(n) do not duplicate or contradict existing NESHAP or NSPS. The EPA is fully aware that at many facilities where hazardous wastes are managed, the RCRA air standards under 40 CFR part 264 and 265 as well as NESHAP and NSPS for specific source categories may be applicable to a particular TSDF. Certain testing, monitoring, inspection, recordkeeping, and other requirements under the RCRA air standards may be similar to or duplicative of requirements under the applicable NESHAP or NSPS. In many cases at a TSDF, individual waste operations will be subject to either the air emission control requirements under the RCRA air standards or the air emission control requirements under the applicable NESHAP or NSPS. Thus, it is necessary to include testing, monitoring, inspection, recordkeeping, and other implementation requirements in each rule to assure compliance with and enforcement of the rule. However, in certain situations, some individual waste operations at a TSDF could be subject to air emission control requirements under both the RCRA air standards as well as a NESHAP or NSPS. In such cases, the EPA believes it is unnecessary for owners and operators of these waste management units to conduct duplicative waste testing, keep duplicate sets of records, or perform other duplicative actions to demonstrate compliance with both sets of rules. Therefore, to be consistent with RCRA section 1006(b) to the maximum extent practicable, the EPA is coordinating the testing, recordkeeping, reporting, and other implementation activities required under the RCRA air standards and related rules developed under the CAA. The EPA has requested public comment in a related proposed NESHAP rulemkaing (the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP, see 59 FR 51919, October 13, 1994) on how the applicable requirements included in the RCRA air standards should be incorporated into CAA rules being developed by the EPA for waste and recovery operations that will allow owners and operators subject to both sets of rules to demonstrate compliance with all applicable rules without having to repeat the duplicative requirements.
