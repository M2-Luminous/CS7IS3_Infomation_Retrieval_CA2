FR940804-0-00071 FR940804-0-00022 Three examples illustrate how this definition applies. One, if EPA finds that a State fails to submit a PM&hyph;10 plan for a moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area pursuant to section 189(a) and the State does not correct the deficiency within 18 months, then, pursuant to this rule, the offset sanction shall apply in the PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area whose boundaries are described in 40 CFR part 81. If 6 months later the deficiency remains uncorrected, then the highway sanction applies in the nonattainment area as well. In both cases the sanction applies only in the nonattainment area because that is the geographic area covered by the Act requirement. Two, if EPA finds a State fails to submit a required SIP revision under the Act for a requirement that applies to only a portion of an area, then the sanctions apply to the portion of the area subject to the requirement and not the whole area. For example, the enhanced inspection and maintenance plan requirement for serious, severe, and extreme nonattainment areas applies only to ``each urbanized area (in the nonattainment area) as defined by the Bureau of the Census, with a 1980 population of 200,000 or more'' (see section 182(c)(3)(A)). Section 184 provides that for all areas within the NOTR, this requirement will apply to urbanized areas with a population in excess of 100,000. Therefore, this requirement could apply to a smaller area within a designated nonattainment, attainment or unclassified area. If the State fails to adopt the program for such an area, the section 179 sanctions would apply only to that smaller area. Finally, if EPA finds that a State within the NOTR fails to submit a reasonably available control technology SIP for VOC required pursuant to section 184(b)(1)(B) with respect to all the sources in the State subject to this requirement, and the State does not correct the deficiency within 18 months, then, pursuant to this rule, the offset sanction would apply in the entire State. If 6 months later the deficiency remained uncorrected, then the highway sanction would apply to all of the nonattainment areas in the State. If there were no designated nonattainment areas within the State, the highway sanction would not apply in that State. The remaining definitions remain substantively unchanged from those in the proposed rule. 3. Section 52.31(c)_Applicability Section 52.31(c) establishes the applicability of the final rule. The portions of ยง52.31(c) setting forth the findings that trigger the sanctions clock remain unchanged as these portions were taken directly from sections 179(a) (1)&hyph;(4). Generally, these findings are that a State has failed to submit a required SIP or SIP element, has submitted a SIP or SIP element that does not meet EPA's completeness criteria, has submitted a SIP that is not approvable, or that the State is failing to implement an approved SIP. The portions of ยง52.31(c) indicating the SIP requirements to which this rule applies have been modified. The proposal indicated the rule covers any part D SIP or SIP revision required under the Act, or any part D SIP or SIP revision required in response to a finding of substantial inadequacy under section 110(k)(5). This section of the final rule has been modified to cover only part D SIP and SIP revisions and not calls for part D SIP's or SIP revisions under section 110(k)(5). The final rule does not cover part D SIP calls because of concerns about applying sanctions for State failures to respond to such SIP calls following EPA nonsubmittal findings without opportunity for notice and comment. SIP calls are currently not subject to notice-and-comment. The public and affected sources must be given notice and opportunity to comment before SIP calls can have binding effect as a result of a section 179(a) finding that a State has failed to submit a SIP in response to a SIP call. Thus, if this rule were to apply to State failures to respond to SIP calls, mandatory sanctions could apply without an opportunity for such comment before new obligations become binding against affected sources. This would be inconsistent with the APA requirements of section 553. Therefore, as discussed in section II.C.3., the final rule does not cover part D SIP calls. The EPA will develop another approach to address SIP calls, providing an opportunity for notice and comment before mandatory sanctions apply for a State failure to respond to a SIP call. 4. Section 52.31(d)_Sanction Application Sequencing Section 52.31(d)(1) is the heart of this rule in that it establishes the order in which the automatic sanctions under section 179(a) shall apply. Several clarifications have been made to the section. One, this provision now requires affirmative EPA action to stop sanction clocks and lift sanctions following section 179(a) findings, including nonsubmittal and incompleteness findings. The EPA's proposed and final sanction clock policy provides that, following findings of nonsubmittal and incompleteness, sanction clocks are permanently stopped (and any sanctions applied are permanently lifted) when EPA finds the plan complete. Section 110(k)(1)(B) provides that a submittal is deemed complete if a completeness finding is not made by EPA within 6 months of EPA's receipt of the plan. Under this clarification to ยง52.31(d), a SIP becoming complete by operation of law will not be sufficient to stop sanction clocks or for an area to avoid sanctions. The EPA will need to affirmatively determine that the SIP is complete in order for the sanction clock to stop and any sanctions to be lifted. This policy clarification will henceforth govern what is required to stop sanctions clocks and lift sanctions following findings of nonsubmittal and incompleteness, and the other section 179 findings. Prior to this policy clarification, in certain cases EPA did stop sanction clocks started by EPA findings of failure to submit or incompleteness by SIP submittals being deemed complete ``by operation of law.'' The EPA believes that this approach was consistent with EPA guidance at the time and that it is appropriate to grandfather these areas under EPA's grandfathering guidance.
