ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: In this action, EPA approves the State implementation plan (SIP) submitted by the State of Montana to achieve attainment of the National ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM 10 ). The SIP was submitted by Montana to satisfy certain Federal requirements for an approvable moderate nonattainment area PM 10 SIP for Columbia Falls. The State has committed to complete several actions for this SIP, including issues regarding its New Source Review and Prevention of Significant Deterioration regulations, test methods, emergency episode plan, operating permit program, and contingency measures. EPA will take separate action, as appropriate, on these rules when the State fulfills its related commitments. EFFECTIVE DATE: This final rule will become effective on May 16, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of the State's submittal and other information are available for inspection during normal business hours at the following locations: Environmental Protection Agency, Region VIII, Air Programs Branch, 999 18th Street, suite 500, Denver, Colorado 80202&hyph;2405; Montana Department of Health and Environmental Sciences, Air Quality Bureau, Cogswell Building, Helena, Montana 59620&hyph;0901; and USEPA Air & Radiation Docket Information Center, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Meredith Bond, Environmental Protection Agency, Region VIII, (303) 293&hyph;1764. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background The Columbia Falls, Montana area was designated nonattainment for PM 10 and classified as moderate under sections 107(d)(4)(B) and 188(a) of the Clean Air Act, upon enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. 1 See 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991); 40 CFR 81.327 (Flathead County; Columbia Falls and vicinity). The air quality planning requirements for moderate PM 10 nonattainment areas are set out in subparts 1 and 4 of part D, title I of the Act. 1 The 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act made significant changes to the air quality planning requirements for areas that do not meet (or that significantly contribute to ambient air quality in a nearby area that does not meet) the PM 10 National Ambient Air Quality Standards (see Public Law No. 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399). References herein are to the Clean Air Act, as amended (``the Act''), 42 U.S.C. 7401, et seq. The EPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing EPA's preliminary views on how EPA intends to review SIPs and SIP revisions submitted under title I of the Act, including those State submittals containing moderate PM 10 nonattainment area SIP requirements (see generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992)). Because EPA is describing its interpretations here only in broad terms, the reader should refer to the General Preamble for a more detailed discussion of the interpretations of title I advanced in this final action and the supporting rationale. Those States containing initial moderate PM 10 nonattainment areas were required to submit, among other things, the following provisions by November 15, 1991: 1. Provisions to assure that reasonably available control measures (RACM) (including such reductions in emissions from existing sources in the area as may be obtained through the adoption, at a minimum, of reasonably available control technology (RACT)) shall be implemented no later than December 10, 1993; 2. Either a demonstration (including air quality modelling) that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously as practicable but no later than December 31, 1994, or a demonstration that attainment by that date is impracticable; 3. Quantitative milestones which are to be achieved every 3 years and which demonstrate reasonable further progress (RFP) toward attainment by December 31, 1994; and 4. Provisions to assure that the control requirements applicable to major stationary sources of PM 10 also apply to major stationary sources of PM 10 precursors except where the Administrator determines that such sources do not contribute significantly to PM 10 levels which exceed the NAAQS in the area. See sections 172(c), 188, and 189 of the Act. Some provisions are due at a later date. States with initial moderate PM 10 nonattainment areas were required to submit a permit program for the construction and operation of new and modified major stationary sources of PM 10 by June 30, 1992 (see section 189(a)). Such States also were required to submit contingency measures by November 15, 1993 that become effective without further action by the State or EPA, upon a determination by EPA that the area has failed to achieve RFP or to attain the PM 10 NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline. See section 172(c)(9) and 57 FR 13543&hyph;13544. On January 27, 1994, EPA announced its proposed approval of the Columbia Falls, Montana moderate nonattainment area PM 10 SIP as meeting those moderate PM 10 SIP requirements due on November 15, 1991 (59 FR 3804&hyph;3808). In that proposed rulemaking action and related Technical Support Document (TSD), EPA described in detail its interpretations of title I and its rationale for proposing to approve the Columbia Falls moderate nonattainment area PM 10 SIP taking into consideration the specific factual issues presented. EPA requested public comments on all aspects of the proposal (please reference 59 FR 3808), and no comments were received during the comment period, which ended on February 28, 1994. This final action on the Columbia Falls moderate nonattainment area PM 10 SIP is unchanged from the January 27, 1994 proposed approval action. The discussion herein provides only a broad overview of the proposed action EPA is now finalizing. The public is referred to the January 27, 1994 proposed rule for a more in depth discussion of the action now being finalized. II. Response to Comments EPA did not receive any public comments regarding its January 27, 1994 proposed approval of the Columbia Falls moderate nonattainment area PM 10 SIP (59 FR 3804&hyph;3808). This Action Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565&hyph;13566). The Columbia Falls SIP consists of two submittals. The first contains the Flathead County Air Pollution Control Program and Air Pollution Plan regulations. Flathead County contains two PM 10 nonattainment areas for which SIPs were due in November 1991: Columbia Falls and Kalispell. The Flathead County regulations apply to both areas and were submitted with the attainment demonstration for Kalispell on November 25, 1991, after being approved by the Montana Board of Health and Environmental Sciences (MBHES) on November 15, 1991. The Columbia Falls SIP and attainment demonstration were not submitted at that time since a permit necessary to the control strategy for the SIP was not finalized. The MBHES issued that permit and approved the SIP on January 24, 1992. This second submittal to EPA was made by the Governor on May 6, 1992. Final technical corrections to the SIP were received by EPA on June 15, 1993. The submittals were intended to satisfy those moderate PM 10 SIP requirements due for Columbia Falls on November 15, 1991. As described in EPA's proposed action on this SIP (59 FR 3804&hyph;3808, January 27, 1994), the Columbia Falls moderate nonattainment area PM 10 plan includes, among other things, a comprehensive and accurate emissions inventory, control measures that satisfy the RACM requirement, a demonstration (including air quality modelling) that attainment of the PM 10 NAAQS will be achieved by January 1, 1995 2 , provisions for meeting the November 15, 1994 quantitative milestone and reasonable further progress, and enforceability documentation. Further, EPA proposed to determine that major sources of precursors of PM 10 do not contribute significantly to PM 10 levels in excess of the NAAQS in Columbia Falls 3 Please refer to EPA's notice of proposed rulemaking (59 FR 3805) and the TSD for that action for a more detailed discussion of these elements of the Columbia Falls plan. 2 The Clean Air Act calls for attainment by December 31, 1994. Section 188(c)(1). EPA interprets the State's demonstration as providing for attainment of the PM 10 NAAQS by January 1, 1995. EPA is approving the State's demonstration on the basis of the de minimis differential between the two dates. 3 The consequences of this finding are to exclude these sources from the applicability of PM 10 nonattainment area control requirements. Note that EPA's finding is based on the current character of the area including for example, the existing mix of sources in the area. It is possible, therefore, that future growth could change the significance of precursors in the area. In this final rule, EPA is announcing its approval of those elements of the Columbia Falls moderate nonattainment area PM 10 SIP that were due on November 15, 1991, and submitted by the Governor on November 25, 1991 and May 6, 1992, with technical corrections submitted in a letter dated June 15, 1993. Specifically, EPA is approving the Flathead County rules (with the exception of rules 501 through 506 which are specific to the city of Kalispell&hyph;EPA will take separate action on the Kalispell PM 10 nonattainment area control plan) and the Columbia Falls PM 10 nonattainment area control plan. EPA finds that the State of Montana's PM 10 SIP for the Columbia Falls moderate nonattainment area meets the Reasonably Available Control Measures (RACM), including Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT), requirement. Five sources/source categories were identified as contributing to the PM 10 nonattainment problem in Columbia Falls and, therefore, were targeted for control in the SIP. The State has demonstrated that by applying control measures to area sources (re-entrained road dust, residential wood combustion, prescribed burning, and motor vehicle exhaust), as well as reducing allowable emissions through air quality permit modifications for the Plum Creek sawmill and fiberboard plant, Columbia Falls will be in attainment by January 1, 1995 (see footnote # 2) and it does not appear that applying further control measures to these sources would expedite attainment. EPA views the following measures as reasonable, enforceable, and responsible for significant PM 10 emissions reductions in Columbia Falls: (1) Flathead County Rules No. 601&hyph;606, which provide re-entrained road dust controls, including sanding and chip sealing standards and street sweeping and flushing requirements; (2) Flathead County Rules No. 201&hyph;209, which regulate prescribed burning; (3) Flathead County Air Pollution Control Program, Chapter VIII, Sub-chapter 3, which contains a voluntary solid fuel burning device curtailment program, and Sub-chapter 4, which lists materials prohibited from burning in wood or coal residential stoves; (4) industry permit modifications made at Plum Creek to reduce allowable plant-wide emissions; and (5) the Federal tailpipe standards, which provide an ongoing benefit due to fleet turnover. The RACM (including RACT) provisions in the SIP are described further in the technical support document associated with EPA's January 27, 1994 notice of proposed rulemaking on this SIP. Further, although no credit was claimed in the SIP, EPA notes that the State has adopted, as part of the Columbia Falls SIP, the Montana Smoke Management Plan, which sets standards for the regulation of prescribed burning. EPA approved this plan in a separate rulemaking action. (59 FR 2988, January 20, 1994). A more detailed discussion of the individual source contributions, their associated control measures (including available control technology) and an explanation of why certain available control measures were not implemented, can be found in the TSD accompanying EPA's proposed approval of the Columbia Falls moderate PM 10 nonattainment area SIP (59 FR 3804). EPA has reviewed the State's documentation and concluded that it adequately justifies the control measures to be implemented. The implementation of Montana's PM 10 nonattainment plan for Columbia Falls will result in the attainment of the PM 10 NAAQS by January 1, 1995 (see footnote # 2). By this action EPA is approving the Columbia Falls PM 10 plan's control measures as satisfying the RACM, including RACT, requirement. As noted, EPA did not propose to approve some aspects of the Columbia Falls SIP, as explained in the notice of proposed rulemaking (59 FR 3804&hyph;3808) and associated TSD. To address deficiencies identified by EPA, the State adopted commitments after public hearings on November 15, 1991 and January 24, 1992, and submitted the commitments to EPA with the Governor's May 6, 1992 letter, as additional tasks to be completed to correct the deficiencies in the Columbia Falls and statewide SIP. The State has fulfilled commitments related to SIP requirements due November 15, 1991 for the Columbia Falls nonattainment area. Those items related to deficiencies in the statewide SIP will be addressed in a separate action. EPA has determined that the Columbia Falls SIP can be fully approved without the State fulfilling the remaining commitments. Therefore, EPA is tracking the State's efforts to meet these commitments, but approval of the SIP for the Columbia Falls nonattainment area is not contingent upon the State meeting them by the specified dates. Therefore, EPA will take separate action, as appropriate, when the remaining commitments are fulfilled by the State. A more detailed discussion of the State's commitments can be found in EPA's January 27, 1994 proposed approval of the Columbia Falls moderate nonattainment area PM 10 SIP (59 FR 3804&hyph;3808) and the TSD for that action. The State has made a separate commitment to testing and further dispersion modeling of emissions from the Columbia Falls Aluminum Company (CFAC) facility. This facility is located outside the nonattainment area and emissions from CFAC were not identified on the Chemical Mass Balance analysis of filters collected from the monitor in the Columbia Falls nonattainment area. Emissions from CFAC are a potential concern, however, since this source accounts for 20 percent of the emission inventory (at permitted allowable emissions). EPA will continue to monitor the testing and assist the State with any action required by the results. Final Action This document announces EPA's final action on the rulemaking proposed at 59 FR 3804. As noted elsewhere in this action, EPA received no adverse public comments on the proposed action. As a direct result, the Regional Administrator has reclassified this action from Table 2 to Table 3 under the processing procedures established at 54 FR 2214, January 19, 1989. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for a revision to any SIP. Each request for a revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors, and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Regulatory Process Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600, et seq. , EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the Clean Air Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Clean Air Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. Union Electric Co. v. U.S. E.P.A. , 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2). Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by June 13, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be file, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements (See section 307(b)(2)). Executive Order (EO) 12866 This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for two years. EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.
