FR940202-1-00003 FR940202-1-00002 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;08&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Industrie Model A320 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Airbus Industrie Model A320 series airplanes, that currently requires modification of the belly fairing structure. This action would revise the compliance time for accomplishment of the modification. All other parts of the rule would remain unchanged. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to ensure that the structural integrity of the belly fairing structure is maintained. DATES: Comments must be received by March 21, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;08&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Comments may be inspected at this location between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. The service information referenced in the proposed rule may be obtained from Airbus Industrie, 1 Rond Point Maurice Bellonte, 31707 Blagnac Cedex, France. This information may be examined at the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Comments Invited Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of the proposed rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments, specified above, will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposals contained in this notice may be changed in light of the comments received. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the proposed rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report summarizing each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;08&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;08&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Discussion On December 6, 1993, the FAA issued AD 93&hyph;24&hyph;11, Amendment 39&hyph;8760 (58 FR 64875, December 10, 1993), applicable to certain Airbus Industrie Model A320 series airplanes, to require modification of the belly fairing structure. That action was prompted by results of fatigue testing, which revealed that rivet heads were sheared off and fatigue cracks were present in the angles at the angle attachment between the keelbeam and the belly fairing support frames. The requirements of that AD are intended to prevent reduced structural integrity of the belly fairing structure. Since the issuance of that AD, the FAA has become aware that the compliance time specified in paragraph (a) of AD 93&hyph;24&hyph;11 for accomplishment of the modification could allow certain operators to accomplish the modification at a time considerably later than that intended. Paragraph (a) of that AD currently requires that the modification be accomplished prior to the accumulation of 12,000 total landings after January 10, 1994 (the effective date of AD 93&hyph;24&hyph;11, Amendment 39&hyph;8760), or within 300 days after that date, whichever occurs later. However, the FAA's intent is that the modification be accomplished prior to the accumulation of 12,000 total landings on the airplane, or within 300 days after the effective date of the AD, whichever occurs later. The FAA has determined that AD 93&hyph;24&hyph;11 must be superseded to revise the compliance time in order to ensure that the structural integrity of the belly fairing structure is maintained in a timely manner. All other parts of the rule would remain as published originally. This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of ยง21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. The FAA has determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated in the United States. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would supersede AD 93&hyph;24&hyph;11 to continue to require modification of the belly fairing structure. This proposed AD would revise the compliance time to require accomplishment of that modification prior to the accumulation of 12,000 total landings on the airplane, or within 300 days after January 10, 1994, whichever occurs later. The actions would continue to be required to be accomplished in accordance with Airbus Industrie Service Bulletin A320&hyph;53&hyph;1014, dated June 25, 1992, or Revision 1, dated May 26, 1993. The FAA estimates that 20 airplanes of U.S. registry were affected by AD 93&hyph;24&hyph;11, and would continue to be affected by this proposed supersedure of that AD. It takes approximately 288 work hours per airplane to accomplish the actions currently required by AD 93&hyph;24&hyph;11, and the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts cost approximately $1,045 per airplane. Based on these figures, the current cost impact of AD 93&hyph;24&hyph;11 on U.S. operators is estimated to be $337,700, or $16,885 per airplane. The total cost figure indicated above is presented as if no operator has yet accomplished the requirements of AD 93&hyph;24&hyph;11 (or this proposed supersedure of that AD). There are no foreseeable additional costs that would be imposed by this proposed supersedure of AD 93&hyph;24&hyph;11. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
