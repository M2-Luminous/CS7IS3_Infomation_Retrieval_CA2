FR940617-2-00114 FR940617-2-00071 Final Minimum Percentages for ``High Rate'' and ``Significant Increase in the Rate'' for Implementation of the General Statutory Funding Preference, Final Funding Priority and Special Consideration for Grants for Predoctoral Training in Family Medicine The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) announces the final minimum percentages for ``high rate'' and ``significant increase in the rate'' for implementation of the General Statutory Funding Preference and final funding priority and special consideration for fiscal year (FY) 1994 for Grants for Predoctoral Training in Family Medicine authorized under the authority of section 747(a), title VII of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, as amended by the Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;408, dated October 13, 1992. Purpose Section 747(a) of the Public Health Service Act authorizes the award of grants to assist in meeting the cost of planning, developing and operating or participating in approved predoctoral training programs in the field of family medicine. Grants may include support for the program only or support for both the program and the trainees. General Statutory Funding Preference As provided in section 791(a) of the PHS Act, preference will be given to any qualified applicant that_ (A) has a high rate for placing graduates in practice settings having the principal focus of serving residents of medically underserved communities; or (B) during the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for which an award is sought, has achieved a significant increase in the rate of placing graduates in such settings. This preference will only be applied to applications that rank above the 20th percentile of applications that have been recommended for approval by the peer review group. A proposed notice was published in the Federal Register on October 5, 1993 at 58 FR 51836 for public comment. No comments were received during the 30-day comment period. Therefore, the final minimum percentages for ``high rate'' and ``significant increase in the rate'', final funding priority and special consideration for this program will be retained as follows: Final Minimum Percentages for ``High Rate'' and ``Significant Increase in the Rate'' for Implementation of the General Statutory Funding Preference ``High rate'' is defined as a minimum of 20 percent of graduates of the medical school in academic year 1988&hyph;89 or 1989&hyph;90. ``Significant increase in the rate'' means that the rate of placing academic year 1989&hyph;90 graduates in the specified settings is at least 50 percent higher than the rate of placing academic year 1988&hyph;89 graduates in such settings and that not less than 15 percent of academic year 1989&hyph;90 graduates are working in these areas. Academic years 1988&hyph;89 and 1989&hyph;90 are used because they are the two most recent years that medical school graduates would have entered practice following the completion of residency training. Final Funding Priority In addition, a funding priority will be given to applicants based on their level of accomplishment in relation to the outcome or process measures cited below: ␣ 1Outcome measures 1Points 1Process measures _25% of students who graduated in 1991, 1992 and 1993 entered family practice residencies 100 _20% of students who graduated in 1991, 1992 and 1993 entered family practice residencies 75 _15% of students who graduated in 1991, 1992 and 1993 entered family practice residencies 50 _Required 3rd year Family Medicine clerkship* (of at least 4 weeks). _12% of students who graduated in 1991, 1992 and 1993 entered family practice residencies 35 _Required primary care preceptorship/mentorship program* in preclinical years. ␣ 20 _Full departmental status at time of application. *Curricular elements must be in place at the time of application or the applicant must provide satisfactory evidence (including commitments from institutional officials) that the clerkship or preceptorship will be operational by the beginning of the third year of the grant.
