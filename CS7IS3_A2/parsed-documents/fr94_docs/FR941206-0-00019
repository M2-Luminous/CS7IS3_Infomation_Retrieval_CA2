FR941206-0-00019 FR941206-0-00001 (b) To verify the calcium content in meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems, a compliance program consisting of the following parameters shall be followed by manufacturers of meat defined in §301.2(rr)(2) of this subchapter. (1) An analysis of a sample of at least 1 pound from each lot shall be performed by the operator of the establishment or his or her agent. For purposes of this paragraph, a lot shall consist of the meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems, designated as such by the operator of the establishment or his or her agent, from the product produced from a single species of livestock in no more than one continuous shift of up to 12 hours. Individual results from the chemical analyses shall be compared to the calcium limit, prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section, in order to demonstrate compliance. If compliance is not demonstrated, that is, if any single analytical result is more than 0.18 percent, 1 2 before product from a production lot that is still at the establishment or one that is subsequently produced can be considered to be in compliance, at least three samples from that production lot shall be taken and analyzed for calcium, either separately, or, at the option of the establishment, as a composite (i.e., combining the three samples for analysis). The average of the results or the composite result must be less than or equal to 0.15 percent. Taking three samples from each subsequently produced lot and analyzing them in order to demonstrate compliance shall continue until five consecutive lots have mean or composite results less than or equal to 0.15 percent. If the statistical evidence indicates that a production lot is not in compliance with the calcium limit, as prescribed in §301.2(rr)(2) of this subchapter, the lot must be labeled as MS(S) and meet all of the requirements for MS(S) in §319.5 of this subchapter. 1 The value 0.18 percent was derived by multiplying by 3 the expected analytical standard deviation obtained by FSIS laboratories on the approved chemical procedure for measuring calcium which uses Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as provided in the ``Official Methods of Analysis of the AOAC International'' (formerly the Association of Official Analytical Chemists), 15th Ed. (1990). 2 Individual or an average of results shall be rounded to the nearest 0.01 percent calcium. (2) The management of the establishment must maintain records to support the validity of the calcium content (as a measure of bone solids) to assure the process is in control. Such records shall be made available to the inspector or any other duly authorized representative of the Agency upon request. (Recordkeeping requirements were approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 0583&hyph;0095.) PART 320_RECORDS, REGISTRATION, AND REPORTS 5.
