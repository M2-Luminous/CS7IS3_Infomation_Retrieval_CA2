Israeli military planes overflew al-Nabatiyah, Iqlim al-Tuffah, and Sidon for 15 minutes, carrying out low-altitude mock raids. According to our correspondent, Israeli occupation forces surrounded Rumaysh, near Bint Jubayl, this morning. The reason for the move was that 15 village youths refused to enlist in Lahd's [South Lebanese Army -- SLA] militia. Norwegian soldiers of the UN Interim Force in Lebanon, stationed in al-'Urqub, tried to prevent an Israeli Lahdist force from entering Shab'a, but the latter succeeded in entering the village following one hour of negotiations. REUTER cites a security source in the south to the effect that Lahd militiamen deployed this morning on main roads leading to villages in the western sector of the occupied border strip in order to impress men aged 16 to 35 for military training with the said militia. The militia threatened to take measures against the families of those who fail to undergo training. The source adds that the militias have set up roadblocks on the main roads and intend to search houses for men in the said age group.
