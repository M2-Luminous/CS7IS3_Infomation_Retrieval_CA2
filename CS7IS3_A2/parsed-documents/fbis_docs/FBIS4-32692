On the Friday before the elections, you said: "We will not lose these elections." How does the party evaluate the results today? [Kwasniewski] We are satisfied. Our forecasts proved correct and so did my statement that we will not lose these elections. One can even say that we won them. I am also talking about Warsaw, which really makes me happy, and about the very good result in Krakow. We are the grouping that has major structures and support in large and medium-sized towns and cities; we are also present in the countryside. Thus, we are unique, in a way. [Rosolak] You also suggested that the elections would confirm the political trends shaped in September... [Kwasniewski] And they did confirm them. The main groupings are the SLD and, in the countryside, the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] and the Union of Freedom [UW]. The right wing, which has drawn conclusions from the September elections and united, is another force in this configuration. The SLD has reasons to consider these results satisfactory. Still, the low turnout is undoubtedly sad. This means that the ideas of self-government and the civic society still remain more in the sphere of slogans than reality. [Rosolak] The SLD has obtained influence in towns. However, does this mean that it will also share power? [Kwasniewski] These are two different things. In the previous term of office, we had approximately 800 members of municipal councils; today we think there will be 10 times as many. Thus, our position in municipal and gmina [smallest administrative units] councils is certainly increasing. This is our first try at self-government because so far we have been present first and foremost in the parliament. This is going to be a great test for my colleagues. In such towns as Sosnowiec, Wloclawek, Czeladz, and Stargard Szczecinski, we are obliged to take over all of the issues. In other places, we will hold talks on coalitions. We are open to all kinds of configurations; however, I will now be quite frank and say that we will neither throw ourselves about or fall into despair if it turns out that we are merely a strong opposition. I even believe that the role of a homogeneous, constructive opposition might turn out to be important and useful for our members of municipal councils; it might help them gain new experience. If UW definitely goes in the direction of a coalition with the right wing, then, as Marek Borowski correctly pointed out, it will not be the first case of such a union. They usually did not gain much as a result, but, after all, it is their own decision. I also think that this will clearly define the responsibility of these groupings for everything that is going on there; so, there is really nothing to envy... As the opposition, we will control these authorities and suggest better solutions. I also think that we will be getting ready for the next elections. [Rosolak] Do you not fear the so-called anti-SLD coalition? [Kwasniewski] No, I do not. It may be formed, but it is just as likely as a coalition with the participation of the SLD. We are talking about politics. I am amused by evaluations that are supposed to belittle our results, as well as by opinions that we did not receive 50 percent of votes everywhere... In the parliamentary elections, we obtained 20 percent, so we are not a majority in the Sejm, either. Thus, it would be difficult to expect that we will all of a sudden win the majority of votes in the self-governmental elections. [passage omitted] [Rosolak] You have established numerous coalitions with the PSL in the regions. What separates coalition members in regions, and what brings them together? [Kwasniewski] Generally speaking, the characteristic thing about self-governmental elections is that there are more issues that bring people together than issues that separate them. It is difficult to expect that great disputes or passions will be related to the communal infrastructure or other issues that are within the powers of self-governments. The analysis of the results of the elections showed that the PSL is not an all-national party but a party that is really strongly linked to the rural electorate. The results that the PSL received in towns are poor. This is the problem when you want to transfer the coalition with the PSL to towns. In towns, we are, in fact, alone and must fight against UW alone or fight along with UW against the right wing. [Rosolak] The coalition with the PSL comprises the government. One can continually hear the following statements: "The left has blurred its image through the coalition with the PSL; its ability to reach a compromise is greater than that of its peasant partner." What is the price of the coalition? What is the limit of compromise? [Kwasniewski] Every decision has its price. I believe that we have confirmed that we are solvent. It is worth recalling that it was predicted before the elections that many misfortunes would befall us. The right wing said that we would lose; others kept saying that our alliance with the PSL would yield us negative results; still others feared that our rational economic program was not very leftist, and, therefore, we would obtain fewer votes. I believe that many of these accusations have been proved false. I believe that our voters will understand that the SLD's compromises result from the feeling of responsibility: from the fact that we think in terms of responsibility for the state, not in terms of disputes over our own positions, ministerial posts, and so on. I am also happy with the fact that the statements that our electorate expected miracles have proved false. It turned out that our electorate is very conscious; the people know and understand that successes are not achieved overnight and that they call for hard work. I believe--please do not think I am boasting--that, generally, it is becoming increasingly clear that we are number one on the left side. It is also obvious that, if the social-democratic left wing is crystallized anywhere, it should be crystallized around us--with our significant participation. I am convinced about that. Thanks to our openness, which you have criticized, we will be able to count on cooperation and the presence of others who want to join us. The Polish political system is shifting toward a four-party system: the left; the right, with very strong Catholic and national views; the center, including UW; and the peasant party, the PSL, which, because of its structure, will be an important grouping in our country for many years to come. [passage omitted] [Rosolak] The Constitutional Committee of the National Assembly has already familiarized itself with six draft constitutions. You say that the differences concern 20 percent of the issues that are found in the Basic Law. Among the controversial issues, you list relations between church and state, the political system of the country, and social rights. How do you see the possibility of reaching a consensus in a situation in which the dispute concerns the most vital problems? [Kwasniewski] Eighty percent are articles on which a consensus can be easily reached; 20 percent involve key disputes. The discussion will be finally ended through a vote. There is no other possibility. We will seek a compromise wherever it can be reached. The National Assembly will settle the issue, which will be finally decided in a nationwide referendum. [Rosolak] As chairman of the Constitutional Committee of the National Assembly, you said that we would have a new constitution by last spring. If the statements by Minister Falandysz are also the opinions of the president, the first citizen does not really look forward to the constitution's being passed anytime soon. [Kwasniewski] I think that the president is supporting the schedule that has been accepted by parliament. It is an ambitious and logical schedule because it is reasonable to elect the president when the conditions of the contract are already known. It would be really bad if the president were elected in line with the regulations that are binding today but that may change later on. This might gave rise to the following question: Does the newly elected president have to accept the conditions created after he was elected? I think that the proposed sequence of events is more natural. [passage omitted]
