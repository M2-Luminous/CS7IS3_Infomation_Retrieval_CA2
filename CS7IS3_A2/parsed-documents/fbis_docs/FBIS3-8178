Sejm Deputy Wieslawa Ziolkowska presented the results of work that went on for more than two months concerning the government's budget draft, on behalf of the Economic Policies, Budget, and Finance Commission. She recommended that the budget draft be adopted, even though she was also quite critical of it. According to the government, budget expenditures are supposed to be 696.1 trillion zlotys [Z] and budget revenue Z613 trillion, whereas the budget deficit should not exceed Z83 trillion. The commission implemented only minor revisions to the draft. Critical Report All proposals for increasing budget revenues and expenditures were rejected. Sejm Deputy Ziolkowska stressed that, in the commission's view, the budget proposed by the government allows neither for improving the efficiency of reforming and restructuring the economy, nor for a slowdown of regression trends regarding meeting basic social needs. Ziolkowska reported on the commission's doubts regarding too optimistic assumptions contained in the draft concerning economic growth, a fall in inflation rates, export increases, and a too cautious evaluation of budget revenues. She also stressed the commission's critical remarks regarding excessive figures resulting from an assessment of sums of money devoted to the reimbursement of income taxes (Z24 trillion), and also an insufficient figure indicating revenue from the lump-sum tax [podatek zryczaltowany]--just Z7 trillion. The commission was also critical of the way of financing the domestic debt, which had been suggested by the government. Sejm Deputy Ziolkowska devoted much of her speech to social expenditures. These are planned to be Z46.5 trillion, which, among other things, will make it impossible to pay about 400,000 social assistance benefits--that figure is higher than last year, when there was not enough money for 250,000 of those entitled. Real [after accounting for inflation] expenditures on social assistance will drop by 4 percent. Little Room for Maneuver The way the report was presented, which included Ziolkowska's subjective views, aroused critical remarks during the subsequent debate. [Acting Finance] Minister Henryk Chmielak also engaged himself in polemics regarding some of Ziolkowska's arguments. He admitted that the government budget draft cannot satisfy everyone, but he also stressed that the government's room for maneuver was restricted very much by factors like high unemployment levels, high costs of servicing the domestic and external debts, and disadvantageous demographic changes. These prevented the government from changing expenditure levels in many fields. But an increase in the sources of budget revenue is becoming a new trend. This should make it possible to achieve a 5-percent increase in those sources, or perhaps even higher than that. At that point, one will be able to think about increasing the expenditures. Argument With Polish National Bank [NBP] Sejm Deputy Waldemar Michna of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL], while presenting a report on the work of the commission regarding the principles of monetary policies in 1994, stressed two significant changes: increasing the money supply from Z155 trillion to Z169 trillion, and the possibility of the NBP's financing the budget deficit in the amount of Z35 trillion (instead of the Z30 trillion the NBP wanted to see.) NBP Chairwoman Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz did not rule out the possibility of increasing the money supply, but only by Z2 trillion at most. Michna also made an appeal to the Sejm deputies not to change the level of financing the budget deficit by the NBP because that could lead to decreasing the banks' profits and a resultant decrease of the state budget revenue. Apart from the draft of the Budget Law and the principles of monetary policies, Sejm deputies also debated a draft resolution coming from Sejm deputies that would oblige the government to seek additional possibilities of increasing the budget revenue that cannot be pinpointed right now, and to present them to the Sejm in midyear. Sejm Deputies Mieczyslaw Czerniawski of the Democratic Left Alliance and PSL's Franciszek Stefaniuk, who spoke on behalf of their respective Sejm deputies clubs, declared their support for the budget. Both presented the difficult situation that is a legacy from the previous governments--that situation made it impossible to implement radical changes in the process of planning budget revenue and expenditures. They also stressed such positive aspects of the budget as the fact that its goal is acceleration of economic growth, a fall in inflation, a more just distribution of the burden of the impact of economic transformations, efforts to bring public finances to their health, an increase of financial means devoted to promoting exports, the introduction of investment-related breaks, and so forth. Sejm Deputy Hanna Suchocka of the Democratic Union [UD] accused the governing coalition of refusing to fulfill the promises they had made during the election campaign, and also of being inconsistent in continuing the reforms. She also criticized the government for what is only a marginal implementation of the "Agreement on State-Owned Enterprises." She announced that the UD Sejm Deputies Club will not support the budget. The same kind of declaration was made by Ryszard Bugaj of the Union of Labor. He listed five reasons: dubious macroeconomic assumptions, insufficient budget revenues (by about Z30 trillion), a too restrictive monetary policy, lack of rationalization with regard to budget expenditures, and a mistaken concept of privatization. At the end of Thursday's debate on the budget, Ownership Transformations Minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek also engaged in polemics with critics of privatization. He said companies are impatient and tired "of waiting for more seals of approval, which are supposed to give them the right to undertake the risk of an economic game." He added that the Finance Ministry has already prepared a draft concerning the introduction of a so-called transaction fee, but one cannot assume that taxing income derived from the stock market will save the budget. The introduction of the fee must be preceded by a thorough analysis and linked to an increase in the supply of shares, and it must also take capital market development into account.
