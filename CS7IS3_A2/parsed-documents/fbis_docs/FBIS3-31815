He noted that after the prime minister's proposal to dismiss him, presented to the president, and in view of the current political situation as well as the foreign political interests of the Slovak Republic, he considered it necessary to solve the personnel question of the minister of foreign affairs. At the same time, he did not assume that his departure would change Slovak foreign policy in principle because a change in political course would not be supported by parliament.
