FR940802-0-00079 FR940802-0-00016 Response: NMFS has reviewed the administrative record in regard to the referenced share agreement criterion, and concluded that the Council intended that historical captains must document a share agreement in effect up to the present time. At its March 1994 meeting, the Council specifically rejected an alternative that would have required share agreements only in 1990, 1991, and 1992. Since the final rule will be implemented in mid-1994, 1993 is the most recent calendar year with readily available records for a full year. NMFS therefore disagrees with the commenter and supports the time period for share agreements, as specified in Amendment 9 and the rule. Comment: The second commenter also suggested that §641.10(a)(2) include in the criteria to qualify as a historical captain the requirement that a person must have landed red snapper at least once prior to November 7, 1989. Response: Section 641.10(d)(iv) requires an applicant for historical captain status to submit documentation of a landing of red snapper prior to November 7, 1989. NMFS agrees that, for consistency, the requirement for such a landing should also be included in the criteria for historical captain status, and it is added in this final rule at §641.10(a)(2)(iv). Comment: The second commenter also objected to the use of the word ``lease'' in one of the criteria for historical captain status, primarily because of the present use of that term in the fishing industry. Response: NMFS agrees with the commenter and has removed the phrase containing the word ``lease'' from §641.10(a)(2)(i). Comment: The second commenter also objected to the statement in §641.10(a)(2)(i) that the share agreement must have provided for the operator to be responsible for hiring the crew, ``who were paid from his or her share.'' The commenter suggested replacement text to reflect the standard practice in the fishery for the ``buyer'' to write the checks to the crew_after the captain determines shares and payment to the crew. Response: Neither the Council nor NMFS intended to establish as a criterion for status as a historical captain that such person must have written paychecks to his or her crew. The intent was that the share agreement provide for proceeds to be divided between the owner and the historical captain. Crew shares or payments would not be contained in such share agreement. Rather, the historical captain would determine payments to the crew, such payments coming from the share under the control of the historical captain_without regard to who wrote the checks. For clarity, the above quoted language is revised to read, ``who were paid from the share under his or her control.'' Comment: A third commenter provided various comments in support of Amendment 9, noting the need to continue the effectiveness of the reef fish permit moratorium and to then establish an ITQ system. Response: NMFS agrees with this comment in support of Amendment 9. However, remarks on an allocation system such as an ITQ system or other effort management option are outside the scope of Amendment 9 and are not included here. Approval of Amendment 9 On July 20, 1994, the Director, Southeast Region, NMFS (Regional Director), approved Amendment 9. Changes From the Proposed Rule In §641.2, the address in the definition of ``Regional Director'' is corrected. As noted above under Comments and Responses, §641.10(a)(2)(i) is revised and §641.10(a)(2)(iv) is added. An additional change is made to §641.10(a)(2)(i) to clarify that a historical captain may have fished under more than one share agreement during the required period. A new §641.10(b)(3) is added to clarify the procedures whereby owners/operators will receive printouts of existing NMFS data on landings of red snapper during 1990 through 1992. The provisions for owners/operators to submit records of landings they believe were omitted from NMFS data are moved to §641.10(c)(1). Classification This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration that this rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The reasons were published in the preamble to the proposed rule (59 FR 27258, May 26, 1994). As a result, a regulatory flexibility analysis was not prepared. This final rule contains collection-of-information requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act_specifically, information on landings of red snapper and documentation of status as a historical captain in the red snapper fishery. These collections of information have been approved by OMB under OMB control number 0648&hyph;0281. The public reporting burdens for these collections of information are estimated to average 2 and 5 hours per response, respectively, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collections of information. Send comments regarding these burden estimates or any other aspect of the collections of information, including suggestions for reducing the burdens, to Edward E. Burgess, NMFS, 9721 Executive Center Drive, St. Petersburg, FL 33702 and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, Washington, DC 20503 (Attention: NOAA Desk Officer). The data to be collected under this final rule are needed by fishermen and the Council to evaluate the effects of potential effort management systems for the red snapper segment of the reef fish fishery. That segment is managed under measures that expire December 31, 1995. To provide ample time to collect the data, present it to the fishermen and the Council, evaluate its effects, and develop, approve, and implement additional management measures prior to December 31, 1995, it is necessary that the data collection under this rule commence as soon as possible. To that end, information regarding the proposed data collection has been broadly disseminated to the fishing community prior to this final rule. The other measures in this final rule are extensions of effectiveness or clarifications of measures that are currently in effect and, thus, do not affect current fishing practices. Accordingly, the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, finds for good cause under section 553(d)(3) of the Administrative Procedure Act that the effectiveness of this final rule should not be delayed.
