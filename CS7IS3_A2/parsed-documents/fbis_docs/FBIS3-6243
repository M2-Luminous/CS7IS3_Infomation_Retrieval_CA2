The Japanese economy is showing some sign of pickup in such areas as housing, home electric appliances, audio equipment and autos, Manae Kubota, director general of the Economic Planning Agency [EPA], told a regular press conference. The bud of the economic recovery should be nurtured with steps to spur personal spending, such as more housing investment and early implementation of planned tax cuts, she said. These measures will be effective in putting the economy on a strong recovery track, she said.
