Text of Rule and Form Amendments In accordance with the foregoing, title 17, chapter II of the Code of Federal Regulations is proposed to be amended as follows: PART 210_FORM AND CONTENT OF AND REQUIREMENTS FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1935, INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940, AND ENERGY POLICY AND CONSERVATION ACT OF 1975 1. The authority citation for part 210 is revised to read as follows: Authority: 15 U.S.C. 77f, 77g, 77h, 77j, 77s, 77aa(25), 77aa(26), 78 l , 78m, 78n, 78 o (d), 78w(a), 78 ll (d), 79e(b), 79j(a), 79n, 79t(a), 80a&hyph;8, 80a&hyph;20, 80a&hyph;29, 80a&hyph;30, 80a&hyph;37a, unless otherwise noted. 2. By revising §210.3&hyph;20 to read as follows: §210.3&hyph;20 Currency for financial statements of foreign private issuers. (a) A foreign private issuer, as defined in §230.405 of this chapter, shall state amounts in its primary financial statements in the currency in which it reports in its financial statements that are distributed to the majority of its nonaffiliated shareholders. (b) The currency in which amounts in the financial statements are stated shall be disclosed prominently on the face of the financial statements. If dividends on publicly-held equity securities will be declared in a currency other than the reporting currency, a note to the financial statements shall identify that currency. If there are material exchange restrictions or controls relating to the issuer's reporting currency, the currency of the issuer's domicile, or the currency in which the issuer will pay dividends, prominent disclosure of this fact shall be made in the financial statements. If the reporting currency is not the U.S. dollar, dollar-equivalent financial statements or convenience translations shall not be presented, except a translation may be presented of the most recent fiscal year and any subsequent interim period presented using the exchange rate as of the most recent balance sheet included in the filing, except that a rate as of the most recent practicable date shall be used if materially different. (c) If the financial statements of a foreign private issuer are stated in a currency of a country that has experienced cumulative inflationary effects exceeding a total of 100 percent over the most recent three year period, and have not been recast or otherwise supplemented to include information on a historical cost/constant currency or current cost basis prescribed or permitted by appropriate authoritative standards, the issuer shall present supplementary information to quantify the effects of changing prices upon its financial position and results of operations. (d) Either. (1) Approach A Notwithstanding the currency selected for reporting purposes, the issuer shall measure separately its own transactions, and those of each of its material operations ( e.g., branches, divisions, subsidiaries, joint ventures, and similar entities) that is included in the issuer's consolidated financial statements and not located in a hyperinflationary environment, using the particular currency of the primary economic environment in which the issuer or the operation conducts its business. Balance sheet amounts so determined shall be translated into the reporting currency at the exchange rate at the balance sheet date; all revenues, expenses, gains, and losses shall be translated at the exchange rate existing at the time of the transaction or, if appropriate, a weighted average of the exchange rates during the period; and all translation effects of exchange rate changes shall be included as a separate component (``cumulative translation adjustment'') of shareholders' equity. For purposes of this paragraph, the currency of an operation's primary economic environment is normally the currency in which cash is primarily generated and expended; a hyperinflationary environment is one that has cumulative inflation of approximately 100% or more over the most recent three year period. Departures from the methodology presented in this paragraph shall be quantified pursuant to Items 17 and 18(c)(2) of Form 20&hyph;F (§249.220f of this chapter). (2) Approach B All transactions of the issuer and its subsidiaries shall be measured (or remeasured if not so measured initially) using the reporting currency and the effects of exchange rate changes on monetary assets and liabilities of the issuer and its subsidiaries shall be included in income, except that transactions of its material foreign operations ( e.g., branch, division, subsidiary, joint venture, or similar entity) included in the consolidated financial statements and not located in a hyperinflationary environment shall be measured using the particular currency of the primary economic environment in which the foreign operation conducts its business. With respect to financial statement amounts of foreign operations so determined: Balance sheet amounts shall be translated into the reporting currency at the exchange rate at the balance sheet date; all revenues, expenses, gains, and losses shall be translated at the exchange rate existing at the time of the transaction or, if appropriate, a weighted average of the exchange rates during the period; and all effects of exchange rate changes shall be included as a separate component (``cumulative translation adjustment'') of shareholders' equity. For purposes of this paragraph, the currency of an operation's primary economic environment is normally the currency in which cash is primarily generated and expended; a hyperinflationary environment is one that has cumulative inflation of approximately 100% or more over the most recent three year period. Departures from the methodology presented in this paragraph shall be quantified pursuant to Items 17 and 18(c)(2) of Form 20&hyph;F (§249.220f of this chapter). (e) The issuer shall state its primary financial statements in the same currency for all periods for which financial information is presented. If the financial statements are stated in a currency that is different from that used in financial statements previously filed with the Commission, the issuer shall recast its financial statements as if the newly adopted currency had been used since at least the earliest period presented in the filing. The decision to change the reporting currency shall be disclosed in a note to the financial statements in the period in which the change occurs.
