He meets his Canadian counterpart Andre Ouellet on Monday and will propose ways to strengthen trade links between South Korea and NAFTA, including the establishment of "special cooperative relations," officials said. They are to discuss post-Uruguay Round bilateral trade arrangements and regional cooperation through the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, the officials said. Han meets Secretary of Commerce Roy MacLaren first and is expected to urge Canada to extend its general preferential tariff (GPT) status for South Korea that ends in June, as well as lower import and other trade barriers to South Korean products. He will call on Prime Minister Jean Chretien on Tuesday before going to the United Nations, where he plans to confer with Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali on the North Korean nuclear problem and possible measures by the UN Security Council.
