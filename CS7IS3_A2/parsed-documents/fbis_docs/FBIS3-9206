The session was chaired by Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik. The talks resulted in the signing of a coalition agreement between the Party of the Democratic Left, the Christian Democratic Movement, and the so-called Centrist Bloc. Immediately after the agreement was signed, Ivan Bielko interviewed Slovak Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac. [begin recording] [Kovac] The coalition agreement makes possible the functioning of the coalition government and its lasting support in parliament for the measures it takes to lead this society toward early democratic elections. A lot of work will have to be done, naturally. The state cannot come to a halt, and the coalition agreement safeguards the mechanisms to enable the coalition parties to achieve constructive cooperation. [Bielko] This coalition agreement was signed by five entities. What will happen if one of them does not agree? How will decisions be adopted? [Kovac] It has been defined that these decisions must be adopted by a consensus of all parties. That means that disagreement of one party is being replaced by a dialogue. Explanations and, truly, the problems that have to be tackled must be solved by consensus. No system of voting has been introduced. It would not be very good. We will re-assess the entire situation. In case there is a negative attitude, we will convene an extraordinary coalition council in order to solve the problems. [end recording]
