Their aim was to finalize the merger of these two nonparliamentary parties of the political right. Correspondent Oto Goerner interviewed Pavol Hagyari, the newly elected chairman of the party. [Begin recording] [Hagyari] The constitutional congress decided the name of the new party. Three names were proposed: the Democratic Party; Conservative Democratic Party-Democratic Party, a double-barrelled name; and the Party of the Democratic Right. The first proposal was given a clear majority, which means that, as of today, we are to be called the "Democratic Party." I am convinced a new, strong party of the right is being created, which in the last elections attracted 10 percent of the voters. We are convinced the same will be the case at the next elections that may be held very soon. [Goerner] Is it not a paradox that there are some parties splitting in the present climate while the KDS and the DS merge? [Hagyari] It is also a question of political foresight. If the Civic Right failed in the last elections because it was split, if we can learn from our own mistakes and from the mistakes of the Polish right, then we are left only with merging into one political spectrum with more right-of-center nonparliamentary parties.
