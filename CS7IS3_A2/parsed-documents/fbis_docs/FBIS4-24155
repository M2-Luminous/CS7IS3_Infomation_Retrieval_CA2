FBIS4-24155 "drafr122_c_94018" FBIS-AFR-94-122 Daily Report 23 Jun 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA HRC Reports Violent Deaths Down During May HRC Reports Violent Deaths Down During May MB2406072094 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1955 GMT 23 Jun 94 MB2406072094 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] Johannesburg June 23 SAPA -- The national violence death toll dropped by 60 per cent from April's 487 to 195 during May, the Human Rights Committee [HRC] said on Thursday [23 June]. In its monthly report the HRC said violence in KwaZulu/Natal had continued to drop, with the May death toll of 104 the lowest recorded since January 1993. Despite ongoing tensions in the area, the declining death toll supported the HRC's repeated calls for the lifting of the state of emergency in KwaZulu/Natal, the HRC said. The 195 deaths in May were considerably lower than the 1994 monthly average of 365 and the 1993 monthly average of 367. There were 73 deaths in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging], 104 in Natal, and 18 elsewhere, bringing the year total to 1,826. Of the 195 victims, ten were women and five children. Two white civilians were among those killed in May. The 226 incidents of violence in May represented a 65 percent decrease from the April figure of 649. This low level of violence had not been experienced since January 1993, the HRC said. Only one "major massacre" took place in May -- the execution-style killing of 12 people in Thokoza, linked to fighting between Self-Defence Units in Katlehong. The right wing, with no deaths attributed to it in May, appeared to have been neutralised after it caused 24 deaths and 184 injuries during its bombing campaign in April. Taxi violence, with 14 deaths, increased for the third month in succession. On human rights, the HRC recorded declining figures in detentions without trial, deaths in police custody and political arrests. It reported as a violation of the freedom of assembly the order circulated by Eastern Cape Premier Raymond Mhlaba banning civil servants in the province from going on strike.
