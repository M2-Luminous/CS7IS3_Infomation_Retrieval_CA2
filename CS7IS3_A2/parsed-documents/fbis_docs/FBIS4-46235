"These actions come from sectors that have yet to understand the role of the new society and the democracy being experienced in the country," Monterrey told LA PRENSA GRAFICA. Monterrey said that for the past 20 days he has been receiving threatening phone calls and communiques both at his office and home. He added that investigations are being conducted to find out who is responsible. The PNC director said that some of the threats have already been carried out, indicating that 15 days ago he was the target of an attack from which he emerged unharmed. As a result of this, he has been forced to take security measures. "I have never in my life had to use bodyguards; I have never even been armed. Unfortunately, I will have to take some precautions so as not to ignore these threats," he added. Monterrey said the PCN has acted firmly against kidnappers, drug traffickers, car theft gangs, and individuals who have been illegally using weapons, so some of these sectors might be responsible for the threats.
