Al-Rawdan explained that the aim behind this decision was to increase the state's revenue and deal with the mounting budget deficit. He indicated, at the same time, that the relative reduction announced in the first chapter of next year's budget, which is being discussed by the appropriate committee of the National Assembly, will not affect the wages and salaries of staff of the state sector. This announcement was made during a session of the National Assembly, which was chaired by Speaker Ahmad al-Sa'dun, during which a draft-reply to the Amir's speech was submitted to the Amir of Kuwait. The session also adopted three laws submitted by the government. During the session, Information Minister Shaykh Sa'ud al-Nasir al-Sabah played down the importance of the statements regarding Kuwait, which were recently attributed to a member of the U.S. Congress. Minister al-Sabah described these statements as "not representative in any way of the opinion of the friendly U.S. people, who support Kuwait's right in its legitimate demands vis-a- vis the Iraqi regime." In this connection, the members of the National Assembly underlined the planned visit of a delegation from the National Assembly to the United States in the middle of this month. They are pinning great hopes on this visit to explain Kuwaiti positions regarding the situation in the Gulf region, and improve Kuwait's image abroad.
