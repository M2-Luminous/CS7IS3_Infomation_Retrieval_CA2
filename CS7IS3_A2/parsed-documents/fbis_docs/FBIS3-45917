This event has attracted attention and aroused anxiety from some Taiwan businessmen in Wuhan. This reporter went to gather news on the event a few days ago. Some time after 1400 on 7 January, six unidentified young people rushed into Hansheng Computer Company, a Taiwan-invested enterprise in Wuchang District, carrying a spanner, saw, and other lethal weapons, and claiming that they had something to discuss with Zhang Tao. Having identified the individual as Zhang Tao, one of the gang said to him: "You assailed my wife with obscenities, so I have come to give you a lesson today." The gang then struck Zhang until his nose was broken and bleeding. Seeing their colleague being beaten by the gang, a guard and a staff member of the company went out to join in the fight. As a result, the guard was hit on the back of his head, injuring his skull, and the staff member's elbow was fractured. They are currently hospitalized. After the incident, Mr. Lu Shengrui, secretary general of the Association of Taiwan Businessmen and general manager of the Hansheng Computer Company, called an emergency meeting of Taiwan businessmen in Wuhan to appeal to the public security department to handle this event, and wrote a letter of appeal entitled "Protect the Personal Safety of Taiwan Businessmen in Wuhan and Urgently Handle the Case of Beating and Injuring Mr. Zhang Tao, Legal Adviser of the Association," which was jointly signed by the association members. According to a briefing by Section Head Gui from the Hubei Provincial Office for Taiwan Affairs, the director of the office said that he would correctly handle this incident when he was informed of it. After receiving the letter of appeal from Wuhan's Association of Taiwan Businessmen, Governor Jia Zhijie and Vice Governor Chen Shuiwen rapidly gave written instructions that public security organs should ascertain the facts and severely punish the assailants as soon as possible. However, more than 10 days have passed since the case was filed and there has not been any outcome from the investigation except a general query of what happened at the scene, which was conducted by the public security committee under the jurisdiction of the district authority. This has aroused great dissatisfaction among the parties concerned and the Taiwan businessmen in Wuhan, who said that they would reveal the affair to the Straits Exchange Foundation in Beijing [as published] and Taiwan media by fax. According to the above briefing, relevant departments are paying close attention to investigating and handling the affair, and have assured the Taiwan businessmen of a fair result.
