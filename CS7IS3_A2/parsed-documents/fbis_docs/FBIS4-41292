FBIS4-41292 "drsov122_u_94005" FBIS-SOV-94-122 Daily Report 22 Jun 1994 Latvia Budget Deficit Hits 16 Million Lats on 1 Jun Budget Deficit Hits 16 Million Lats on 1 Jun WS2306104394 Tallinn BNS in English 1508 GMT 22 Jun 94 WS2306104394 Tallinn BNS English BFN [Text] Riga, Jun 22, BNS -- The 16.3-million-lat state budget deficit on June 1 was completely covered with state treasury bills, Finance Ministry's Budget Department Director Gatis Kaminskis told reporters. In the first five months of this year, the budget earned 211.8 million lats, or 36.9 percent of the projected yearly revenues, while the spendings hit 219 million lats, or 35.6 percent of the planned yearly expenditure. Commenting on the budget situation in the first five months of this year, Kaminskis noted that budget incomes exceeded spendings 2.8 million lats what reduced the prevalence of spendings over incomes from 10.4 million lats late in April to 7.19 million lats late in May. The Latvian economy currently enjoys a process of stabilization because in May the inflation rate was the lowest this year, only 0.2 percent compared to April. In total, the inflation grew 12.4 percent since the beginning of this year. Kaminskis underscored that the prediction that the inflation would soar after the introduction of the uniform 18 percent sales tax on all food stuffs in the beginning of June has not materialized. He also called for the improvement of the taxation system because the debts of sales tax and profit tax-payers to the national budget have increased. Sales tax payments formed 66.2 million lats of the state budget earnings in the first five months of this year but the sum is 1.8 times smaller than in the same period last year. The debt of sales tax-payers to the state budget makes up around 3 million lats and the State Income Service should find out the reason for the tendency of this debt to grow, Kaminskis noted. The excise duty payments have also been unsatisfactory between January and May as they formed only 23.5 percent of the projected excise revenues.
