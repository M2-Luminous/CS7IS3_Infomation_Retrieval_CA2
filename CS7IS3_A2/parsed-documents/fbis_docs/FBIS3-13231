The sources noted that the meeting was held to reorganize relations between these groups in light of current developments in the wake of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron. The sources added that an agreement was reached at this meeting, which was chaired by Faysal al-Husayni as the head of the Fatah Movement in the West Bank, that stipulated the revival of the Unified National Leadership of the Intifadah. They said that agreement was also reached on reformulating national unity on the basis of the struggle [against the Israeli occupation] and within the framework of firm Palestinian principles. They also noted that collective action will be taken to support the PLO command's suspension of the peace process in protest of the Hebron massacre and linkage of the resumption of negotiations to the drawing up of new rules and bases that will ensure the removal of the existing settlements in the occupied territories. The Palestinian sources expressed their belief that the Palestinian groups' representatives might soon reach an agreement, according to which the Population Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine will return to the PLO establishments and leadership bodies.
