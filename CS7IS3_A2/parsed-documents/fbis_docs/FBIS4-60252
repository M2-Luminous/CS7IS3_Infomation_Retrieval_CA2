The Majles met in open session yesterday chaired by Dr. Rowhani, and the deputies from the cities of Langrud, Jahrom, Ahvaz, and Sanqar and Kolia'i gave speeches. Then the Majles took up its agenda, and we direct the attention of our esteemed readers to the detailed proceedings. Legislation Law Transferring Health Monitors in Elementary Schools to Educational Units in the Ministry of Education and Training The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles session was the report from the Health Care Commission's second consultation on the Motion To Amend Article 1 of the Law Transferring Health Monitors in Elementary Schools to Educational Units in the Ministry of Education and Training, enacted 9/12/1370 [3 December 1991], of which Article 1 was approved by the deputies. Article 1: The text of Article 1 of the Law Transferring Health Monitors in Elementary Schools to Educational Units in the Ministry of Education and Training enacted 9/12/1370 is amended as follows, a note entitled Note 4 is appended, and its existing Note 4 is changed to Note 5. All health monitors in elementary schools who were trained in the supreme health care schools under the Ministry of Health Care, Treatment and Medical Education are transferred to the Ministry of Education and Training. Note 4: As before, the responsibility for health care in the schools (planning, policy making, manpower training and implementation) in the framework of the nation's health care and treatment network is the responsibility of the Ministry of Health Care, Treatment and Medical Education. Bill Exempting Islamic Republic Shipping From Paying Taxes To Buy Ships The second item on the agenda was the report from the first consultation of the Economic, Financial and Cooperative Affairs Commission concerning the Bill Exempting the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Company From Paying Taxes on the Portion of Its Profits Allocated To Buy Ships. A member of the Economic Affairs Commission discussed the reasons for rejecting this bill. He said: If every organization is going to avoid paying taxes, how can we expect others to pay them? If taxes are not collected, how are going to implement development projects? Implementation of these projects depends on collecting taxes. He then added: On the one hand we want to free ourselves from dependence, and on the other hand we want to have tax exemptions. These two things do not go together. If tax exemptions are made every day, the government will not be able to carry out its responsibilities. One of the bill's supporters said: If we exempt them, they will be able to buy a ship every year. Since ships are very important and vital for us, they must therefore be tax exempt for this purpose. After talks by supporters and opponents, the general form of the aforementioned bill was put to a vote and approved. Parviz Siqali, Deputy From Langrud A recent imperialist plot is to make the people disappointed in their past performance The first preagenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles session was Siqali, deputy from Langrud. He observed the martyrdom anniversary of the acting commander of the Gilan 16 Qods Army. He discussed the Great Satan's plot to reduce the price of oil and the appropriate procedures adopted by the president of the republic to deal with the crisis of the severe drop in oil prices. Continuing, he added: If the price of a barrel of oil increased to $30 instead of $12, and if we had a foreign exchange surplus instead of a foreign exchange deficit, we would repay our foreign debts on time and a positive answer would be given to the rightful demands of the Majles deputies and others. If the price of a dollar were less than 100 tomans, would we have the same views and judgments we have today? Clearly the answer is no. We all know that the price of oil is an international issue, and that Iran's role in OPEC is not constructive. He also said: The recent imperialist plots were planned in calculated frameworks, and in difficult economic circumstances, psychological and spiritual pressure will be applied in the following areas: (1) Disappointing the people in their performance; (2) Portraying the dimensions of Islam as ineffective and not world-inclusive in the management of a country; (3) Portraying the government as weak in terms of its stated goals, and in short it will seek to draw the conclusion that the slogans of the splendid period of the Islamic revolution have not been realized. Siqali said that nothing more than this is to be expected from foreign enemies, and if they change their position on the course of the Islamic revolution one must be skeptical. He said: How must one deal with domestic enemies, who consider themselves Muslims following the leader's path, but in practice act in secret hypocritical opposition to God, his Prophet, the vice regent of the Muslims and the sacred government of the Islamic Republic? The speaker discussed the fact that the Imam of the Age's (may God hasten his joyful advent) nameless soldiers clearly know them better than anyone, and they know well that they are busy every day collecting the assets of the people and the government, putting unworthy people in the nation's sensitive and key positions, and having vulgar gatherings at night for debauchery. Continuing, he said: They call collecting countless coins and hundreds of millions of tomans the giving of gifts, and today the taking of bribes is rampant in Islamic society; large and small acts of embezzlement are seen in the offices, the government companies, the banks and other places. Sometimes it is reported in the high-circulation newspapers. The people are asking the officials how these people must be dealt with, and what level of divine punishment should be applied to them. Siqali then discussed the fact that the province of Gilan has been forgotten, and the people are asking the deputies, what national development projects have been carried out in this province since the Islamic revolution, other than the during the earthquake issue, which opened the eyes of many ministers. In this same regard he added: More than 85 percent of the villages in Gilan do not have drinking water and its cities are no better off. The rural roads are not suitable and about 60 percent of the province's villages do not have the benefit of electrical power. Continuing, he said: The communications networks are in the worst condition. The Qazvin-Rasht road has taken the lives of many travelers and has become known today as a killing ground. At the same time, this province does not have a railroad. The famous Rasht airport is an airport in name only. On the shores of the Caspian Sea the passenger and freight shipping lines do not have coastal cities or multipurpose ports, and nothing has been done about them in the planning for province development. At the end of his speech, the deputy from Langrud discussed the fact that based on the report from the Fisheries Company, revenues from caviar exports were about $100 million. If the dollar is worth 200 tumans this year, revenues from the sale of caviar are about 20 tumans billion, yet net fishermen, with high costs of living, live by the skin of their teeth or drown. In the year 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] three people drowned under very suspicious circumstances. At the first opportunity I told the governor-general of Gilan, the minister of the reconstruction crusade and the minister of the interior that the reason for the drownings is still shrouded in ambiguity. Mohammad Mehdi Shoja'ifard, Deputy From Jahrom Today, thanks to this government, the Imam's Aid Committee even pays the educational expenses of college students it covers. The second preagenda speaker was Shoja'ifard, deputy from Jahrom. During his speech he said: It makes the nation more optimistic when we compare the nation's various affairs before and after the revolution with other countries. He discussed the nation's economic situation. He said: Before the revolution, 85 to 90 percent of the people had economic problems, yet today, thanks to the Islamic government and through the efforts of the officials and the president of the republic, more than 80 percent of the people have no basic economic problems. Before the revolution, did the poor receive a million rials in any city from the Imam's Aid Committee, as they did in Jahrom? Where was it possible for a student to study easily is he so desired? The speaker continued: Today, thanks to this government, the Imam's Aid Committee even pays the educational expenses of the college students it covers. I want the Voice and Vision organization to cover this subject. Compare the security issues. Today in America itself, which is proclaiming the new world order, this nation's students are being searched in the junior high schools. Shoja'ifard thanked the minister of the interior for dealing with the nation's security problems. He noted: Currently when most of the nations of the world want to keep themselves among the people, they announce in some way that they have relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran. Continuing, the deputy from Jahrom discussed the Palestine issue. He said: We declare that emigration to Israel should not take place, for it will be regretted. In conclusion, he said: In view of the fact that the Majles has guaranteed the purchase of the date crop, 15,000 tons of dates are now rotting in Jahrom. I also further advise Mr. Rafiqdust that he must pay more attention to wounded war veterans and not lay this burden on the government. If he gives one-third of the foundation's revenues to the wounded war veterans, that is sufficient. 'Ali Maturi, Deputy From Ahvaz Are we adhering to the religious and lawful principle of supervision in the way that we should? The next speaker was Maturi, deputy from Ahvaz. In his speech he said: Along with the astonishing and undeniable glory that has come to us and the ray of hope that has come into the heart of each and every believer and oppressed person in the world, are we adhering to the religious and lawful principle of supervision in the way that we should? Or have we contented ourselves with a few investigations and interpellations? To understand the intellectual and moral poisons in order to develop a work ethic and social order, which was discussed by the exalted leader and could be the cure for all our social and economic problems, have we made the same effort that we have made to solve the traffic problem or the poisons caused by automobile exhaust and factory smoke in the city of Tehran, with all the investments, discussions, debates, observations and media reports, which are also themselves quite necessary? He added: Have we given careful attention to what the exalted leader has said, with his divine insight, in his message to the new chief of the Voice and Vision organization? Have we presented that to society as a cultural and political message? Truly, this illuminating and path-finding message, along with the fateful messages of the late Imam, should be revived as standard equipment for the journeys of society's cultural and educational thinkers, artists and officials. If we apply the contents of these messages, we will no longer be confused about how to deal with videos and satellites. The deputy from Ahvaz discussed the enemy plot to diminish the importance of our involvement in international affairs, especially the World Haj Conference. He said: We must think about how to answer these clever plots. Today the international battlefield is a political and cultural battlefield, and the world is clever and deceitful. Our enemy controls all the resources and even all the international organizations. In this commercial fair we must purvey our values with clarity, sincerity and faith, and in this regard we must adopt the best procedures and the soundest paths. Maturi then discussed the problems in his electoral district. He said: Apparently the project to develop sugarcane and the ancillary industries was intended to develop Khuzestan and solve the problems of unemployment and national production. Unfortunately, however, it must be said that not only has the area's unemployment problem not been solved, but in effect it has also multiplied the problem by several hundred times, and by taking over working lands instead of unused lands and making refugees of farmers, it has sent them to the cities and to false employment. I ask the respected Majles supervisors and also the minister of agriculture to supervise the course of this great national project more carefully. He asked the minister of the reconstruction crusade and the officials of the nation's Deprived Regions Office to look realistically at the numerous problems in the deprived villages of Ahvaz, and to look kindly upon these deprived villages with serious help, especially with regard to solving the drinking water problem. He added: Cutting the reconstruction budget for the municipality of Ahvaz is great oppression, which has been visited upon the noble people in the years since the war. I earnestly implore Mr. Mirzadeh to put an end to this undesirable situation. Several times I have asked the governor-general of Khuzestan and the minister of the interior to make the village of Jamidiyeh into a district. In conclusion, he thanked the chief of the Physical Training Organization for stabilizing the current situation in Khuzestan, and he thanked the Soccer Federation for guiding the South Ahvaz team to the Asian Cup games. Barat'ali Mohammadifar, Deputy From Sanqar and Koliya'i Unfortunately as yet no conclusive result has been announced on the research and investigation in the province of Kermanshah. The final preagenda speaker was Mohammadifar, deputy from Sanqar and Koliya'i. During his talk he expressed severe regret at the statement from the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Pilgrimage prohibiting the distribution of any kind of books or photographs during the Haj rites, and reducing the number of visitors to the house of God. He said: The Muslims of the world have a question to ask of a government that considers itself the servant of the shrines. According to what criteria of religious law are Islamic books and books on the Haj rites prohibited in Saudi Arabia during the days of the rites of Abraham's Haj? Mohammadifar said that the declaration of this prohibition by the Government of Saudi Arabia is a violation of a clear verse from the Koran and it is a violation of a tradition of the Prophet (peace be upon him). He said: We hope that the Government of Saudi Arabia will come to its senses and not carry out orders that violate the commands of Islam and the Koran. He then discussed the research and investigation in the province of Kermanshah, which the Majles has been studying for almost two years, and whose report has been published for the public's information by the Majles. He said: Unfortunately a definitive conclusion has not yet been announced on this for the martyr-nurturing people of the province of Kermanshah. In view of the repeated letters that have been written and the protests the people of the province have sent to the province deputies and even to the Article 90 Commission concerning the lack of a careful report and a trial of the violators, we ask the chief of the Article 90 Commission to prepare this report as soon as possible and send it to the respected chief of the judiciary so the violators can be tried and punished. In conclusion, the deputy from Sanqar and Kolia'i thanked the government and the chief of the Deprived Areas Office for declaring his electoral district a deprived municipality and he thanked the chief of the Plan and Budget Organization for allocating a significant budget to build the Sanqar road. revolution Courts Have Right To Hear Cases on the Return of Confiscated Assets Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division. The judiciary and the courts are dealing harshly with the narcotics issue, and the American government's claim that drugs are being transported through Iran is completely without basis. Ayatollah Moqteda'i, chief of the National Supreme Court, announced the above. He added: More than 40 tons of morphine was confiscated in the years 1360-1372 [21 March 1981-20 March 1994], yet there is absolutely no domestic consumption of morphine. Smugglers were transporting this cargo for distribution in Europe and America. The chief of the National Supreme Court, speaking yesterday morning at a gathering of media correspondents, continued: Recently baseless and purposeful statements have been made by American leaders that the Gvernment of Iran is smuggling narcotics across the country. Now, after approval from the Interests Discernment Council, the revolution courts system is dealing harshly with the issue of narcotics and narcotics smuggling. He added: Fatal blows have been dealt to narcotics smugglers and smugglers by the revolution courts and the police forces. The statistics on prisoners, 60 percent of whom are in prison for narcotics crimes, are good testimony to this. At the beginning of his talk Ayatollah Moqteda'i discussed the duty of the National Supreme Court, the appeals procedure in the branch court and its procedures for dealing with deficiencies, reversals, and upheld verdicts. He then discussed statistics. He said: In the year 1372, 39,000 cases reached the branch courts, of which 38,850 were heard and closed. There were also 12,912 open cases at the beginning of the year 1373 [21 March 1994], which are being heard in the branch court. All these existing cases are from the second half of the year 1372. Elsewhere in his talk, the chief of the National Supreme Court discussed the establishment of a Supervisory Unit in the court. He said: For judges whose verdicts come to the court, we have prepared a case folder to see how often a judge's verdicts are reversed and how often they are upheld. This is itself a criterion for understanding judges and their benefits and promotions so judges can be evaluated for quantity and quality. In this regard all files that have more than 250 reversals are collected. We print them and make them available to the judges. He discussed the investigation of special cases. He said: Rapid investigation of special cases such as murder, kidnapping, armed robbery, and other things has shown that there are few of these kinds of crimes and this type of investigation has had a useful effect reducing the crimes. He then discussed the public, revolution and general courts, whose details have recently been approved by the Majles. He said: The system of general courts has many distinctions, including the two main goals of the courts, which are rapid investigation and arriving at truth and reality. Of course there are also problems, which are gradually being corrected. Continuing, he compared the current judicial system with the system intended for the general courts. He said the current system, with public and revolution prosecutors, has weaknesses, and the approval of the general courts system will solve the current problems in the judiciary. Ayatollah Moqteda'i said one of the duties of the National Supreme Court is to create unity in judicial procedures by forming a General National Supreme Court Council. He said: If there is conflict between two level-one legal courts or two level-two penal courts in dealing with a law, the general council will convene to deal with the conflict. The majority opinion of the meeting will have the force of law as a unified judicial procedure. Continuing, he noted: In the year 1372 there were 26 meetings of the general council and 74 cases were discussed and closed. There were 11 unified judicial procedure cases, and the rest were penal or legal demands. He discussed three instances of unified judicial procedures in the year 1372. He added: One of them had to do with cases where the revolution courts ordered confiscation of property, and individuals came to the legal courts with documents, letters of guarantee, checks or other documents and demanded the return of their confiscated assets. With a unified procedure, the court gave the verdict: Since these cases were heard by the revolution courts and the confiscation order was given, the return of the assets and claims in this regard must be also be heard in the revolution courts. Another case had to do with crimes of smuggling goods, where individuals evaded customs regulations and the courts gave discounts. This led to the spread of smuggling of goods and no fines were collected for the smuggled goods. The National Supreme Court gave a unified procedures verdict that fines on smuggled goods cannot be discounted. It announced that this is crime subject to government fines and that these must be collected under the law. On the other hand, nongovernment fines may be changed in accordance with the opinion of the religious magistrate. The third case had to do with security crimes. The question was whether this crime is private, public or both. The court's view was that security crimes are both private and public, and even if the private plaintiff declines to prosecute, the court will not decline because of the public aspect. At the end of his speech, Ayatollah Moqteda'i discussed the case of Jalal al-Din Farsi. He said: After a protest from the Tehran Public Prosecutor, Mr. Farsi's case came to the court and was referred to Branch Court 11. After a careful study of the case the problems with the verdict were considered. Of course, these basic problems did not overturn the verdict. That is, the judges of the court believed that it was manslaughter, but there were defects in the quality of the argumentation and the evidence, and they raised an objection during the full defense. The charge of manslaughter was upheld, however, and it was sent to the penal court that issued the verdict to be returned after removal of the defects.
