And AD [Democratic Alliance] approaches Maurizio Costanzo. Rome--Behind the very minor point of not knowing when the next elections will be held hides the last big organizational structure to survive the collapse of the First Republic. It is the PDS, which has not awaited the decision of the Quirinale [presidency of the Republic] to start selecting its candidates. At PDS headquarters, a committee has been established that includes secretariat coordinator Davide Visani; group leaders D'Alema and Chiaranti; party president, Giglia Tedesco, and the reform senator, Ranieri. The job of preparing the slate of candidates is a difficult one, made even worse by the new electoral system. It is new territory, as challenging as a wager, both technically and politically because the commission has already started running while the progressive alliance has not yet left the starting gate. At party headquarters--where several deputies who are reluctant to be nominated have been summoned--they have discussed the criteria for selecting the candidates. D'Alema explained that "to win, we have to have credibility, not just in our platform but in the choice of the new political class as well. The existing people will remain in the race where they have a chance to win, otherwise they will find themselves on the proportional lists. These words signal an out and out revolution. Up until the last elections the big wigs were able to ride to victory on the coattails of the party under the protection of the proportional vote. This time they will have to work to win all on their own, and anyone who cannot make it...." It is certain that some members of the old guard will no longer be around this time. Chiarante sent a letter to Occhetto saying that he had decided that "the time had come for him to step aside. A while ago even Tortorella had said that that was his intention as well, but now I am not sure," revealed former party President Stefano Rodota, who himself is no longer willing to run: "Also because no one has asked me to." The reformist Pellicani, PDS deputy group leader in the Chamber of Deputies, is also in doubt about what to do. But in comparison with this small group of parliamentarians who want to sit this one out, we have a huge throng of PDS leaders on the national level and a host of obscure local dignitaries who want to sit in the next Parliament. The problem becomes a really difficult puzzle to solve when you consider that the new electoral system holds few hopes of success for the party's "bosses" in Lega areas and that the future alliance will call for many sacrifices. In Ravenna, the PDS will have to support the Republican La Malfa; in Umbria, it will have to find some way to say no to the Socialist Manca. And then there are the alliances with the Refoundation, the AD, the Greens, and the Rete. "We are all looking for a safe electoral college," says Rodota, "and in some cases shamelessly." Faraguti of the DC was heard saying day before yesterday in the Transatlantico [deputies' lounge]: "Why don't you try asking the deputies currently in office how upset they are? We may have Imposimato's declaration that he is in favor of a government shakeup, but there are lots of people in the PDS who do not want to give up their seat to Adornato." While they are waiting to finalize the progressive lineup, the PDS is beginning to fill in its own slots. At PDS headquarters, they anticipate sacrifices, some exclusions, and shifts. For example, Nilde Iotti, who has always run in her own region of Reggio Emilia, would be "transferred" to the majoritarian and the proportional slates in Rome. The same fate will befall Reichlin who would have to leave his own electorate in Apulia to run on the proportional slate. Instead, prominent positions have been reserved for the party bigwigs: Occhetto will be the candidate on the majoritarian list in the heart of communist Emilia and will also be "used"--as the new electoral law allows--on three proportional slates. D'Alema will go to Taranto, and Napolitano will run in Naples on the majoritarian and proportional slates. The problem will be keeping the candidacies secret. At PDS headquarters they explain: "With this system, you have to avoid giving your opponents the `advantage' of knowing your moves because they could plan their countermoves." On the left, they are moving toward an alliance. The Greens and the Rete intend to run together in the proportional. Del Turco is proposing the same thing to the PRI [Italian Republican Party], to the remains of the PSDI [Italian Socialist Democratic Party] and to the social Christians. And Bordon invites everyone to join together under the banner of the Democratic Alliance, which is looking for prominent candidates for the upcoming elections. It has a semi-commitment with television commentator Maurizio Costanzo who has asked for some time to think about it.
