Edmundo Galiza Matos reports: A very good evening, dear listeners! The peace process experienced new developments here in Maputo today. The General Peace Accord's CSC met, under the chairmanship of Aldo Ajello, special representative of the UN secretary general in Mozambique, to examine the confinement and demobilization of troops from the government and the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo]. The parties centered their discussions on delays allegedly being observed on the government side. The concern of the international community was conveyed by the respective ambassadors. Let us hear what Armando Guebuza, head of the government delegation to the CSC, had to say on the issue. [Begin recording] [Guebuza] We, the government, agree with the report presented by the president of the Cease-Fire Commission [words indistinct] delays in confining troops. The government evidently [words indistinct] made a move last week, confining more troops [words indistinct]. [Unidentified correspondent] Did the international community express any concern regarding delays [words indistinct]? [Guebuza] The international community expressed concern over the delays observed and expressed satisfaction that [words indistinct] as well as a warning of the dangers that these delays in the implementation of the accord can represent [words indistinct] can jeopardize the elections date. But, obviously the [words indistinct] the last date for elections. [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] delays [words indistinct]? [Guebuza] We shall work [words indistinct] to prolong a situation of this nature. [Correspondent] No money, no elections. This is what [words indstinct] Dhlakama said. What do you think of that? [Guebuza] I think that we have to hold elections, taking into account the reality in the country, with our limitations, with our economic and financial [words indistinct]. The country does not have sufficient money [words indistinct]. We have to work in this way. Nothing can replace the stability of the country, particularly relating to money [words indistinct] additional financial resources [words indistinct] and we have asked the international community to see whether it will carry out its promises to allow us to hold elections, without many difficulties. [Correspondent] But, in your view, this statement [words indistinct] no money, no elections, [words indistinct] Renamo will not take part in elections. What does this mean for the government? [Guebuza] It is dangerous [words indistinct]. We think that the important parties in this process should be moved by the objectives [words indistinct] respecting the freedom of men [words indistinct] and to advance to a situation of participation in economic process, without [words indistinct]. [Correspondent] [words indistinct] Renamo in elections? [Guebuza] I hope Renamo will reflect on this demand. It cannot be used as a blackmail [words indistinct] our people want money but are aware that money can [words indistinct] with the country's stability. [end recording] In turn, Renamo's Jose de Castro says his movement is not happy with delays by the government in confining troops and went so far as to propose that the international community should condemn the government for this delay. [Begin recording] [Castro] Renamo is not happy because the government has slowed, I can even say halted, the confinement of its troops. We do not know the reasons which make the government act in this way. Accordingly, we propose that there should be a declaration condemning this action, because in the past when there were no justifiable reasons to condemn Renamo [words indistinct] if it was Renamo to delay or halt the confinement of troops, the whole world would be shouting at this time. [Correspondent] This means Renamo wants the CSC to condemn the government delays? [Castro] Exactly, exactly, exactly. [Correspondent] The recent statement by Renamo President Afonso Dhlakama that without money, there will be no elections [words indistinct]? [Castro] [Words indistinct] he was very clear when he said that with or without conditions, we shall participate in elections. This means that even with the difficulties that we are facing, with regard to logistics and transforming our movement into a party, our president has already said that we shall take part in elections [words indistinct]. [Correspondent] [question indistinct]. [Castro] [Words indistinct] without money, the statement has already been made [words indistinct]. [end recording]
