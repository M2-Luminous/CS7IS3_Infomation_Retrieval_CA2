The statement said that the meeting first heard the secretary general, who reviewed the current situation in the country and the state of belligerency ignited by al-Ahmar gang in all parts of Yemen after striking the 5th Brigade in Harf Sufyan, the 3d Brigade in 'Imran, and the attack on the Ba Suhayb Camp last Wednesday [4 May]. The statement affirmed that these attacks were carried out in accordance with the war decision taken by 'Ali Abdallah Salih in order to bury the democracy, and [he] announced in his speech the war decision, which put the country in an endless disaster after having maneuvered about the convention document. The war had been paved by the series of murders and massacres of the Armed Forces of the unity, and all this means that 'Ali Abdallah Salih and his gang had looked at the unity as laying down his influence on the land of his authority by using various pawns of power. The statement said that the war carried out by al-Ahmar house usually interprets their rejection of the unity and their insistance on carrying out their separationist project. This gang miscalculated when it did not take into account that the unity had become a reality and that the unity has had its own defenders. The socialist party and all patriots and honorable people will defend the country and the unity, and continue its sacrifices to defend the homeland and its unity. The statement warns that the shelling of the civil establishments and economic corporations and villages and the killing of innocent people is a desperate attempt to justify the war and its crimes. By declaring a state of emergency, 'Ali Abdallah Salih has slain democracy and rejected all Arab and international efforts to stop bloodshed. This has been expected from 'Ali Abdallah Salih, who rejected the national consensus and the document. The statement added that the central committee declares its rejection of the state of emergency and the use of the House of Deputies to cover up the war. The central committee at the same time condemns the declaration of the war by 'Ali Abdallah Salih, and appeals to all the masses and the Armed Forces to repel this conspiracy. It praises the heroship of the Armed Forces of the unity and the masses for their resistance of the aggression. The central committee welcomed the Arab and the international calls to stop the war and continue the political and serious dialogue.
