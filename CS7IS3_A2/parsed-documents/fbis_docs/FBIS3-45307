Both sides disagreed with each other on the textile trade issue; U.S. officials brought up an old case, saying that the Chinese side had made "little improvement" on the human rights issue, which may affect the extension of most-favored-nation [MFN] status in June; and Secretary of State Christopher will meet PRC Foreign Minister Qian Qichen in Paris in late January to discuss bilateral relations. What is the development trend for Sino-U.S. relations this year? As the Clinton administration has reshuffled its leading group in foreign affairs and laid down its diplomatic foci, how will Sino-U.S. relations be affected? Clinton To Strengthen His Diplomatic Work The Clinton administration, on the whole, did not have a good showing in its diplomatic work in 1993. It suffered a series of setbacks in Somalia and Haiti; the White House appeared to be very passive faced with the chaotic political situation in Russia; and it was criticized by the domestic media for its indecision on the Bosnian issue.... The first to announce his resignation was Defense Secretary Aspin, who is going to be succeeded by Inman. Then, Talbott, who is a good friend of the president and former director of the Washington office of TIME magazine, succeeded Walton as deputy secretary of state, thus becoming the No. 2 figure in the State Department. These personnel changes show that Clinton is going to strengthen his diplomatic work in 1994. Clinton wants to straighten out the chaotic state of diplomatic work over the past year, hence, the diplomatic foci listed by the State Department are in the following order: Economic work and trade, the Middle East, Russia, nuclear proliferation, and the concept of democratic politics. Such a list is much more concrete than the three diplomatic principles (economic security, military security, and democratic security) set forth a year ago, which were ambiguous and contradictory in their implementation. Now, the Clinton administration's diplomatic policies are worked out in accordance with the medium to short-term interests of the United States, which, on the whole, conform to the traditional pattern of U.S. diplomatic strategy. People have noticed that democracy comes last in the list of diplomatic foci. Last year, U.S. diplomacy was in a state of confusion. The Clinton administration just treated symptoms but not the disease and was led by the media. Moreover, it did not differentiate what was primary from what was secondary and its strategic interests were not clearly defined. For example, it stressed the "human rights issue" too much in its policy towards China and almost stopped granting MFN to China at the expense of its national economic interests. Although the recent White House reshuffle of its leading foreign affairs group does not have a direct bearing on Sino-U.S. relations (the move was mainly concerned with its policies towards East Europe and Russia), the orientation of these adjustments and the emphasis on real strategic interests will indirectly help advance Sino-U.S. relations to a normal path, that is, its policy towards China will be evaluated and considered in accordance with the real interests of the United States. U.S. President Is Interested in China Over the last several months, many U.S. congressional delegations have visited China. Senator Johnston, chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and Congressman Gephardt, majority leader of the House of Representatives, pointed out respectively that the United States should attach importance to the China market. They called for more economic cooperation and trade between the two countries and were generally satisfied with China's performance on the human rights issue. Regarding the State Department's assertion of so-called "little improvement" by China on the human rights issue, which "may affect the extension of MFN treatment," some observers in Washington said that this was merely a counter for the Clinton administration to bargain with Beijing and a move to try to force Beijing to make concessions. Moreover, although the U.S. ambassador to China said that China had made "great improvements" in human rights, the State Department immediately said that "little improvement" had been made, because the latter thinks that as the decision on extending MFN treatment is made six months from now, it was a little too early to make such conclusive remarks on this issue. Meanwhile, according to sources in Washington, Clinton, who is inexperienced in diplomacy, is very much interested in China and frequently asks his assistants to regularly brief him on questions related to China. As far as Sino-U.S. trade relations are concerned, he is particularly optimistic. According to sources in the White House, the President believes that Beijing can persuade Pyongyang to take a mild gesture to solve the problem related to the DPRK's possible possession of nuclear weapons. The sources also said that Clinton had asked at least one of his assistants to try to reach a deeper understanding with President Jiang Zemin, and he also said he would personally handle policy on China in such a way as to treat Sino-U.S. relations as his own "special program," just as former President Bush did. The United States Is Not Politically Superior to China Diplomatic observers on Washington said: Viewed from the framework of international relations in the mid-1990's, the United States does not have the means to blockade China, and the day when Beijing and Washington are on an equal footing is about to come or has already come. People notice that such western powers as Germany, Japan, and France have vigorously developed trade relations with China and are looking forward to entering the huge China market. However, as far as the international political situation is concerned, the development of the political situation in Russia is really a very great worry to the United States and the Clinton administration, and the U.S. public are anxious about the changes there over the past six months. Under such international circumstances, Washington is not ready to antagonize China in the diplomatic arena. Hence, a Chinese scholar said: Compared with Washington, Beijing now has greater superiority in the international political arena. Facts have proved that the means employed by the United States against China, such as siege, intimidation, and discrediting China, have been ineffective. In 1994, for the sake of the United States' own interests, the Clinton administration cannot but reciprocate toward China, and such a situation is quite evident.
