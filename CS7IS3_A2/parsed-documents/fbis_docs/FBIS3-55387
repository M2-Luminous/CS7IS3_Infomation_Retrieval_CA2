The essence is the same, however. The economics professors who gathered in Boston from the country's leading universities gave President Bill Clinton a solid "B." For his first year of administration, especially in the sphere of the economy, the young President gets a "four plus" as though there were no minus point. But the positive notes would have been even stronger if it had not been for what one professor called "the green light for President Yeltsin's vacillations." The economics professors call the U.S. Administration's new approach to the rate of economic transformations in Russia following the parliamentary elections "indulging Yeltsin." Both advocates of more confident state intervention in economic regulation (the Massachusetts school) and Harvard adherents of profound market freedom believe that any delay in switching from the state plan to the market will lead only to additional difficulties for people, and will still further compromise the ideas of democracy. Believing that during his recent visit to Moscow, Vice President Al Gore sent the Russian leadership the wrong signal, Professor Dornbusch called his visit a "complete and utter disaster." But speaking at the same meeting of professors, Lawrence Summers, under secretary of the Treasury, denied that the administration approves of a "gradual approach" in Russia. He simply said that President Yeltsin is having to deal with social and economic difficulties whereby privatization and measures to switch to the market may be sabotaged by the political opposition. However, international notes were muffled at this meeting. The domestic economy dominated. "The administration's actions have not only proved surprisingly fruitful, they have also been very sensible," R. Dornbusch, the famous academic from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told the worthy members of the U.S. Economic Association. This high assessment by a representative of this institute is not very surprising. From his first days, Clinton began to look to people and ideas from this famous educational establishment. The studies of scientists from Massachusetts have been reflected in many of the White House's economic measures -- from the national program for the retraining of workers to the plan for the radical reform of health care. Naturally, with the advent of this administration, the trend which held absolute sway in the Reagan-Bush years has been squeezed out. This trend is exemplified by the venerable Harvard University, many of whose researchers, incidentally, came to advise the Russian Government during President George Bush's term and are still here. Probably no one objected to the assessment of the administration given by Lawrence Klein, the most senior professor of economics at Pennsylvania University and a Nobel prize winner. He did not intervene in the debate with figures and formulas but commented on Clinton's first period as follows: "An excellent spring semester." But there were arguments about figures. They mainly concerned the permissible unemployment level. And the reduction of the defense structure is proceeding by no means painlessly in the United States. According to Professor Alan Blinder, the country's economy will feel quite comfortable with unemployment at less than 5.5 percent. However, this level remains only a goal, since in November unemployment in the country was at 6.4 percent, and critics maintain that the trigger mechanism of inflation starts to operate beyond the limit of 6.1 percent unemployment.
