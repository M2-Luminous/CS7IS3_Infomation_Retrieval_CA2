The COA had originally allocated only NT44 billion (U.S.$148 million) for the fund. All farmers will be eligible for the subsidies. The original draft had stipulated that only farmers who produce certain items -- citrus fruit, apples, plums, peaches, tea, beef, duck, pork, and shrimp -- would be elibgible for the subsidiy. A COA offical said that if the prices of agricultural products fall due to an influx of foreign products after Taiwan joins GATT, the COA will evaluate whether Taiwan farmers are being adversely affected, and subsidize them accordingly if they are.
