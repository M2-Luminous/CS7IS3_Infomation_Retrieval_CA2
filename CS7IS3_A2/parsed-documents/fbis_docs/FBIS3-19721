The program is designed to retrieve as much as possible of the funds spent on space research by promoting projects with realistic economic prospects. Sheryl Riggins has more. [Riggins] Finland's leading space researchers were out in force on Monday [21 March] for the publication of the new space research program. Finland does not plan to spend money on just any project under the illustrious heading space, and Finns are not seeking a spot for a Finnish astronaut on spaceflights. Instead Finnish space research will be focusing on down-to-earth projects with realistic applications. Finnish scientists will be concentrating on three main areas -- telecommunication satellites, remote mapping, and basic space research. Finland already has extensive background in precisely these areas of study. Remote mapping is a field of particular interest, because it can bring significant economic rewards some time in the future. Remote mapping is used, for instance, in exploration for mineral deposits, charting timber reserves, predicting the weather, and providing navigational assistance to ships -- all of which are sellable services. The new national space research strategy comes on the eve of Finland's entry into the European Space Agency, ESA. Joining the club [as heard] will cost about 100 million marks a year. The Finnish space researchers believe that at least that much can be earned in industrial orders.
