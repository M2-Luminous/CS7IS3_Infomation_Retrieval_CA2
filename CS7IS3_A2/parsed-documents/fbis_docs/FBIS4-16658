"This is a large book," Lev Gushchin, the chief editor, stressed, "with over 400 pages and 100 color photographs. It is written in the form of the president's personal diary and covers the events from the dramatic August of 1991 to the tragic October of 1993. Descriptions of the events are interspersed in the book with Boris Nikolayevich's reflections on the paths of Russia's development and transformation, portraits of political figures and those people with whose lives the country's destiny became interlinked at that difficult period." "It would be no mistake," Lev Gushchin noted, "to say that the many facts and assessments contained in the book are really sensational and that many of the riddles and mysteries of recent years are logically answered here. But to be frank it is the tone the `Notes' which is most impressive. This is perhaps the first time that we have encountered a text which is so personal, candid, and at times merciless toward the author and others, a text penned by a member of the country's top leadership."
