President Mugabe was addressing the Zimbabweans at Zimbabwe's High Commission in Gaborone last night. He told them that his government does not see them as traitors for leaving Zimbabwe for Botswana, but expressed the hope that when they ultimately return home they will be able to take with them their experiences to develop Zimbabwe. He also briefed his audience on a wide range of issues, ranging from his state visit to Botswana to the economic situation in Zimbabwe under the structural adjustment program which ends next year. He said his visit to Botswana is in the spirit of cooperation between the two countries to strengthen bilateral relations and increase the volume of trade between them. President Mugabe assured the meeting that the structural adjustment program was yielding better benefits for the country, adding that more investors are now coming into the country as a result of the program. President Mugabe will address a press conference at the Sir Seretse Khama Airport shortly before leaving for home.
