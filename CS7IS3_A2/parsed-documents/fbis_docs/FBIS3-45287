Liu Fangren pointed out that the province at present should devote great efforts to the following aspects with regard to united front work: 1. It is necessary to uphold and perfect the multi-party cooperation and political consultation system under the CPC's leadership, and to do a really good job in fostering, selecting, appointing, and employing non-CPC personalities. Party committees, governments, and organs concerned at all levels must wholeheartedly and effectively serve democratic parties and other non-CPC personalities in all circles and help them solve actual problems. 2. It is necessary to work really hard to win the support of representative personalities of the nonpublic economic sector, with a view to promoting the development of the non-state-owned economy in the province. 3. It is necessary to attach great importance to nationality and religious affairs. Party committees and governments at all levels must take the initiative in selecting, fostering, and employing cadres from minority nationalities in accordance with the guideline laid down in the documents concerned issued by the central authorities. To do a good job in handling religious affairs, all localities must comprehensively implement the party's policy toward religions and should do a better job in safeguarding normal religious activities. At the same time, all localities must make greater efforts to do a still better job in united front work abroad, to extend the united front, to unite with the vast number of Taiwan compatriots, Hong Kong and Macao compatriots, and overseas Chinese, thus contributing to the economic development of the province. In his speech, Liu Fangren demanded that party committees at all levels strengthen leadership over united front work, really attach great importance to united front work, and place it on important agenda, thus making greater contributions to the economic prosperity of the province.
