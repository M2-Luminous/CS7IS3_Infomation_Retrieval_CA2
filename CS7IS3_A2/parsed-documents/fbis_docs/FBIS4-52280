Advancers more than doubled retreaters, 528 to 241, with 175 hitting the daily permissible ceiling as 40 million shares changed hands, the most active trading in a month. Amid a hectic tug-of-war between selling and buying, the composite index lost 1.71 points to finish at 917.55 Tuesday. Issues of Hyundai affiliates attracted investment on expectations of a reconciliation between the business giant and the government after the group's honorary chairman, Chong Chu-yong, announced his retirement from active business management. The index started Wednesday with a gain of 10 points during the morning session based on high hopes for improved market supply and demand, but profit-taking and anxiety put a brake on the bull run.
