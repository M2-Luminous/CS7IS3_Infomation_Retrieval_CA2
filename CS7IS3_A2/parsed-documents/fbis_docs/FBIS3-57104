In particular, the Security Committee has no premises or telephone number, its Chairman Viktor Ilyukhin told Interfax. The Legislation Committee has to draft a plan of legislative activities for the Duma and will have no recess. Vladimir Isakov, its chairman, told Interfax Monday that the State Duma deputies had significantly amended the plan that had been submitted by the legislative commission of the president's office and the two plans had to be reconciled. The Information Politics and Communication Committee chaired by Mikhail Poltoranin has to report on the state-controlled mass media, in particular television coverage of parliament activities. Numerous deputies, notably the liberal democratic group, think that the Parliamentary Hour TV program has to be resumed under the title of The Federal Assembly Hour. Poltoranin himself believes that the equal representation of all branches of authorities can be achieved by a law now being drafted by the legislative commission of the president's office.
