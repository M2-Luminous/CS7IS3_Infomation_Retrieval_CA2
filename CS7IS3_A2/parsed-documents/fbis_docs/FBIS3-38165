On the second day of his visit to western Thrace, Baykal visited Mufti Mehmet Emir Aga in his home. Fanatic Greeks demonstrated when the bus carrying Baykal, his delegation, and journalists arrived in Xanthi. While Baykal was replying to questions by Greek journalists, the demonstrators attacked Ahmet Faikoglu. Greek police manhandled the Turkish journalists who were trying to capture these incidents on film. Some of the journalists were stranded in Faikoglu's office. The demonstrators then threw stones at the bus carrying the delegation. Speaking at the Turkish Union in Xanthi, Deniz Baykal said: The stones hurled at the bus show the oppression to which the Turkish identity that we want to keep alive is subjected. In an earlier speech in the village of Gokceler, Baykal pointed out that if the western Thrace Turks are approached with a new understanding, they could constitute a bridge between Turkey and Greece. He noted that it is not customary for Turkish politicians to show an interest in or support western Thrace, adding: For some reason, we have always refrained from talking about western Thrace. Turkish politicians think that if they show an interest in western Thrace they might hurt our friendship with Greece. We must overcome this. We want to be friends with Greece. We will be friends with Greece but not at the cost of the Turkish identity, faith, and language of the 150,000 people living here.
