Kuncze named the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] as his party's strongest opponent at the elections. In his view, it has not yet been decided which tendency will become dominant in the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] after the elections. [Zsoldos] After the MDF's national meeting and the MSZP's congress, what are your views on the SZDSZ's possibilities for making a coalition after the elections? [Kuncze] We continue to maintain that this depends on the possibility to reconcile the programs, and this question can only be answered after the election results are known. [Zsoldos] In the past, you said that an increasing number of tendencies exist in the MDF and you do not know which one will become the dominant one. Do you still hold the same view? [Kuncze] It has not been possible to clarify our views on the MDF because we still do not know their program. On the basis of the ideas raised at the MDF's national meeting, it seems that, on the level of rhetoric, they are beginning to echo the proposals that the SZDSZ has long been representing in its amendment proposals. [Zsoldos] Does this mean that, even after the election of Peter Boross as prime minister, it is still impossible precisely to determine the MDF's political line? [Kuncze] I still see the coexistence of many tendencies in the MDF and it is impossible to know what weight they will have in the new parliament after May. [Zsoldos] Which party does the SZDSZ see as its main election opponent? [Kuncze] The MSZP, on the basis of the public opinion polls. [Zsoldos] With the approach of the elections, what are the most dangerous phenomena in your view? [Kuncze] As the official campaign period has not yet begun, I cannot give a clear answer to this. On one hand, I am afraid of the quite conceivable possibility that the forces that refer to the past 40 years will have too much presence in the MSZP's campaign. On the other hand, it can already be seen that the MDF has launched a success propaganda that does not reflect the real conditions. This is dangerous for the public opinion because it is misleading, and it is also dangerous for the MDF because it defines its program and its tasks for after the elections starting from an unrealistic situation. [Zsoldos] The MDF's popularity increased after the election of Boross as prime minister. To what do you attribute this? [Kuncze] According to the latest opinion polls, the temporary increase of the MDF's popularity has stopped. Boross, who has indeed been using a very clever rhetoric since his eleciton has not actually implemented any real changes in governing. The press is still loud with corruption cases in privatization. The fact that the government has replaced some of its members does not alter the fact that the institutional system that facilitates corruption is unchanged. Boross has also refused to make changes in the leadership of the television and radio although these can fundamentally influence the purity of the elections. Boross has been trying very hard to appear in an attractive manner for the public and draw the MDF with himself, nevertheless, the mistakes of the past four years will be a burden on the next governmental cycle. People draw the conclusions on the past four years on the basis of the contents of their wallets rather than on the basis of success propaganda.
