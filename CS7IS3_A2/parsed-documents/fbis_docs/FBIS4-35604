Having attended the "Bahir 94" live ammunition maneuvers conducted by an armored formation of the 2d Field Army today, the defense minister said: We are not developing our armed forces to antagonize anybody, because we are at peace with all our neighbors. He pointed out that the goal of this modernization is to ensure the preparedness of our armed forces for accomplishing their task of defending national security. Field Marshal Tantawi said: Our only task in peacetime is to train our armed forces cadres to ensure their optimal combat efficiency. The more peace is established, the better training can be at all levels. We seek to achieve balance between the human element and armaments to enable individuals to use modern and sophisticated weapons, Tantawi said. He added that the numbers of combat elements in the armed forces are currently being increased against those working in the service or administrative sectors. He affirmed that the numbers of the armed forces will not be decreased, emphasizing: We seek to achieve the optimal use of available manpower. The defense minister pointed out that there are no plans to cut the term of military service for new recruits, noting that the armed forces recruit the number of individuals they need. He explained that the surplus recruits are absorbed into the national service apparatus, which seeks to achieve self-sufficiency for the armed forces. Field Marshal Tantawi said that the armed forces have an excellent mobilization plan that ensures shifting from a condition of peace to one of war in record time. The defense minister called for paying more attention to military training, noting that sophisticated armaments need first-rate training. We have to stretch the shelf-life of old weapons. We have to enhance their efficiency and upgrade them to the level of modern weapons, he said. He stressed that commanders and officers of different ranks should be given the opportunity to make decisions to cope with developments in order to develop their sense of initiative and creativity. Tantawi called for enhancing the combat efficiency and preparedness of the armed forces and for raising fighters' morale through constant training, discipline, and physical fitness. The military drill incorporated armored formations from the 2d Field Army with elements from the Air Force, Air Defense, and Electronic and Chemical War and units from the engineering and airborne divisions. In the drill, our troops checked a hostile offensive action and forced the attacking forces to retreat to the international borders, inflicting heavy losses on them. The exercise began with reconnaissance sorties in which our troops gathered information on the condition of the hostile forces. In the meantime, our forces destroyed hostile aircraft that tried to reconnoiter our positions. The (Shilka) and Chaparral antiaircraft missiles were used in the exercise. This is the first time the firing process has been conducted from training aircraft outside the air defense firing range. The shooting was conducted under conditions identical to those prevailing in a real war. The antiaircraft ballistic units dealt with the enemy's armored units to destroy them and secure our forces' lines. Our artillery bombarded the enemy artillery and silenced their sources. Our aircraft attacked the depth of the enemy defenses to destroy its artillery and armored pieces. Our artillery units prepared for the advance of the bulk of our troops by constant bombardment and smoke screens. Combat units opened gaps in the enemy's mine fields, using the Egyptian-made al-Fatih missiles, which proved their high efficiency during the Gulf war. Our troops then advanced into the depth of the enemy's lines, while our air defenses were checking attacks by the enemy's air force using the (Shilka) missiles, characterized by the ability to deal with air targets while moving. Our artillery succeeded in silencing the enemy's reserve artillery deep in the lines by firing long distance. It also succeeded in destroying the enemy's armored vehicles, using highly-explosive ammunition with the help of antitank helicopters. MI-8 helicopters were meanwhile landing paratroopers behind the enemy's artillery lines to create a gap in its defenses. A Buffalo aircraft loaded with antitank weapons landed on the battlefield to replenish our troops' supply of ammunition. Our troops finally managed to control the territory that was seized by the enemy, forcing its troops to retreat. [passage omitted]
