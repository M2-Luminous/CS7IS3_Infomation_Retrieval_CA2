This is despite the fact that the SPLA considers self-determination a firm strategic position that it will discuss with the Sudanese Government under the sponsorship of the IFAD [International Fund for Agricultural Development] states. Are you concerned over the NDG's failure to reach a unified stand on the principle of self-determination? [Garang] All the constitutional documents endorsed by the NDG, the last of which was the Nairobi declaration, include the right of the south and the neglected areas to self-determination. In light of this, the failure to reach an agreement on a meeting to reformulate what has previously been accepted is a political setback that cannot be understood. The right to self-determination is a basic component of democracy and human rights. Therefore, if the NDG denies this right of the people of the south and the neglected area, the parties to the NDG will be placed on an equal footing with the party oppressing the people in the south and their ethnic and religious sects. I believe that the basic issue that must be discussed is not just the right to self-determination, but also the objective circumstances that forced broad sectors of the Sudanese people to demand the right to self-determination. The scheduled meeting of the NDG will not discuss the right to self-determination, but will reach agreement on the best way to topple the Sudanese regime and to reach an understanding on running the country in the stage that will follow the downfall of the regime. In the past, I proposed Harare as a possible venue for the NDG meeting. Cairo was also mentioned as a possible venue. The meeting will be held when the appropriate circumstances become available. [passage omitted] [Zayn] If the NDG fails to adopt a position supporting the right to self-determination, which the SPLA views as a basic point in its negotiating strategy, what will be the fate of the alliance? [Garang] The NDG parties cannot reject the principle of self-determination after they have already accepted it as an article in constitutional documents worked out by the alliance. I think that the collapse of the current regime in Khartoum will lead to a stage where there will be no need to call for self-determination when the reasons that led to these calls are removed. But if the call for self-determination continues after the collapse of the current regime, it will mean that the successor regime has also failed to offer a final solution to the problems in Sudan. [passage omitted] [Zayn] If certain influential northern voices within the alliance continue to reject the right to self-determination despite their previous acceptance and their commitment to the constitutional documents that contain this principle, and if the SPLA -- with its two wings -- continues to adhere to the right to self-determination for the south and the neglected areas, will the NDG remain a viable alliance framework between the SPLA and the northern parties, despite this dilemma that is threatening its existence? What form of relations link you to your allies in the northern parties? [Garang] Our alliance is, in the first place, with the Sudanese people, and these relations are based on joint efforts to topple the current regime. If this objective is not realized, stability and peace in the region around Sudan will be in question. The current regime wants to incite instability and political confusion, and wants to strike at the peaceful coexistence in eastern Africa and the Middle East. [passage omitted]
