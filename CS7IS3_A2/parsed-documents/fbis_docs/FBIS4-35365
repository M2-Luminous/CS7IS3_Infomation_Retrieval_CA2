We have informed the party to which they belong about this. He emphasized again that the security forces will pursue anyone who kidnaps or harasses any citizen or who tampers with the security of the citizens. There is only one Authority in the Gaza Strip, and this Authority has been entrusted with safeguarding the security of the citizens and punishing those who violate the law. Asked whether an ultimatum has been given to these parties, he explained that the responsible party has been officially requested to hand over those who carried out the killing, and we will pursue the murderers. It would be important to us and to them if they hand over the murderers, he said. [passage omitted]
