The front-running candidate for the office is former Venezuelan oil minister Alirio Parra, said to have the support of most of the 12 member countries of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). But Iran has proposed its current ambassador in Tokyo, Hoseyn Kazempur-Ardabili, a veteran OPEC delegate. Iran's oil minister, Gholam Reza Aqazadeh-Kho'i, made it clear Wednesday he was maintaining Kazempor's candidacy, blocking a consensus in favour of Parra, and told reporters early Thursday he had "not changed" his position. According to OPEC's statutes, the organization's top executive officer is appointed by unanimous decision of the OPEC conference for a period of three years that can be renewed only once. Subroto, aged 66, a veteran Indonesian official who served for 10 years as Indonesia's mining and energy minister until he was named head of the OPEC secretariat in 1988, will be completing his second term by the end of June. Some delegations were said to favour extending his appointment for six months as an interim solution, to give OPEC members time to sort out the problem by the time of their year-end conference scheduled to open here on November 16. Another provisional solution mooted would provide for the current OPEC President, Libya's Oil Minister 'Abdallah Salim al-Badri to "supervise" the operations of the Vienna-based secretariat in cooperation with OPEC's Iraqi Deputy Secretary General, Ramzi Salman. However, Kuwait made it clear at one point Thursday it would suspend any relations with OPEC if day-to-day operations at OPEC headquarters were left in the hands of an Iraqi national. Conference sources meanwhile claimed Aqazadeh had been rebuffed by key members, including Saudi Arabia, when reportedly seeking guarantees that an Iranian would be appointed three years from now if Iran withdrew its present candidate to make way for Parra. Under the statutes, the secretary general may be picked "on a rotational basis" for a two-year term, if a unanimous decision cannot be obtained. This happened frequently in the late 1970s and early 1980s, but then resulted in a stalemate because of the Iran- Iraq war. When Marc Nan Nguema of Gabon left office in mid-1983, an Iranian was next in line, but his appointment was blocked by Iraq and its Arab neighbours. As a consequence, then Deputy Secretary General Fadhil al- Chalabi, who happened to be an Iraqi, was left in charge of the secretariat until Subroto's appointment in June, 1988. The choice of a new OPEC chief executive officer was the final point on the agenda of the ministers' mid-year meeting which opened here Wednesday. They cleared their main business late Wednesday by agreeing to leave OPEC's overall oil production ceiling unchanged to year-end and to avoid any ministerial meetings before the next regular conference set for November 16. The ministers reckon that this will encourage the recent uptrend in oil prices, since demand is expected to firm up towards the end of the year as economic recovery gains ground in industrial nations. "Doing nothing may sometimes do the trick," a delegate commented. Oil futures soared in New York after the ministers' decision late Wednesday, hitting a 12-month high of 19.86 dollars a barrel for the American benchmark light crude, WTI. But analysts here said this was mainly due to factors which had no bearing on the outcome of the OPEC talks. In London, North Sea Brent prices at two months broke up through the 17-dollar mark early Thursday afternoon, as crude for August delivery briefly reached 17.04 dollars a barrel before stabilizing at 17.02, compared with 16.94 dollars at the Wednesday close.
