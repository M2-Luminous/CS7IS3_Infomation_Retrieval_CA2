This event is of great significance to promoting the development of the socialist market economy, forming a matching legal system, establishing a modern enterprise system, and standardizing the microbasis of the market economy. The Corporate Law is an important law for standardizing the main body of the market economy. Its functions include standardizing corporate organization and behavior, protecting the legitimate rights and interests of companies, shareholders, and creditors, and maintaining social and economic order. It cultivates, in a legal form, the main body of the market that caters to the needs of large- scale socialized production and the market economy and improves the system of legal entities in China. This is a foundational project for the establishment of the socialist market economy that integrates the economic structural reform with the building of an economic legal system, activates and protects economic reform with economic legislation, and standardizes and codifies the measures of enterprise reform and the achievements of the reform. The making of the Corporate Law embodies the principle set by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee that calls for close integration of reform decisions and legislative decisions. The Corporate Law has been brought forth in pace with the needs of the enterprise reform. It not only is a result of the effort to sum up experiences and consolidate what has been achieved, but also promotes and protects enterprise reform by wielding legal authority, so that this reform may make steady, yet vigorous progress on the broad road paved by the law. The establishment of a modern enterprise system is a natural requirement of the development of large-scale socialized production and market economy. It points to the direction of the reform of China's state-owned enterprises. A company is an important, typical form of modern enterprise and is a product of the development of large-scale socialized production and market economy. Company, a form of enterprise organization standardized by law, can effectively separate corporate equity from ownership of promoters. In a company, the relationship between operational power and ownership is well-defined, the organizational and management system is scientific and rational, rights and responsibilities are clearly demarcated, various parties to the company check on each other, and risks are distributed in a way that is also conducive to fund-raising. It not only effectively protects the rights and interests of the owner, but also gives full decisionmaking power to the operator. Enterprise management and capital are separated from government administration, which is made possible by the relationship between the operational power and the ownership and the mode of property organization, so that the state is freed from its unlimited liability for enterprises. These legal principles embodied in the Corporate Law are the very basic requirements of a modern enterprise system. The making of the Corporate Law is in keeping with the demand on the establishment of a modern enterprise system and has a positive role to play in renewing the enterprise system with concentrated efforts and in further emancipating and developing the productive forces. A company is built on the basis of concentration of capital. This determines the following important features that are inherent in a company: One, a company is set up in a responsibility form, not in accordance with ownership or administrative jurisdiction: and two, the concept of company connotes diversified economic sectors and investments from a variety of sources, as the corporate form can be used by owners of different natures. The relevant provisions in the Corporate Law are based on China's national conditions and were made by drawing upon and assimilating useful experience of other countries in corporate legislation while close attention is given to practical experience and the needs of development. As to the specific corporate form, two major forms, namely, the limited liability company and the joint-stock company with limited liability, are prevalent and found in large quantities in China. The Corporate Law gives due regard to the characteristics of our country and contains separate provisions on solely state-owned ones among limited liability companies, which are designed to meet the needs arising from the reorganization of state-owned enterprises into companies. Such stipulations conform to China's national conditions and indicate a dynamic, yet cautious effort. Making the Corporate Law means establishing a standardized corporate system in accordance with the requirements of the modern enterprise system. The corporate system is a common asset of mankind, but for it to play a truly positive role as a scientific form of enterprise organization, we must adhere to standardization and the legal premises and requirements for incorporation or reorganization of companies. Incorporation of companies and reorganization of enterprises into companies can go ahead only when the required conditions are ready; otherwise, incorporation or forced reorganization is not allowed. To ensure its correct enforcement, the Corporate Law contains the special chapter "Legal Responsibility" which stipulates that violators of this law will be called to account. Existing companies must be screened also in accordance with the provisions of the Corporate Law. The procedures and specific methods to follow in implementation are governed by the State Council's stipulation. The enforcement of the Corporate Law as well as the establishment of the modern enterprise system is an arduous and complex job. It requires meticulous organization, close cooperation among related departments, and concerted efforts in the renewal of China's enterprise system, so as to help promote the development of the socialist market economy.
