Watanabe, 70, conveyed his decision in a third meeting with LDP President Yohei Kono, who has himself vowed to run in a Diet election to select a successor to Hosokawa, 56. Hosokawa announced his resignation on April 8 over a financial scandal and a Diet stalemate. Watanabe made the decision against a backdrop of ruling coalition partners coming close to agreeing on key policies such as national security and tax system rehabilitation, and picking Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, head of the alliance's core party Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) as its candidate for prime minister, political sources said. Watanabe's change of heart over quitting the LDP paved the way for the party to field Kono as its official candidate for the premiership election, party sources said. Kono met with Watanabe on Friday and Monday hoping to persuade him not to run in the premiership race to keep party unity but the efforts proved fruitless then. Watanabe, an LDP veteran who has held various ministerial posts under LDP governments, declared Sunday he will quit the party to be a candidate for the election, saying a cabinet capable of rescuing the country from the current difficult situation should be formed. As a crack grew among coalition parties over the process of picking a successor to Hosokawa, Shinseito and Komeito, the coalition's other key party, briefly considered Watanabe to be new leader of a post-Hosokawa coalition. The LDP's 38-year-long grip on power ended last summer as seven parties ranging from socialists to conservatives formed the current coalition following the July general elections, in which the LDP failed to retain a majority. Watanabe told reporters after the face-to-face meeting with Kono that he will not help the coalition and will remain in the LDP to promote reform. Watanabe also said that he will vote for Kono in the prime ministerial election in the Diet. LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori, meanwhile, told reporters that Watanabe decided not to leave but to remain in the party because the coalition has not yet forged agreement on crucial policies such as national security and its stand on North Korea's suspected nuclear arms development project. Diet balloting for a new prime minister is likely to take place on Thursday [21 April] or after, parliamentary sources said.
