There Is a Clear Sky Over Moscow -- for the Time Being...."] [Text] The Dniester area is a corner of paradise. Thirty-degree heat, freshened by the wind from the Dniester. Early cherries and strawberries, masses of cucumbers, tomatoes and all sorts of vegetables, at prices that are absurd by Russian standards. The beautiful girls in short skirts attract the gaze of the men around them like a magnet. Peace The war seems to be a thing of the past. Only the gravestones in the cemeteries in Bendery and Dubossary and the modest graves right on the streets remind us of what happened here in 1992. Then, at the time of the "summer military campaign," as officials say, they laid to rest for eternity over 600 young men, and 4,000 Dniester area inhabitants were maimed and wounded. Since the war, begun exactly a day after the decision of the Moldavian [Moldovan] Parliament on peaceful settlement of the territorial conflict with the Dniester area, the PMR [Dniester Moldavian Republic] residents have no very warm feelings toward the Mircea Snegur country. The independence in hand, won with Kalashnikov, is sacred. An independence so far unrecognized by the world community. The possibility of the renewal of military conflict, despite the negotiations which have been going on with Moldavia [Moldova], with Russia as mediator, for almost two years now, is not ruled out. Moldavia is suddenly strengthening its Armed Forces. The PMR is hurriedly forming its power structures. The number of armed military men, special forces and state security workers in Tiraspol is not a happy sight for a peaceful person. According to our rough estimates -- we simply could get no official information on this score -- the Dniester power structures number close to 8,000-10,000 people, for a total PMR population of 700,000. If one adds to this the 14th Russian Army, stationed in Tiraspol, which by our calculations constitutes anywhere from 12,000-13,000 persons, the armed readiness of the region can easily take first place over other similar spots. The point, however, is not so much in the actual number of people in camouflage. During the war, 15,000 barrels -- from pistols to grenade launchers -- were seized from the 14th Russian Army. Commander Aleksandr Lebed, on one side, and the Dniester state authorities, on the other, signed an "Act of Seizure." The fate of most of the weapons is unknown. Meanwhile, the "material" existence of the ordinary, so to speak, peaceful inhabitants of the Dniester Republic does not evoke pleasant emotions: most of them receive below the subsistence level. The average wage is somewhere around 120,000 "dniestrofiki," in the official version bearing the name "suvoriki" (stamps with a picture of Aleksandr Suvorov are glued on the old Soviet money). One of our Russian rubles equals 6-6.5 Dniester ones. Poverty particularly graces the pensioners, who have a pension with a maximum of 80,000 "suvoriki," with the average subsistence minimum being 150,000. People with the physical and mental potentials, and moreover -- links with the criminal world (which, incidentally, long ago divided the Dniester land into spheres of influence) engage either in so-called commerce, or in general in things that have little to do with the law. Homicides, theft, rackets, kidnapping people with a view to ransoming them to the PMR -- are the order of the day. In this situation too, over a period of actually one-and-a-half years in the Dniester area, a conflict has been flaring up, so far, thank God, on a verbal level, between the leaders of the 14th Army and the headquarters of the Tiraspol Garrison on the one hand, and the local state authorities on the other. This is a conflict which at present has a good chance of turning into armed confrontation. Ministers with Double Last Names The internal enemies of the local authorities are Lt Gen Aleksandr Lebed, 14th Army commander, and Col Mikhail Bergman, Tiraspol commander. The leaders of the state authorities in opposition are Vadim Shevtsov, chairman of the State Security Committee, and President Igor Smirnov. In that precise order. Other representatives of the "opposing sides" naturally take part in the verbal "Mord-bashing." The interrelations between them are so emotional that they are far from parliamentary formulations. There are thousands of people who are for both of them, though. The Dniester citizens. Since almost the entire staff of the 14th Army and the Tiraspol Military Headquarters are local residents. Despite the two years that have passed since the war, Tiraspol resembles a typically post-front city, with signs that anarchy holds sway, an anarchy based on physical-firing power. With a mass information media very clearly marked official, whose methods openly resemble the "bright" repressive-stagnant years. It is no trouble to pick up the lies, whatever the topic. Lt Gen Lebed and Col Bergman can get a whole program out of them. The former -- in the most modest expressions, on the strength, apparently, of his special status, and the latter -- a whole string of them. The Armenian newspaper SYN OTECHESTVA and the television program "AsKET," reciprocate their feelings. The court regularly hears suits brought by local leaders against Mikhail Bergman -- in defense of honor and worthiness or for slander. For some reason, though, not once has the colonel, who is not loved by the authorities, been punished. In the opinion of the Dniester authorities, Bergman is the man who provides the sound for Lebed. The main arguments for public accusation of the colonel: he has "outlived" two army commanders, has a summer home and rose too quickly to the rank of colonel. De facto --that is all. Meanwhile, the accusations coming from the mouths of the leaders of the Russian units are much more interesting. Moreover, this is not a game of cat and mouse. It is large-scale. Out in the open. "Do you know, where you have landed?" Bergman says to us. "The mafia rules in the Dniester area. There are a few people in the government who have been convicted. Aleksandr Saydakov, minister of Local Industry, has two counts, including one for motor vehicle theft. Vladimir Yemelyanov, chairman of the United Strike Committee, was convicted of illicit trading in state plates. The chairman of the State Security Committee, now Maj Gen Vadim Shevtsov (real last name Antyufeyev), is sought by Baltic authorities for "gay" affairs when he was working in agencies in Riga. There are many persons in the government who do not go by their real last names -- in addition to Shevtsov, that same Matveyev, the former Goncharenko, who served with Antyufeyev in Riga. There are former KGB and GRU workers -- a lot of them. Gudymo, the present minister of State Security, is on pension from organs of the KGB. President Smirnov is a puppet, a habitual drunkard. Moreover, a weak-willed one. Shevtsov has all the authority, and he tramples the people under him: he makes compromises with many people. For example, Smirnov's son, a State Security captain, drives around in a car worth $48,000. The godfather of the local mafia also gets around the same way. Everyone knows about this, you realize, ours is a small town...." The facts about Bergman have really turned out to be common knowledge. Vadim Shevtsov, in a private interview with us, stated that he had not just one, but five last names: "I was an operations worker." The change in last name "is fully natural, after all, I am in hiding." As for the mafia in the government: "Bergman is a sick man." The convictions of the ministers -- well, there were some. "But after all, you can't begin life from scratch." Are there any former members of the special organs from Moscow among the republic's leaders? "You understand, after all, people want to protect the Dniester area." The more information we learned about the "state leaders" of the Dniester area, the "warmer" our feelings grew. Valeriy Litskay, the present minister of Foreign Relations, even in 1983, gave a signed statement to the Moldavian organs of the KGB on cooperation, having become an agent using the nickname Oleg. The minister of Foreign Affairs, as he calls himself, took this historic action on the basis of the fact that he "as a patriot of our Motherland, expresses his desire to cooperate with the organs of state security in the matter of ensuring the interests of the Soviet Union" (quotation from a statement to the KGB). The personal file of another local leader -- Bolshakov, known in the organs of the KGB by the nickname of Agent Berzin, personally sent by Mikhail Bergman to the Dniester ministry of State Security, was suddenly lost in the course of a week, a fact which V. Luchik, procurator general of the PMR, sorrowfully announced. Modest Crime? Right at the time of the war, the PMR president issued some very curious documents. On the seventh day of the war, 25 June 1992, a presidential edict was issued "On Setting Up Republic Administration of Foreign Economic Activity." Implementation of the foreign economic activity of the Dniester region was handed over to... a limited liability company, "Tri Plyus Ko ltd," of the Ukrainian Republic. On the basis of which a Tiraspol branch of republic administration for the above-named problems was to be set up. Where did this currency favor to a Ukrainian firm come from? Another document, of the postwar days, is no less attractive: the "Act of Counter-Checking the Dispatch of Railcars from the Rybnitsa Station by the Kvant Cooperative on 12 December 1992." Some 307 cars of metal, steel and wire rods, addressed to Kvant, arrived from the Cherepovets Metallurgical Plant. According to the waybills. The goods were remolded by the cooperative into a very cheap finished product called "arch modules" and were immediately dispatched to the CIS countries and Bulgaria. A very simple scheme for illegal sale of valuable metal. Meanwhile, the power structures of the Dniester area are being hit with very significant mix-ups. Of 46 criminal investigators, 32 experienced officers "left." A whole company of regular officers left the Dniester Special Service Battalion. The other day, there was a rebellion in the Dniester, as they say in Tiraspol. The reason was quite unique: a few days back, the special service men had seized a group of one of the representatives of the local mafia, Stas, who was literally released there and then. For reasons incomprehensible to the surrounding masses. The rebels were quickly sorted out, and the battalion commander was immediately replaced. The departure of the local workers of the power structures for Bergman's headquarters is easily explained by the "perpetrators of the celebration," themselves: revealing the crime of homicide is actually tantamount to revealing the crime of stealing chickens. Vadim Shevtsov smiles: "It is a pity I don't have the documents on some of the workers right now. You should take a look. The reason for the departure: at headquarters they pay, after all, in Russian rubles, almost twice as much as we do..." The report of the Tiraspol GUVD, which we obtained from President Igor Smirnov, is astounding: a modest amount of crime and a 50-70 percent disclosure rate. In the words of Mikhail Bergman and the officers retiring from criminal investigation, the secret is simple. In the first place, the militia workers were given a verbal order to cease serious investigative activity. In the second place, there is a secret agreement with the criminal groups on carrying out their "actions" and moreover "stripping down" outside the limits of the Dniester capital. In the third place, which is, perhaps, the most terrible thing -- many of the corpses fished out of the Dniester, despite the degree of their decomposition, are written off to the war, and the contemporary homicides, that the whole city knows about, are for some reason not entered in the official reports of the GUVD. Two days before we arrived, a businessman was killed by a bullet in the head. An old man who was a witness is to this day in a resuscitation ward. A short time earlier, another businessman was killed in his motor vehicle and "at the same time," again, a small child ended up in a resuscitation ward. Like a living legend, the story goes around Tiraspol of how two subdivisions of the power structure -- special service and GB [state security] -- shot at each other. According to the Tiraspol version, two policemen from Ukraine were tracking their "own" criminal, who had decided to visit the charming land of the Dniester. The special groups decided to take them all at the same time. The result -- three "guests" and a few of their own men were killed. "You understand, we are just setting up our organs of law and order," Vadim Shevtsov told us. Power Is a Simple Matter We were able to sense Vadim Shevtsov's power from personal experience. Three days before we arrived, Viktor Petrenko, director of the Tiraspol Motor Vehicle Service, was suddenly arrested. His last name figured in a story with a "Lincoln," which had been standing idle on enterprise territory for several months, and according to certain data, had been bought as a present for President Smirnov who, for understandable reasons, refused the latter. Petrenko, who was on friendly terms with Smirnov, like one of the family, as they say, had access to the government house, and in addition -- had MVD and GB certificates and several models of weapons. He was taken on the way from the local "White House" to the presidential car -- and what was curious, escorted by Smirnov himself. Vadim Shevtsov, who personally took part in this incident, described Petrenko's behavior as a "violation of the conditions of a special position," and of his own will placed him under administrative arrest for a while... for 30 days. Just like the good old days -- without a trial or investigation. Igor Smirnov kept modestly silent. Appearing on television on the subject of Petrenko's strange arrest, on the third day of Petrenko's sojourn with vagrants in a jail cell, Mikhail Bergman then and there "received" a whole program from Dniester Radio. The radio reported that Bergman had "resorted to such dirty tricks" that he had even thought up a kind of arrest for Petrenko. In confirmation of its conclusion, it cited the words of the motor vehicle service director's wife, who had informed it that her husband, she said, had gone off to Odessa and would be there for dinner. At this point, Petrenko had not been there for dinner three times. We received the answer to our question about Petrenko's strange fate next morning: by decision of the Dniester Public Prosecutor, he was released from the jail cell with the admission that Vadim Shevtsov, director of the State Security Committee, had violated his authority, since in Petrenko's actions "there were no elements comprising a crime." Vadim Shevtsov himself explained the occurrence with the very simple sentence: "This is our private matter." The "private matter" resulted in the fact that during this time, Victor Petrenko and his family, after thanking us for the unexpected help, left the borders of his native land, in the hope of finding a safe little town in a different region. Aleksandr Lebed, laughing, evaluated what had happened: "It is obvious. Shevtsov is simply showing his strength, to keep Petrenko from saying anything unpleasant. Remember: Molotov's wife stayed home, and Kalinin's wife too, so that their husbands could walk on a short leash. Here, it is I, Shevtsov, who is the master." In a private conversation with Petrenko, we received a similar response: "Who is the boss in the city and the republic? Shevtsov?" "Shevtsov." "Can Smirnov count on his own guard in an emergency situation?" "No." The presidential guard, which confirmed our suppositions, is really subordinate to Vadim Shevtsov. Officially. He himself can see nothing so terrible in joining all the state security forces in the same hands. Russia, it seems, has already gone through this. In August 1991. The "Special Feature" of Weapons -- Killing No one can name the whereabouts of the thousands of gun barrels that disappeared during the war. There are only local disputes about one-and-a-half thousand barrels, removed from the people "in the trenches," by military headquarters after the war. Local authorities accuse Bergman of specially destroying the registration log of the confiscated weapons, and "putting it to his own uses." Meanwhile, as Aleksandr Lebed confirmed for us, the situation was somewhat different: "The confiscated weapons were turned over to the local commanders. After that a special commission came to us for verification, and it even included Col Yakovlev (I am his enemy No 1, he even passed over Bergman). So they counted and recounted everything down to the last piece. The commission signed the written statement. Only then did I call out Col Bergman and say: put the statement at the bottom of the safe, but destroy the registration log as not assigned by the regulations. We created a special commission for this and destroyed it." So just where are these thousands of firing pieces now? When will they surface? And whom will they kill and maim? On the other hand, several hundred barrels with thousands of cartridges have already surfaced: according to the assertion of qualified Moscow authorities, they were already transported for the opposition to Moscow from the Dniester area during the October events of last year. As for the several dozens of participants from this sunny republic, in the words of Vadim Shevtsov, he bears no responsibility for them. Even though in "identikit" pictures, sent from Moscow to Tiraspol, people assigned to the same Dniester Special Service Battalion have now been recognized. Their last names, positions and nicknames are well-known. In an interview for MK correspondents, Aleksandr Lebed informed us of one "attractive" fact. Military headquarters has documents according to which the Dniester Battalion sent the following weapons to Gagauzia (Budzhak Battalion): AKS-74 -- 300 pieces, AKS-74u -- 50 pieces, 180 Makarov pistols, RPKS-74, Dergunov sniper rifles -- 7 pieces, AGS-17 automatic grenade launcher -- one, 100,000 ammunition units and 96 grenades. "Nothing reached Gagauzia, as its spokesmen confirmed." Vadim Shevtsov had contrasting information on this score. Lebed sent the above-named weapons to Gagauzia. And they arrived there. We did not see either side's documents. Trustworthy confidential sources in Tiraspol made it known to us that in September of last year, three Russian opposition leaders were made a gift of three attractive Dergunov sniper rifles, which make a very accurate hole in the forehead of the desired victim at a distance of 1,200 meters. Their numbers: No 65347, No 84282 and No 66480. Vadim Shevtsov answered this question: "I did not give any rifles to anyone." The question was open for competent authorities in Moscow. As for the Russian opposition, most of it shows open sympathy with the present Dniester authorities. Zyuganov, Makashov, Anpilov, Alksnis, Baburin, Umalatova, Pavlov and others visit Tiraspol on holidays and non-working days. Shevtsov thinks that, if the patriots are drawn to the Dniester area, why not mix with them? After all, other "leaders" express no particular desire to visit Suvorov's corner.... For the "internal security" of the citizens of the Dniester region, particularly in 1992-1993, those wishing them were handed out weapons by the president's hand. This can be explained by the need for independent defense against criminal groups, since the organs of internal affairs have little power. Let us note that this situation developed against the background of the highly publicized shortage of weapons among the organs of law and order. In all, according to the available registration book, 900 barrels were issued to those wishing them. The Tiraspol Cotton Production Association asked for seven TT pistols and got them. Weapons are officially registered to the management of the metallurgical plant, the small Olimp enterprise, the editors of that same Dniester Radio, the directors of a metals structures plant, and others. And naturally, to all the officials of the republic -- "by virtue of the danger of their job." In general -- it is all nothing. Some formulas resemble anecdotes. For example, Galina Andreyeva, a political leader, is permitted to carry a weapon only "if she has a weapon available." They permitted the deputy of one of the firms "to be issued one --." Pistol, rifle, and perhaps, machine gun? The head physician of the Tiraspol Maternity Home got the "go-ahead" for official registration of a personal pistol, but "supplying the weapon is his problem" -- as the resolution says. Some Dniester citizens are issued weapons from ... material evidence, from specific crimes. There is a special approach for ten executives in the Dniester Government who hold the rank of ministers and deputies. They were issued... Simonov semi-automatic carbines, which in the stagnant times could be found only in the use of servicemen of the former Soviet Army. A. Karaman, vice-president of the Dniester area was distinguished more than anyone, in the sense of armament. He has the use of six types of weapons: two types of Kalashnikov automatic, TT, Makarov and Stechkin pistols (actually submachine guns), and a Simonov semi-automatic carbine. Some of the people presented with weapons are now taking up permanent residence outside the boundaries of their beloved Motherland -- more precisely, in the far abroad. And just where the weapon itself is --remains only a guess, because the registration book has no notes on its being turned over. All these things, however, in the words of Mikhail Bergman, are just the beginning. The worst is yet to come: "The Dniester Army is now preparing for the next putsch in Moscow," says the colonel. "Weapons are hidden throughout the villages, up to 800 barrels each in the same place. They are preparing to ferry them to the Russian capital, where some of the barrels are already concentrated. Forty-six people using assumed names have now come to Tiraspol from Moscow. They are getting ready. A huge slaughter is slated for the autumn in Moscow...." Vadim Shevtsov expresses no particular desire to refute Bergman and Lebed: "There are other people in the 14th." "There is no doubt that specific forces are standing behind Lebed, and it is generally known that he is a friend of Grachev and makes use of the army commander of the moment," the director of the republic's State Security explains to us. "After all, Lebed and I were friends. On 4 January 1993, however, Lebed suggested to me and to Matveyev, the former minister of Internal Affairs, that we take part in the overthrow of the PMR government. We refused. And then it started. (...) He, Lebed, by no means sees himself as Russian minister of Defense -- he sees himself as the second person who will bring order in Russia." (In parentheses we note: to the frank question we put to Lebed concerning the fact that many people are waiting for him in Moscow, the lieutenant-general answered: "I do not want to go to Moscow.") Igor Smirnov, president of the Dniester area, develops his colleague's idea: "The present situation is quite convenient for Bergman and people like him. If we, the PMR, can find a common language with Moldova, the Dniester area as a "hot spot" will disappear. (...) Russia needs all of Moldova because of geopolitical and strategic interests. We do not object, we are not leaving Moldova. (...) As Goebbels said, the more impudent the lie, the more plausible it is. They accuse us of the fact that the Dniester Battalion was at the White House...." Both of them were of one accord: we don't want to collect documents on the 14th Army, we want it to be here, we don't need any aggravation. So they just did not give us any documents against the 14th Army and the Tiraspol Military Headquarters. What Can We Expect? The atmosphere in Tiraspol is unpleasant. Everyone knows about the tailing, telephone bugging and mutual "reconnaissance" of the opposing sides. It sometimes reaches the point of absurdity: people know the quarters from which the outside surveillance comes. The "adversaries" know each other by sight. The republic seems to be split in half. Representatives of the Russian Army and the political opposition speak openly about replacing the "mafiosa" Dniester Government. With a more respectable one? Or -- with a more loyal one? Replacement -- in what form? Russia's interests, as always, are veiled. It is possible, as quite often happens these days -- they are simply unpredictable. The Dniester area -- beyond any doubt -- is a "card" in the political game with Moldavia, which has so far not come into the CIS. The "card," however, may be played both in a peaceful way and in a military way. This can happen in the near future. At the same time, the Dniester Government is not a sweet treat. Its relations with the Moscow opposition are obvious. The priority of force is unconcealed. The number of unregistered weapons is unpredictably high. In both the Dniester area and Moscow there is peace for the time being. God grant that no one disturbs it. P.S. Having returned to the capital of our Motherland, the MK correspondents noticed an outside tail following them. We do not know to which structure these people belong. On 21 May, the apartment of one of us was "frisked." The "guests" took no money or valuables. What they were looking for -- is still a mystery.
