The Agricultural Ministry today noted that the cut came in line with the November 1993 decision on the part of the European Commission to liquidate the 1990 acccounts and stressed that every year Italy suffers the biggest reductions in FEOGA funds because of failure to respect Community controls and the terms within which payments must be made.
