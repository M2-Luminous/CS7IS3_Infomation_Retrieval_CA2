"They are gone from the outside of the house. I don't know about the inside," one diplomat said when reached by telephone from Bangkok. A second western diplomat, also contacted by telephone from Bangkok, confirmed that said the guards were absent from outside the house. "I passed along (the street in front of) her residence last night and the two guard boxes were not there any longer," he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The second diplomat also said there still could be guards inside the residence, and speculated they could have been pulled from outside the house to make the military government look good to the increasing number of tourists visiting Rangoon. "It is too soon to draw any conclusions, but it is definitely the first time (the guards have been withdrawn) since she was put under house arrest" on July 20, 1989, he said. The first official, who also declined to be identified by name, refused to speculate as to why the soldiers guarding the complex on Rangoon's University Avenue had been withdrawn. "But I don't think it is terribly significant," he said. [passage omitted: background]
