Bjoerck says the centre right government's proposal to join the programme will probably pass through parliament with little or no opposition. But the defence minister adds, joining Partnership for Peace does not mean Sweden is abandoning its traditional neutrality. Fourteen countries--all East European states and former Soviet republics--have so far signed up to join the scheme. Another neutral Nordic country, Finland, has also said it will join the programme. The other three Nordic countries--Denmark, Norway and Iceland--are already full members of NATO.
