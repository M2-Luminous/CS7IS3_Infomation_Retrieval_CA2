[Kano] The Japan New Party and the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] have asked us about it. Their thinking that reform should be carried out in all areas is essentially the same as ours. But we consider procedural matters as being important, too. We would like to make a decision after hearing views of parties concerned. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] At least, do you intend to participate in the decisionmaking bodies of the coalition parties -- like the representatives' conference? [Kano] The nine-item basic policies agreed to by the coalition parties conform to our line of thinking. We would like to offer our efforts in pushing for the policies. We will participate in the decisionmaking bodies, if asked. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How do you view the moves being made by the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] toward collaborating with each other? [Kano] With the international community in a period of change, we must walk the way of reform. We cannot move backward. We must realize why we wanted to carry out political reform to begin with. What I want to do is to pursue this goal based on common policy ideals. People who want to be politicians must think about this point. That is the responsibility of politicians toward the people. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] If the LDP and the SDPJ decide to collaborate, they will be able to carry a no-confidence motion in the cabinet, too. [Kano] Their collaboration must not be an illicit union. Both parties said so themselves. That is what I want to say to them. We must recall why political reform was necessary. We must push our policy from a new position. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] There are people saying the House of Representatives should be dissolved once the budget is passed. [Kano] The next general election should be held under a new election system since the Political Reform Bill has been passed. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How do you intend to expand the force of your party in the future? [Kano] We will make efforts to have our party's position and basic thinking understood better. There are people who have actively sought political reform. We hope we will succeed in gaining understanding from a larger number of people. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] There are all kinds of stories now circulating about your New Party Mirai. Some say it is leaning toward Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], and some say the Mirai members defected from the LDP because of problems they had with their constituencies. [Kano] I am aware that there are many rumors. But our actions are based on the belief that we should go for reform and act future-oriented. We cannot stake our political lives only on the human relationship. I hope you will understand the sincere resolve each of us made in taking the action of bolting the LDP and forming the new party and thus risking our own political lives. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What is your position on the taxation sytem reform? [Kano] It is part of economic reform, and the question lies in how best the assets, consumption, and income levies can be balanced. There is also the question of how the direct taxes and indirect taxes should be proportioned. It is important that we all discuss the matter frankly. In reviewing the matter, we will have to think about the future picture of Japan, too. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you think an increase in the consumption tax rate would be unavoidable? [Kano] The question is not whether to raise that tax, but why we must think about it. The vision for the future, the standard of lives for the people -- these things need to be thought out. We will have to think about the taxation system reform, thinking about all these things.
