Also, in the north, groups of Indians entered the towns of Cayambe, Otavalo, Ibarra, San Gabriel, Huacas, and Cristobal Colon and blocked the Pan-American Highway, thus preventing the movement of vehicles. As a result of the demonstrations in Quito, approximately 50 people are under arrest and, at the orders of the police commissioner who according to the law must punish them for breaking the law, will be fined between 60 and 120 sucres and serve four days in jail. Approximately six aerial incursions took place between 1 and 2 February over Quito, especially over places where students were protesting. The aircraft dropped tear gas bombs to disperse the demonstrations.
