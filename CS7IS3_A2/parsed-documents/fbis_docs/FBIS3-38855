Bosnia-Herzegovina took advantage of the occasion to demand the immediate withdrawal of all heavy weapons positioned around Sarajevo to a point outside the town's range. If the Serbs do not do this within 48 hours, Minister Ljubijankic demanded air strikes. The credibility of NATO as a serious institution and [word indistinct] talks is at stake. Our foreign minister repeated the demand to lift the arms embargo for Bosnia-Herzegovina. Ljubijankic and Balanzino discussed the military presence of the Croatian Army in our country. Our side referred to a secret agreement between Franjo Tudjman and Slobodan Milosevic on the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina between Croatia and Serbia. Bosnia-Herzegovina expressed the desire to join the Partnership for Peace, an NATO initiative designed to unite with the former Socialist countries. Mr. Balanzino informed Minister Ljubijankic that NATO is keeping our country in mind but that the acceptance procedure is long, and the number of interested countries is great. Mr. Balanzino informed the Bosnia-Herzegovina foreign minister that NATO has planned all the details for action in Bosnia-Herzegovina; only a political decision is needed. It is high time we preserve the meager credibility of the international community and NATO with resolute action. We seriously believe this, he emphasized.
