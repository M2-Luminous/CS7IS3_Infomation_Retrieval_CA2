Asif Ali Zardari went to Iraq as a special emissary of the prime minister with a consignment of medicines and a letter for President Saddam Husayn, where he was accorded an enthusiastic welcome. He went to seek the release of three Pakistani prisoners, but he found out in Baghdad that 24 Pakistanis were serving jail terms on various charges in that country. The Iraqi authorities, on Zardari's request, tracked down all Pakistani prisoners and released them immediately. Now, only one Pakistani remains in an Iraqi jail. He is accused of being involved in political activities. When Asif Ali Zardari returned to Islamabad with eight of the released prisoners, the prime minister received them at the airport, thanked the Iraqi Government, and noted that the purpose of sending a special emissary to Baghdad has been fulfilled. The release of the Pakistanis and their return at the beginning of the holy month of Ramadan is a source of happiness and joy for the country. Efforts will be made to ensure early release of the lone Pakistani now held in Iraq. She said we are doing all this for the sake of Pakistan's glory and honor at the international level and to raise our voice in support of truth and justice. We hope the opposition will also cooperate with the government in this regard. The prime minister has rightly said that the return of the eight released Pakistanis will bring happiness to their homes and that a man feels especially happy when he puts his feet on the soil of his motherland. In reply to a question about whether Pakistan will help Iraq restore its contacts with the rest of the world, the prime minister said Pakistan and other countries should work to ensure the territorial integrity and independence of Kuwait, so that post-Gulf War conditions can reach a logical conclusion. Pakistan has maintained traditional relations with Iraq, and we want to restore our ties in accordance with the UN resolutions and the international situation that emerged after the Gulf War. We will do all this within the limits set by the United Nations. Vital nations always take care of their nationals no matter which part of the world they live in. They provide assistance to their nationals whenever they find themselves surrounded by difficulties or problems and do not rest until their problems are solved. They consider this a matter of national ego and honor and are ready to place everything at stake to mitigate their suffering. It is not possible for them to ignore their citizens. There are numerous examples to show that a nation has either declared war against or severed all ties with other countries in order to have one or two of its citizens released. The present government has set a good example in this respect. It has enhanced the prestige of the country and the nation at the international level. Within the country, it has brought relief and comfort to the families whose relatives had been separated from them and nobody had ever thought of their release and repatriation. We already had diplomatic ties with Iraq and now an element of warmth has been added to them. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has referred to the limitations and restrictions imposed by the United Nations, which we need to observe in view of our commitment to the world body. Nonetheless, Pakistan can certainly play an effective role in restoring Iraq's ties with the rest of the world and it must do so. Normalization of Iraq's ties with the international community will create a sort of stability in the entire region and will help establish and promote international contacts on the basis of mutual respect. Iraq's participation will prove particularly useful in efforts toward achieving the collective objectives of the Islamic countries. Addressing a news conference on his return from Baghdad, Asif Ali Zardari disclosed that the Iraqi Government is pleased with our humanitarian gesture. Iraq was in great need of the medicines we provided. Several people have died in Iraq because of a shortage and nonavailability of medicines and the common people are facing serious difficulties finding food and medicines as a result of restrictions imposed by the United Nations. Asif Ali Zardari said that he had the impression that Iraq would have been destroyed, like Bosnia, as a result of 120,000 tons of bombs that were dropped on that country during the Gulf War, but the Iraqis have rebuilt everything in just two years. It has been confirmed from other sources as well that Iraq has erased all signs of destruction just one year after the war, intentionally leaving a few places in their ruined state as war memorials. No other areas bear any sign of destruction caused by the war. Zardari said that the Government of Iraq has requested that Pakistan send medicines. The request should be considered sympathetically and an appeal should be made to the United Nations to lift restrictions on the supply of medicines and foodstuffs to Iraq on humanitarian grounds. Pakistan's efforts in this context will certainly bear fruit. As for the dispatch of medicines, there is no restriction in this regard. Pakistan and Iraq enjoy age-old ties. They have interacted and cooperated with each other under various agreements and, hence, a close and harmonious relationship must be established between them. Iraq is full of oil wealth and can provide oil to Pakistan on concessional terms. Trade between the two countries can also prove mutually beneficial. Anyhow, as stated by the prime minister, Pakistan's ties with Iraq can be restored only within the limits set by the United Nations. Iraq appreciates Pakistan's humanitarian gesture. Pakistan should also appreciate Iraq's goodwill gesture and thus the two countries should once again become each other's helper and supporter and prove a source of strength for the Islamic world.
