"Parallel" technologies are in the process of redefining the concepts of large and medium-sized mainframe systems. IBM recently announced a renewal of its supply in mainframes built on its Cisc 390 processors thanks to solutions called "parallel transaction or interrogation servers." Mainframes are in the process of becoming secure information servers. It is now Bull's turn to unveil a new range of large and medium-sized company mainframes which mark a technological break with its previous range (DPS 7000/700 and 700/400), thanks notably to the achievement of Symmetrical Multiprocessing Technologies (SMP) but also thanks to the use of a "home" Cisc processor with a very high integration density. (The processor developed in Cmos [Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor]/VLSI [Very Large Scale Integration] technology by Bull integrates 4.7 million transistors. It runs at 66 MHz and offers 30 Mips [million instructions per second] power) Up to 24 Parallel Processors These servers can integrate up to 24 processors in parallel (6 cards with 4 processors) and are defined according to a number of models in relation to the missions they are destined to carry out: mainframe on a transactional processing environment (up to 7,000 active users), network server (up to 1,000 users), relational applications server, and client/server in a production environment and as a decision-making aid. On each of the cards interlinked by a bus with a debit of 500 Mo/s [Megabyte per second], processors communicate with each other with the help of an interconnection network with an output of 1 Go/s [Gigabyte per second] and sharing a memory faceplate of 64 Ko [Kilobytes] (Footnote 2) (The faceplate coherence is directly managed by the GC0S7 mainframe operation system in which a EXMS multiprocessor extension was jointly developed). The result is an increase in power of over 50 percent compared to the previous range and an improvement in the performance/price ratio which, according to Bull, is of a factor of three. These new capacities mean important gains in terms of transfer rates (local network at 100 Mbits/s instead of 10 Mbits/s) in particular under TCP/IP [Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol] for client/server applications while discharging (thanks to the parallelism) the main servers from their communication tasks. The cost of the Mips on the network server is to the order of 20,000 French francs [Fr] while it used to be about Fr180,000 on the previous range and Fr60,000 on the most recent generations of parallel servers. The expansion to open systems (Unix) and to client/server applications, which requires a lot of communications to render the heterogeneous nature of the systems transparent to the user), are not only becoming possible but also accessible in terms of cost.
