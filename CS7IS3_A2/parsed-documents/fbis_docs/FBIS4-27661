FBIS4-27661 "dreas107_m_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-107 Daily Report 2 Jun 1994 Thailand Board Announces Steps To Attract Industries Board Announces Steps To Attract Industries BK0206094494 Bangkok THE NATION in English 2 Jun 94 pp B1, B2 BK0206094494 Bangkok THE NATION English BFN [By Manirat Chitsamakun] [Text] The Board of Investment (BoI) yesterday took a major step to promote supporting industries in Thailand by announcing benefits for an additional 10 industrial categories, mostly small and medium-sized firms, in an attempt to attract at least 5,000 Japanese plants to Thailand. Moreover, the board, chaired by Prime Minister Chuan Likphai, will also allow an additional 20 industries, including auto parts, electronic products, plastic products and rubber products, to be located in the Zone 2 investment area. The BoI, however, has yet to rule whether to grant privileges to the fertilizer and ceramic industries under the second classification of the BoI promotional privileges. The BoI's latest move is seen as a response to investors' complaints over inadequate infrastructure in the remote provinces under so-called Zone 3. Although the government tried to promote investment by offering a first-class incentive package for those who wish to set up plants in those provinces some investors have been reluctant to go there because the provinces are too far away. At a press conference yesterday, Sathaphon Kawitanon, BoI secretary-general, said the BoI board has agreed to grant an eight-year corporate tax exemption to those who wish to set up plants for engineering plastic parts, rechargeable batteries, electronic connectors, machining centres, heat treatment, surface treatment, sintered products, grinding tools, cutting tools and toolings, regardless of where the industries are located. Yesterday's announcement has added to the list of industries BoI approved on October 26 last year. Then, the BoI offered maximum benefits to four industries -- moulds and dies, jigs and fixtures, forging, casting and induction furnaces. Sathaphon said that the incentive worked quite well as it helped increase factories in the four industries from only one to 12. Sathaphon said that this should help promote small-and medium-scale industries, which are the foundation for economic development. He said that it is coincidental that the yen has appreciated, which is expected to prompt small and medium firms in Japan to relocate their plants to low-cost countries. BoI recently conducted a seminar in Japan and found that there were about 1 million small and medium plants there. "If we can get just 1-2 percent of the total or only 5,000 factories, the opportunity among local industries to get transfer of technology will be tremendous," he said. The 20 industries which the BoI allowed to be set up in the Zone 2 investment area are leather tannery, wheel tyre, rubber, glass, carpet, leather products, footwear and parts, toys and electronic games, box or packaging products, metal-made containers, leather gloves, lenses or glasses, metal items, metal string, auto parts, energy-saving light tubes, batteries, electronic products, soft gelatine capsules and plastic or plastic-coated products.
