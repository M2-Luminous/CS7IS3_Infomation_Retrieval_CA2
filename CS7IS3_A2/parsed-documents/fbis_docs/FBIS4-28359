FBIS4-28359 "dreas111__a94033" FBIS-EAS-94-111-A Daily Report 8 Jun 1994 ANNEX Japan SDPJ Basing Plan on Protecting Constitution SDPJ Basing Plan on Protecting Constitution OW0906024794 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN in Japanese Morning 8 Jun 94 p 1 -- FOR OOFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0906024794 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] On 7 June, the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] set a policy of putting together a party governing concept in order to form a new coalition government after the Diet passes the fiscal year 1994 budget. The party's goal is to press Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata either to have his cabinet resign en masse or to choose the path of rejecting the concept, dissolving the Diet, and calling a general election. The pillars of the SDPJ's governing concept include: (1) Respecting the ideals of the constitution; and (2) taking responsibility for and a role in global peace and disarmament. Based on the items agreed upon by each party in the Hosokawa coalition government at the time of its establishment in August 1993, the SDPJ will put "protecting the constitution" in the forefront. The SDPJ's governing concept will also specifically call for reforming the decisionmaking system for the government and ruling parties to make it a democratic and open one. The SDPJ will decide on beginning party procedures in its Central Executive Committee as early as 9 June. In addition, Committee Chairman Tomiichi Murayama is planning to call on Prime Minister Hata to hold a party summit where he will present the SDPJ's ideas in detail. The new governing concept is based on the thinking that, according to a senior party executive: "The SDPJ was pressed at the April policy conference of the coalition government parties to ratify the policy accord put together by the other parties. We were thus unable to put forth our own positions." The party's aim in formulating the new concept is to play the lead role in the government conference by putting forth its own ideas first. In particular, in taking seriously the debate following the argument of Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa and others for changing the constitutional interpretation on the right to collective self- defense, there is gaining ground in the SDPJ the view that there must be a clear reflection on World War II. Concerning the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) nuclear development issue, there is a wish to go beyond the April policy conference to a concrete response in strengthening further the position of "resolving the issue through talks within the framework of the constitution." Concerning government and ruling party decisionmaking, too, the SDPJ's governing concept will press for a reform of the council of party representatives led by Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and other party executives as well a shift to "ruling party summits" and other "forums for open discussion" previously proposed by SDPJ Central Executive Committee Chairman Murayama.
