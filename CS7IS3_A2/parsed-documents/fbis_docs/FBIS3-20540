The history of China's 15 years of reform is really a history of the Chinese people's continually studying, debating, liberating their thinking and changing their ideas, all under the leading banner of Deng Xiaoping's "building socialism with Chinese characteristics". After Deng Xiaoping's visit to the south of China in 1992, many people breathed a sigh of relief. They believed that the theoretical puzzle which had been murky for years had now been clarified now by comrade Xiaoping's thunderous voice, and the theoretical barriers to further reform and opening theory had been eradicated, and the only question remaining in establishing the socialist market economic system was how to operate it. But I am not so optimistic. To be sure, the 14th Party Congress determined that China's reform objective is to establish the new socialist market economic system, thus ending disputes over the goals of reform. It reached agreements concerning the general direction of reform for the party and the nation, such as, "the ice jam has been broken, the shipping channels are open." However, to really break the invisible conceptual shackles on reform and opening and social development, there is much hard work still remaining to be done. This is because it will for some time be hard to heal the remnants of old concepts produced by traditional socialist theory and practice, and these are still preventing us from going forward. These "remnants" concentrate on three aspects: 1) "Is it the socialism or capitalism"; 2) "Is it State ownership or private ownership"; 3) "What is the real relationship between plan and market"? Although comrade Xiaoping's speech on his visit to the south of China brought people a great way forward in understanding these questions, it is still far from resolving many people's uncertainties. In the practice of reform and opening, it is usually the case that these ingrained "remnants" quietly pop up, affecting people's vision and restricting their activities. So, it is still necessary for us to hold multiple "consultations" on these "remnants." --Concerning "capitalism or socialism." In reality, there has never been fixed, inflexible capitalism, nor fixed, inflexible socialism. Real capitalism and socialism have in many regards surpassed what they were designed to be in Marx's time. Marx never put socialism absolutely in opposition to capitalism; rather, he stressed that socialism spun off from capitalism, developing capitalism's good factors and abandoning its bad aspects. Socialism with Chinese characteristics is no longer the socialism in the past meaning of a planned economy rejecting markets, but a combination of China's situation and socialism. This socialism combines the general socialist system with market economics, a socialism which embodies the future course of societal development. The nature of socialism is to create much higher efficiency than capitalism can, liberating and developing productive forces but not other things. Therefore, we shouldn't adopt some pattern as the principle, but should adhere totally to the principle of development. But regardless of whether we call it "socialism" or "capitalism", if it is favorable to developing the productive forces, strengthens the Chinese people's capacities, and improves their standard of living, we will take advantage of it and use it. Otherwise, no matter what it is, we should abandon it. --Concerning "state ownership" or "private ownership." It is most difficult to change ideas on this question. In spite of repeated emphasis by the party and the state that while we "must adhere to state ownership being the main part, multiple economic elements can still coexist and develop together", many people can agree with this verbally, but in their practical work they turn pale at the mention of "private ownership". In their view, without "the state" title, we cannot have an orthodox public ownership system, an example of how the existence of private ownership is further restricted. This sort of "private ownership panic" does considerable harm to developing our national economy. We cannot assume that this phenomenon is normal--on the one hand, stressing that the people are the masters of society, while on the other hand fearing the masters owning a portion of that society's wealth; on the one hand believing that three farmers back in the fifties organizing a cooperative was "public", while on the hand believing it is not public ownership if thousands of people establish enterprises by investing in stock. We should be more bold in admitting that "private ownership" is to a certain degree an intrinsic requirement of socialism, and that socialism absolutely does not reject "private ownership"; on the contrary, it is more extensive and deep than it is in capitalism. Only in this way can it embody social and historical progress. Of course, this sort of private ownership within socialism is not a totally chaotic mutual massacre, mutually predatory, but an orderly, fair, competitive "private ownership" which takes socialist public ownership as the dominant factor, under State intervention and supervision. This means that this kind of "private ownership" is clearly characterized by fairness. "Public" and "private" are interchangeable, they are only one important aspect in production relationships, just bringing about the developmental "pattern" of the productive forces. They must both comply with the demands of productive forces, but must not replace the productive forces as our standard for judging success or failure. If something is favorable to liberating and developing productive forces, we should not be obsessed with the "public" versus "private" argument. In other words, the only standard for accepting or rejecting "public" or "private" should be whether it liberates and develops the productive forces. No matter whether "private" or "public", if they can promote development of the productive forces, then they deserve our protection; if not, then we should abandon them. --Concerning "plan" and "market." In the contemporary world, there is no economy which is dominated absolutely by a planned economy, no matter what type of social system, nor is there an absolutely market-dominated economy either, both types are always mutually compatible and supportive. Plans always have certain subjective features, representative of governmental will; markets always have certain objective features, representative of mutually supportive rules inside matters. "Plan" and "market" are both only means of resource allocation, and this is so no matter what their nature, no matter whether good or bad, "capitalism" or "socialism." Overall, planned measures can be adopted, and so can market means if they are favorable to liberating and developing the productive forces. We need not be obsessed with debating whether the "plan" or the "market" is right or bad, which is the more important or the less important. We must completely abandon those "leftist", unsuitable, and impractical old concepts of socialism in our minds, we must be cured of the remnants of old concepts brought on by traditional socialist theory and practice. The only good treatment is insistence on the party's ideological line of seeking truth from facts. Seeking truth from facts is the quintessence of Mao Zedong thought, and is also the moral nature of Deng Xiaoping's basic theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. For a long time, especially prior to the 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th Party Central Committee, we made a big mistake in that while building up socialist theory we deviated from the ideological line of seeking truth from facts, emphasizing thought drawn from abstract principles and ignoring the practical base of theories. The result was that while things always looked perfect in theory, with nothing to criticize, they obviously departed from reality, and the degree of accomplishment of these theories was very low. A great person has said that the value of a theory lies in the degree of its accomplishment. We cannot imagine that a theory can be dissociated from reality but still be regarded as correct and valuable. The reason why traditional socialist theory has suffered setbacks is that it has never really been rooted in the fertile land of the various socialist countries. Theory is one thing, practice is another, and separating the two must make for a lack of vitality. This is also precisely the reason why people are calling strongly for reform and theoretical renewal. Therefore, in the process of establishing a socialist market economic system, we cannot commit the same mistakes of traditional socialist theory, but must adhere to starting out from practice. One part of this practice is the basic national situation of China. Its major characteristics are: a huge population, especially the rural population; backward productive forces, especially the backward rural economy, and the gap between the urban and the rural; unbalanced regional development and a substantial imbalance in industrial development; high gross economic value, but a low average level. On the other hand, to be a member of the world, we must take into account doing business in compliance with international regulations. This is our reality, this is where we stand in constructing the socialist Chinese market economy, and neither in formulating theory nor in renewing theory can we ignore this reality. The three fundamental principles of "if it favorable to developing socialist productive forces, if it is favorable to strengthening the overall capacity of a socialist country, if it is favorable to improving the people's living standard" set forth by comrade Xiaoping's speech during his visit to the south of China, shine brightly in ideological brilliance. These are the basic standards which determine and judge each step in our reform, and are also our effective proof in seeking to accomplish the goals of reform. In our practice, we must abandon those ideologies and concepts that do not match up with the "three favorable" principle, and we should persist in the correct and correct the wrong, to be worthy of this great historical mission.
