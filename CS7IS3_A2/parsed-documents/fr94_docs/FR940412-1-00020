FR940412-1-00020 FR940412-1-00006 DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS 38 CFR Part 4 RIN 2900&hyph;AF22 Schedule for Rating Disabilities; Diseases of the Ear and Other Sense Organs AGENCY: Department of Veterans Affairs. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is proposing to amend its rating schedule regarding evaluation of diseases of the ear and other sense organs. This amendment is necessary in order to comply with a General Accounting Office (GAO) study, which recommended that medical criteria in the rating schedule be reviewed and updated. The intended effect is to update the portion of the Schedule for Rating Disabilities pertaining to diseases of the ear and other sense organs to ensure that it uses current medical terminology and unambiguous criteria for evaluating these disabilities and reflects recent medical advances. DATES: Comments must be received on or before June 13, 1994. Comments will be available for public inspection until June 21, 1994. This change is proposed to be effective 30 days after the date of publication of the final rule. ADDRESSES: Interested persons are invited to submit written comments, suggestions, or objections regarding this change to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (271A), Department of Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20420. All written comments received will be available for public inspection only in the Veterans Services Unit, room 170, at the above address between the hours of 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday (except holidays), until June 21, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John L. Roberts, Consultant, Regulations Staff, Compensation and Pension Service, Veterans Benefits Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20420, (202) 233&hyph;3005. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In response to the advance notice of proposed rulemaking published in the Federal Register on May 2, 1991, we received comments and suggestions from VA medical doctors and VA Rating Specialists. The comments included suggestions that we delete several diagnostic codes, include diagnostic codes for additional conditions, and change evaluation criteria for a number of conditions. We have considered all of these suggestions and implemented several as explained in the following proposal. If medical terminology in the rating schedule is outdated, it is difficult for a rating specialist to accurately associate medical evidence with the proper evaluation criteria. For that reason, we propose to update the medical terms which identify diseases of the ear so that the schedule uses the most common terms. In addition to publishing an advance notice of proposed rulemaking, we also contracted with an outside consultant to recommend changes to the evaluation criteria to ensure that the schedule uses current medical terminology and unambiguous criteria, and that it reflects medical advances which have occurred since the last review. The consultant convened a panel of non-VA specialists to review that portion of the rating schedule dealing with hearing and ear conditions in order to formulate recommendations. We are proposing to adopt many of the recommendations the contractor submitted. Some recommendations, however, addressed areas other than evaluation criteria, such as percentage evaluations and frequency of examinations. Since these suggestions are clearly beyond the scope of the contract and deal with issues which would affect the internal consistency of the entire rating schedule rather than one section, we have generally not adopted them. We propose to change the terminology describing several of the conditions in this section for clarity and to reflect current medical terminology. Under diagnostic code 6201, the term ``otitis media, catarrhal, chronic'' is outdated and we propose to replace it with ``chronic otitis media, with effusion (serous otitis media).'' Similarly, ``chronic otitis externa'' is the medically preferred term for ``auditory canal, disease of'' and we propose to use it as the heading for diagnostic code 6210. Meniere's syndrome (diagnostic code 6205) is often referred to as ``endolymphatic hydrops'' and we propose to add this designation in parenthesis to the heading of this diagnostic code. When first included in the rating schedule, the term ``chronic labyrinthitis'' under diagnostic code 6204 was used to indicate pathology affecting organs of equilibrium. That term, however, is not used in current medical practice; these conditions are currently described as vestibular disorders. For this reason, we propose to change the heading of code 6204 to ``peripheral vestibular disorders.'' Since the word ``neoplasm'' connotes a pathological abnormality better than the term ``new growth,'' we propose to substitute that word under diagnostic codes 6208 and 6209, which pertain to malignant and benign conditions, respectively. A number of grammatical elements are useful in eliminating ambiguity and ensuring that the schedule presents rating criteria as precisely as possible. We are proposing editorial changes, primarily of syntax and punctuation, throughout this portion of the schedule. These changes are intended to clarify the rating criteria and represent no substantive amendment. Section 4.85 describes the use of tables VI and VIa in the evaluation of hearing impairment. Table VI is a chart of average puretone decibel losses and speech discrimination percentages, with conversion to Roman numeral designations where the values intersect. Table VIa assigns Roman numeral designations to ranges of average puretone decibel loss without regard to speech discrimination. The Roman numeral designations derived from tables VI or VIa for each ear are then transferred to Table VII and combined to yield diagnostic codes and disability percentages from 0 to 100. Higher numeric designations equate to a higher disability percentage. Currently table VIa is reserved for cases of language impairment or inconsistent test results, and table VI is used in all other hearing loss ratings. Based on research and statistical studies conducted by the Veterans Health Administration, we propose the addition of two new provisions to ยง4.85. The first new provision, designated as ยง4.85(d), directs that the rating specialist choose the higher Roman numeral designation derived from table VI or VIa whenever puretone thresholds in four of five specified testing frequencies (500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz (Hz)) are 55 decibels hearing level (dBHL) or more. While results of speech discrimination tests with this type of hearing loss in a controlled setting are often near normal, they do not reflect the true extent of difficulty understanding speech in the everyday work environment, even with the use of hearing aids. Table VIa, which measures pure tone loss only, will be used as an alternative to the combination of speech discrimination and pure tone scores for this particular configuration of hearing loss, but only if it results in a higher evaluation. The second new provision (ยง4.85(e)) directs that the rating specialist choose the higher Roman numeral designation derived from table VI or VIa when puretone thresholds are 30 dBHL or less at frequencies of 1000 Hz and below, and are 70 dBHL or more at 2000 Hz. The rating specialist will then elevate the Roman numeral designation to the next higher number. This type of hearing loss is an extreme handicap in the presence of any environmental noise, and often cannot be overcome by the use of hearing aids. It is therefore appropriate to assign the next higher numeric designation in order to compensate for this outcome. The intended effect of these two new provisions is to fairly and accurately assess the hearing disabilities of veterans as reflected in a real life industrial setting and is thus a liberalization of the current version of this section of the Schedule.
