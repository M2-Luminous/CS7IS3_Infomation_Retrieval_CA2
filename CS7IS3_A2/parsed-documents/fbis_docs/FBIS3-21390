Katyal; date and place not given] [Text] From a 75-minute intensive question-and-answer session with a small group of Indian journalists, the Singapore Prime Minister, Mr. Goh Chok Tong, emerged as a clear-headed leader. He did not hedge any query, whether palatable or otherwise. This is evident from the excerpts of the interview, as reported by K.K. Katyal. [THE HINDU] A lot of expectations have been aroused by the planning of the visit to India. I do not know how you look at it. And how in your opinion, the economic relationship could be enhanced. So far the tendency in India is to look westward. Now it is to look eastward. The tendency in your case was to look eastward. I think you are looking westward now. Could you give us a general idea of what you expect of your visit? [Goh] First, I look at the overall picture. Where India's position is, India stands the risk of being marginalised unless India opens up much more rapidly than it has done over the last two years. Europe would be looking more and more inwards. Its priority is to get the Single European Market going. Western Europe would also pay much more attention to Eastern Europe because these countries are neighbours. Western Europe would want to see that these countries progress so that they will not destabilise Europe. In Asia, ASEAN and the East Asian countries are booming. We have formed APEC. The United States will remain engaged in this area. The United States itself is not just looking to Asia and Europe. It is also looking south to Mexico and Chile to AFTA [expansion not given]. So I ask myself, where does that leave India? I came to the conclusion that India would also come to the same conclusion. It must open up and decide how it wishes to integrate its economy. Would it want to integrate with the West or with Asia? Perhaps India should try and do both. In the past, India looked towards the former Soviet Union, and the West, but India would now see that East Asia would be booming away over the next 15-20 years. So I think India would also therefore want to look towards East Asia. Here I see the opportunity where Singapore can play a part. [THE HINDU] But Mr. Prime Minister, this question may be put to you when you are there. We have already embarked on this process of liberalisation and you must have watched it. What are your impressions? You talked about opening up, but we are on the path. [Goh] The results are actually remarkable. But they have been overshadowed by the great interest shown in China's more rapid growth. [THE HINDU] By countries of East Asia? [Goh] By the world. But if you examine the data for India, I would say they are remarkable. The growth, 1990-1991, was in the region of 1.4-1.5 per cent. After the opening up, it went up by more than three times to over 4 per cent per annum. Your foreign exchange reserves have gone up very rapidly. Foreign investments have flowed into India. Much slower compared to investments flowing into East Asia but, nevertheless, in terms of volume, much more than investments flowing into India over the last 40 years. Inflation has been brought down. [THE HINDU] Before your visit was finalised, at your National Day Rally in August, you spoke of generating "a mild India fever." Closer to your visit, in what form do you see that happening? [Goh] I would want to excite Singapore investors in the potential of India. I would want to encourage Singapore investors to jointly invest with Indian businessmen in India, both for the domestic market, which is huge as well as for the export market. When Singapore investors go to India, I hope that they would make at least 25 per cent of their production for the export market. We also have interest in property development. But India, of course, has its own rules at the moment which will not allow foreign investors to buy land in India. I do not know whether there are possibilities over here. Singaporeans, by and large, are good in adding values to land, by putting up industrial facilities, hotels and residential properties. I would want to explore this area, to see how we can use our strength in property development in India. [THE HINDU] When people talk about India and countries like Singapore going into India, they always compare India with China, Vietnam, Indonesia or even across the causeway to Johor. What do you think India has to do to generate the level of interest as, for example, China, Vietnam and Indonesia? [Goh] India is a giant which has not realised its own potential. So India would have to be confident that it can compete internationally. India would have to face this challenge and just open up many sectors of its economy to competition, like what China has done. China, by welcoming foreign investors, has forced its state enterprises to be more competitive. India could, likewise, open up its internal economy to external competition and I believe India can compete. That confidence India must have in itself. This message, if it comes through strongly, will excite international interest. [THE HINDU] Are there any specific problems that Singapore businessmen have as far as India is concerned? [Goh] Until recently, India had not opened up. So it was very difficult for foreign investors, including Singapore businessmen, to invest in India. At the moment, there are some concerns over some bureaucratic rules which hamper investments. I think these are areas where one has got to learn to negotiate. These rules are becoming more transparent and simpler. [THE HINDU] The information technology park project in Bangalore is encouraging (and sends) positive signals. By contrast, there is the Madras Corridor project, I do not know what stage it is in. What are the lessons to be learnt from the two experiences? [Goh] The situation is different for both projects. Bangalore already has a core activity. When we showed interest in the industrial park in Bangalore, it was just adding on another layer to what had been going on. The Madras Corridor is something new. I would want to have more experience before we embark further into the Madras Corridor project. It is a huge project. We would not want to initiate an undertaking unless we are certain that success will come out of it. So it is on the back burner for the time being. [THE HINDU] A question about APEC. This is the region that the Americas think is the fastest growing. Do you think that India can, at some stage, become a member or play a role as an associate member? [Goh] The question would not arise over the next three years. APEC has decided not to consider new applicants for the next three years. Thereafter, it depends very much on India. If India's economy is more and more integrated with the Asian economy and it is also exporting to the United States and buying from the Americans, then India should certainly be considered as a potential member. If relations are quite limited, then it is an academic question. [THE HINDU] Has there been a change in your perceptions of India politically and strategically, from the time you were Defence Minister to now? [Goh] Yes. Partly because of India's stance on Cambodia and partly because of India's linkages with the former Soviet Union... I have to confess that I was a little worried reading reports of India's acquisition of a blue-water fleet, and reading the remarks by one of your generals who said that India intended to stretch its power from Singapore to Africa. Maybe this was just rhetoric of generals. But when these remarks appeared in cold print, you ask yourself, "What for?", "Why does India have to stretch its power from Singapore to Africa?" My perception has changed. As I got to understand India better, I saw that India has a legitimate interest to want to have a good navy to be able to defend its long coastline. Also, India is opening up and is not spending more on defence. [THE HINDU] Mr. Prime Minister, in this region, Japan and China are major factors. Do not you think ASEAN and Singapore need to strengthen the dealings with India so as to restore the balance in the overall context, both in the security and the political context? Is there a case for that? [Goh] Certainly. We see China emerging as a very strong economic giant in Asia. There is no reason why India should not develop also into a strong giant. When you have two friendly big economies in the area, it is going to benefit everybody. [THE HINDU] Mr. Prime Minister, looking at South Asia, is there any cause for concern when there are tensions between India and Pakistan over Kashmir, or over this issue about NPT, etc? On these issues what are your views? [Goh] We have some concern but they are not big concerns. Our linkages in terms of trade and investments are not on a large scale with that area. It does not really have too high an impact on our own economy. Politically, the Indians and Pakistanis in Singapore are now Singaporeans. They are much less affected by events in India and Pakistan. This would not have been so 30 years ago when Indians and Pakistanis still felt they were part of India and Pakistan and they would be emotionally caught up. The key comes down to whether there are emotional links between the two countries. If there are strong links, when things go wrong in that part of the world, this would affect us. [THE HINDU] Mr. Prime Minister, going back to APEC and ASEAN, one perception is that it should be restricted to cooperation for economic development among countries of this region. How do you envisage the relationship between ASEAN and APEC with other countries in this region? Do you think you are diluting by making APEC a superstructure and keeping some countries, like India, out of it? [Goh] APEC will not be at the expense of ASEAN. ASEAN is an organisation for countries in the area and we will continue to explore ways to integrate our economies through the ASEAN Free Trade Area where tariffs are going to be lowered much faster and go down to lower levels. APEC enables ASEAN to reach out to countries with which we have strong links. It also enables us to get United States to remain constructively engaged in the area. They complement one another. India is not kept out. India is not a member because its interests so far are different. When India begins to have more trade with APEC member countries, we would be very interested in bringing India to our forums. [THE HINDU] Do you think over a period of time, the leadership will go to the hands of the United States? [Goh] Of APEC? No, no. [THE HINDU] Going back to China, Singapore is in a unique position to assess the evolution of modern China. How do you see China? Some see it as a benign military power. some see it as a growing economic power which would take on a forward posture in the world. How do you read what China is going to be? [Goh] We take a realistic approach. We see both challenges and opportunities in China's growth. The opportunities are obvious. It is a huge market which offers us investments and trade. The challenges, of course, would be the nagging problem as to how a big economic power would behave in the future, whether it would translate into military power or political power, or a domineering China which wants to dictate other countries' behaviour. The practical approach is to get China constructively engaged in the political and economic processes of the region. In that way, China will understand better the aspirations and fears of its neighbours. Likewise, the neighbours of China would also understand better China's aspirations and problems. [THE HINDU] It was in this context that I had asked earlier whether there is a merit in an enhanced relationship with India, so that it provides a balance vis-a-vis whatever China may be in the future. [Goh] I would not want to go into this geopolitics of balance. I will just simply say that India is a giant with tremendous potential and if India realises its potential, that is going to bring benefits for countries in the region. If you set out to try and encourage India to balance China, you are creating a huge problem when there is not any. If India becomes an economic giant, that is in our interest. Of course we want to engage India in such a way that when India acquires new weaponry, it will not cause its neighbours to be overly concerned. Because you are then meshed in with the economies and interests of your neighbours. [THE HINDU] Mr. Prime Minister, ASEAN is a big success in the economic sense and perhaps in the security context also. SAARC has yet to take off. What are the reasons for these two developments? [Goh] I have not done a deep study on SAARC so my observations may be superficial. I think first, the ASEAN has a longer history than SAARC. ASEAN is 27 years [old]. SAARC is only about seven years old. Secondly, in ASEAN, we have a few middle-income countries. SAARC is still an association of rather poor members. Thirdly, whilst several ASEAN countries have always been outward looking, the members in SAARC, have mainly been inward looking. In terms of economic strategy, India until recently has been inward looking. So has Pakistan been. With such an attitude, where is the scope for regional cooperation? In ASEAN, Malaysia, Singapore, and, to some extent, Thailand and Indonesia, have always been outward looking. So there are therefore benefits and compelling reasons for us to try and link our economies together so that we can reinforce each other and grow faster. Also we do not have intractable problems like some members of SAARC have. [THE HINDU] Like between India and Pakistan. [Goh] India and Pakistan. [THE HINDU] A lot of countries like Singapore seem to have completely forgiven communist countries for their past, whereas they have not quite forgiven countries like India which were friendly with the Communist countries. It is like being more sinned against than sinning. [Goh] Where do you get the perception from? [THE HINDU] From talking to people here. [Goh] I am very surprised. [THE HINDU] Mr. Prime Minister, even in Japan for instance, they have not quite forgiven us for being friendly with Soviet Union at that time. And they still talk about expropriation or nationalisation which has not happened for 30 years. [Goh] I think it could be a misconception. China is different. China is controlled by one party. If the party has decided to change course, the question we ask ourselves is who comes after Deng Xiaoping. Would the course be changed? And most of us have come to the conclusion that economic reforms in China would not be changed whoever is in charge in ten years' time. Therefore, there is confidence that the system will continue. For India, the democratic political processes can produce somebody who campaigns on the basis of nationalisation. And if that somebody wins, he is going to nationalise. So we ask ourselves the same question we are asking ourselves of China, would reforms in India stay on course. [THE HINDU] What is your perception? [Goh] If Prime Minister Rao and Finance Minister Manmohan Singh have another four or five years, it will stay on course. [THE HINDU] Taking that argument further, would it be logical to say that in a situation like India--democracy is a liability for economic reforms? If there is a possibility of change in government then reforms cannot stay on course? [Goh] It depends on the alternatives. If the alternative viewpoints espoused by the opposition parties are not very different from the present government, as far as reforms are concerned then there is no liability. The question is who can do the job better or faster. But if the opposition espouses another viewpoint, talk about nationalisation when they come into power. [THE HINDU] Or anti multi-national... [Goh] Or anti multi-nationals in this issue. And they look like coming to power, then of course, nobody is going to invest. It is not a liability or a strength. I think it depends on the reality of the situation. [THE HINDU] There are some unflattering comments about the functioning of the democratic system here. What do you think about this? [Goh] We always go by the market test. They can write what they want. But the point is national leaders and investors still seek to talk to us. [THE HINDU] Mr. Prime Minister, if I have to ask a hypothetical question if you have to look at your crystal ball and make a prophecy--10 years from now, how do you see India-Singapore relations? [Goh] Ten years from now, our trade will increase several fold. Singapore will have a bigger presence in India. Political relations will be much warmer and closer than today. And we will certainly see more Indian leaders visiting Singapore. [THE HINDU] And more journalists. (laughter)
