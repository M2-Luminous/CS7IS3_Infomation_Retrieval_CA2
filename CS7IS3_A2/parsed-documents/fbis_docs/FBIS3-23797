And by no means because their number will be increased and Nakhararism will emerge by subterranean passageway, say. The number of top officials of the state will not change. It is simply that no one, aside from them, wants to live in this country. Because, as has become clear following the recent parliamentary debate, they alone in Armenia have a good life, and they will yield this fine life of theirs to no one for anything. It is ordained for all the rest under these conditions that they either let go of their own volition or clear off home. In terms of the growth of somberness of the forecasts we have, it should be noted, broken all world records. A year ago it seemed that a million people could at the very least live on this land. Now we ourselves are standing amazed at our naivete of last year. And not only us. Everyone all around is talking about this, and it is only a few Nakharar ministers who disagree with this opinion. It is they who will continue to live here, consequently. If they remain ministers, of course. The absurdity of such an idea should not come as any surprise. People capable of being surprised in this way are hardly to be found because our society has lost this capacity also. Being surprised means displaying emotions. We, however, are for the most part unimputable. Except, of course, those who with risible friskiness continue to cling to power. In having ensured by hook or by crook that all ministers without exception speak at the parliamentary lectern, Speaker Ararktsyan did them a bad turn, I believe. The public at large, to whom they are virtually unknown, suddenly gagged on such a powerful stream of unprofessionalism, impudent complacency, dismissive attitude toward the troubles of their compatriots, and ability to unblushingly lie, blackmail, intimidate.... The impetuosity of this step was obvious also from its results: The Nakharars, summoned to the attack, by no means dispelled the oppressive impression remaining following the speeches of representatives of the opposition but intensified it even more. Not acknowledging even a part of the gravity of what they have wrought, the gentlemen of state have become professional trouble-bearers not only in the eyes of their political opponents but of all of society also. Throughout the civilized world just one thing is required of parliament--the timely adoption of laws and efficient supervision of their fulfillment. Our members of parliament, however, are being set by the government, in the person of its ministers, the task of procuring gasoline, speeding up bank transactions, effecting barter deals, and, generally, switching over entirely to the spheres of activity for whose malfunction-free realization ministers are supposed to exist. And since the deputies are not doing this, they are not, consequently, entitled to criticize those who are strenuously creating the appearance of this "doing." The habit of constantly erecting Potemkin villages is becoming second nature even in the most critical situations. Ministers just about mouthed from the parliamentary platform the essentially primitive truth: While you, deputies, are here making speeches and forcing us to listen to them, inflation at the markets continues its victorious progression. Have done as quickly as possible and let us go, get down to business, and save the nation. And this is being said to a hall that is constantly protesting this influx of members of the government into parliament and demanding an end to the stream of monotonous maxims of the holders of high office. After all, ministers had sufficient time to discharge their direct duties before the sitting of parliament! But here it was ascertained that it was these two tense parliamentary days that were the cause of all the misfortunes that have come crashing down on our heads! Bagratyan led out into the field of battle his entire host in the manifest hope of winning. He did so at the price of a demonstration of the "splendor" and misery of the cabinet he heads. Whether he won or not is another matter. The main thing is that the population of the republic is the loser.
