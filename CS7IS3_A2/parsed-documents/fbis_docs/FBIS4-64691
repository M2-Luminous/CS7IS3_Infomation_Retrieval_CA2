Hagen's Party Splits"] [Text] Oslo -- Norway's Progress Party split yesterday. Three of the party's Storting deputies left the party. Another deputy had already gone his own way and the party deputy chairman had already resigned. This means that party leader Carl I. Hagen will have a Storting group of only six deputies, while the four breakaways will start to work together. Compared with New Democracy in Sweden where the party's founders disappeared and women took over, the reverse is the case in Norway. Carl I. Hagen, who has been party leader for 16 years, has kicked the women and all the opposition to him out of the party leadership. He is now being referred to as the "party owner" in the Norwegian press and has returned to the populism that characterized the party in the 1989 election when his party become Norway's third largest and had 22 Storting deputies. It was after this formidable success that Hagen believed that he could build up a more serious party. Young people who had been attracted into the party because of the radical change it represented enjoyed rapid careers. However, it turned out that they had views that could not automatically be reconciled with those of the older populists in the party: They were in favor of free immigration, Norwegian EU [European Union] membership, and the right for homosexuals to marry. The conflict came to a head at the party congress in mid-April. Deputy chairman Ellen Wibe resigned when Carl I. Hagen proposed that the congress should not reach a decision on Norwegian membership in the EU. However, it was Hagen who won over the majority of delegates and who demanded blind obedience. "The walls of the party closed in so much that they made it very difficult to breathe. If we had not resigned voluntarily, we would have been thrown out," said Ellen Christiansen, one of the Storting deputies who has now quit the Progress Party, which notched up 5 percent of voter sympathies in the most recent opinion poll.
