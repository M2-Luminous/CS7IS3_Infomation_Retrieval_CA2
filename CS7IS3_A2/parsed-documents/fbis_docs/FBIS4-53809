Datuk Sri Anwar, who was in Singapore to attend an international conference here, was speaking at a news conference before returning to Malaysia. He said Asian countries should not just talk about moral decadence of the West. Instead, they also need to address their own excesses and to recognize growing demand for greater openness and accountability. Datuk Anwar said he was worried people would think that progress can be measured purely by economic indices. He said the Asian renaissance he has spoken of would also have a cultural and moral dimension. Datuk Anwar also spoke informally with Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong at a dinner last night. Referring to Mr. Goh's comments that he would welcome the North American Free Trade Agreement being extended to Asian countries, Datuk Anwar said he would bring this up with Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed. Turning to a suggestion for a link between the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement [AFTA] and Australia and New Zealand, Datuk Anwar said ASEAN needs to get AFTA set up first. Then only can arrangements or synergy with others in the subregion be considered. Datuk Anwar also said Malaysia is supportive of the peace process in the Middle East. Assuming the process continues and there is a final settlement between Israel and the PLO, Malaysia is open to an early recognition of Israel and normalization of relations.
