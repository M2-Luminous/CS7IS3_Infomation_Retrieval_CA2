That is the result of a survey conducted by the Public Opinion Research Center [OBOP] at the end of March. A majority of Polish people (58 percent) think that the affairs of the country are heading in the wrong direction. Only one in four Poles is of the opinion that the situation is improving. Seventy-nine percent of those polled say that moods among people are bad, and just 15 percent think they are good. Among the optimists, the most prevalent social groups are young people under age 19 (32 percent) and people who are well off financially (26 percent). One-fourth of those polled predict an improvement in living conditions over the next three years, but one-third think that conditions will deteriorate. The latter view is shared most often by people between the ages of 40 and 49, with primary vocational educations and who are in poor financial condition. Assessments regarding the current economic situation in the country are not the best, either. Only 5 percent of those polled think that the country's economic development is satisfactory, but as many as half of those polled (44 percent) are of the opposite view. The number of people dissatisfied with the way democracy is developing in Poland is also on the increase (64 percent). It is the highest percentage since August 1993 of people negatively evaluating the social transformations. * * * The survey was conducted by OBOP in the period 23-29 March of this year, using a random sample of 1,197 people.
