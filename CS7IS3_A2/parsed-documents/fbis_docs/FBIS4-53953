Under the current law, at least 3 percent of the policyholders have to unite to file a suit to check their insurer's management situation or possible illegal activities. That requirement practically prohibits policyholders from seeking law protection, particularly if their insurance firms are large. For example, in the case of Nippon Life Insurance Co., a policyholder would have to call and unite more than 450,000 other policyholders to bring a suit. According to the ministry sources, the other risk-managing measures include establishing a finance body to salvage any financially troubled insurers, and allowing issuance of corporate bonds to insurers as a means of new fund-raising channels. Reorganizing insurance firms into a joint-stock corporation from the current mutual aid status is also being sought so to strengthen their management in the face of increasing competition, they said. The measures are planned by the Insurance Council, an advisory panel to the finance minister, as part of regulation reforms ahead of foreign entry in Japan's life and nonlife insurance industries. With the suggestions, the Finance Ministry is likely to put the new guidelines into effect in the spring of 1996, the sources added.
