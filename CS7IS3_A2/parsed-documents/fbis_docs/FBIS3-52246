The CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY cites informed sources as saying that an attempt to assassinate President Ilyas al-Hirawi a month ago has been uncovered. The security agencies arrested a number of suspects and they are being interrogated. The security agencies apprehended a network in the north a few days ago. The network is suspected of engineering recent explosions in different areas; its members belong to extremist groups that seek to sow sedition by undermining stability. The security agencies have also apprehended members of a network in the south, made up of extremist Palestinians who cooperate mostly with Lebanese elements with criminal records. They are being interrogated to discover any links between the various attempts to undermine stability, the latest of which was the explosion at the Phalangist Party's central headquarters.
