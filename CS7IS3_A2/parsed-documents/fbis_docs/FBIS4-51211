Regarding this problem, entities set up by Taiwan and Hong Kong businessmen are the most serious. The investigation shows that small-sized foreign-funded companies have heavily involved in the above mentioned activities. Employees working in these institutions and companies, owing to failure of obtaining protection from labour departments of the local governments, are generally earning a comparatively low salary and even facing a threat of being dismissed when they pass their best period of age. And because of short of backing by an organizational institution, their lawful rights and interests including pensions, medical charges, insurance of unemployment, labour insurance for their families and allowance for dismissal have also not been guaranteed.
