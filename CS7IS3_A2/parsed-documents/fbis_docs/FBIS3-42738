The eternal philosophical question "How to Live?" has turned for many of our compatriots into a desperate query: "How to Survive?" Two years ago Ukraine inherited a total general crisis. Along with independence, the Ukrainian people got an opportunity to live by their own wits. How did they use this opportunity? The Soviet Union disappeared from the map two years ago; yet, we still have a part of the Soviet economic system, not yet a Ukrainian economy. Production is not geared toward Ukrainian resources and needs but toward making output which we do not need from raw materials and components which we do not have. This is why without a radical structural overhaul of the Ukrainian economy based on its resources and needs we will neither be able to provide a normal life for the people nor achieve complete independence for the country. Nor will a structural overhaul be enough in itself. We must stop the printing press which churns out money. This reminds me of the comic play "The Wedding in Malinovka" and its colorful character, Popandopulo the Financier. He is no miser: on the contrary, he pays readily with the money which he himself prints, repeating: "Go ahead, take it; I can draw myself new bills." It seems that the monetary policy of the National Bank is based on the same principle. While irresponsible emission weakens the karbovanets, the use of hard currency in domestic transactions renders it totally useless. Until Ukrainian money becomes the only legal tender in Ukraine, the talk of stabilizing Ukrainian finances will only serve to disguise anti-Ukrainian financial policies. I am not proposing to restore the Iron Curtain or bring back xenophobia: since the exchange of currency is an integral part of a normally functioning economy, how come there are stores all over Ukraine, where Ukrainian money is not accepted? An integral part of the current financial policy is the fixing of the dollar exchange rate by the National Bank. In general, it is normal to have fixed exchange rates. In Poland, for instance, it is one of the most important components of Balcerowics' brilliant stabilization plan. Nor does it matter what level the exchange rate is set at, as long as it is a rate of exchange (i.e., of free purchase and sale), and not confiscation. How else to call the compulsory exchange of one half of their hard currency earnings imposed on enterprises? And, to make sure that they could not make up their losses by selling the rest of their hard currency at the currency exchange, the exchange has now been shut down. Money, both foreign and domestic, has a bad luck in Ukraine. Both experts and officials at every level have talked so much of new money being printed, or already printed, that monetary reform became unavoidable. Expectations of it in Ukraine as well as abroad are so strong that from the psychological point of view the karbovanets can no longer be stabilized. How to stabilize a currency that has lost all credibility and whose replacement is expected from one day to the next? The optimal solution would be to introduce the hryvna in parallel with the karbovanets and then to withdraw the latter gradually. Perhaps other methods would turn out to be better. But should this candy-wrapper game go on? The choice is up to us. Simple replacement of one kind of paper with another would not be of any use. The proper effect would be achieved only by coordinated monetary and banking reform in the context of general economic reform. What is needed is a two-level banking infrastructure with the National Bank at the top level and a broad network of flexible, independent, mainly private commercial banks at the lower level. The hryvna may be brought into circulation from the start as freely convertible within Ukraine. Creating the hard currency stabilization fund to support the exchange rate is a feasible task, if it is given the highest priority. However, the stabilization fund will be exhausted quickly unless there are goods that the hryvna can buy. Until the engine of the market economy starts humming, it could be mainly real estate and land. There is no reason to fear: privatized land plots will not go anywhere from Ukraine but will be utilized more efficiently--including also by those who band together into cooperatives. Our state is not poor, it is rich. It is the Ukrainian people who are poor. The state owns 90 percent of all property: the land, the raw materials, the factories and the stores--practically all of Ukraine. This enormous wealth is not traded (at least not legally); it has been artificially withdrawn from the market and is not tradable. Since there is a shortage of goods for sale, prices go up, inflation increases and money quickly loses its value. It is not profitable to invest into long-term projects which are necessary to establish new enterprises, restructure existing ones and effect a structural overhaul--in short, to develop production. As a result, money is either spent in retail trade, where it turns over quickly, or is siphoned abroad, where business conditions are much more favorable. In Ukraine, meanwhile, inflation, combined with the decline of output, is turning into stagflation. In these conditions, privatization is the greatest anti-monopoly factor. State monopoly, on the other hand, makes it possible to hike prices without shame and with impunity. The domination of the state sector in the production of consumer goods and retail trade means a harsh choice between an orgy of price hikes which we see today and low prices with a gradual but inexorable withdrawal of goods from legal trade which we had in the past. Private production and trade mean sufficient quantity of goods and socially acceptable prices, whereas state production and trade result either in out-of-this-world prices on down-to-earth goods or in low prices on nonexistent goods. Some 2,000 years ago, in his treatise "On Duties" Cicero wrote as though it had long been obvious: "It is important that people use public property as public and private property as their own." Thousands of years have passed. Today's bureaucrats have grown accustomed to managing public property "in the name and on the behalf of the people," which means totally without accountability. If we take into account that they control land, residential and commercial real estate and plenty of other property, it would become clear that a gold mine is like nothing compared to what the bureaucrats have. Combined with a variety of permits, licenses and limitations, excessive state power becomes the foundation for abuse and corruption. This is why the black market is the only one that flourishes and constantly grows in Ukraine. Privatization will move great quantities of goods from the black market to the legal one. There is no better cure from both inflation and corruption. Ukraine is not yet democratic, but it is no longer totalitarian. People can talk, hold rallies and strike. Employees of the state sector can now press their demands, which are both reasonable and, at the same time, unrealistic. People think that the state, if it only wished, could satisfy everybody's demands. Similar problems exist in France, Italy and other countries. This clearly shows that a market economy, democracy and a large state sector are incompatible, because a great temptation arises to seek improvements in the living standard not in accordance with economic development but by means of non-economic pressure. In the West, the low point was reached during miner strikes in the 1970s in Great Britain, which in a large measure brought about the replacement of the Labor government by the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher. The problem was solved radically and efficiently: by privatization. As a result, the living standard in Great Britain increased considerably, including that of workers, and especially that of miners. For the same reasons privatization was effected in the Canadian province of British Columbia, in Australia and in New Zealand. Privatization is going on in France, Germany, Sweden and Italy. And in every country of the former USSR. Except in Ukraine. These examples lead to the following conclusion: mass privatization has a major positive impact, both immediate and indirect. This is not a concession to fashion, nor another imported idea, but a deliberate step toward healing the economy. This is why the Party of Democratic Renewal of Ukraine (PDVU) advocates rapid, large-scale privatization of both small and large enterprises. However, privatization alone will not suffice. We also need new, competitive enterprises. This is why privatization must be complemented by the urgent development of private enterprise, most importantly of the small and medium market segments. We have talked often enough of the back-breaking tax burden that law-abiding entrepreneurs cannot afford, but cause for complaint has not diminished. I have already mentioned the fact that the state takes 50 percent of hard currency earnings, paying almost nothing in return. I could mention many other examples of how private enterprise is being pressured, but what for? Questions whether the state creates favorable conditions for economic initiative or inhibits it, or whether it protects citizens from bureaucratic and criminal extortion or encourages it, seem rhetorical. Nevertheless, given the lack of favorable conditions for business activity of the population, these are the questions of survival. There could have been instructions hanging everywhere on how to open and manage a private business, whereas organizing assistance to beginners could have become top priority. The main goal of a private enterprise is return on investment, or profit. The state, on the other hand, has a different set of priorities. A state entrepreneur is above all a servant of the state. His goal is to do what is best for the state and for his career, not business considerations. A private enterprise is much more efficient than a state one. This has been proven by historical experience and is clearly illustrated by the living standards of the people in the Free World. Since the Iron Curtain has fallen, only those who do not want to hear do not know this. Social Democratic parties, after coming to power, traditionally carried out nationalization. As a result, a sizable state sector exists in the West. But they have become convinced that this is harmful and have revised their programs radically. Now they advocate strong social security systems within the confines of the free market economy. Rich people do not exist only in America: they exist everywhere where there is money. They existed under Stalin's orthodox socialism and under Brezhnev's developed socialism; they exist today, too, while socialism is on its death throes. But only the market economy helps create a large class of proprietors, the third estate. In developed countries it has become the majority of the population. It is comprised of businessmen and farmers, teachers and doctors, scientists and skilled workers. Prosperity does not fall from the skies like manna, nor does the middle class appear out of nothing, as though by magic. It is built up gradually, with diligence and hard work. Neither the Europeans nor the Americans have always had the kind of standard of living they enjoy today. Nor do all countries with a market economy prosper yet. There is no ideal, but there are decent examples and, therefore, hope. The living standard in countries which combine the market economy with a multiparty parliamentary system is considerably better than in any other social structure that humanity has known. Availability of goods, a large middle class and the fruits of the market economy are the guarantees of stability and dynamic, harmonious development of society. Lack of energy and raw materials and irregularities in foreign commercial relations, primarily with Russia, are a reality. But how important can this be when gas, water and other valuable resources are squandered without control and the energy intensity of production in Ukraine exceeds considerably the same indicators in France, Germany and Denmark? The insistence that external factors are the main cause of our problems is empty talk, substitution of the root causes of our economic crisis with other, less important ones and an attempt to shun responsibility for our own shortcomings. Our state is not poor, our country has not been cursed with a poor climate and our land is fertile and has other resources. It is not Ukraine that is resource-poor; it is Iceland that lacks resources and is but a volcanic island battered by the winds. Yet, its per capita income is a little higher than in the US. Denmark is a country perched on dunes; yet, its people live so well that only after a second attempt they were persuaded to approve the Maastricht Treaty. The Japanese also live well. The wonder is not that we live poorly but that we are alive at all. We live poorly because government leaders have bad policies which do not encourage people to work but to beg, demand and steal. Why do we have such policies? Of course, there is plenty of incompetence and lack of professionalism. The traditional brain drain to Moscow and lack of experience governing a country and not a province and poor professional education under the Soviet regime all have had their impact. Moreover, a Soviet economist and an economist are not the same thing; nor is it always clear which impulse in the leadership would win over: that which comes from the experience of management or of destruction. But above and beyond all these factors, the fact is that the ruling elite implements the kind of policy it wants. Ukraine is not ruled by little kids but by rational human beings who make conscious decisions and consciously accept their obvious, foreseeable consequences. There is no need either to discover America, or to reinvent the wheel, or to seek out a nonexistent program for a quick and painless transition to a living standard similar to that of Sweden or even of Greece. The fundamentals of the true market economy, which are in the main identical in Japan, the EU and the US, are well-known. So are the blueprints for accelerated development of Third World countries and for the transition of socialist economies to the free market. Not only are they well-known, but they have been tested in practice, as continuously proven to work in Europe, Asia and Russia. Problems do arise, but the ultimate success of such policies is already clear--in those countries where they have been adopted. In Ukraine, on the other hand, laws on the privatization of small and large enterprises that were passed a year and a half ago have not been implemented yet. State privatization programs for 1992 and 1993 were deliberately sabotaged. The same is true of the Cabinet of Ministers' decree on the privatization of backyard and dacha plots for 1993. Are the authorities ignorant of this? Or perhaps they lack the ability? No, it is desire that they lack. Property without proprietors, business without businessmen allows them to combine without accountability the license of an owner with the lack of responsibility of a hired hand. If you can live like this you do not want to change anything. But it can not go on like this. Privatization is unavoidable. Life and economic necessity will gain the upper hand. Everybody understands this. Preparation for large-scale privatization goes on. In a rather unusual way, however. Transition to a corporate structure, breakup of large enterprises, buyouts and commercialization go on slowly and in some cases only superficially. But, at the same time, busy replacement of signs and the establishment of pseudo-market entities and small enterprises in the state sector that live off state authority go full-steam ahead. On the one hand, this is a way to transfer public funds and even property into private pockets and, on the other, a seizure of advantageous starting positions which, once mass privatization has been declared, would automatically lead to the transfer of better properties into privileged hands. Based on this scenario, mass privatization would formally begin only after the de facto privatization of highly profitable properties has been completed. There are many tasty morsels, and it takes time to share them out. Privatization is being delayed while the lion is getting ready to leap. Those who are willing to learn can learn a lesson from history: whenever the people realize that property is being distributed unfairly there is trouble. In 1961, the Russian Emperor granted the serfs freedom without land. The outcome is well-known. Since the majority of the population have been excluded from privatization and have no chance of acquiring their fair share of national (and not state) property, none of the leaders will be able to sleep or to conduct business in peace. Freedom without property is a time bomb placed under the privatization process as well as under the economic future of the country. The specter of communism roams Ukraine. Who does not learn from other revolutions will get his own. This is why the best possible method of privatization is the one that is most fair. Such would be a free distribution of a major portion (more than half) of property among all proprietors, i.e., all Ukrainian citizens. Some maintain that this would mean forced privatization, or collectivization backwards. It is correct. Collectivization was robbery. Distribution among the people would be restitution of stolen property. Indeed, collectivization backwards. Today, this approach is used sparingly and altogether insufficiently. Sum total of privatization--K1.050 million--is clearly too little and the list of targets is too short, while there are few enthusiasts and information about the program is being disseminated poorly. We should learn from Russia or, better still, the Czech Republic, both how to popularize and explain vouchers and to offer a variety of opportunities for making use of them. The people of Ukraine do not suffer from market reforms but from their absence. Not only are market reforms not implemented; they are being systematically discredited. Partly revised and partly monopoly prices are now called free prices, the ongoing theft of property privatization, massive fraud entrepreneurship and the whole thing market reform. In this way, people feel anger and hatred toward the market, reform and reformers. Instead, we hear calls for a state of emergency in the economy and for responsible commissions, committees, etc. There is no need for any such steps. We have had a state of emergency in the economy for 70 years, as well as its advocates in power. Ukraine needs the opposite: a normal economic system and a normal, competent government formed by a normal, politically accountable parliament. From this emerges the key aspect of our differences: politics. Economic reform is the function of power. The hope that it could be implemented by a group of professors of economics is a pipe dream. If those who have political power (the parliament and the president) want reforms and delineate their general direction, specialists will have the responsibility to work out the needed programs and legislative agenda, and administrators to carry them out. Collectivization was not carried out by peasants or by experimental economists, but by Bolshevik leaders. The economic miracle in postwar Germany, achieved under the direct leadership of Economic Minister Erhard, had been first sanctioned by the Allied occupying powers and strongly supported by Chancellor Adenauer and the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union in the Bundestag. Growth in the US and Britain in the 1980s was spearheaded by the political will of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher and their cohorts. The most important precondition for reform is the election of a reformist parliament and a reformist president, and the formation of a reformist government. Can this be achieved in the coming elections? It can, but by accident. The majority in the existing Supreme Council, which only pretended to carry out reform and was busy discrediting it, made sure that the incoming Supreme Council was the same. To this end, it passed the old election law, making it worse. The elections will be held on a non-party basis, which means that the voters will be voting for individual deputies, not for a specific political line, politicians or policy. Existing democracies have several forms of election laws. But they all are meant to establish a parliament whose members are divided into party factions. The majority party forms the government and is therefore responsible for the chosen policy. On the line are votes in the next election. By assessing election platforms of the parties and comparing them with recent past, the voters have a clear framework for deciding for whom to vote. This does not, and cannot, exist in a non-party election in which candidates represent no organized political force or tradition. Political connections and true intentions of so-called independent candidates are all too often concealed and come out only when they are already in the Supreme Council. Multiparty elections are a way to achieve a functional, well-structured and responsible government, while non-party elections are a way to create a politically anonymous, irresponsible Supreme Council. Success does not come in a day. Western countries reached prosperity only after they combined the market economy with a multiparty democracy. The same process is now under way in countries which only recently were living under dictatorship, such as Spain, Portugal, Chile and South Korea. It is not an accident that the Supreme Council, whose policy has been to impede market reforms, has chosen as its political priority the path of sabotaging a multiparty system. It would be naive to hope that a Supreme Council elected in this manner, whatever its composition, would improve our living standards. As long as supporters of economic and political democracy remain divided and disorganized, the party in power will continue to pursue its line, accompanied by vile demagoguery. In short, economic and political reform can only be blocked due to the weakness of its supporters. The only way to be respected is to become strong, and the only way to do so is to unite. A club of like-minded people is a good idea but it is not enough. A voter club is also a good idea, but it is not a lasting one. We need permanent, stable organizations of citizens: parties. Do not wait for favors from above--they are not forthcoming. Unite instead.
