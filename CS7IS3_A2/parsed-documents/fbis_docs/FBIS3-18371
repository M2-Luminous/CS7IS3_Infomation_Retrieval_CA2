This applies particularly to the unit that bears the name "Communications Group," which, it was recently revealed, has been cooperating with the Cologne Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution [BfV]. In the draft amendment to the BGS Law, the government has admitted for the first time that the Communications Group has been carrying out eavesdropping operations for the Cologne-based bumblers as part of "interagency assistance." This concerns a practice that is to receive a new legal basis as a result of the amendment. One of the justifications advanced in the government draft is that BGS "support for the BfV in the field of communications technology" is used in uncovering secret service communications activities being conducted by other countries. However, it is also of significance in the surveillance of foreign terrorist groups. The BfV needs the BGS in order to establish whether right- or left-wing extremists groups are seeking "to intercept security agency radio communications and identify frequencies." That is apparently only half the truth. People who are well informed about the BGS report that their eavesdropping operations are not confined to requests from the BfV. The "Communications Group," which comes under the authority of the Border Security Presidium West in Bonn, is also supposed to conduct operations of its own -- it is also supposed to work for the Federal German Intelligence Service. The results of the operations are not only passed on to the appropriate services in Pullach and Cologne, but are also used by the BGS itself. This means that in practice, the BGS violates the separation of the police and secret services, which is rooted in the constitution, on almost on a daily basis. Within the BGS itself, the "Communications Group" is considered an autonomous unit. The technical facilities of the group, which is based in Swisttal-Heimerzheim, are described as being very modern and eavesdropping operations could be conducted "as far as the Urals." The terse justification is "border security operations." So, some questions remain open, such as whether the BGS has recently started ensuring the security of borders in the Urals.
