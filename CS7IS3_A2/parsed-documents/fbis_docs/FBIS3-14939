Asked whether he thinks that those who walked free from the Lefortovo prison were criminals, Kazannik replies: "As a former procurator general I cannot make any such comment. This matter is exclusively in the jurisdiction of a court. I may have a personal opinion about them, but if they were amnestied, they have to be released immediately, whether I like them or not. The law is the law." Asked whether Yeltsin and his entourage put any pressure on him last week, Kazannik says: "Definitely. Because Baturin's message contained a proposal to disobey or at least to drag out the amnesty act. Meanwhile, Boris Nikolayevich's [Yeltsin] resolution said the following: Kazannik, Galushko, and Yerin are to follow Baturin's instructions. This was direct pressure. This was direct intervention into the jurisdiction of the procurator general." Aleksey Kazannik goes on to say that his duty, as procurator general, was "to implement a resolution of the State Duma on a political and economic amnesty." He says that he contacted Yeltsin on Friday and asked him to repeal his orders, but Yeltsin categorically refused to do so. During his conversation with Yeltsin, he offered his resignation, but Yeltsin refused to accept it, and demanded that Kazannik find a way out of the situation. Asked whether Yeltsin made it clear what sort of solution he was seeking for that situation, Kazannik replies: "No, he did not make it clear, but later his immediate entourage, his advisers tried to help me find a solution. But it was an unlawful solution. In fact, our conversation on Friday boiled down to how to stop the State Duma resolution." He says that he was told to ask the Duma to clarify the meaning of the word "immediately," to explain the fact that one part of the resolution calls for a general amnesty while another part only mentions Article 79 of the Constitution, and to define the difference between an amnesty and a pardon. Kazannik continues: "Under pressure, I was forced to say that the procuracy would indeed ask the State Duma for these clarifications, but nevertheless, I repeatedly said that the procuracy had nothing to do with this. The procuracy has no legislative powers. It does not question, but strictly follows legal enactments." Kazannik adds that some ideas put forward by Yeltsin's advisers were simply laughable, such as the suggestion to declare the resolution invalid because it was published in the wrong section of ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA. Kazannik goes on to say that he is sorry if he disappointed Yeltsin by not obeying him, but when Yeltsin had appointed him, he accepted the post on the understanding that he would strictly follow the laws of the country, rather than personal orders. In conclusion, Nikolay Svanidze says that Aleksey Kazannik is going to give up his recently acquired official residence and move back to his native Omsk. Meanwhile, the executive power in Moscow seems to be in complete disarray.
