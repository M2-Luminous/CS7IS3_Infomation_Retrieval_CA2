The officials of the Defense Industry Undersecretariat [DIU] have said that far from moving to impose an arms embargo, the European countries are competing with each other to sell their arms to Turkey. Recalling that France will sell Super Puma helicopters to Turkey in 1995, the DIU officials asserted: "They struggled for many months to sell those helicopters. Will they now decide to inform Turkey that they won't? The European countries will not find it easy to decide to impose an arms embargo on Turkey with their arms industries in difficulty. No one should be worried by the rumors, which have been circulated by a few irresponsible deputies who support the Workers Party of Kurdistan." The same officials said that Turkey and Germany are working on projects relating to frigates, submarines, and other weapon systems. As for Britain, they asserted that the two countries are only working on a project relating to HF-SSB communication systems. The officials asserted: "Almost all the arms used by the security forces in southeast Turkey have either been manufactured locally or acquired from sources other than Germany. Turkey has been acquiring BRT-60 armored vehicles, causing significant argument by the Russian Federation. The security forces will not be helpless if Europe moves to impose an arms embargo on Turkey." Although the DIU officials have said they do not regard the rumors of a possible embargo by the European countries seriously, they have stressed that a similar reaction by the United States may cause a problem. For example, Turkish military aircraft may find it difficult to fulfill their missions.
