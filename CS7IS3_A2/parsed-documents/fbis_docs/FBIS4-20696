There are a few nuclear power information network systems that can be readily accessed using personal computers and modems, but the majority of these systems are closed and can only be accessed and used by power companies, research institutes and other pertinent organizations. And there is a lot of data on nuclear power that has yet to be converted to an electronic format, i.e. databases that have been maintained as-is in hardcopy form, and others which have gone electronic, but which are simply accumulations of individual personal records. The future conversion of stores of valuable data to electronic formats will make it easier to utilize this information, and current efforts such as the ``Data Freeway'' project being sponsored by the Science and Technology Agency (STA) are attempting to stimulate the mutual utilization of this information by various research organs. The storage and use of data via various forms of multi-media such as CD-ROMs will likely become more popular in future as well. We can therefore look forward to the day when these advances will make nuclear power-related information available to the general public, thereby promoting a better understanding of this valuable source of energy. We apologize in advance for the fact that time and space limitations have prevented us from introducing herein more than just a portion of the database systems currently in existence in Japan.
