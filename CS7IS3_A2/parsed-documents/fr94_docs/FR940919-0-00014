FR940919-0-00014 FR940919-0-00002 Alternative disposition strategies for REO may include, at a minimum, sale on an individual basis via broker and sale on an individual basis via auction or sealed bid. For non-performing real estate loans, disposition strategies usually include modification, foreclosure or other legal action, compromise and settlement, and individual sale via auction or sealed bid. Like Subpart A, Subpart B does not apply to real estate-related assets sold simultaneously with a purchase-and-assumption agreement (including option agreements during the duration of the option) or transferred by the RTC to a de novo institution (discussed more fully above under Subpart A). Subpart B, by its terms, does not apply to individual real estate assets with a book value of $400,000 or less or individual non-performing real estate loans with a book value of $1 million or less. In addition, Subpart B does not apply to assets meeting these thresholds, if the RTC determines that a disposition not in conformity with Subpart B and section 21A(w)(3) of the FHLBA would bring a greater return. Finally, subsection (w)(3)(D) provides that no provision in (w)(3) shall supersede the requirements of subsection (w)(2). Section 1640.15 reiterates this principle of implementation by providing that nothing contained in Subpart B supersedes the requirements of (w)(2) or Subpart A. Consequently, all real property with a book value of more than $400,000 must be marketed on an individual basis for a minimum of 120 days in conformity with subsection (w)(2) and Subpart A of these regulations. Administrative Procedure Act The RTC is adopting this rule as an interim rule. It will be effective immediately upon publication in the Federal Register without the usual notice and comment period or delayed effective date generally provided for in the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553. For the most part, this rule implements the express language of section 21A(w) (2) and (3) of the FHLBA, as recently added by the RTC Completion Act. Promulgation of the rule on an expedited basis is necessary to permit the immediate implementation of these new provisions in order to avoid any additional losses that could occur due to a delay in the sales of assets in connection with the resolution of failed thrifts pending the usual delayed effective date. Thus, the RTC finds that the benefits to the public in adopting the interim rule outweigh any possible harm resulting from not seeking comment on the proposed rule in advance of its effective date. The RTC actively solicits comments on this interim rule and will consider those comments in the adoption of the rule as final. Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq., the following initial regulatory flexibility analysis is provided: 1. Reasons, objectives, and legal bases underlying the interim rule. These elements have been discussed above in the Supplementary Information section. 2. Small entities to which the rule would apply. This rule applies only to procedures for the RTC's marketing and disposition of certain types of assets. 3. Impact of the interim rule on small businesses. This rule imposes no burden on small businesses. Rather, as part of the RTC's Small Investor Program, it is intended to offer small businesses greater opportunities to acquire certain types of assets from the RTC. 4. Overlapping or conflicting federal rules. There are no known federal rules that overlap, duplicate, or conflict with the interim rule. 5. Alternatives to the interim rule. The RTC has not identified alternatives that would be less burdensome to small businesses and yet effectively accomplish the objectives of the interim rule because it imposes no burden on small businesses. Request for Public Comment The RTC is issuing this interim rule to implement immediately statutory direction to market and sell real property on an individual basis for 120 days and to provide procedures favoring the individual management and disposition of larger real estate-related assets, unless a bulk transaction would likely maximize the net recovery to the RTC. Nonetheless, the RTC is hereby requesting comment on all aspects of this interim rule during a 30-day comment period. List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 1640 Savings associations. For the reasons set out in the preamble, the RTC hereby adds Part 1640 to title 12, chapter XVI of the Code of Federal Regulations, to read as follows:
