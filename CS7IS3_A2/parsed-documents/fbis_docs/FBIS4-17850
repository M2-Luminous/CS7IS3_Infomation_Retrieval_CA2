The talks between the foreign ministers of Russia and France are being held in the United Nations office in Europe. Russian diplomats are of the opinion that the positions of the two countries on the crisis in the former Yugoslavia are close on a number of important points. Moscow and Paris favour close cooperative action among Russia, the United States, the European Union, and the United Nations in the quest for a resolution of the crisis. It was in many respects due to this policy line that the four-country contact group was set up.
