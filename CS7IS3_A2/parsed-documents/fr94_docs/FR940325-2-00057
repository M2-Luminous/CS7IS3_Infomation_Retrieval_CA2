SUMMARY: This is a notice of the Presidential declaration of a major disaster for the State of Maryland (FEMA&hyph;1016&hyph;DR), dated March 16, 1994, and related determinations. EFFECTIVE DATE: March 16, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: 0 Pauline C. Campbell, Response and Recovery Directorate, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Washington, DC 20472, (202) 646&hyph;3606. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Notice is hereby given that, in a letter dated March 16, 1994, the President declared a major disaster under the authority of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq .), as follows: I have determined that the damage in certain areas of the State of Maryland, resulting from ice storms on February 8&hyph;18, 1994, is of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant a major disaster declaration under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (``the Stafford Act''). I, therefore, declare that such a major disaster exists in the State of Maryland. In order to provide Federal assistance, you are hereby authorized to allocate from funds available for these purposes, such amounts as you find necessary for Federal disaster assistance and administrative expenses. You are authorized to provide reimbursement for debris removal, emergency protective measures, and the repair of public utilities under the Public Assistance program in the designated areas. Other assistance under Public Assistance may be added at a later date, if warranted. Since information regarding other damages in the State of Maryland is still being gathered, you may modify the event description and/or time period after additional information has been obtained, if warranted. Consistent with the requirement that Federal assistance be supplemental, any Federal funds provided under the Stafford Act for Public Assistance will be limited to 75 percent of the total eligible costs. The time period described for the implementation of section 310(a), Priority to Certain Applications for Public Facility and Public Housing Assistance, 42 U.S.C. 5153, shall be for a period not to exceed six months after the date of this declaration. Notice is hereby give that pursuant to the authority vested in the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency under Executive Order 12148, I hereby appoint Jack Schuback of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to act as the Federal Coordinating Officer for this declared disaster. I do hereby determine the following areas of the State of Maryland to have been affected adversely by this declared major disaster: Calvert, Caroline, Charles, Dorchester, St. Mary's and Talbot Counties for reimbursement for debris removal, emergency protective measures, and the repair of public utilities under the Public Assistance program.
