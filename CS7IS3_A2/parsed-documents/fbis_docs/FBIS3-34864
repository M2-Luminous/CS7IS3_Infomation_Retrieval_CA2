[Al-Hudaybi] President Mubarak does not want to recognize the Muslim Brotherhood as a legal entity and says that he does not know of anything called the Muslim Brotherhood. I do not understand this, because the Brotherhood is a fact and a reality known to every Egyptian who knows its long history. How can the president not know about our existence? [Raghib] How do you explain the president's nonrecognition of the Brotherhood? [Al-Hudaybi] I do not know yet on what basis the president denies our existence. He always stresses that he will never recognize us, now or in the future. There is no way or opportunity to meet him and discuss this issue and, at least, to find out his reasons for not recognizing us. [Raghib] Is there any hope that the Brotherhood will participate in the national dialogue? [Al-Hudaybi] Various and differing statements have been issued by the Presidential Office. All of them call for the political forces to participate in the dialogue. When Dr. Usamah al-Baz, Foreign Ministry first under secretary and director of the President's Office for political affairs, was asked whether the Islamic groups will be invited to the dialogue, he said it is a political and social necessity to invite them and that all groups will be invited as long as they adhere to the Constitution and the law and not to violence. Ibrahim Nafi', chairman of the board and chief editor of AL-AHRAM, also referred to this point in several articles he wrote. We deduced from these articles that he had received political instructions to emphasize the participation of the political forces in the dialogue. [Raghib] Do we understand from this that the optimistic statements that came out at the beginning prompted you to prepare to participate in the dialogue? [Al-Hudaybi] We did in fact begin to prepare for the dialogue. We participated with all the other opposition parties in all the meetings that were held specifically to prepare for this dialogue. We signed the opposition parties' statement addressed to the regime. [Raghib] Putting aside the nonrecognition, what is preventing you from submitting whatever action programs you have to the dialogue if you are not able to participate in it? [Al-Hudaybi] Like any active force in the nation, we could contribute our ideas, cultural views, and capabilities on the issues that will be raised in the dialogue, just like any popular force that is active in issues that are of concern to the people. [Raghib] What is the reaction inside the Muslim Brotherhood to your exclusion from the dialogue? [Al-Hudaybi] We definitely regret this stand. We were hoping that the dialogue would be a genuine national one, because such a dialogue would embrace all the active forces in the homeland. If you exclude one active force, you are contradicting the principles of the democratic system. It would also mean that the dialogue would encompass just a part of the homeland, not all of it. [Raghib] What has your group decided since the recent stand? [Al-Hudaybi] We have no choice now but to obtain a license to register the Muslim Brotherhood Party. Issuing a license is not in the hands of the Parties Committee [in the People's Assembly], but is well within the powers of the president of the republic himself. [Raghib] But the regime opposes the establishment of an Islamic party, so that the Copts will not ask to establish a Christian party. [Al-Hudaybi] The regime's justification is weak and politically motivated. I believe there is no harm in establishing a Christian party vis-a-vis an Islamic party. In 1948, and before the parties law was issued, the Muslim Brotherhood was religiously and politically active without the Copts demonstrating against it. On the contrary, relations with them were very good, and they still are. [Raghib] We all know about the Muslim Brotherhood's activity before the revolution and until it clashed with the regime in 1954, when an edict dissolving it was issued. Why does the group insist on engaging in political activity? [Al-Hudaybi] Political action has always been part of the Muslim Brotherhood's policy. We have no choice here; passages in the Koran and Sunnah [Prophet Muhammad's sayings and deeds] contain many provisions concerning government and politics. Since the group was established in 1928, those of our religion have proved their patriotism at all times. [Raghib] Are you seeking to gain power? [Al-Hudaybi] All political forces and parties seek power; this right is not exclusive to a certain party or group. But this should be done in a legitimate way through genuine democracy and free elections. It is the right of every Egyptian political force to seek power, and we are one of them. [Raghib] The current Muslim Brotherhood is accused of being an extension of the group's prerevolution military wing. What about this? What about the linkage between the Muslim Brotherhood and the acts of violence? [AL-WAFD] Al-Hudaybi forcefully denied this accusation, saying it is intended to discredit the Muslim Brotherhood. He said the current leaders of the group have nothing to do with anything related to a military or underground organization. He added: [Al-Hudaybi] We work publicly, and I reject any linkage between violence and the Brotherhood. It is well known that we condemn terrorism and violence. [Raghib] What about internal differences within the Muslim Brotherhood? [AL-WAFD] Al-Hudaybi denied the existence of any blocs or trends within the group, but he stressed that there is freedom of opinion. He said it is impossible for the whole group to have the same opinion. [Raghib] What about your relations with Muslim Brotherhood groups abroad? [Al-Hudaybi] The Islamic Brotherhood emerged in Egypt. People in various Arab and non-Arab countries then accepted its principles either through books or immigration. They shared the group's thought and policy and established groups in their own countries. Here, we find great similarity in thought and way of acting, but every group adapts according to the circumstances of its country.
