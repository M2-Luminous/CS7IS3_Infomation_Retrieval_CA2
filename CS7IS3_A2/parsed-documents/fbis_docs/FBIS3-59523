What is your objective? [Desama] In the field of European research policy, the European Parliament plays a strategic role, as it does in budgetary affairs. The Parliament is more and more influential, thanks to the new codecision procedure established by the Maastricht Treaty. Thus our objective is to wield as much clout as we can on decisions, to exert real influence on the European Commission, and be able to apply either carrot or stick in our constant battles with the Council of Ministers. The carrot means optimizing our negotiating capacities; the stick means pounding our fist on the table when necessary and not being intimidated by confrontation. [Jassogne] The European Commission proposes to earmark appropriations for generic technologies while reaffirming its commitment to support projects that target specific sectors such as aeronautics or the automotive industry. Isn't this inconsistent? [Desama] No, because the menu of programs can be designed both to support generic technologies -- technologies that may have ramifications in multiple sectors -- and to stimulate specific sectors where industrial competitiveness basically depends on technological prowess. This is the case in the data processing industry, taken in the broadest sense. It's also true in the aeronautics industry, another area where technology is the name of the game. It's true in the space sector too, with respect to launchers. And increasingly in the automotive industry, which has to operate efficiently to compete against the Japanese, even though its technology may be more advanced. In addition, it will have to apply itself to the enormous environmental problems it is going to face. [Jassogne] But on close inspection of the Commission document, one doesn't find these targeted pillars... [Desama] It's true that the vertical axes are not very clearly identified. But the document is pitched at the level of a general framework for the research program. The place where you find that sort of emphasis is at the level of specific programs. I won't try to hide the fact, as we see it, that this type of emphasis can only be put into the research program to the extent that an industrial policy exists downstream. It serves no purpose to do research in critical areas if the effort is not supported by industrial policies: The Japanese and Americans will just pluck the fruits of our technology for their own benefit. For the moment, there is no industrial policy. After much contention, the idea was rejected at the Edinburgh Summit in December 1992. So we're just going to have to see what the Belgian presidency is going to do. I think it has the capacity to give impetus to the European growth initiative, to give a shot in the arm to the losers of the Edinburgh battle. If Belgium gives substance to this initiative and to the impulses in these sectors, I think it will be able to set in motion the beginnings of an eventual Community industrial policy. [Jassogne] How much priority does the Parliament want research to have? [Desama] Our objective is still to meet the goal set at the Milan Summit in 1985, i.e. 6 percent of the total Community budget: enough for research to be the third largest item in the Community budget, after agriculture and structural funds. We're currently spending between 4 and 4.5 percent. If we adopt the European Commission proposal for the fourth framework program, we will be able to maintain the present level of research. Even that may be difficult to achieve, due to current conditions and budgetary problems. We support the Commission proposal. I sense that the member states, with perhaps one or two exceptions, are moving in the same direction. But there are some hesitations on the part of Germany and the United Kingdom. Even France is less than totally enthusiastic. Still, it may well be that the positions of France and the United Kingdom are only negotiating ploys. Germany is the more worrisome and more dismal case. In the past it was always the driving force. Today, the Germans are in a phase of retreat in this domain. This means the battle in the coming weeks is going to be tough. But the Parliament has one important weapon: co-decision. Because of it, the decision can't be made without us and against us. And I don't think any of the member states is going to decide to eviscerate the fourth framework program, since their own laboratories and industries also depend on it. At any rate, if all goes well we should be able under the Belgian presidency to reach political agreement on the fourth framework program. [Jassogne] What about research in aeronautics? [Desama] It's not out of the question that a line of "aeronautical research" might emerge. Of course, it will not appear as such in the framework program, but in the form of a specific program -- why not? Under the rubric of "industrial technologies," for example. I'm all in favor, so long as it's paired with the beginnings of an industrial policy. Otherwise it's just casting pearls before swine.
