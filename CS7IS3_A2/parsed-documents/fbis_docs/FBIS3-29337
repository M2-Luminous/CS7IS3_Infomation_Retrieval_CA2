Borhan said the soldiers serving with the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) were not armed to fight a full-scale war but adequately to defend themselves as peacekeepers. [passage omitted] You must understand that my boys are not there for the war. Only as peacekeepers. They will have to find their own way to defend themselves (in the face of the air strikes), he told reporters. We are not prepared to fight the Serbs if they react to the air strikes. We can't simply retaliate to heavy artillery with our rifles, can we? Gen. Borhan asked. In that respect, Gen. Borhan said, when the soldiers cannot retaliate, the best option for them is to take cover in trenches. This is the kind of risk we are taking and in the process we have to expect casualties, he said. [passage omitted] He said some of the 1,500 Malaysian soldiers are holding positions in Sarajevo, pockets of them are outside the ravaged city while some are on their way to the city. There were reports that some of the soldiers are positioned in split. The soldiers were scheduled to be operational by this month but, according to Gen. Borhan, the UNPROFOR command had reassigned the Malaysian Batallion (Malbatt) to be fully operational (as peacekeepers) by next month.
