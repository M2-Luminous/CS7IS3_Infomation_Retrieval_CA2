It is said that the U.S. Government wishes to continue such attacks from time to time, for the Serb aggression against Gorazde has wiped off the United Nations' last vestige of prestige and has undermined the Security Council decisions, taken under the influence of the western governments. But it seems that NATO is the main loser of this international air display. The NATO air raids, although limited to some sort of air display so far, has angered the Russians who were not consulted on the decision to launch an air strike. [passage omitted] The extreme nationalists of the Russian legislatures, including Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party, have now become the major faction influencing Russia's foreign policy. This faction does not wish to see further humiliation of Russia. They become angry when they see their Slav brothers are killed by the NATO bombs. The Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, therefore, protested and adopted a stand against the NATO air attack on the Serb positions. The attack foiled his dream of hoping that the West would consider Russia as an equal and trustworthy partner. The question in everybody's mind in Russia today is, when will the West stop humiliating Russia?
