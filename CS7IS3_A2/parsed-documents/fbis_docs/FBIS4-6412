The representatives, who resumed discussion on Tuesday morning, are expected to reach agreement during the day if they can hammer out differences on two issues of immediate concern, Japan's stand on North Korea's suspected nuclear development program and tax system rehabilitation, coalition sources said. The two issues have blocked the coalition from cementing ties on policies for a new government to replace the administration of Hosokawa, who declared his resignation April 8 over scandals involving his finances. Clearing these obstacles could lead to a meeting as early as Tuesday of coalition party leaders, who will formally sign into accords key policy coordination and then select Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata as their candidate in the prime ministerial election in the Diet, the sources said. On Monday, Hata emerged as the most probable successor to Hosokawa after veteran conservative politician Michio Watanabe indicated second thoughts about his plan to leave the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and seek coalition backing to run in the Diet election for the premiership. Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito [Clean Government Party], the coalition's key party, told reporters after the representatives' session went into recess that they agreed on all policies but tax reform. Regarding the North Korean nuclear issue, the alliance partners agreed that Japan will abide by the United Nations, prepare for emergency under the framework of the Constitution and cooperate with the United States and South Korea, the sources said. Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the leading coalition the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [as received], told reporters that if the representatives forge an agreement, a meeting of government leaders will be held to confirm the agreement and then party chiefs will discuss picking a prime ministerial candidate and forming a new cabinet after confirming the policy accords. The session will resume at 3:00 P.M., coalition officials said. The representatives are made up of persons at secretaries general level of the SDP, Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), Komeito, the Japan New Party (JNP), the Social Democratic Party (DSP), the Democratic Reform Party and Kaikaku No Kai [Reform Party]. New party Sakigake [Harbinger], which declared Friday that it will not take a post in the new cabinet, stayed away from the session. Keiwa Okuda, chairman of the House of Representatives Steering Committee, meanwhile, said Monday he wants to convene a plenary session Wednesday or Thursday for a vote on the premiership. He told reporters that the lower house will hold the vote-taking plenary session as soon as the heads of the coalition parties pick their official nominee for the next prime minister. Hata said Monday that cabinet changes must be minimal after the establishment of a new government. Hata, 58, head of Shinseito, the coalition's core party, told reporters late Monday night, "I think it's difficult to replace many of the cabinet members who worked out the fiscal 1994 budget if the present coalition agrees to establish a new government." Hata, who is also deputy prime minister, said the new government must be a full-fledged rather than provisional government because Japan needs to meet the expectations of the rest of the world.
