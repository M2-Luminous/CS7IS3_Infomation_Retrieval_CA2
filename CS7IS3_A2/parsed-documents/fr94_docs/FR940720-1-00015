FR940720-1-00015 FR940720-1-00005 For the reasons set out in the preamble, we are proposing to amend Subparts H and J of Part 404 of 20 CFR Chapter III as follows: PART 404_FEDERAL OLD-AGE, SURVIVORS AND DISABILITY INSURANCE (1950&hyph;␣) 1. The authority citation for Subpart H of Part 404 continues to read as follows: Authority: Secs. 205(a) and 1102 of the Social Security Act; 42 U.S.C. 405(a) and 1302. §404.721 [Amended] 2. Section 404.721(b) is amended by removing ``for no apparent reasons,'' and by removing the comma between ``from'' and ``for'' in the first sentence; and by removing ``If there is no evidence available that he or she is still alive'' in the second sentence and substituting the words ``If the presumption of death is not rebutted pursuant to §404.722'' in its place. 3. New section 404.722 is added to read as follows: §404.722 Rebuttal of a Presumption of Death. A presumption of death made based on §404.721(b) can be rebutted by evidence that establishes that the person is still alive or explains the individual's absence in a manner consistent with continued life rather than death. Example 1: Evidence in a claim for surviving child's benefits showed that the worker had wages posted to his earnings record in the year following the disappearance. It was established that the wages belonged to the worker and were for work done after his ``disappearance.'' In this situation, the presumption of death is rebutted by evidence (wages belonging to the worker) that the person is still alive after the disappearance. Example 2: Evidence shows that the worker left the family home shortly after woman, whom he had been seeing, also disappeared, and that the worker phoned his wife several days after the disappearance to state he intended to begin a new life in California. In this situation the presumption of death is rebutted because the evidence explains the worker's absence in a manner consistent with continued life. 4. The authority citation for Subpart J of Part 404 continues to read as follows: Authority: Secs. 201(j), 205(a), (b), and (d)&hyph;(h), 221(d), and 1102 of the Social Security Act; 31 U.S.C. 3720A; 40 U.S.C. 401(j), 405(a), (b), and (d)&hyph;(h), 421(d), and 1302. 5. Paragraph (c)(4) introductory text and (c)(4)(i) of §404.988 are revised to read as follows: §404.988 Conditions for reopening. * * * * * (c) *␣*␣* (4) Your claim was denied because you did not prove that a person died, and the death is later established_ (i) By a presumption of death under §404.721(b); or, (ii) *␣*␣* * * * * * [FR Doc. 94&hyph;17402 Filed 7&hyph;19&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4190&hyph;29&hyph;M
