The president's press spokesman, Andrzej Drzycimski, acknowledged this to be a conflict between the party-dominated parliament and the president, who wanted to make it possible for all political forces and citizens to have a real role in the discussion on the Constitution. Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy addressed the statement by Andrzej Drzycimski during a news conference: [Begin Oleksy recording] I do not think Poland needs any new conflict at the top, and Poles expect good cooperation from all of the highest bodies in authority in the state, a good mutual understanding of the matters that are most important for Poland, and not conflicts, collisions, rancor, and resentment. I wish to express a deep conviction that this sort of judgement expressed in the name of the president is an emotional judgement in association with the decision of parliament, and that it will not cast a shadow on the hitherto good cooperation between the president and the Sejm.
