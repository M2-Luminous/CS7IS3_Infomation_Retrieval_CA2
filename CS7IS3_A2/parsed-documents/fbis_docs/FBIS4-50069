Arthur Garcia, the first ombudsman in Hong Kong, and Wilfred Wong Ying-wai, former deputy secretary for civil service, are among a group of 13 appointed by the National People's Congress Standing Committee to join the 57-member Preliminary Working Committee (PWC). The new members include eight from Hong Kong and five from the mainland. The total membership of the PWC has been boosted to 70, minus Liu Yiu-chu, who had earlier quit. Officials earlier promised to increase the membership of the PWC amid fierce criticism over its lack of credibility and dearth of dissenting views. The new batch of the think-tank, however, remains dominated by mainland officials and pro-China figures. The five mainland members come from the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, the local headquarters of Xinhua (the New China News Agency) and the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG), which falls under the jurisdiction of the Foreign Ministry. Mainland officials admitted that the expertise of senior government officials was desperately needed in their work. "We always hope that more former government officials will take part. But there are practical difficulties for some," one said. The appointment of Wilfred Wong, who has helped arrange private dialogue between serving colleagues in the bureaucracy and local officials from Xinhua, is significant. Mr Wong said last night that his previous service in the Government would help him to give constructive advice to the Chinese Government. Mr Garcia, a retired High Court judge who was later named as the Commissioner for Administrative Complaints, will offer legal advice to the working panel, which has suffered from the shortage of legal experts. Although the Hong Kong Government does not allow any civil servants to brief PWC members, an Executive Councillor said they would not object to Chinese JLG members briefing the panel or even letting them read the documents as long as they could be kept confidential. Another local legal expert appointed to the panel is Ambrose Lau Hon-chuen, who is also convenor of the preparatory committee for the Hong Kong Progressive Alliance, a political party to be launched by the end of next month. Mr Lau said he would definitely join the PWC's legal sub-group to help in scrutinising existing Hong Kong laws and to bring them in line with the Basic Law. Two academics -- Ng Ching-fai, dean of the science faculty at Baptist College, and Woo Chia-wei, a vice-chancellor of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology -- were also appointed. Also included were two businessmen; Paul Cheng Ming-fun, an executive committee member of the influential Business and Professionals Federation of Hong Kong, and Philip Wong Yu-hong, who represents the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in the Legislative Council and is also a member of the New Hong Kong Alliance. The publisher of the pro-China Hong Kong Commercial Daily, Lee Cho-jat, was also named to sit on the panel. Topping the list of the five mainland members are two high-flyers in the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office Zhang Liangdong and Xu Ze -- who were recently promoted to head the office's Hong Kong administration department and economic department respectively. Mr Zhang and Mr Xu have been serving in the secretariat of the PWC since its inception last July. Two more local Xinhua officials were also appointed: Ulanmulun, a vice-director focusing on economic affairs in Hong Kong; and Weng Xinqiao, director of the department of education.
