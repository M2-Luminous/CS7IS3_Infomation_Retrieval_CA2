ACTION: Direct final rulemaking. SUMMARY: The EPA is approving the State Implementation Plan revision submitted by the Governor of Montana on October 19, 1992 for the purpose of establishing a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program to satisfy the Federal mandate of the Clean Air Act to ensure that small businesses have access to the technical assistance and regulatory information necessary to comply with the Act. Since this is a voluntary program that does not impose any new regulatory burdens on small businesses, the EPA is proceeding with a direct final approval of this SIP revision. The rationale for this approval follows. EFFECTIVE DATE: This rule will become effective on April 4, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Laura Farris, Mail Code 8ART-AP, EPA Region 8, 999 18th Street, suite 500, Denver, Colorado 80202&hyph;2405, (303) 294&hyph;7539. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background of Revision Implementation of the provisions of the Clean Air Act (Act), as amended in 1990, will require regulation of many small businesses so that areas may attain and maintain the National ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and reduce the emission of air toxics. Small businesses frequently lack the technical expertise and financial resources necessary to evaluate such regulations and to determine the appropriate mechanisms for compliance. In anticipation of the impact of these requirements on small businesses, the Act requires that States adopt a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program (PROGRAM), and submit this PROGRAM as a revision to the federally approved State Implementation Plan (SIP). In addition, the Act directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to oversee these small business assistance programs and report to Congress on their implementation. The requirements for establishing a PROGRAM are set out in section 507 of Title V of the Act. In February 1992, the EPA issued Guidelines for the Implementation of Section 507 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments , in order to delineate the Federal and State roles in meeting the new statutory provisions and as a tool to provide further guidance to the States on submitting acceptable SIP revisions. The State of Montana has submitted a SIP revision to the EPA in order to satisfy the requirements of section 507. In order to gain full approval, the State submittal must provide for each of the following PROGRAM elements: (1) The establishment of a Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP) to provide technical and compliance assistance to small businesses; (2) the establishment of a State Small Business Ombudsman to represent the interests of small businesses in the regulatory process; and (3) the creation of a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) to determine and report on the overall effectiveness of the SBAP. II. Summary of Submittal The State of Montana has met all of the requirements of section 507 by submitting a SIP revision that implements all required PROGRAM elements. House Bill (HB) 318 signed into law on April 23, 1993, provides authority for the Montana Department of Health and Environmental Sciences to establish a PROGRAM. The Montana Board of Health and Environmental Sciences held a public hearing on September 25, 1992 to consider and approve the PROGRAM, which will amend the Montana SIP to add Chapter 10 of Volume I. The Montana PROGRAM was submitted to the EPA by the Governor of Montana on October 19, 1992 as an addition to the Montana SIP. It was initially reviewed for administrative and technical completeness, and was deemed complete on April 19, 1993. The submittal was then reviewed for approveability by EPA Region VIII and EPA headquarters. One of the EPA headquarters reviewers, the Office of the Small Business and Asbestos Ombudsman (OSBO) did not concur on the Montana PROGRAM for the following reasons: (1) Insufficient designation of Small Business Ombudsman position in the Montana Department of Commerce (DOC) to make an effective decision; (2) No designated role for the SBAP to act as secretariat to the CAP and Ombudsman; (3) Manpower resources appear inadequate to support the SBAP, and there are no quantitative or qualitative or other support for the SBAP from the DOC or others; and (4) It is advantageous for the Ombudsman and the SBAP to both have a toll-free hotline to serve the public. The State addressed these issues in a letter dated January 3, 1994, and subsequently received the concurrence of the OSBO. A. Small Business Assistance Program The State has met the first PROGRAM element, the establishment of a SBAP to provide technical and compliance assistance to small businesses, by committing in its SIP revision Chapter 10.2.3 to establish a SBAP in the Montana Department of Health and Environmental Sciences, Air Quality Bureau. It will be administered by an environmental specialist. Chapter 10.2.3 describes the details of the SBAP, which meet the six requirements set forth in section 507(a), including such activities as: (1) ``Provide information to small business stationary sources on compliance methods and technologies;'' (2) ``Provide information to small business stationary sources on ... pollution prevention and accidental release detection and prevention;'' (3) ``Assist small business stationary sources in determining applicable requirements under this chapter and in receiving permits in a timely and efficient manner;'' (4) ``Provide small business stationary sources timely notice of both their rights and obligations under this chapter;'' (5) ``Provide information ... regarding the availability of audits services which are useful for determining compliance status with the requirements of this chapter;'' and (6) Consider `` ... requests from small business stationary sources for modifications of work practices or technological methods of compliance.'' B. Ombudsman The State has met the second PROGRAM element, the establishment of a State Small Business Ombudsman to represent the interests of small businesses in the regulatory process, by locating the office of the Ombudsman in the Montana DOC as stated in Chapter 10.2.2 of its SIP revision. C. Compliance Advisory Panel The third PROGRAM element is the creation of a CAP to determine and report on the overall effectiveness of the SBAP. The CAP must include two members selected by the Governor who are not owners or representatives of owners of small businesses; four members selected by the State legislature who are owners, or represent owners, of small businesses; and one member selected by the head of the agency in charge of the Air Pollution Permit Program. The Act also delineates four responsibilities of the Panel: (1) To render advisory opinions concerning the effectiveness of the SBAP, difficulties encountered and the degree and severity of enforcement actions; (2) To periodically report to the EPA concerning the SBAP's adherence to the principles of the Paperwork Reduction Act, the Equal Access to Justice Act, and the Regulatory Flexibility Act 1 ; 1 Section 507(e)(1)(B) requires the CAP to report on the compliance of the SBAP with these three Federal statutes. However, since State agencies are not required to comply with them, EPA believes that the State PROGRAM must merely require the CAP to report on whether the SBAP is adhering to the general principles of these Federal statutes. (3) To review and assure that information for small businesses is easily understandable; and (4) To develop and disseminate the reports and advisory opinions made through the SBAP. The State has met these requirements by committing in Chapter 10.2.4 of its SIP revision to appoint the members of the CAP as stated above, and to designate to the CAP the four responsibilities listed in the Act. D. Eligibility Section 507(c)(1) of the Act defines the term ``small business stationary source'' as a stationary source that: (A) Is owned or operated by a person who employs 100 or fewer individuals; (B) Is a small business concern as defined in the Small Business Act; (C) Is not a major stationary source; (D) Does not emit 50 tons per year (tpy) or more of any regulated pollutant; and (E) Emits less than 75 tpy of all regulated pollutants. The State of Montana has established a mechanism for ascertaining the eligibility of a source to receive assistance under the PROGRAM, including an evaluation of a source's eligibility using the criteria in section 507(c)(1) of the Act. This mechanism is contained in the State's Title V enabling legislation, HB 318, Section 1, which is Chapter 10.2.1 of the State's SIP revision. The State of Montana has provided for public notice and comment on grants of eligibility to sources that do not meet the provisions of sections 507(c)(1)(C), (D), and (E) of the Act but do not emit more than 100 tpy of all pollutants. This provision is contained in Chapter 10.2.1 of the State's SIP revision. The State of Montana has provided for exclusion from the small business stationary source definition, after consultation with the EPA and the Small Business Administration Administrator and after providing notice and opportunity for public comment, of any category or subcategory of sources that the State determines to have sufficient technical and financial capabilities to meet the requirements of the Act. This provision in contained in Chapter 10.2.1 of the State's SIP revision. III. Final Action In this action, the EPA is approving the SIP revision submitted by the State of Montana. This SIP revision implements each of the PROGRAM elements required by section 507 of the Act. Chapter 10.3 of the revision contains a schedule for implementation of the PROGRAM by November 15, 1994. The EPA is therefore approving this submittal. This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future notice will inform the general public of these tables. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq. , the EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, the EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. By this action, the EPA is approving a State program created for the purpose of assisting small businesses in complying with existing statutory and regulatory requirements. The program being approved does not impose any new regulatory burden on small businesses; it is a program under which small businesses may elect to take advantage of assistance provided by the State. Because the EPA's approval of this program does not impose any new regulatory requirements on small businesses, I certify that it does not have a significant economic impact on any small entities affected.
