ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The purpose of this notice is to announce that the Secretary of Commerce has approved a new standard, which will be published as FIPS Publication 189, Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)_Part 2: Shell and Utilities. This standard adopts the International Standard ISO/IEC 9945&hyph;2:1993, Information Technology_Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)_Part 2: Shell and Utilities, which defines a command language interpreter (shell) and a set of utility programs. On January 28, 1994 (59 FR 4034) and February 17, 1994 (59 FR 8041), notices were published in the Federal Register that a Federal Information Processing Standard for Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)_Part 2: Shell and Utilities was being proposed for Federal use. NIST reviewed written comments submitted by interested parties and other available material. On the basis of this review, NIST recommended that the Secretary approve the standard as a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS), and prepared a detailed justification document for the Secretary's review in support of that recommendation. The detailed justification document which was presented to the Secretary, and which includes an analysis of the written comments received, is part of the public record and is available for inspection and copying in the Department's Central Reference and Records Inspection Facility, Room 6020, Herbert C. Hoover Building, 14th Street between Pennsylvania and Constitution Avenues NW., Washington, DC 20230. This FIPS contains two sections: (1) An announcement section, which provides information concerning the applicability, implementation, and maintenance of the standard; and (2) a specifications section, which deals with the technical requirements of the standard. Only the announcement section of the standard is provided in this notice. EFFECTIVE DATE: This standard is effective April 3, 1995. ADDRESSES: Interested parties may purchase copies of this standard, including the technical specifications section, from the National Technical Information Service (NTIS). Specific ordering information from NTIS for this standard is set out in the Where to Obtain Copies Section of the announcement section of the standard.
