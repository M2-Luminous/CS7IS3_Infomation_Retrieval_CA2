The alliance is no longer in existence; and six months ago, the last Russian soldier left Poland. Now the Polish Army is preparing for NATO membership. Poland urgently wants to join, and the sooner the better. For the Polish people, the situation in their neighbor Russia is much too insecure. But the West hesitates. NATO membership is not within easy reach. On the eve of the NATO summit, Warsaw is being very clear. [Walesa] By not letting us join NATO, the West is betraying and hurting itself. After the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union broke up, we thought that the West wanted a unified Europe, and real security. But all this is now being jeopardized by the West's position. This is why many people in our country feel much worse now than they used to. In the past, we hoped that there would be a unified Europe and equal rules. In reality, nothing has happened. There is even a chance that the old forces could regain their strength. What have we achieved? [Kuehnrich] Poland's NATO membership aspirations have been the number one topic in the country for weeks. Poland wants to be part of the West, part of Europe. The polemics in the media are getting sharper. The critical point being discussed is that the West makes allowances for Yeltsin. But Russia is a country that is not trusted in Poland. Experiences from the past have not been forgotten: Others determined the country's future. Poland once again feels like a buffer zone, and what is more, it feels that it is not being granted equal rights. [Walesa] We are looking at things that the West can see as well, but is trying to overlook. But we will not allow Russia to make conditions for us to meet. Russia is setting conditions for NATO and the West. I get the impression that we no longer have to ask NATO or Clinton, but we should go and ask Yeltsin because he controls the West and NATO. [Kuehnrich] How do you see Germany's position regarding Poland's wish to join NATO? Is it a clear position? [Walesa] The Germans are in a difficult position. One has to understand this; and I understand the Germans. They still have the Russian Army on their territory. They also face problems related to unification and various other difficulties. Germany is watched by everybody, and one, therefore, should not be surprised about the hesitant attitude taken by the Germans. [end recording] Reproaches are being directed toward the West, and worried looks go across the border into Russia. The fact is that the majority of Poles are in favor of a quick alliance with Western Europe and NATO.
