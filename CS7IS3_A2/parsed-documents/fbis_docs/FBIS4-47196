Experts from the government and the president's office worked all night to be in time for Yeltsin's anniversary press conference. The group issuing the president's documents did not work as expeditiously: only four of the five edicts were officially distributed yesterday. The edict on the banking system did not appear outside the Kremlin. Judging by the extensive list of documents being prepared, yesterday's package will not be the last surge of activity by the executive authority before the summer lull. The President Did not Promise Every Family an Apartment by the Year 2000 The presidential edicts issued yesterday provide every reason for the executive authority to substantially reduce the pace of its work, if not leave on vacation. Package No. 2 filled the niche, empty since May, of the authorities' attention to social problems and relationships with foreign financial organizations. Edicts signed by Boris Yeltsin on 10 June: --"On housing loans"; --"On the issuance and circulation of housing certificates"; --"On measures to finish incomplete housing construction"; --"On improving the work of the Russian Federation banking system"; and --"On protection of consumers." Edicts Being Prepared for Signing: --"On increasing the responsibility of state enterprise directors"; --"On protecting the rights of investors and citizens in the securities market"; and --"On the customs procedure for commodities for investment projects." Basic Provisions of the Edict "On the Issuance and Circulation of Housing Certificates": --When houses are built, juridical persons with the rights of a buyer have the right to issue housing certificates; --The volume of an emission of housing certificates (expressed in units of overall living space) may not exceed the total volume of housing being built by a buyer; and --The minimum rated value of a housing certificate may not be less than 0.1 square meter. Basic Provisions of the Edict "On Housing Credits": --Credit is extended for housing construction if the builder is allotted a plot of land and has authorization to build housing from the appropriate organs; --There may be thre types of loans: a loan to purchase land, a short-term loan to build housing, and a long-term loan to purchase housing; --The total amount of credit issued should not exceed 70 percent of the cost to build or purchase housing; --The basic documents which determine the relationships between the bank and the borrower in granting a loan are the loan agreement and the security contract (on the mortgage); and --A plot of land under construction, completed housing or incomplete construction, and other forms of property and property rights may be an item of security. The reasons for issuance of the decrees "On housing loans," "On the issuance and circulation of housing certificates," and "On measures to finish incomplete housing construction" are very logical and clear--the idea that it is precisely the construction industry which will become the "locomotive" of the Russian economy has been popular in the government for a long time. Moreover, the edict on housing loans legalizes the mortgage concept, which has been put into practice quite extensively. The Supreme Soviet did not have time to approve a corresponding draft law. The underlying social reason for these decisions is obvious as well--there are few average Russians who can gain a thorough understanding of the subtleties of export allocation and licensing (the net result of Package No. 1 was the idea of liberalizing Russian exports). However, for those who authored the housing construction edicts--the State Committee on Questions of Architecture and Construction [Goskomarkhitektury]--there are reasons of a more prosaic nature to advocate their quick approval. A package of government decrees on measures to support the construction complex--and not without budget participation, of course--should be rushing to catch up with these edicts. Yefim Basin, chairman of the Goskomarkhitektury, estimates the overall volume of unmet demand for housing at 14 trillion rubles [R] and the area of housing that has not been completed at 40 million square meters (42 million square meters were built in 1993). * * * Basic Provisions of the Edict "On Protection of Consumers' Rights" Upon its publication, the advertising of banks and financial, insurance, and investment companies must: --specify the actual amounts of dividends paid for common registered stocks over the past fiscal year; --specify the date and registration number of the securities issue being advertised; and --not permit announcement of guarantees, promises, or assumptions about the future effectiveness of their activity. Yeltsin's edict "On protection of consumers" [sic] pursues objectives that are even more populist. The aims of this document were formulated by the president himself: it is necessary "to put advertising activity in order and ensure that a person has the right to reliable financial information." The authorities' attempts to spare their fellow citizens from the illusions that they can buy "a house in Paris" with the dividends from securities are very much justified: in the event that their commercial undertakings fail, Russian investors prefer to appeal to the state, not the firm that deceived them. According to KOMMERSANT-DAILY information, Russian banks, concerned about the increase in competition from nonbanking financial institutions in attracting the funds of private investors, played an important role in pushing through the edict. Foreign Banks in Russia Have been Rehabilitated The pendulum of the president's edicts concerning operations by foreign banks in Russian territory with the funds of Russian residents has once again been put into motion. On 17 November 1993, this activity was frozen until 1 January 1996 by the edict "On activity by foreign banks and joint banking ventures with the participation of nonresidents in Russian Federation territory." The clause in the edict stating that its restrictions are not extended to those foreign banks which did not have time to begin serving Russian residents before 15 November 1993 was good news for only two banks: "Lionskiy Kredit," a subsidiary bank of Credit Lyonnais, and the joint bank Dresdner Bank (FRG) and BNP (France). All the rest of the 10 that were planning to begin operating in the Russian market, which had already received licenses from the TsB [Central Bank] of Russia, turned out to be "losers." Now the president has given the green light to European foreign banks in Russia. It is a reasonable question: what prompted the president to rehabilitate the foreign banks ahead of time? While in November the spirit of the president's edict was directly contrary to his edict of 27 September "On improving work with foreign investments," it was brought about chiefly by election campaign considerations, not by calculations that victory would be achieved by orientation toward a liberal-market ideology with emphasis on priority support for the interests of Russian business or a rejection of more prohibitive measures, and it is more pragmatic in nature. At least three circumstances attest to this. First of all, it is obvious that opening the Russian market to foreign banks is one of the conditions for granting Russia deferments in paying its foreign debt to the Paris Club. And creditors' patience has evidently run short. Secondly--and this is confirmed by the fact that European banks are the ones that have been most active thus far in penetrating the Russian financial market--opening the doors to foreign banks is aimed at facilitating the talks that are actively under way on Russia's partnership in the European Community. In principle, it has not been ruled out that this liberalization will be followed by reciprocal liberalization by Russia's trading partners, and this may alleviate antidumping sanctions from the EC. An answer to this question may be given on 23 June at a meeting between Boris Yeltsin and Jacques Delors, where it is planned in particular to coordinate Russian quotas for aluminum and uranium exports to the EC. Thirdly--and this is perhaps what is most important, the appearance of foreign banks in the Russian market should in theory contribute to a solution of two extremely critical problems in the Russian economy. Despite the rapid increase in commercial banks, the credit development field in Russia continues to be inadequate for the requirements of a market economy. This is shown by comparing the structure of the money supply in Russia and the United States. It follows from this that Russia is significantly ahead of the United States in the proportion of cash and funds accumulated in the accounts of enterprises and in public savings, but on the other hand, it lags behind in the amount of commercial credit that is extended. In this sense, the chronic nonpayments are a form of compensation for the lack of development in credit relationships. The new opportunities being opened by the presence of foreign banks in the Russian market may also revitalize the moribund investment process. The epochal formation of the Investment Finance Consortium, despite the importance of the precedent of government interaction with the banks and investment companies in stimulating private investments, attests to the narrowness of investment supply. The overall volume of state guarantees for securities of the consortium amounts to R800 billion, and this year R8 billion will be mobilized altogether. Foreign direct investments, the need for which has finally been acknowledged in the Russian Government, will come through these foreign banks; however, this has not prevented it from breaking up the Russian Agency for International Cooperation and Development--a federal organ charged with implementing the policy of attracting foreign investments. As far as public reaction is concerned, it is absolutely clear that the politicians, the bankers, and businessmen view this change in different ways. Unexpected arguments are already circulating: giving foreign banks access to Russian residents' accounts will leave the CIA with nothing to do. It may be said in response to this that the largest data bank on all Russian enterprises is being held by the Goskomimushchestvo [State Committee on the Administration of State Property], and specialists of the World Bank and other Western financial organizations providing Russia with technical assistance in carrying out privatization have had legal access to the data for a long time. Nevertheless, from the viewpoint of prospects for development of the national economy, the pluses of the foreign banks' arrival in Russia outweigh the minuses, all the same. * * * Reaction by Russian Bankers to the President's Edict Andrey Tsimaylo, vice president of Most-Bank: "There are specific differences between the banking system of any state and other sectors of the economy. The banks are akin to the militia and the army--both constitute elements of national security. For this reason, the national banking system should be the last to be integrated into the international market (and hence, to permit full-fledged branches of foreign banks on its territory). This should not take place before Russian banks are standing on their feet, that is, when the largest of them have enough of their own funds to put them among the first thousand largest banks in the world. And for this it is essential that a bank have a minimum of $125 million of its own capital. "And even in this case, it is not right to authorize foreign banks to serve residents. In other states, the 'other' banks take part in the capital market and the interbank market, but the national banks serve their clients. "By authorizing foreign banks to serve residents today, we can forget about national security. Each bank knows the history, the problems. and the financial capabilities and plans of each client. Foreign banks will also have the same information on resident clients in Russia. Not one of the world's intelligence services even dreamed of this. "They say that foreign banks will finally teach you how to operate. On the contrary, it is more likely that we will be teaching them how to operate in the Russian market--with the GKO [expansion unknown] and with gold certificates. And Russian bankers increase their skill this way--those same Western banks organize the seminars at which Russian employees are trained. "They say that foreign banks will bring new technologies into the Russian market. If this means equipment, many Russian banks have equipment today that is no worse, and perhaps even better. But if this refers to banking technologies, please tell us: who needs 30-year bonds with 4-percent profitability? "They say that foreign banks will teach us how to treat a client. However, I am not convinced that they would extend credit to clients who have no credit history. "Finally, they say that foreign banks will bring foreign investments with them. However, the lack of a foreign bank is not an obstacle to penetration by foreign investments. If any one of them wants to extend credit to AvtoVAZ [Volga Automotive Plant], it will do so even without a Russian 'branch.'" Yakov Dubenetskiy, chairman of the board of the Promstroybank [Industrial Construction Bank] of Russia: "I think the presence of foreign banks in the Russian market meets our national interests over the long term. There is no question that foreign banks should be represented in Russia. However, it is not possible for them to conduct their activity today under the same conditions as the Russian banks." Sergey Yegorov, president of the Association of Russian Banks: The association's position on this matter has been set forth on more than one occasion. We believe that the presence of full-fledged branches of foreign banks in the Russian market today will be disastrous for the Russian banking system. The overwhelming majority of Russian commercial banks canot be compared in size with even a comparatively small foreign bank. Countries with a much stronger national banking system do not allow foreign banks. But in Russia, the commercial banks have just barely come to their feet, and time is needed for them to be able to compete with foreign banks." Boris Sergeyev,member of the board of "Tokobank": "Based on principle, not self-interest, we support the idea of liberalizing the conditions for activity by foreign banks. At the same time, it is reasonable to set some restrictions, such as limiting capital from Western banks to 12 percent of the total amount." Saida Petrova, head of a department of the Moscow Export-Import Bank: "There is actually no banking system in Russia at this stage. All Russian commercial banks are essentially branches of the Central Bank--all banking turnover without exception goes through the RKTs [presumably: currency control center]. Western banks' transactions will bypass this system. It will be impossible to monitor the influx of foreign capital and its circulation in the country. As a result, we will witness the collapse of Russia's banking system, which has not been created yet."
