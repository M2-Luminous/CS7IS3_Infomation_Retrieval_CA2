Agreement was reached that proposals for making amendments to the Constitution may be considered by the Supreme Soviet only in the event of their initiators being the president, 40 people's deputies, or 150,000 citizens of the Republic. The deputies also voted unanimously in favor of an article providing for equal elections, in which all voters have an identical number of votes and an approximately equal number of citizens live in each constituency. [passage omitted] Thus, the new Constitution of the Republic of Belarus was passed article by article. However, an attempt to pass, in its first reading, a draft law on the introduction of the Constitution into operation did not obtain the support of the majority of deputies. A draft law on the national archives was passed in its first reading, and amendments and changes to the civil code of the Republic of Belarus were considered. With this the session adjourned its work until 15 March.
