The civilians were killed at 7:35 p.m. (1735 GMT) Tuesday in a mortar attack on the city center. Thirteen other civilians were injured by 120 mm mortars, he said. The UN Protection Force did not officially attribute the attack, but an UNPROFOR spokesman in Zagreb said there were "very strong indications" that the shells were fired from Bosnian Moslem positions. He said the UN military observers in Brcko sited nine impact points where shells struck in downtown Brcko. UN forces fear the city, a critical passage point on a strategic corridor linking Serb-controlled zones in Croatia and eastern and western Bosnia to Serbia, is becoming the new flashpoint in the two-year-old Bosnian war. In Belgrade, a spokesman for Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic gave a different death toll, saying four people, including at least one child and a pregnant woman, were killed. He blamed what he called Tuesday's "savage" shelling on Bosnian Moslems. [passage omitted] In other developments, lawyers who visited 11 French aid workers held by Bosnian Serbs for more than a month criticized the "intolerable" psychological conditions of their detention and accused French officials here of not trying to resolve the matter. The lawyers, from the Brussels-based International Federation of Human rights Leagues, said the aid workers from the Premiere Urgence (First Emergency) group had been left in tight quarters, which created tension, and since have been separted into two groups. They are accused of smuggling arms for the Bosnian Government, which their organization denies. The lawyers blasted French officials in Sarajevo for "accepting that for a month these people were left without defense, without a lawyer and saw no one." French Ambassador here Henri Jacolin said he saw the group Tuesday night, conceding they were upset over a Serb decision to prolong their detention by a month but "coming out of it." The workers have been held since 8 April at the Sarajevo suburb of Lukavica pending trial by Serbs, who say they could face up to 15 years in prison.
