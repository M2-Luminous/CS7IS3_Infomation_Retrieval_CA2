Yet, at the recent local and European elections, between 20 and 40 percent of all east Germans voted for the PDS [Party of Democratic Socialism]. Do you understand this? [Thierse] Beside the former supporters of the SED [Socialist Unity Party of Germany] regime, there seems to be a considerable number of Germans who think that they can best express their anger and frustration by handing it to the PDS. Helmut Kohl is to blame for this election result. Anyone promising as much as Kohl did in 1990, and delivering so little of it, should not be surprised to see an antiwestern party gain support in eastern Germany. [Ohligschlaeger] But this development harms the SPD [Social Democratic Party] rather than the CDU [Christian Democratic Union]. [Thierse] The CDU has clearly lost votes in eastern Germany, while the SPD has achieved considerable gains. But without the PDS, these gains could have been even higher. Secretly, the CDU is probably pleased at the PDS victory. But I do not think parties that promise a great deal, such as the CDU and the PDS, can be successful in the long run. [Ohligschlaeger] Why has the SPD failed to win over the dissatisfied voters in eastern Germany? [Thierse] The degree of frustration seems to call for a certain degree of radicalism. Unlike the PDS, the SPD cannot and will not promote antiwestern moods. We do not want an election campaign full of pessimism. We want to make offers that are feasible and can win a majority. [Ohligschlaeger] But this does not seem to be very successful at the moment. [Thierse] We have learned our lesson and we will conduct a far more emotional election campaign over the next few months. We must show that we are passionately committed to effecting a change of government. This also goes for myself. I have kept out of the debate on the European election campaign strategy because I did not feel competent enough on Europe. That is different in the Bundestag and landtag elections in eastern Germany. If I can contribute anything, it is certainly 40 years of GDR socialism. [Ohligschlaeger] And what would you recommend on the subject of coalition statements? [Thierse] We should not get tied up in coalition statements now. At the moment we are closer to the Greens programwise than we are to other parties. But what the talks in October will be like and what their outcome will be is still open. I think there is still a lot possible with the FDP [Free Democratic Party of Germany]. Everything will depend on the SPD's election results. And the results of the recent elections were not as bad as many people want to make believe: In the municipal elections, which are doubtless the more authentic ones, the SPD could gain up to 9 percent. [Ohligschlaeger] Is this not making things look better than they are? In Saxony-Anhalt the CDU is ahead of the SPD by a small margin in spite of the wage scandal. [Thierse] This is a false interpretation of the result. We have won up to 9 percent, and journalists call that defeat. The CDU has lost up to 8 percent in the east. But just because it has lost less than had been feared, a large crowd of journalists interprets this to be a victory for the CDU. [Ohligschlaeger] So it is all the journalists' fault again? [Thierse] I think that a large section of the media are CDU election campaign staff. They keep accusing the SPD of not making it clear enough what it plans to do after the elections. But the fact that the CDU has not yet presented a precise factual program does not seem to bother any of the journalists. The issue of parties' relations with the PDS is handled in a similar manner. [Ohligschlaeger] Are you surprised about that? [Thierse] Yes, because this problem is not peculiar to the SPD, but it is something that the CDU also has to face. [Ohligschlaeger] What does the SPD say? [Thierse] On the land and federal levels, any political cooperation between SPD and PDS must be ruled out, whether it is called coalition or something else. On the municipal level, there will not be any coalitions either; but there the situation is different. In Berlin, the district authorities' composition has been forced upon them by the election results. It is only decent democratic behavior to let people who have been elected cooperate in the solution of common problems, where this is necessary. The PDS has to be defeated by democratic decency instead of making it a martyr.
