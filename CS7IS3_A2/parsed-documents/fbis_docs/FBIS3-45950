In an exclusive interview with XINHUA here today, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmoud Vaezi [name as received] said that his country's foreign debts will reach 15 billion U.S. dollars by the end of this year provided the government will not make any repayment. Earlier reports said that the country so far has delayed the payment of some 8-9 billion dollars and an additional sum of 6 billion dollars will mature this year. Vaezi put Iran's foreign debts at about 8.8 billion dollars, saying that Germany is Iran's biggest creditor with some 2 billion dollars, followed by Japan, with 1.5 billion dollars, and France, with 250 million dollars. Iranian officials are discussing with foreign countries to find a way out for the foreign debts, he said, believing that the issue will be solved in the near future. Iran failed to repay its foreign debts last year due to the sharp drop in oil prices in the world market following the depression of the world economy. However, Governor of Iran's Central Bank Mohammad 'Adeli said earlier this month that the Central Bank and the government do not owe a single penny to any country or company, but the Iranian private sectors and commercial banks have foreign debts. He said that his country has only to repay 8 billion dollars and the delay of repayment is due to the non-cooperative attitude of insurance agencies to cover medium and long-term credits. The Iranian Government decided in the budget of 1994 to repay some 1 billion dollars of foreign debts, but many Iranian officials urged the government to allocate more incomes to repay foreign debts. Some experts believed that the Iranian Majlis (parliament) will raise the figure for government to repay foreign debts as the government will reduce its development expenditures because of the low oil prices. The government hoped in the new year's budget to get 12.5 billion dollars with the oil price calculated at 14 dollars per barrel, but many officials especially the Majlis deputies believed that the country's oil income will not exceed 10 billion dollars since the present oil price stands below 13 dollars.
