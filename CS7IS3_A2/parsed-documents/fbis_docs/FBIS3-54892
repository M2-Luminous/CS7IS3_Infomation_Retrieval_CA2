Bill Clinton will take part in a conference of NATO member countries' heads of state and government and from 11 to 12 January will visit Prague where he will hold negotiations with Polish, Hungarian, Slovak, and Czech leaders. At Boris Yeltsin's invitation, the American President will make a three-day official visit to Moscow to "consolidate the democratic partnership between the United States and Russia," it officially reported. To conclude his tour, Clinton will visit Minsk. Ukraine will not be visited by the head of the White House. However, INTERFAX reported on 3 January that a visit by L. Kravchuk to Moscow for trilateral negotiations has not been ruled out and that the Ukrainian president has been invited to do so in a recent letter from Clinton. The president's international service has informed a UNIAN correspondent that Nursultan Nazarbayev will make an official visit to Ukraine during Clinton's stay in Moscow. As for the letter, there is, indeed, an invitation in it to a trilateral meeting, but in Washington rather than in Moscow. It is not certain, THE WASHINGTON POST on 3 January quoted a high-ranking representative of the administration as saying, that the American and Ukrainian presidents will meet in Moscow; experts think that this will depend on the results of the U.S.-Ukrainian nuclear talks with the participation of the Russian side, which started in Washington on 3 January. Ukraine is represented there by Vice Premier V. Shmarov and Deputy Foreign Minister B. Tarasyuk. Viktor Stelmakh, press secretary to the Ukrainian president, informed a UNIAN correspondent on 4 January that he could neither confirm nor deny reports of a forthcoming meeting between Kravchuk and Clinton in Moscow, since "there has been no final decision yet."
