As Chinese Premier Li Peng is abroad on official visits to four Central Asian countries and Mongolia, Zhu is presiding over the State Council's work and serving as acting premier. During the meeting, Zhu recalled his visit to Australia in 1992, saying that since that visit, bilateral relations of economic and technological cooperation have soundly developed, high-ranking officials exchanged visits frequently and bilateral political ties improved further. He said China and Australia are mutually complementary in economic structures. Australia produces iron ore and wool, both of which are largely exported to China. At the same time, the two countries can cooperate in the deep-processing of commodities. As long as Australian products maintain competitiveness and australia provides China with advanced technology, the prospects for bilateral cooperation in this regard are broad, he said. Zhu noted that the joint ventures run by the two countries in Australia are successful. "It is China's hope that efforts should be made not only for the enhancement of cooperation between the two governments, but also for the promotion of cooperation between the enterprises of the two countries," he said. Hayden said he was deeply impressed by achievements that China has made in economic construction, adding that Australia places great importance on its economic relations and trade with China. He expressed satisfaction with bilateral trade in the fields of iron ore and wool and agreed to China's views on giving full play to their advantages and conducting cooperation in products' deep- processing. During the meeting, the two also briefed each other on the respective countries' domestic economies.
