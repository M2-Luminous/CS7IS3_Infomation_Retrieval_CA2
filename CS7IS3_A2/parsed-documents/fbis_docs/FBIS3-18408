It is no coincidence that it was under this country's presidency of the European Union [EU] during the first half of last year that the Twelve announced publicly for the first time that they are prepared to accept states from this region in the future. At the same time, it liberalized to a greater extent its internal market for East European exports. One of the men who deserved much of the credit for the progress in rapprochement between East and West on the old continent was Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen. He granted our newspaper an exclusive interview in connection with his visit to the Czech Republic. [Sklenka] The NATO member countries approved the Partnership for Peace [PFP] initiative at their recent summit. In what specific way should the Alliance's plan improve security and stability in Europe? [Petersen] The approval of the PFP initiative can be described as the most important decision made at the NATO summit in January, because its aim is to unite the whole of Europe. The essence of the plan embraces support for practical military and political cooperation, cooperation that reflects the various endeavors and abilities of each signatory country, while involvement in the initiative is open to any country interested in it. In this regard, the PFP eliminates in advance the possibility of Europe being divided and helps to increase stability, confidence, and security. The North Atlantic Alliance's initiative, however, should not be viewed independently, but as an element of the West's broader concept for bolstering peace and improving cooperation and security in Europe. For example, the EU recently came up with a plan for a so-called Stability Pact, whose ultimate aim is the same. [Sklenka] Some of the most senior representatives of the countries of Central and East Europe, nevertheless, point out that, although the initiative de facto brings the postwar division of Europe to an end, NATO could have offered something more than just consultations and joint exercises. [Petersen] The PFP plan is based on the real requirements of the current era in Europe. It would be erroneous to think that this initiative offers only formal consultations, joint exercises, and so on. It is necessary, first and foremost, to be aware of the very crux of the plan, that is, that the PFP represents an important element in filling the security vacuum for the countries of Central and East Europe. The mechanism for consultations -- which enables any participating country to discuss with NATO issues that present a threat to it, infringements of territorial integrity, and political independence -- forms an important part of their security system. As far as guaranteeing their security is concerned, the East European countries may, apart from this, also count on close political and economic cooperation with the EU by means of the association agreements. [Sklenka] In your opinion, when will the time be right to expand the Alliance? [Petersen] The heads of state and government of the NATO member countries declared quite unequivocally at the January summit that the Alliance is open to all European countries. It says in the final declaration, among other things, that "we expect and welcome the opportunity to expand NATO." Denmark supports the attempts by the countries of Central and East Europe to join the Alliance. Nevertheless, we are of the opinion that this process must be gradual, while we consider involvement in the PFP initiative to be an intermediate stage toward full membership in NATO. In no way, however, do we view it as a guarantee of their membership. [Sklenka] Apart from the expansion of political and security cooperation, the Central and East European states are also seeking cooperation in trade. They are demanding greater access to the common EU market. [Petersen] I fully agree with the view that favorable economic development in Central and East Europe is one of the conditions for boosting security and stability in this region. In this regard, Denmark is trying to help to increase as much as possible the access of Central and East European exporters to the EU market. We are absolutely convinced that the liberalization of trade is the best contribution to the success of local political and economic reforms. Our government put forward certain specific measures at the Copenhagen conference last April, the aim of which was to increase their closer trade cooperation with the EU. The results of the conference became a springboard for the Copenhagen summit in June where the Twelve further liberalized their market for imports from the countries of this region. [Sklenka] The Czech Republic and five of the region's other countries have signed association agreements with the EU. These are the first step on the road toward full membership in this organization. In your opinion, when would it be realistic for the Union to begin expanding eastwards? [Petersen] In accordance with a decision made by the European Council, the EU should be expanded on 1 January 1995. Following the probable admission of the four candidate countries -- Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway -- more talks will be held on possible institutional changes and the admission of other new countries at the intergovernmental conference in 1996. Talks on the admission of Central and East European countries into the EU could begin in 1997. The length of the negotiations and the speed of the actual process of their incorporation will be individual and based on the readiness of each country. It seems to me that there is a realistic chance of expanding the Union again at the turn of the century at the earliest. Naturally, Denmark will support -- as it has done until now -- closer cooperation between the Twelve and Central and East Europe. [Sklenka] The association agreements for Hungary and Poland came into effect in February following a two-year ratification procedure. How long could this take in our case? [Petersen] As you know, Denmark was one of the first EU countries to ratify -- in December 1993 -- the Czech Republic's association agreement. I believe that the approval procedure in all the EU member states will be completed by the end of this year so that the document can come into effect on 1 January 1995. Irrespective of this, however, the Czech Republic has a valid Interim Agreement, which encompasses all the economic and trade issues contained in the association agreement, including greater access to the EU market for Czech goods. [Sklenka] The negotiations on expanding the EU to include Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway have reached the final stage after more than a year. As a result of the continuing differences of opinion on the speed of their adaptation to conditions in the Union, however, there is a real risk that the date of their admission will not be adhered to. [Petersen] According to the original timetable, the talks should be completed by tomorrow, if expansion is to be achieved by 1 January 1995. In this context, all the EU states are approaching the talks with the utmost understanding for the demands of the other side and with an effort at compromise. In the event that this does not happen, there is a real risk that the planned date will not be adhered to. In view of the June elections, the mandate of the European Parliament deputies -- who must also ratify the agreements on the admission of new countries into the EU -- will come to an end. [Sklenka] What is your assessment of the current state of cooperation between the Czech Republic and Denmark? [Petersen] I consider bilateral Czech-Danish relations to be very good. During the past few years, we have succeeded in forging very close cooperation on all levels, which has carried mutual cooperation forward onto a qualitatively new perspective. I believe that my official visit to the Czech Republic is confirmation of this positive trend. [Sklenka] How satisfied are you with the participation of Danish companies in privatization in the Czech Republic and in our market in general? [Petersen] The privatization process in the Czech Republic has made considerable progress. Many Danish enterprises are monitoring developments in your country with great interest; some of them have even become actively involved in privatization. For example, Dansk Eternir Fabrik, which is a subsidiary of the largest industrial group in the country, F. L. Smidth, has established a special investment fund for Central and East Europe through which it is taking part in a number of joint enterprises. In the Czech Republic it is involved in 11 joint ventures, including ventures with EZ Beroun and EZA Sumperk. At the moment, approximately 60 Danish companies -- whose activity is focused mainly on trade, industry, and consultancy -- are operating on the Czech market. Denmark considers the Czech Republic to be a very important potential partner for developing economic cooperation, which underscores the increasing interest shown by our companies in investing in your country.
