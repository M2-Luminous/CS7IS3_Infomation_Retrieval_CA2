But the communications workers are the first to go on the warpath against the reformed government. Feeling that in the absence of Gaydar and Fedorov you can get money out of the present government, at any rate having seen that the agrarian lobby, led by Aleksandr Zaveryukha is succeeding in doing so, the communications workers, who do not have such powerful support in high places, have decided on an unexpected, but pretty massive attack. On 10 February we will not see any programs, aside from morning and evening news bulletins, on the "Ostankino" and Russian state television companies' channels. The decision was made by the communications workers' trade union central committee. In all other respects the latest all-Russian strike is no different from previous strikes by workers in other sectors. They are putting forward economic demands, above all the payment of debts. The state television and radio companies, and, therefore, the state, owed the communications workers around 70 billion rubles [R] at the end of last year. Not that much compared with the debts to other sectors. At the end of last year the government directed the Finance Ministry to pay the debt. This was not done, so the debt continued to mount in January. The doubling of electricity tariffs and the increase in other costs have already forced radio communications lines to shut down in a number of cities in the country. The strikers intend to continue the blackout until the debt is paid in full. Television, which was the pawn of the old system, whereby the viewer paid for its work by buying a television set, and then part of the money added to the value of the television set was redistributed at the top, now has to depend on government charity. A government that recently slashed the Russian radio and television company's budget by exactly 50 percent can hardly be described as particularly charitable. What is, in the circumstances, a reasonable decision to introduce television by subscription nonetheless could have serious social consequences. The former leaders of the strike movement are hard on the heels of the striking communications workers. Although the strike by oilworkers at "Yuganskneftegaz," one of the country's biggest associations, planned for the same day, 10 February, has been postponed, the association's working people have not dropped their demands for the payment of debts. And we are talking here about R500 billion. They are demanding a revision of the system for the taxation of fuel and energy complex enterprises and are proposing that Viktor Chernomyrdin immediately hold an all-Russian conference of leaders of oil and gas enterprises, trade unions, and strike committees. At the same time, L. Mironov, chairman of the Russian oil and gas enterprise construction workers' trade union, appealed to the country's president. His open letter says that "the behind-the-scenes games of politicians in the government...are provoking mass actions by working people and the suspension of oil and gas production in the winter, which is bound to have the most disastrous consequences..." Another trade union leader -- V. Ochekurov, chairman of the timber industry workers' trade union central committee -- appealed to the leaders of parliament. The timber workers warned that "there is a danger that timber processing enterprises will close down." The reasons are the same. No pay for five months. Finally, we have the miners. The leaders of the Kuzbass workers' movement have just stated at a Moscow press conference that a major strike will begin on 1 March unless the government presents by then a program to resolve the economic crisis. Blank television screens could certainly spark off new strikes this very winter.
