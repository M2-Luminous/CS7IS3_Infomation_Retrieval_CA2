After any number of meetings, confabs, and minipsychodramas, the tension was finally released in the Republican Party [PR]. Charles Millon and [Trade and Industry Minister] Gerard Longuet prevented the party from breaking away from the Union for French Democracy [UDF] group in the National Assembly. The PR president, as well as Honorary President [and Defense Minister] Francois Leotard, had been nonetheless rather in favor of this idea. Faced with the division that this initiative caused, however, Gerard Longuet chose the path of prudence and kept the party within the UDF. Defusing the crisis that began on 14 June, the party deputies, meeting in the presence of the industry minister on Wednesday evening [22 June] therefore unanimously voted to adopt a motion defining the aims and strategy of the PR in the light of the upcoming presidential election. In the text adopted at the end of the meeting, which lasted more than one and a half hour, the deputies confirmed that they wanted to prepare for the presidential election of 1995 "in the best possible conditions," in order to avoid the fratricidal and bloody battles that marked the 1981 and 1988 presidential elections. For them, this means supporting the candidate for the majority, a principle that had been adopted, they stressed, by the UPF (UDF and RPR [Rally for the Republic]) in 1990. Speaking yesterday on the RTL station, Philippe Vasseur, PR secretary general and deputy for the Pas de Calais region, stated: "The union candidate can be anyone within in the majority (...). We must stop saying that it should be the prime minister." [passage omitted]
