New Delhi also expressed concern that this will result in the delivery of the state-of-the-art F-16 aircraft to Pakistan, providing it with a greater number of delivery systems for weapons of mass destruction. Speaking at a lunch hosted in honor of the visiting U.S. senators, including Mr. Pressler, the minister of state for external affairs, Mr. Salman Khurshid, pointed out that Pakistan already acknowledges possessing weapons of mass destruction. He said the U.S. Administration move will, therefore, destabilize the South Asian region. In such a scenario, India will need to reappraise its defense policies. The minister objected to India being lectured on the human rights issue, especially in the light of a commitment to democratic norms. Mr. Khurshid said India is faced with a proxy war in Kashmir. He made it clear that motivated propaganda against India on human rights will be counterproductive. The U.S. senators--Mr. Pressler, Mr. Cochran, and Mr. Brown--are currently on a visit to several Asian countries. They will also hold talks with the prime minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, and the home minister, Mr. Chavan.
