Professional technical cadres composed mainly of scientific and technological personnel account for more than half of the total cadres, thus becoming an important force in the Army's modernization. To educate and cultivate a large number of both socialist-minded and professionally proficient scientific-technical cadres is a strategic decision made by the Central Military Commission [CMC] under the new period of reform and opening up. The whole Army conscientiously carries out Comrade Deng Xiaoping's belief -- that "science and technology are the primary productive forces" -- and makes great efforts to build a well-coordinated and rationally structured contingent of scientific-technical cadres who have high political awareness, are professionally competent, and possess a good work style. At present, tens of thousands of scientific-technical cadres hold high-level posts in charge of specialized technologies across the whole Army. A dozen of them have been elected academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and more than 5,000 cadres enjoy special allowances from the government. The entire Army attaches importance to cultivating middle-aged and young scientific-technical cadres. Thus far, more than 200 middle-aged and young experts have made outstanding state-level contributions. Of them, the youngest professor is only 28 years old. In our Army, senior experts with outstanding achievements and middle-aged and young experts with marked contributions represent separately the highest or first-class level that our country has reached in certain scientific areas. We have taken the lead in the world in scoring some research results in weapon tests, satellite launching, engineering technology, basic medical science, and superlarge computer development. Hundreds of scientific-technical personnel in our Army have been elected members, directors, or executive chairmen of authoritative academic organizations at home and abroad. Following the development of the contingent of scientists and technicians, our Army established and perfected policies and regulations on managing professional technical cadres to gradually institutionalize and regularize this contingent. The CMC and the PLA headquarters successively promulgated seven sets of regulations for managing professional cadres -- regulations concerning the examination and appointment of professional technical cadres, grade adjustments, grades for civilian employees, and promotions and awards for cadres who have made remarkable contributions. They also made stipulations concerning the political treatment and pay for professional technical cadres. All major units have also taken new measures to encourage scientific-technical personnel. These effective regulations and measures have aroused the enthusiasm of the broad masses of scientific-technical cadres to contribute their wisdom and talents to the modernization of national defense. In recent years, the entire Army has won nearly 10,000 state and military science and technology achievements awards. Many of these achievements have reached advanced international levels or have filled the gap in the fields of science and technology at home.
