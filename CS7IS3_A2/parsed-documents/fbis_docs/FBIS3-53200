AL-THAWRAH says: Perhaps it is not surprising that we are seeing desperate attempts and various techniques to disturb the summit. In this context, we understand Israel's statements--or rather threats--yesterday about a military escalation in southern Lebanon on the eve of the summit to influence its results within the framework of a persistent endeavor to change its results or derail it. AL-THAWRAH adds that yesterday's statements by an Israeli military commander concerning an escalation in Lebanon and attributing such an escalation to a Syrian wish to strengthen its position, as he alleges, are an explicit Israeli threat to hold Syria responsible for the consequences in advance. AL-THAWRAH affirms that such attempts will not cease. The Israeli circles and the media under their influence are not short of means to put pressure on the summit in an attempt to confuse the U.S. decisions that Clinton will carry to Geneva. This is especially since, based on experience, they know well who Hafiz al-Asad is and what exceptional communication skills he possesses, skills that will enable him to convince President Clinton of the fairness of our cause and of our nation's right to restore the occupied territories. AL-THAWRAH adds: Fairness and rights are the central issue that this exceptional leader, Hafiz al-Asad, will carry to the Geneva summit. They realize, and so does the entire world, that Hafiz al-Asad in Geneva is not Syria's president and not an interlocutor with Clinton on behalf of Syria. Rather, the importance of the summit basically stems from the fact that President al-Asad will not speak for or represent Syria alone. Nay, he is the pan-Arab president who will carry the entire pan-Arab issue to the table of negotiations with Clinton in Geneva. AL-THAWRAH adds: That is what al-Asad stands for, that is what he represents, and that is how he dealt with the three other U.S. Presidents with whom he met -- Nixon, Carter, and Bush. The issues that the three other summits dealt with were in fact comprehensive, pan-Arab issues concerning the right of all Arabs to peace and fairness. The upcoming summit will also be like this. Concluding, AL-THAWRAH says: Here again, is the exceptional importance of the upcoming Geneva summit. The entire world is aware of the exceptional importance of this summit, and it is definitely so. TISHRIN comments on the recent Israeli statements expecting an escalation of tension in southern Lebanon prior to the Syrian-U.S. summit in Geneva mid-January. TISHRIN explains that Israel has never ceased its attacks on Lebanon. Hardly a day goes by without a southern Lebanese village being subjected to artillery shelling or an air raid. TISHRIN affirms that Israel is dissatisfied with the convocation of the Syrian-U.S. summit. This is simply because the objective of the summit is to boost the process leading to a comprehensive Middle East peace. Israel does not want peace. It wants to firmly entrench the occupation, continue the settlement activity, and drag Arab sides into separate deals, such as the case with the Palestinian side. Israel also wants to inflame the situation in southern Lebanon. This, the Israeli officials believe, would help cast doubts about the usefulness of the Syrian-U.S. summit. TISHRIN says that if Israel is really interested in peace rather than inflaming and exploding the situation, why does it not accept the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and cooperate with the U.S. initiative and international efforts to establish a firm, durable, and comprehensive Middle East peace? Why does Israel not help render U.S. President Bill Clinton's move successful by declaring its readiness to fully withdraw its troops from the occupied Arab territories and to trade these territories with a genuine, firm peace? TISHRIN says: Syria and Lebanon have spent two years of talks in Washington, but they saw nothing from the Israelis except maneuvering, procrastination, and security pretexts. This is as if Israel's security can only be ensured by threatening the security of Syria and Lebanon and by continuing the occupation of their territories. Concluding, TISHRIN says: Needless to say, Israel's record in southern Lebanon is black and full of crimes. The Lebanese have not yet forgotten the deportation of the entire population of the south during the recent aggression nor Israel's public announcement that it wants to create a new refugee problem in the Middle East. Proceeding from these facts, the Lebanese rule out nothing. Israel is experienced in aggression and in pretending to be an innocent victim.
