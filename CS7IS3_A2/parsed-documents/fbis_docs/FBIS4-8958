Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (F.Y.R.O.M.), the new Macedonian Communist movement is collecting signatures for its petition demanding that they should leave. All foreign troops serving under the U.N. flag should leave the F.Y.R.O.M., as their presence is at odds with some provisions of the state's constitution, says the party's president Trifun Andreevski. Andreevski quotes Articles 122 and 123 of the constitution which state that the sovereignty and independence of Macedonia shall be defended by the Macedonian Army. If this demand is not granted, then the party, based in the western town of Gostivar, demands that at least the U.S. troops be replaced by those from Russia, D.P.R. Korea, China or Japan. The (?incoming) contingent should bring the (?number of) U.S. troops [words indistinct] up to 500. Nearly 1,000 UNPROFOR troops, mostly from Scandinavian countries, have been deployed in the F.Y.R.O.M. since early 1993. A string of ranking U.S. Army and NATO officials have recently been visiting the F.Y.R.O.M., among them U.S. Joint Chief of Staff General John Shalikashvili in early April. [passage indistinct]
