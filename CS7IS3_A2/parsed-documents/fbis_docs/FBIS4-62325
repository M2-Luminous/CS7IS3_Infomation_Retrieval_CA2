"In connection with the unilateral use of international sanctions imposed by the UN Security Council against Yugoslavia, the absence of a reliable international legal mechanism of controlling their implementation (the Duma ruled) to suspend the participation of the Russian Federation in carrying out international sanctions against the union republic of Yugoslavia", the key article of the law says. The lower house of the Russian parliament recommended all government agencies and enterprises to fully restore economic, political, diplomatic and cultural relations with Serbia and Montenegro which were disrupted by the sanctions. The law is yet to be discussed on the second reading, but the Duma had already recommended the president, the government and the Foreign Ministry to "immediately undertake energetic and persistent efforts in the UN framework aimed at lifting sanctions against the union republic of Yugoslavia up to a unilateral refusal to implement the sanctions". Besides, Russian representative at the UN was instructed to raise the issue of imposing sanctions against those conflicting parties in former Yugoslavia who reject an immediate ceasefire and an unconditional beginning of talks. "In case of unilateral lifting of the embargo on arms deliveries to Bosnia, Russia should resort to adequate actions up to raising the issue of a unilateral withdrawal from the regime of sanctions", according to the document. The Duma believes there is currently a real possibility for ensuring peace in former Yugoslavia and called on all warring parties to "immediately cease all combat activities and begin talks on ensuring peace". The chamber said it is ready to promote dialogue between the parties. The lower house also addressed parliamentarians of the world to refrain from decisions "capable of destabilising the situation in former Yugoslavia", and mostly from those which can result in shipments of weapons to a warring side. It also proposed to the states bordering on former Yugoslavia to hold an international conference on overcoming the Balkan crisis with the UN and CSCE participation.
