At the moment, the Russians can destroy only about 2,000 nuclear warheads per year. On the territory of the former Soviet Union there are 30,000 nuclear warheads and, in Russia alone, 40,000 tonnes of chemical weapons. It would take 15 to 20 years to destroy these stocks. An internal paper of the Foreign Ministry says that, in October 1993, an agreement was concluded with the Defense Ministry in Moscow on the construction of a pilot plant for the destruction of the chemical combat agents, lewisite and yperite, in the area of Saratov (final price DM62 million). A mobile laboratory for the analysis of combat agents was handed over to the Russians already in December 1993. The costs for the "disarmament aid for chemical weapons" in 1993: about DM5 million. For the accelerated disarmament of their nuclear weapons Russia and Ukraine have asked the Federal Government this year for equipment as well as control and safety systems at a value of about DM17 million.
