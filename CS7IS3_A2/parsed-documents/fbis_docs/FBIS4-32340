Zoran Lilic's words uttered the day after the session of the Supreme Defense Council of the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] are a clear signal to the Serbian war lobby across the Drina. Lilic said that they cannot "hold hostage" the population on this side of the Drina. These words have attracted the attention of observers in Belgrade. They were said amidst the debate about [Zoran] Djindjic's initiative and the increased pressure Belgrade is exerting on Radovan Karadzic and others to accept the proposed division of Bosnia. The Malcontents Our sources claim that nothing happens by chance. Their interpretation of Djindjic's initiative points out his ever-increasing and ever more important links with Karadzic, and, on the other hand, with Cosic and the church. These people are inclined toward the unitarization of the FRY and toward creating, effectively and legally, a Serbian national state. Milosevic and his leftist national wing are allegedly more inclined toward a "civic state." MONITOR's sources further claim that Bulatovic's "Herzegovina initiative" represented a simpler test. Trebinje Leader Bozidar Vucurovic said that he is not interested in such a project, as his interest is not in a civic, but a national state. Three weeks ago, Milosevic received a delegation of the SPS [Socialist Party of Serbia] from Bosnia. On that occasion, he told them that he wants them to secure power in the Srpska republic, that he will help them do so (not publicly and directly, of course), and that Banja Luka will be the new capital of the Srpska republic. After this, the SPS of the Srpska republic held a convention in Banja Luka, traditionally a stronghold of the opposition against Karadzic (rebellion of a unit last September, disagreement between the 1st Krajina Corps Commander General Talic and the central command, and the like). On the other hand, Karadzic is granted less and less time on the state television and nobody in Belgrade wants to talk officially about his political future, although he is being asked to do the impossible -- convince his top military leadership and followers to give over 20 percent of territories presently under their control to the Bosnian Government without any guarantees that such a division of Bosnia will be long-lasting. Karadzic is not standing still: He is trying to activate his intelligence-police network Tajfun [hurricane] in Belgrade. Many people claim that the role played in all this by Momcilo Mandic, former deputy head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Bosnia-Herzegovina, who is now head of the Bureau of the Srpska republic in Belgrade, is also unclear. Moreover, Karadzic has been closely gathering around himself the anticommunist nucleus (the Plavsic woman, Krajisnik, and others); he has also received secret support by the church at the recent meeting of its top leadership held at the Pec Patriarchate. Belgrade, however, assesses affairs within the Serbian leadership in Bosnia to be "numerous as the sands" and that will be used as a trump card by the socialists in their election campaign. What is this scenario like? Milosevic is counting, or at least was counting, on a longer-lasting truce in Bosnia, which would enable elections to be held there. With the support of the police and television -- somewhat in the fashion in which this was done in Krajina in the case of [Milan] Martic -- Milosevic's candidates would win at these elections. Karadzic will become an old story. Along with General Mladic. Expectations of this kind are still uncertain: The development of the crisis in Bosnia does not promise a permanent peace. This suits Karadzic as destabilization is out of question at the time of possibly decisive battles. A dispute of a fundamental nature has broken out among the Serbs. Heated debates are being held about questions connected with the future and whether it is of any use to continue to wage war. On the other hand, a tough struggle for power has begun between the Serbs across the Drina and Belgrade and it is difficult to predict the final outcome of this clash. Milosevic is trying to rally his war advisers and aides. Radmilo Bogdanovic, however, has said: "I am not pleased by Lilic's statement" -- something that may develop into a tough conflict. MONITOR's sources claim that the opinion prevails among the top Serbian leadership in Bosnia that the war will inevitably continue. These assessments are probably justified from the point of view of General Mladic, for instance: He surely possesses correct reports regarding the intentions of Bosnian and Croatian generals to carry out a breakthrough in northern and western Bosnia. This is clear. Belgrade, however, is prepared to trade with territories, but that is not feasible in practice. Discontentment General Mladic is trying to reorganize his forces. His intention is to form larger mobile tactical units that would be able to be transferred from one front to another whenever there is need to do so. He is also trying to get rid of some officers he considers to be unsuitable. At the same time, Milosevic is criticizing the General Staff of the Yugoslav Army, that is, General Perisic, because of its support to the top Serbian leadership in Bosnia. By carrying out certain cadre changes in the army, he is trying to place under his control this factor that is potentially extremely tricky for him. Discontented with the general situation in the Army, he criticizes General Perisic and others partly for crime in the Yugoslav Army, unsolved murders (see box), and for Yugoslav Army officers "unselectively" departing for Krajina and Bosnia. Through his "exclusive channels," Milosevic is trying to feel the situation in the top leadership of the army of the Srpska republic as well. It seems that he has some serious intentions regarding General Manojlo Milovanovic, currently head of the headquarters of the army of the Srpska republic. This tanker who graduated from high military schools has recently led all large-scale offensive operations of the Srpska army. His position prior to the current one was commander of the Drina Corps of the army of the Srpska republic. An analysis of his statements, particularly concerning crises around Sarajevo and Gorazde this year shows that he often corrects and moderates General Mladic's statements. Satisfied with the mop-up operations carried out in the belt along the Drina last spring, Milosevic has personally appointed him to the post of head of operations of the army of the Srpska republic. In the meantime, a major piece of "ill luck" befell Mladic. At the end of May, Bosnians took Elevation 691 on the Ozren Mount, southwest of Tuzla, that is, the well-known Serbian stronghold of "Vijenac." Even VECERNJE NOVOSTI admitted that and reported on the Serbian loss of about 110 fighters. The article held as responsible the commander of the Serbian "Ozren" tactical group and the commander of the battalion that was defending the said stronghold. The further development of the war crisis might bring more "ill luck" to Mladic and thereby mar his "fame." People in the know claim that he has already been offered the post of commander of the Uzice Corps of the Yugoslav Army, but these rumors are impossible to check. Milosevic, Karadzic, Mladic, Cosic -- again! Serbs, it is said, must "concede" territories in Bosnia. Does this not resemble the haggling over the Vance-Owen plan? Djindjic has now fallen into this maelstrom and he is too close to the Belgrade regime to be able to easily shake off his links across the Drina. After all, he did not establish those links without the Serbian president's knowledge. As a part of Djindjic's initiative, somebody has been trying to mix up Montenegro into all that. In its announcement criticizing the honorable Serbian Democrat, a party says: "You have stuck a dangerous thorn into our people's healthy flesh. That has motivated separatist forces in Cetinje. The sentiment of separating Montenegro from Serbia has been growing," the warning says alarmingly. Belgrade sees "Yugoslavia" as a burden. Nobody knows what to do with it. [Box, p 16] Generals, Death of a Soldier, Crime, Milosevic As the song by singer Kemal Monteno goes, "it was some time in spring," when affairs -- of the kind that usually end with en masse pensioning off -- begun sprouting. Milosevic is now criticizing the General Staff mainly because of some cases of crime, but also unexplained circumstances about the death of soldier Jugoslav Mihajlovic (19) from Pozarevac. Mihajlovic was seriously injured in the Surdulica Barracks on 14 May at about 2340 and later died in a Nis hospital. The Information Service of the General Staff harshly reacted to a report on this case carried by a Belgrade daily. However, assertions in the article have not been denied. On the other hand, crime in the Yugoslav Army has spread so much that General Perisic himself had to deny its existence, speaking before about 100 journalists last week. There is no smoke without fire, people say. Milosevic, however, uses criticism with a view to exerting additional pressure on the top military leadership, something that is confirmed by at least two things: a. The situation in the Yugoslav Army is so rotten that even the commander himself has to talk about it, at least by denying it, and the problem is made much worse by the fact that what is mostly talked about is crime. b. Tension is growing between Milosevic and the generals. Again?
