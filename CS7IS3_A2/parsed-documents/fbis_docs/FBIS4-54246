For the second year in a row, 35 Fijian soldiers were integrated for 12 days in France's Pacific marine infantry regiment, based in Noumea, and carried out various maneuvers. At the same time, a group of French soldiers from the regiment went to Fiji to take part in similar exercises. Transportation was carried out by the French, as the Fijians have no air force. The French military commander here, General Rene Delhome, said military cooperation with Fiji would be stepped up in the future.
