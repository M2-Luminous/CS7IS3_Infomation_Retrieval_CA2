It called on Yemeni leaders to work harder to resolve their differences and cement Yemeni unity, pointing out that Yemen's unity is linked to the region's stability and security. This was declared by Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid at a news conference following the end of the session. Yemen's unity is a "pan-Arab achievement and asset" that must be protected and maintained, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said. The secretary general said that the Arab League Council instructed him to get in touch with Yemeni leaders to seek an immediate end to the fighting and to keep the League's member states informed about his efforts. Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that the Council will consider itself in a state of permanent session to follow up the efforts that various Arab leaders are exerting to end the Yemeni crisis. Answering journalists' questions, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that the dispatch of Arab troops to separate rival forces in Yemen "was not discussed" in today's session. Asked to comment on the news that Yemen is not enthusiastic about the holding of this particular meeting of the Arab League Council, the secretary general said that any two League member states have the right to request a Council meeting. Today's session was at the request of Egypt and Libya, he stated. Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that the Arab League Council does not interfere in the internal affairs of Yemen or any Arab country. The Council respects the sovereignty of all Arab countries, he added. The secretary general pointed out that the Yemeni leadership received an Arab League delegation on 4 March. Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid pointed out that the other Arab leaders attended the signing of the Pledge and Accord document in Amman, on 20 February, a matter which, the secretary general added, confirms Arab interest in the situation in Yemen.
