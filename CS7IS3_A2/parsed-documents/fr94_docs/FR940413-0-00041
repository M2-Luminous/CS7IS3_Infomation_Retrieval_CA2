FR940413-0-00041 FR940413-0-00011 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Minerals Management Service 30 CFR Part 206 Allowances for Extraordinary Gas Processing Costs AGENCY: Minerals Management Service (MMS), Interior. ACTION: Notice of intent to retain extraordinary cost provisions. SUMMARY: The Royalty Management Program of the Minerals Management Service (MMS) has regulatory provisions for gas processing cost allowances that exceed normal industry standards. The MMS had intended to develop criteria for the conditions and practices in the gas processing industry and for technologies that are unusual, extraordinary, or unconventional. However, after careful analysis of the comments received on the gas valuation regulations, as well as comments concerning whether extraordinary cost allowance provisions should be developed for its oil, coal, and geothermal product value regulations, MMS has decided to determine on a case-by-case basis whether an operation is outside of normal industry operational standards. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: David S. Guzy, Chief, Rules and Procedures Staff, MMS, Royalty Management Program, at (303) 231&hyph;3432. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background (a) History of Regulation for Extraordinary Cost Allowances The MMS gas valuation regulations at 30 CFR 206.158(d)(2)(i) (1993) state that MMS may grant an allowance for extraordinary costs of processing if the lessee can demonstrate that the costs are, by reference to standard industry conditions and practice, extraordinary, unusual, or unconventional. The MMS intended to apply this provision to advanced processing technologies or unusual conditions that are outside of normal industry operational standards. The MMS published a Notice in the Federal Register on November 28, 1988 (53 FR 47829), entitled ``Allowances for Extraordinary Costs, Transportation, and Gas Processing'' and solicited comments on what factors would comprise criteria for standard practices and conditions and for assessing when a project would qualify for an extraordinary cost allowance. The comment period was originally due to close on January 27, 1989, but MMS, by Federal Register Notice dated January 25, 1989 (54 FR 3623), extended the due date for public comments to March 15, 1989.
