Such a deployment, Martic says in his letter, is absolutely unacceptable and out of the question for us. The same goes for other RSK borders except those along demarcation lines with the Republic of Croatia, in accordance with the Zagreb agreement. Reminding UNPROFOR Commander de Lapresle that he was one of the signatories of the Zagreb cease-fire agreement, in his letter Martic also points out: The governments of the RSK and the APWB have signed an agreement on friendship and cooperation; there have been no incidents in the border area and there is no need for your presence in this area, Martic says in conclusion.
