According to the German Machine-Building and Plant-Construction Association, just under 40 percent of all German exports to the People's Republic consists of machines. In the first nine months of last year, machines and plant worth approximately 3.2 billion German marks [DM] were exported to China. Total German exports involved about DM6.4 billion. According to the Association's estimates, exports in the machine-building sector will reach DM3.5 billion for the whole year. In the past 15 years, the export of machines to China increased constantly, with some fluctuations. Whereas the export volume of German machines and plants to China was still DM1 billion in 1980, it increased, after a slight fall, to DM2.4 billion in 1985 and to DM3.2 billion in 1986. The reservation of German exporters was clearly noticeable in the three years after the Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing in June 1989, when the volume dropped again to below DM2 billion. The majority -- a quarter -- of German machines exported to this East Asian country are textile machines, followed by machine tools (18 percent), and packaging and food-processing machines (8 percent). Trade with China has changed fundamentally since the country opened up. Whereas German exporters had to negotiate the conditions of their deliveries to China with 10 to 12 foreign trade offices at the end of the 1970's, when the Chinese Government adopted the first cautious reform measures, it is now possible to contact Chinese buyers directly. Step by step, large and later medium-sized and small enterprises were granted permission to negotiate directly with foreign partners. In addition, the country relaxed its foreign exchange regulations considerably and standardized the exchange rate on 1 January this year. However, "this is unfavorable for Chinese enterprises that import goods," stated Ruiquan Cheng, secretary general of the "Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society," an association of 4,000 machine-building enterprises and 17,000 engineers. After the standardization of the exchange rate, the Chinese enterprises no longer enjoy the former privileges for the exchange of Chinese renminbi against dollars or German marks. However, the impact on the country's imports is still unclear. According to the secretary general, German enterprises are still too little known and their presence is not sufficient in the Chinese market. As far as machines and plants are concerned, Japanese exporters accounted for 35 percent in 1992 (more recent data are not available). The Germans only supplied 17 percent of the Chinese imports in this sector. Still, German enterprises are doing quite well in this area. Before the United States, they were the second-largest supplier of machines to the PRC.
