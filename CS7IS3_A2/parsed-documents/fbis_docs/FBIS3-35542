The statement emphasized that those attempts were a natural outcome of the operations conducted by 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam squads. In its statement, Hamas announced that as long as the occupation, the settlers, and their weapons, exist and as long as the prisoners remain in prison, Hamas and 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam will hold a dialogue with Rabin only through the bullet. The statement noted that Hamas will overcome all Israeli attempts to embarrass it, and that all the political maneuvers and trial balloons floated by the Israeli Government were doomed to failure. The statement clarified the Hamas position on the agreement that has canceled the issues of Jerusalem and the refugees, negated Palestinian control, and allowed the Jews to build more settlements. The statement said Hamas will do all in its power to foil this plan by the permitted legitimate means, far from the violence being practiced by Rabin's government.
