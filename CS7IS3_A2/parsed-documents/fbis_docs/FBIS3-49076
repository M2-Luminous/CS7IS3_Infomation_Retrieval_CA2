What did you discuss? [Akmadzic] It is correct that Mr. Hrvoje Sarinic and I visited Belgrade at the initiative of the cochairmen of the peace conference, Owen and Stoltenberg. In Belgrade, we held talks with Serbian representatives, the leaders of Serbs from Bosnia-Herzegovina, Radovan Karadzic, Momcilo Krajisnik, and Nikola Koljevic. The talks were also attended by the representatives of Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic and Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic. The talks were also attended by some other important persons, the cochairmen of the peace conference, and some members of their expert teams. All issues that burden Croatian-Serbian relations in Bosnia-Herzegovina were discussed, such as the issue of delineation. We also discussed how to jointly approach the issue of concessions, the issue of making concessions, or, as this is referred to in the negotiations, territorial concessions for the Muslim Republic in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In this regard, the Serbian side was more obliged to make territorial concessions, while the Croatian side was obliged to consider concessions regarding an access to the sea. The talks, all aspects of the talks, so to speak, focused on these issues. The result of the talks was, we can call it, the joint proposal in Geneva made with the cochairmen for settling this issue, which was unfortunately not fully concluded and agreed on at the end. However, joint principles were established as to how to make concessions to the Muslim Republic in Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Suljak] Could you tell us, without giving us a hard diplomatic answer, whether you returned from Belgrade satisfied? [Akmadzic] No, I, personally, did not return satisfied from Belgrade. I must immediately stress that from Belgrade we went to Vienna where we held talks with Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Silajdzic and his aides. The talks that were held there focused on virtually the same topics and problems. These talks represent bilateral contacts, which, if I may say so, have been going on continuously between the negotiating rounds in Geneva and Brussels. We were not satisfied. I repeat, I personally was not satisfied. I am not satisfied because the Geneva-Brussels talks were again adjourned, because they ended without a final settlement. I would like to use this opportunity to say that, apart from these talks, other continuous contacts between the Serbian and the Muslim sides are also maintained in Sarajevo, at the local airport. Therefore, what should be emphasized is that contacts among the three sides are being maintained all the time. The negotiations in Geneva happen periodically, after these contacts. Such contacts will continue to be maintained. I am not saying that the Belgrade meeting will be repeated, but contacts aimed at finding a lasting solution, establishing a cease-fire, and ending all hostilities will be maintained. Joint Solution [Suljak] Did the Serbian and the Muslim sides demand from the Croatian side at these talks in Vienna and Belgrade anything else that the public does not know? Were there any new, additional demands at the expense of the Croatian side? [Akmadzic] No, one cannot talk about something being demanded at the expense of someone else. I can say that all these talks were held in a good atmosphere. However, no one is demanding anything at the expense of someone else. We were trying to find a joint solution. Of course, every side is trying to get the best possible deal, which none of the three sides found very easy anyway. [Suljak] How is it that you accompanied Hrvoje Sarinic and not, for instance, Mate Boban, especially in view of the fact that Radovan Karadzic represented the other side? [Akmadzic] I was in the Croatian side because I am a Croat, if you want to know on whose side I am. Without a Compromise [Suljak] No, we know that, but why was Mr. Boban not present at these talks? [Akmadzic] I was chosen to go there, in agreement with Mr. Boban. Therefore, there was nothing unusual in this, except what was agreed. When the Croatian republic of Herzeg-Bosna was founded, the need arose for the involvement of as many people from different positions as possible. [Suljak] What is your comment on the increasingly frequent reports in some Croatian and foreign media on the replacement of Mate Boban, especially the articles that are already promoting you as the next top man in the Croatian republic of Herzeg-Bosna. [Akmadzic] I will not give you a diplomatic answer, but will be sincere, I have not been reading newspapers recently. I am very busy. I would not want to comment on this. Mr. Mate Boban is president of the Croatian republic of Herzeg-Bosna and president of HDZ [Croatian Democratic Community]. These are his posts and this is what he is. I am minister for inter-republican and international cooperation. My job is also to act as a coordinator, so to speak, between the Croatian and Muslims sides and reestablish trust. I also perform certain jobs in the political body for relations between the Croats from Herzegovina and the Croats from Bosnia, that is, the political representative body in the future union of Bosnia-Herzegovina republics. I have too many jobs and I have no time to think about anything else. [Suljak] So, no one approached you recently with the proposal to perform the duties of the top man of the Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna in the future? [Akmadzic] I have already told you, Mr. Mate Boban is president of the Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna.
