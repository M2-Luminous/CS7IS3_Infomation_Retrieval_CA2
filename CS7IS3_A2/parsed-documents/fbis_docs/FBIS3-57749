Touching upon the problem of foreign investments in the Russian economy, Chernomyrdin emphasised that last year had seen no cardinal changes as regards Russia's readiness for cooperation. Inside Russia, conditions for the operation of foreign investors gradually change, albeit too slowly, he said. Russia can accept and "digest" foreign investments amounting to at least 10,000-12,000 million U.S. dollars a year, not as "aid" but on mutually beneficial commercial terms, Chernomyrdin said. "We are prepared for joint work in this respect, to set up, in particular, a multilateral council of foreign and Russian bankers, investors, and entrepreneurs and jointly examine investment cooperation possibilities with respect to particular sectors and enterprises," the Russian prime minister said. Chernomyrdin expressed readiness to participate in the work of such a council, a session which could be held in Moscow in May-June. In conclusion, the Russian premier voiced hope that the World Economic Forum would promote the understanding of the processes taking place in Russia. Then he answered questions asked by plenary meeting participants. January saw a campaign during which Russia was accused of curtailing reforms and the Russian Government was alleged to have a desire to reverse the reform process. "I would like to state once again: Russia will not turn backwards and will not swerve off the road of reforms. This is guaranteed, primarily, by the Constitution which reflects the realities of a democratic society, democratic Russia. We have the president who is the guarantor of what we do now. You may rest assured that my government will go ahead with reforms and will not turn off the road," Chernomyrdin said.
