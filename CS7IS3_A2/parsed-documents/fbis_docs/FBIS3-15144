Saatpalu said he would have been surprised if Russia had stuck to its earlier promise to withdraw the troops from Estonia by Aug. 31. "I'm aware that nobody can come up with solutions to the problems of the troop withdrawal," he said. Commenting on the debates about the 1920 Tartu Peace Treaty, Saatpalu said he doesn't know any force "that would make Russia recognize the validity of the treaty." "Estonia has two options to get back five percent of its territory: it can either declare war on Russia or seek out political forces that would make clear to Russia the advantages of returning Estonian lands it currently holds," Saatpalu said. The commission chairman sees two possible solutions also to the problem of Russian military pensioners: they can be either deported or convinced of the profitability of returning to Russia. Saatpalu considers it unlikely, however, that any of the non-Estonians will voluntarily leave Estonia. "It may be different if they get paid for it," he said. Saatpalu voiced his conviction that Russia will not achieve its objectives in issues related to the pensioned military. "Since Estonian laws stipulate that they must leave, any compromises on this issue are ruled out," he maintained. Saatpalu announced that members of the foreign affairs commissions of the Russian State Duma and the Estonian parliament will get together in the first half of the year.
