ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the regulations for delegations of authority relating to general redelegations of authority from the Associate Commissioner of Regulatory Affairs to certain FDA officials in the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH). The redelegation provides these officials with authority to grant or deny certain citizen petitions for exemption or variance from medical device tracking requirements. This action is being taken to facilitate expeditious handling of citizen petitions. FDA is also issuing a conforming amendment to the medical device tracking regulations to make the regulations consistent. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 17, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Joseph M. Sheehan, Center for Devices and Radiological Health (HFZ&hyph;84), Food and Drug Administration, 2098 Gaither Rd., Rockville, MD 20850, 301&hyph;594&hyph;4765, or Ellen Rawlings, Division of Management Systems and Policy (HFA-340), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, 301&hyph;443&hyph;4976. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: FDA is amending the regulations in §5.31 Petitions under part 10 (21 CFR 5.31) by granting the authority to the Director and Deputy Directors, CDRH, and the Director, Office of Compliance (previously known as the Office of Compliance and Surveillance), CDRH, to issue responses to citizen petitions submitted in accordance with §§10.30 and 821.2(b) (21 CFR 10.30 and 821.2(b)) requesting an exemption or variance from the provisions of part 821 concerning medical device tracking requirements. FDA is making a conforming amendment to 821.2(b), which currently lists only the Director, Office of Compliance and Surveillance, CDRH, as authorized to issue such responses, to add the Director and Deputy Directors, CDRH. Further redelegation of the authority delegated is not authorized. Authority delegated to a position by title may be exercised by a person officially designated to serve in such position in an acting capacity or on a temporary basis.
