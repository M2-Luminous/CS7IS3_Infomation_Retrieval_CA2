FR940927-0-00048 FR940927-0-00007 IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments Following are summaries of all substantive written comments on the proposed amendment that were received by OSM, and OSM's responses to them. 1. Public Comments Pursuant to section 411 of SMCRA and 30 CFR 884.15(a) and 884.14(a)(1), OSM invited public comment and provided an opportunity for a public hearing on the Navajo Nation's proposed amendment and certification of completion of coal reclamation (administrative record No. NA&hyph;214). No public comments were received, and because no one requested an opportunity to testify at a public hearing, no hearing was held. 2. Agency Comments Pursuant to 30 CFR 884.15(a) and 884.14(a)(2), OSM solicited comments on the proposed amendment and request for concurrence with the Navajo Nation's certification of completion of coal reclamation from Federal, State, and Tribal agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Navajo Nation plan (administrative record Nos. NA&hyph;209 and NA&hyph;215). Navajo Environmental Protection Administration (Navajo EPA) Navajo EPA stated that the proposed amendment of the Navajo Nation plan differed from SMCRA and provided comments in a letter dated May 27, 1994 (administrative record No. NA&hyph;219), including editorial comments pertaining to the specific language proposed in the plan amendment and suggestions on how to improve such language. These editorial comments are available in the administrative record for this amendment, and a copy has been provided to the Navajo Nation. However, because these comments are nonsubstantive in nature, OSM has not addressed them below. (1) Navajo EPA stated that the title of the Navajo Nation plan should be changed to the ``Navajo Abandoned Mine Lands Reclamation Plan'' to clarify that the plan refers only to abandoned mine land reclamation, and not to any active mines, over which NAMLRD has no jurisdiction. OSM responds that the Navajo Nation's Reclamation Plan is approved under Title IV, Abandoned Mine Reclamation, of SMCRA and not under Title V, Control of the Environmental Impacts of Surface Coal Mining, which provides the authority for States to administer coal mining regulatory programs. No legislation exists granting Indian tribes the authority to regulate coal mining on Indian lands.
