Hagen believes that it is of little significance whether or not Norway becomes a member of the EU [European Union]. Nor does he think that Norwegian influence in the EU is important in itself. "The central issue is party political influence, not nationalistic considerations," he said. The Progress Party chairman has little enthusiasm for Norwegian EU membership, even though he expects that he will end up saying "yes." He is planning to make public his personal view of Norwegian membership at a press conference today. Hagen said that even though he is basically positive toward the EU, he has grown more and more skeptical toward the plans for further union. He has little enthusiasm for the EU's goal of a common currency and a central bank, and is also deeply dissatisfied with the EU's agricultural and regional policies which he believes bear the mark of the planned economy. The only unambiguously positive aspect of the EU that he can see is the importance of the organization for peace and security in Europe. "The sum total of all the rest is neither here nor there. By this I mean that Norwegian membership will not in itself mean major changes. Both the `no' and `yes' sides exaggerate when they respectively portray the EU as a hell and as a paradise. The important thing is how Norway adapts and what policies we pursue. We could for example choose to follow the EU's rules even if we remained outside," Hagen said. Hagen does not want the party's national conference this coming weekend to reach a decision on the full negotiated membership agreement with the EU, and pointed out that the party's program has laid down that the matter will be decided at a meeting of the party's national executive. Party chairman Hagen thinks that the organization needs time to evaluate the outcome of the negotiations and backs an extraordinary national executive meeting in June. He also stressed, however, that he fully accepts that the national conference can reach a decision on Norwegian membership if this is the wish of the national conference.
