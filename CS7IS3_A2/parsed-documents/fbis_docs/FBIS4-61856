Highly symptomatic. First, the IMF. On page 57 of the documents examined by the IMF council there is a curious table on Russia's implementation of its earlier pledges on financial stabilization and economic reforms as of the beginning of April 1994. The table contains 15 items, and on the right it shows the progress made in implementing them. Now, you will encounter "not implemented" nine times, "partially implemented" or "uncertain" twice, and "implemented" four times, and all four occasions relate to 1993. There are various ways of interpreting the esteemed IMF governors' motives and the political factors that dictated the positions of, for example, the "big seven." But you do not exactly lack evidence that things are not as fine and dandy here as certain officials would have it. Let us look at the recent statement by the government and Central Bank on economic policy in 1994. At least six times it states the intention not to fix a currency rate or prices, not to implement mutual offsetting of debts, not to resume import subsidies or preferential credits. It is important, of course, to give assurances of what "we will not do." But what "will we do"? The most important measures are the promise not to give extensions on earlier credit issues any longer (interesting to see how this would work in the agrarian complex), hold more credit auctions, and reduce centralized exports and imports. Fine, but by no means enough. The 1993 policy can and must be continued, but the reforms must also continue. The statement says that "the unification of the monetary systems of the CIS states with the Russian monetary system is possible only through the adaptation of the states' economic systems...." Vague, but at least it is clear that there is a need to adapt, and it will take many countries years to do that. But adaption suddenly occurred in just a few days. How do you explain the feverish signing of the agreement with Belorussia [Belarus]? Incidentally, this is not taken into account in the draft budget either from the viewpoint of inflationary processes or from the viewpoint of promised state credits. Most important is the government's objective. In this case it is to reduce inflation to 7 percent in December 1994 from 8 percent in March at the time when the statement was prepared. Not very ambitious.... But even the figures that are cited prompt questions. The budget projections are fundamentally important. According to them, the federal budget deficit will not exceed 62 trillion rubles [R] in 1994. Now, at the end of April, we are being offered a further deficit of R6.4 trillion in Central Bank issues, mainly in the form of a concession to the agrarian lobby. An obvious trend. It is interesting that even the IMF experts, in their report, indicated that income had been overstated and expenditure understated by at least R45 trillion, which it was intended to find through various taxation and other measures. I dare say that only a fraction of the income measures are at the adoption stage, and there is no question of any real revenue or real cuts at the moment. My personal view is that the hidden deficit is of the order of R60 trillion. If you add to this R80-90 trillion in potential expenditure contained in laws, edicts, and decrees which no one has abolished, but which are not included in the budget, then the optimism dwindles even further. The lack of real action, the creeping increase even in the acknowledged budget deficit, and the deferential treatment given to various lobbies are bound to cause alarm. I very much hope I am mistaken, but at the moment I see no reason to revise my somber forecasts. Once again we are on the path of rising inflation, devaluation of savings, almost total curtailment of investments, and absence of economies. And it is the poor who are hit hardest by inflation. The government's latest actions to increase the deficit while doing nothing in the economic policy sphere could well make even the democratic factions in parliament stop supporting the draft budget, which is cleary becoming simply bad, having been only just tolerable. If a policy adjustment has begun, it will have to be carried out with the support of different forces.
