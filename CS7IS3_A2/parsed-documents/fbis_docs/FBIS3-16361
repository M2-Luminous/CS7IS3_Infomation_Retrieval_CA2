In a statement received by ITAR-TASS on Wednesday [16 March], Livshits admits that "the Federal Assembly, of course, has the right to determine legislative work priorities". However, Livshits, dr. of science (economics), is of the opinion that "the Russian economy is now in need of a legislative basis for a market economy, not a state of emergency which would not resolve a single deep-seated problem". Livshits also points out that "the government, basing itself on the presidential message to the Federal Assembly, must energetically implement its programme and monitor the situation. The government should not be pulled about and rendered panicky," he emphasises. The presidential message determines a reform strategy and basic guidelines for domestic and foreign policies. "No such thing as an economic state of emergency is spelled out there," the presidential adviser noted. "The president makes active efforts in a quest for national concord. Any actions of the Federal Assembly in this respect will find understanding and support. But concord does not mean a renunciation of reform or a rollback to unjustified emergency measures," Livshits stressed.
