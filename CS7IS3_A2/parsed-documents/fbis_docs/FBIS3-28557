Pae Myong-kuk of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] has decided to resign from the central executive council and as chairman of the South Kyongsang Provincial chapter of his party, it was reported Monday. Pae is under suspicion of having conspired with an aide to former Rep. Pak Chae-kyu to expose a scandal in which Pak had received bribes amounting to 200 million won from his supporters in 1989. Pae replaced Pak at the National Assembly after Pak's conviction on charges of accepting the bribes. But two weeks ago, Pak's aide came forward and said he had exposed the scandal at the instigation of Pae, from whom he received 2 million won. In resigning from the party post and the provincial chairmanship, Pae took "moral responsibility" for the affair when he called on DLP Secretary-General Mun Chong-su Monday morning. During the meeting, Mun said Pae apologized for causing trouble for the party and the secretary-general. "Rep. Pae will officially announce his intention to resign from those posts Monday," Mun said. Pae insisted, however, that he had not instigated former Rep. Pak's aide, Kim Tae-wol, to bring bribery charges against his boss. But he admitted that he had given 2 million won to Kim Tae-wol after learning that Pak had received bribes.
