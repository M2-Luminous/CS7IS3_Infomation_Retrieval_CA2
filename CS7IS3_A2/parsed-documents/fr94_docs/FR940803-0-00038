FR940803-0-00038 FR940803-0-00016 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 94&hyph;AGL&hyph;7] Establishment of Class D and E Airspace; Kenosha, WI.; Revocation of Class E Airspace; Kenosha, WI AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action establishes Class D and Class E4 airspace at Kenosha, WI. This action also revokes the Class E5 airspace at Kenosha, WI. An air traffic control tower has been commissioned at Kenosha Municipal Airport. The intended effect of this action is to provide adequate Class D airspace for instrument flight rules (IFR) operations and require two-way radio communication at Kenosha Municipal Airport, and to establish Class E airspace for instrument approach procedures in areas outside the Class D surface area. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 UTC, October 13, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert J. Woodford, Air Traffic Division, System Management Branch, AGL&hyph;530, Federal Aviation Administration, 2300 East Devon Avenue, Des Plaines, Illinois 60018, telephone (708) 294&hyph;7568. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On Monday, April 4, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class D and E4 Airspace at Kenosha Municipal Airport, Kenosha, WI (59 FR 15667). The proposal was to add controlled airspace extending upward from the surface designated as an extension to a Class D surface area. Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D, Class E4 and Class E5 airspace designations are published respectively in Paragraphs 5000, 6004, and 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D and E4 airspace designations listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The Class E5 airspace designation listed in this document will be subsequently removed. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes Class D airspace with Class E arrival extensions at Kenosha Municipal Airport. An air traffic control tower was commissioned at Kenosha Municipal Airport. Controlled airspace at an airport with an operating control tower is designated as Class D airspace. The intended effect of this action is to provide adequate Class D airspace for IFR operations and require two-way radio communications at Kenosha Municipal Airport. The Class D surface area does not completely contain six instrument approach procedures. This Class E4 airspace will contain the instrument approach procedures in controlled airspace without imposing a requirement on aircraft operating under visual flight rules within the Class E4 area to communicate with the Kenosha Municipal Airport air traffic control tower. The Class E5 airspace at Kenosha Municipal Airport is revoked due to the commissioning of the air traffic control tower. Aeronautical maps and charts will reflect the defined area which will enable pilots to circumnavigate the area in order to comply with applicable visual flight rule requirements. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
