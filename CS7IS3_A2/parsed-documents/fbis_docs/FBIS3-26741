Up to the end of 1993, there were more than 340 registered large and medium aircraft (each with over 100 seats). The greatest changes brought by the initial formation of our country's civil aviation transport network are the transition from a sellers' market to a buyers' market in passenger air transportation. By the end of 1986, the number of passenger seats provided by the mainland civil aviation industry exceeded 15,400; there were 288 domestic and international air lines; and the total mileage served reached 1.548 billion metric ton km. At that time, passengers found it very difficult to buy air tickets, and some did not hesitate to buy second-hand tickets from ticket scalpers at high prices. By 1993, the number of passenger seats provided by the mainland civil aviation industry exceeded 50,000, an increase of 230 percent over that of 1986. There were over 610 domestic and international airlines, and the total mileage served reached 5.2 billion metric ton km. Today, passengers can easily buy air tickets, and sometimes they can choose from a number of flights. According to statistics, the average passenger seat utilization rate in 1986 was 89.7 percent, whereas the average passenger seat utilization rate in 1993 was 72.4 percent. The formation of a buyers' market led to the real beginning of competition among various airlines. The prime concern of safety, high-quality services, flights that depart and arrive on schedule, and replacing the fleet with new models of aircraft are important chips which airlines can use to solicit passengers. The rapid development of airlines also caused some difficulties and problems: The quantity of large aircraft is increasing too quickly and there is a lack of pilots, particularly high-quality pilot trainers; there is not enough time for technological development due to frequent refits; and the standard of service provided by the ground crew and aviation control personnel demands prompt improvement -- the whole contingent must be strengthened. The departments and leaders concerned have attached great importance to these problems.
