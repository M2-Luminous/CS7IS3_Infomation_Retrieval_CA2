He graduated from the historical faculty of Tbilisi State University and defended his dissertation on 19th century Georgian history; he is a candidate of historical sciences. He has worked in the Historical Museum, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Political Department of the Head of State. Since November 1993, he has been in charge of the Press Service of the Head of State. [passage omitted] [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] What does your service concern itself with in the main? [Kandelaki] First and foremost, the interests of the state. I consider it intolerable when the mass media distorts certain facts and interprets them in its own way, while not attaching great significance to this. In such cases, it is a question of the violation of the interests of the state. We demand from all the mass media -- we also cooperate with the opposition press -- accuracy and authenticity. [passage omitted] [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] Finally, the matter of censorship. Does it exist or not? Moreover, to what extent is its existence justified in general? [Kandelaki] I believe there is no censorship now. It is another matter that each journalist should have, so to speak, his own internal censorship that functions regardless of his personal sympathies and antipathies. Moreover, the criterion for assessing phenomena of one kind or another should be the interests of the state.
