We have news from Vienna-based reporter Cha Man- sun: [Begin Cha recording] A few minutes ago, the IAEA issued a special statement regarding North Korea's replacing fuel rods at the nuclear reactor. After assessing that it can take all necessary steps to implement the nuclear agreement in the initial stage of replacing fuel rods at the North Korean nuclear reactor, the IAEA has made an urgent proposal that it will immediately send a working- level delegation [silmu taepyodan] to North Korea to discuss the issue. The IAEA has issued the statement because it believes that it cannot verify the conversion of nuclear materials by North Korea if North Korea continues changing fuel rods without taking any necessary steps -- such as taking samples from the spent fuel rods -- for the inspection team. In particular, the IAEA warned that it has no alternative but to report to the IAEA Board of Governors, as well as to the UN Security Council, because North Korea's changing of fuel rods without taking any steps according to the nuclear agreement required by the IAEA is a grave violation of the agreement. The IAEA has asked North Korea to immediately cooperate on necessary steps according to the nuclear agreement [haekhyopchongsang pilryohan chochie chukkak hyopcho] and, at the same time, urged it to delay changing the fuel rods. Finally, the IAEA warned that it cannot but make a conclusion that it cannot verify the previous conversion of nuclear materials by North Korea [kwago pukhanui haekmulchil chonyongul] if North Korea continues changing fuel rods in the future.
