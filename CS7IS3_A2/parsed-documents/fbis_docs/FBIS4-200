The most important of these promises was the commitment made to endow our country with democratic institutions so our people can choose their representatives. This year, on the eve of 3 April 1994, I address you with particular delight. The 19 December 1993 multiparty presidential elections constitute one of the most important accomplishments of the democratization process in our country. Of course, one cannot talk about these elections without paying tribute to the whole country and without mentioning 3 April 1984. This date was an historical turning point when all the sons of the country came together to form a united, strong, and prosperous Guinea. This turning point also enabled us to open up to the outside world, establish individual and collective freedoms, prepare for economic liberalism, adopt a constitution, and create all the constitutional institutions, all the things that are indispensable for the establishment of a country where the rule of law prevails. Like 28 September 1958, 3 April 1984 is a milestone in the glorious history of our country. That is why I pay glowing tribute to all those who, either known or unknown, contributed to the accomplishment of this permament task, particularly the members of the Military Committee of National Redress and our valiant Army who were able to bring Guineans together to fight against the challenges of the moment. Dear countrymen, I have already said the real winner of the presidential election of December 1993 remains the people. My wish is that Guineans would use this victory to improve democracy building in the country. This means each and everyone should contribute his part to regular legislative elections in the future and for all to respect the laws and republican institutions. Furthermore, I am pleased with the detente which characterizes the current political and social scene. Credit must go to all the nation's politicians for this important achievement. This victory should also serve as an impetus to the socioeconomic development of the country, which is undoubtedly one of the conditions for the survival of democracy. I call on all sons and daughters of the country to view the first five-year term of office of the Third Republic as an example of the profound change possible within the appropriate institutional framework. We must create the basis for the genuine revival of the national economy, work toward integrated development, and modernize through a change of attitude and behavior. It is clear the subregional, regional, and international economic atmosphere is difficult, but I have confidence in the creative and fighting spirit of Guineans. In regard to economic growth, I consider energy and communication infrastructure essential for a real economic take off. That is why sustained efforts have been directed and will continue to be directed toward these priorities. I am pleased to inform you, dear countrymen, that negotiations with financial backers have been successful and the construction of the Garafiri Dam will begin by the end of this year. The reorganization of the energy and post and telecommunications sectors should soon help improve the operations of these services. Road construction projects under way on some of our highways should be multiplied to take the country out of its isolated situation. I remain convinced that the cornerstone of our development rests with the farmer. It is therefore appropriate to intensify the policy of agricultural development and support the village water supply program which is beneficial to our people in the rural areas. One of our major social problems now is unemployment. I therefore call on the creative ability of Guineans for the exploitation of the private sector. When this sector is harmoniously coordinates with government's efforts it can generate employment within the framework of national solidarity. It is at this cost that we can achieve a more balanced society. Fellow Guineans, achieving this large-scale program requires huge resources. Unfortunately, we are poor. Therefore, the thing to do is to judiciously use existing resources while seeing to the sound management of government property. Furthermore, by maintaining and improving our country's relations with international financial institutions and friendly countries, on the basis of already secured confidence, we can count on the support required for our economic recovery. It is understood that all external contributions should essentially be acquired to supplement our own efforts. Meanwhile, the policies pursued so far in developing the education and health infrastructure has helped to achieve results considered exemplary on the continent. These policies should be resolutely continued and reinforced. To enable our women and youth to fully fulfill their roles in building up the country, it is important to reactivate their organizations at all levels. The same goes for labor unions, whose function should be adapted to the new situation. Fellow Guineans, in being confronted with all sorts of challenges, African states have no other options than to join their resources within the framework of subregional groupings, or even larger ones. It is this profound conviction which makes me say that backing subregional integration will be one of the guidelines of our African policy. Concerning the Liberian conflict, the Guinean people's efforts remain fruitful. In fact, the recent installation of institutions which are expected to lead to the democratic elections called for by all Liberians has proved that our people's views are correct. South Africa is preparing for its first multiracial elections, and their success will sanction an end to the apartheid system. In the Middle East, our desire to always strive for the defense of justice and the people's legitimate rights has always dictated our position of principle. This stand has always inspired our unflinching support for the Palestinian people's just cause. The progress made in seeking solutions to the Israel-PLO conflict comforts us. To contribute to the peace process which has been initiated, we will bring the necessary changes to our policy to back and favor the establishment of a constructive dialogue between the protagonists. But we will do this without any shady deals, and by making sure that justice has prevailed. In the same vein, it is noted that the former Yugoslavian crisis continues. But recent efforts by the United Nations and Europe give us hope. Dear countrymen, our road is long and inevitably strewn with obstacles. However, the future is bright. While wishing you a happy anniversary, I call on you to set to work to make the first five-year plan the plan for all and sundry. But this should be done in a spirit of sound emulation, equity, tolerance, and peace. Long live the Republic!
