Description of the Proposed Amendment By letter dated May 17, 1994 (Administrative Record No. OH&hyph;2018), the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Reclamation (Ohio), submitted proposed Program Amendment Number 68. In this amendment, Ohio proposes to revise three rules in the Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) to make the Ohio program as effective as the corresponding Federal regulations concerning contemporaneous reclamation. The specific rule revisions proposed by Ohio in this amendment are briefly described below. 1. OAC section 1501:13&hyph;1&hyph;02 paragraph (J): Ohio is adding this new paragraph to define the term ``mining area.'' 2. OAC section 1501:13&hyph;4&hyph;02 paragraph (CC): Ohio is adding this new paragraph to define the term ``contour mining.'' 3. OAC section 1501:13&hyph;4&hyph;05 paragraphs (A)(2)(a) (i) through (iv): Ohio is adding these new paragraphs to require that the mining operation plan in permit applications shall identify the mining method to be used and, depending on that proposed mining method, the maximum extent of cover to be mined, the beginning and ending point of the mining, the direction of mining, spoil placement plans, the locations of haul roads, the intended timing of the mining operation, and any other information that demonstrates an orderly and reasonable progression of mining and that specifies how the mining operation will meet the contemporaneous reclamation requirements of OAC section 1501:13&hyph;9&hyph;13. 4. OAC section 1501:13&hyph;4&hyph;05 paragraph (D)(2)(a): Ohio is revising this paragraph to require that reclamation plans in the permit application shall contain a detailed timetable for the completion of each major step of the reclamation plan specific to the described mining method and addressing the contemporaneous reclamation requirements of OAC section 1501:13&hyph;9&hyph;13. 5. OAC section 1501:13&hyph;9&hyph;13 paragraphs (A) (1) through (6): Ohio is revising these paragraphs to clarify the rule language, to specify minimum time and distance requirements for backfilling and grading for mining methods other than contour or area mining, and to require the contemporaneous commencement of augering after the creation of the highwall to be augered.
