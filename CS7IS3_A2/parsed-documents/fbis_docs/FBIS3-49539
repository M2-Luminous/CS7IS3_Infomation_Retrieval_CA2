The defense minister did not give the reason for the dismissal of the two officers. We have learned that the two officers were responsible for carrying out deals in military and other production of the ministry's economic unit, known as Defense Ministry-2. The source notes that if the dismissal was for corruption, the accused will be temporarily suspended and their case transferred to the prosecutor's office. One rumor has it that Popinski and Tsakov have been removed because of the so-called Albanian deal. In September the Defense Ministry sold 100 mortars (120-mm) and mines to Tirana. The arms were transported with Albanian trucks. The deal was cleared with the government team for the defense industry, General Simeon Petkovski from the Defense Ministry, said. The suspicion exists, however, that a part of the mortars arrived in Bosnia instead of Tirana. However, our military merchants were not responsible for the Albanian trucks' route and destination.
