The party said it would not recognize any such contracts signed before the election, and said the scheme would have to be sanctioned by the Transitional Executive Council before being implemented. The ANC added that it would oppose any attempt by the National Party to preempt the electoral right of the voters to pass their judgment on housing. The Transitional Executive Council has decided that the scheme should be suspended until differences on the issue have been resolved. Mr. Shill claimed that politically motivated organizations wanted the provision of housing delayed until a new government was in power.
