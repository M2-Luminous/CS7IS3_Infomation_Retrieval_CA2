After provocative attacks on the positions of the Brcko defense yesterday, last night, at 1945, the enemy launched a fierce artillery attack. Using mortars of all caliber, recoilless guns, howitzers, and the T-12 gun, the aggressor shelled our positions between Ljukici and Kladije [words indistinct] Omerbegovaca and Vranovaca with destructive projectiles. Unable to change anything at the impenetrable defense lines, at 2015, the chetniks turned their artillery in a criminal fashion toward civilian targets deep toward the free Brcko territory. The aggressor mercilessly attacked unarmed civilians and houses on free Brcko territory with 122-mm and 155-mm howitzers, 122-mm mortars, and hill guns for a whole hour. [passage omitted]
