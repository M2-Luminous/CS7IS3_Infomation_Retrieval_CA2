Speaking at a Foreign Policy Council meeting devoted to further integration in the Commonwealth of Independent States, Kozyrev noted that Russia is also interested in the all-round strengthening of the CIS member-countries, so that she would be surrounded by stable states. He said Russia was ready for as much integration as its partners desired. Kozyrev pointed out that there are a lot of far-reaching ideas being bandied about now, such as Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev's proposal to create a Euroasian Union, or ideas about forming a confederation. From Russia's point of view, any of these proposals would be acceptable. However, "it would be best to avoid a situation in which the proposal and discussion of such promising ideas does not hinder us in solving specific pressing problems, or distract our attention from them", Kozyrev said. He stated that it was most important to concentrate joint efforts on coordinating legislative activity and searching for ways to make the CIS interparliamentary assembly more effective. The Foreign Policy Council's meeting was attended by representatives from the parliament, various ministeries and departments, political and public organisations, and the clergy.
