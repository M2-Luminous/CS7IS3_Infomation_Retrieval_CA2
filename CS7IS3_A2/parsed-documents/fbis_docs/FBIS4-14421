Rybkin said that the drafting of a document on national concord is an example of practical interaction of branches of power. The speaker of the Lower House of the Federal Assembly believes it would be naive to think that the present Duma will be able to provide full legislative backing for transformations in Russia. Nevertheless, it is possible to lay down the groundwork for fruitful operation of the next composition of the Lower House, he said. Rybkin said some Russian MPs suggest that the term of the present State Duma be extended for another four years. The speaker of the Lower House said this can become possible only if the process of national reconciliation develops successfully. There is, above all, interaction between the president and the parliament. "Then the people would be able to express their will, which would be represented in a constitutional extention of the Duma's powers," Rybkin said. Dwelling on European interparliamentary ties, the speaker of the State Duma expressed perplexity with the fact that Russia has not yet been admitted into the Council of Europe as a full-fledged member. In his turn, the marshal of the Polish Sejm expressed satisfaction with successfully developing cooperation between Russian and Polish MPs and declared for its further widening. Jozef Oleksy heads a delegation of members of the Polish Sejm that arrived in Moscow at the invitation of the Duma. The delegation includes representatives of the main factions of the Polish Sejm.
