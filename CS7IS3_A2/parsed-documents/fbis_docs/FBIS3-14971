Kirill Shakhnovich reports. [Shakhnovich] Taking part in this session from 24-25 February were delegations of the military departments of eleven states of the Commonwealth. The session resulted in the adoption and signing of such important documents as: -- a decision on the confirmation of the statute on the council of defense ministers; -- a decision on the secretariat of the council of defense ministers of the participating states; -- a decision on the establishment of the coordination staff and the principles of its makeup; -- a decision on additional measures for the stabilization of the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border; and also, -- a decision on the period of the presence of collective peacekeeping forces in the Republic of Tajikistan; -- a decision on the interstate commission for military- technological cooperation of the CIS member-states; this decision is popular because even those countries who do not participate in this bloc can come to this commission and because the problem of replenishment of military spare parts is a highly acute one for all armies today. And the final point, which was signed by the eleven states of the Commonwealth, refers to the preparation of draft documents on the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the victory in the Great Fatherland War of 1941-1945. Here in particular is what was said at today's news conference by Viktor Samsonov, the head of the staff for coordination of the armed forces of the CIS Countries: [Begin Samsonov recording] As for seeking to set up a system of collective security, this of course involves the signing of a treaty on collective security, and we propose that at some point we shall set up joint armed forces of the Commonwealth countries which will form the basis of a system of collective security of the whole Commonwealth, and of each state individually. There is an analogy here with the NATO bloc, but without rejecting totally the experience of NATO, which has functioned for a long time now, I would say that there is much in the experience of the CIS states that is its own and special to it, experience which has not come directly from other states, but of course there will be mutual experience. However, the setting up of collective security naturally is being more and more understood among the states of the Commonwealth, and this is shown by the preceding session in Ashgabat, where another three states entered the signing of the treaty on collective security.
