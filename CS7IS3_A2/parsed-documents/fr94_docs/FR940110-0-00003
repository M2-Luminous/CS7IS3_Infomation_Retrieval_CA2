To manufacture whipped butter with a highly pleasing flavor, the raw milk and cream must be free of objectionable flavors. This final rule defines acceptable flavor characteristics to assist the graders in identifying and classifying the flavor. 3. Define Body, Color, and Salt Characteristics and Establish Disratings Just as production and processing practices influence the flavor of whipped butter, they also influence body, color, and salt characteristics. This final rule describes distinguishing body, color, and salt characteristics and establishes disratings which are used to determine the U.S. grade. 4. Illustrate How Flavor, Body, Color, and Salt Characteristics Influence Grade Determination These standards provide step-by-step instructions in determining the final grade of whipped butter. The U.S. grade of whipped butter is determined on the basis of classifying first the flavor characteristics. Then body, color, and salt characteristics are noted and disratings established. When total disratings exceed the permitted amount identified in the standards, the final U.S. grade is lowered. 5. Establish Optional Microbiological and Keeping-Quality Tests (Not Mandatory for Grade Designation) Since 1975, the General Specifications for Dairy Plants Approved for USDA Inspection and Grading Service have required microbiological and keeping-quality testing of whipped butter bearing USDA official identification. The market analysis conducted during the development of these standards revealed that the industry utilized tighter microbiological specifications for proteolytic and yeast and mold counts than those listed in the ``General Specifications''. To be more aligned with current industry standards, this final rule tightens these microbiological requirements. This final rule also incorporates these same tests as optional tests (not mandatory for grade designation) in the United States Standards for Grades of Whipped Butter. This final rule also makes corollary changes in the General Specifications for Dairy Plants Approved for USDA Inspection and Grading Service (subpart B of 7 CFR part 58) to conform the definition and grade designations of whipped butter set forth therein with the new United States Standards for Grades of Whipped Butter (in subpart G of 7 CFR part 58). USDA grade standards are voluntary standards that are developed pursuant to the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 (7 U.S.C. 1621 et seq .) to facilitate the marketing process. Manufacturers of dairy products are free to choose whether or not to use these grade standards. USDA grade standards for dairy products have been developed to identify the degree of quality in the various products. Quality in general refers to usefulness, desirability, and value of the product_its marketability as a commodity. When whipped butter is officially graded, the USDA regulations and standards governing the grading of manufactured or processed dairy products are used. These regulations also require a charge for the grading service provided by USDA. This action makes minor format changes for purposes of clarity to Tables I and III to the format that appeared in the proposed rule. Public Comments On June 30, 1993, the Department published a proposed rule (58 FR 34937) to promulgate the United States Standards for Whipped Butter. The public comment period closed August 30, 1993. No comments were received during this time. List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 58 Dairy products, Food grades and standards, Food labeling, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR part 58 is amended as follows: PART 58_[AMENDED] 1.
