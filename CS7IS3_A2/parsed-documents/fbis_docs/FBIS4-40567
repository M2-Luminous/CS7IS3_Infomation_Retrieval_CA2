Russian presidential special envoy and Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin is taking part in the meeting. The British Foreign Office told ITAR-TASS that all parties at the session are striving to agree to the last details of the "geographical division" map of the Former Republic of Yugoslavia. The whole package is to be approved at a minister-level meeting of Russia, the U.S., Great Britain, France and Germany, which is scheduled to take place within the next two to three weeks. Later the documents, which are in informed circles regarded as ultimatums of their own kind, will be handed over to the Serbs, Croats and Moslems, the hostile sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The range of the issues discussed by the "contact group" is extremely complicate, the British Foreign Office representative noted. For this reason, the possibility of the talks being extended until friday cannot be ruled out, he indicated. According to British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, the international committee has only a few days left at its disposal to put an end to the Bosnian conflict. Speaking in London on Wednesday, Hurd noted that there exists a real danger of a new war braking out in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which may spill over beyond its borders.
