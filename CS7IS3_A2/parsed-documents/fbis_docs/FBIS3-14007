Although Pakistan is trying to dye the Kashmir issue in Islamic colors, Mr. Khursheed was successful in getting the attention of the secretary general of the Conference by pointing out that after Indonesia, India has the largest Muslim population in the world, and that the votes of the Conference members in support of this resolution will affect the Indian Muslims. India is discussing three concerns with members of the Human Rights Commission. One is that this controversial resolution will increase terrorism in Kashmir and would curb the progress of human rights protection efforts. The second is that voting in support or remaining absent during the vote will affect bilateral relations. Third, support of this resolution will directly affect India-Pakistan relations. Mr. Khursheed met with representatives of several countries over the last three days and said that not participating in voting would be against the basic principles of human rights and would increase Pakistan's role in terrorism. He said that the proposed resolution is being viewed in the framework of human rights in different parts of the world. Mr. Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the opposition leader in the Lok Sabha who had also gone to take part in the conference, has insisted that member nations not be absent during the Pakistan resolution vote. He said that all nations friendly to India should vote against the resolution. He told newsmen that the question was not one of human rights violations in Kashmir, but of Pakistan's support for terrorism in Kashmir, and that every country should oppose this. *
