The ministers told the press that two-way trade was developing dynamically, despite a fall in production and export in both countries. Last year the trade turnover totalled $300 million, of which Hungarian export amounted to $159 million, and import to $141 million. Ukraine is the 14th biggest trade partner of Hungary. Kadar and Slyepichev said the organizational framework for bilateral links had been established. To date, about 300 Hungarian- Ukrainian joint ventures have been set up. In a move to promote their operation, the two countries are likely to sign an investment protection agreement soon. The two ministers voiced their wish to strengthen cooperation between Hungary, Ukraine, and Slovakia, and said the three states will seek help from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to finance projects in the region. The Ukrainian minister thanked Hungary for a $1 million loan for the reconstruction of the Beregszasz hospital. The loan is to be repaid through goods deliveries.
