However, big money apparently can also be earned by dealing with nonradioactive isotopes, prices for which on the black market often are no lower and sometimes even higher than those for radioactive ones. The deal that Rimmele and Eichler [not further identified] concluded in Riga was valued at $2 million. Nevertheless, even this seems to be nothing in comparison with the sums with which Voldemars Selga, a well-known businessman in Latvia, is operating in deals concerning rare metals. The document, which can be seen in the picture [published in English and Latvian next to the article and reported below], dated 3 February of this year, is called, literally translated, "Usage of bank guarantees of the Reconstruction and Development Bank [RDB] of Latvia for buying osmium." The text refers to an already received [two last words underlined] guarantee from RDB for $4,555,000,000 (! - J.D.) for the Finnish company "Wimco-Erica Finland Ltd" to purchase osm-187, and contains a requirement to confirm the right to use this guarantee to buy 32.9 kg of osm-187 in Russia. The RDB board president and owner of the control package is Voldemars Selga. There are also materials in which the Finnish side confirms that the purchasing of osm has already begun. Actually, it must have started before one of the signatories, visible in the picture, began to talk about seeking -- even with the assistance of INTERPOL -- V. Selga's partner, RDB Vice President Andrejs Zagars, on suspicion of fraud... The fax visible in the picture did not reach its intended recipient, and this explains why V. Selga's signature is not on the document. The sources of the above mentioned information are not sufficient to provide a precise description of the deal. Nevertheless, there can be no doubt about such guarantees by the bank. According to the initial capital and capital stock, amounting to several hundred thousand lats, RDB only ranks somewhere in top 40 or 50 commercial banks in Latvia, and it should not have the right to give a guarantee for a million dollars, let alone any figure in the billions. Suspicion also arouse over the fact that the mentioned quantity of osm -- 33 kg -- is too big. Experts in Germany, commenting on the plans of Rimmele and Eichler to buy only 6 kg of osm-187 in China, acknowledged that demand for this material is measured in milligrams... We do not have any more detailed information about the Finnish role. This cannot be said about possibilities to describe the personality of V. Selga. In 1984, during the era of the Soviet Union, he was sentenced to prison for fraud and falsification. Is Selga a crook? This was the question that arose in September 1992, when he was arrested on suspicion of cheating in a deal with the confectionery firm "Uzvara." V. Selga's background in the highest political circles could be observed when he was released from jail thanks to Latvian Supreme Council Deputies V. Kalnberzs and V. Steins, who posted bail for him. After all, he did not deliver the promised sugar for "Uzvara," but the money he had accepted in advance -- 50 million Latvian rubles -- he only returned a few months later. [passage omitted] These operations with the participation of Voldemars Selga, together with the Lake Constance story, provide food for thought -- what is the nature of the environment in which the trade in isotopes in Latvia is occurring? Shady. The house of Victor Balulis on Sarma Street, where Eichler was kept after his capture, is undoubtedly connected to criminal circles. After his return from prison -- in the second half of the 1980's, when the cooperative movement began -- V. Selga was connected with these circles. Viktors Abakumovs and Aleksandrs Kisels, well-known people in the criminal world, were employees of his in the "Merkurijs" joint stock company. The first was murdered in the fall of 1991, the second was arrested for the second time last autumn and confronted with charges of blackmail. Today, it would be out-of-fashion to call them bandits, as they are all businessmen, doing legal business. However, it can be done in various ways -- deals can be fair or shabby, and taxes can be paid or ignored... In the West, the deals with rare metals are being watched by special services and by police, looking for evidence of cheating or blackmail, as well as by financial experts, who look for possible instances of "money laundering." In Latvia, minimal attention is paid to these problems and there are practically no chances for controls of any type. How can grams of anything be detected, if there are tons of sugar and flour being smuggled over the Latvian border? Still, a few grams of isotopes are far more valuable than several tons of sugar... Who has ever heard of any Latvian special services stating that they are in possession of some information in this respect, for instance regarding the production and trade control of isotopes in Russia? The story of Rimmele and Eichler provided sufficient grounds to begin speaking about it, but it seems that while quarreling with each other, there is no time left for such things. Can we speak about narrowing down the possibilities to "launder" money? Probably not, especially since, to date, any attempts by tax inspectors to control cash transactions have remained in the realm of dreams. The dangerous thing is that trade in nonradioactive materials can not be discerned from trade in radioactive materials, which are hazardous for human health and life, because both come from the same delivery sources. In a secret report by the German Federal Intelligence Service on the black market of radioactive materials and the threat of radioactive terrorism from the East, Kaunas and Vilnius had been mentioned as centers of illegal trade. Anyhow, this may be little consolation for Latvia. Trading will continue in places where there are few hindrances to businessmen.
