This statute specifies a set of measures controlling exports (transfers, exchanges) of complete rocket systems (ballistic missiles, space-launch vehicles and research rockets), remotely piloted vehicles (cruise missiles, radio-controlled target drones and radio-controlled reconnaissance aircraft) capable of delivering a payload a distance of 300 km and more, and equipment, materials, and technology that could be used in their manufacture and also special equipment intended for the preparation and launch of the said missiles and remotely piloted vehicles (hereinafter called goods and services used for missile manufacture). 2. Exports (transfers, exchanges) from the Russian Federation of goods and services used in the manufacture of missiles shall be controlled in order to counteract the proliferation of missile equipment and technology that could facilitate the manufacture or acquisition of missile systems capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction and also the manufacture or acquisition of the production capacity for such systems and encompasses all types of foreign economic activity (other than imports), including production and S&T relations, coastal and border trade, commodity-exchange transactions, and the demonstration of exhibits at international exhibitions and fairs. 3. It is not the purpose of the statute to put obstacles in the way of national space programs or international cooperation in such programs, except in the instances where their realization could facilitate the manufacture of systems for the delivery of weapons of mass destruction. 4. The procedure for control of exports from the Russian Federation of goods and services used in the manufacture of missiles specifies: the preparation and issue of findings concerning the possibility of exports (transfers, exchanges) of goods and services applied in the manufacture of missiles enumerated in the List of Equipment, Materials, and Technology Used in the Manufacture of Missile Weapons Whose Exports Are Controlled and Realized by License (hereinafter called the List) approved by Directive No. 20-rp of the president of the Russian Federation on 11 January 1993 (in the 19 November 1993 version of Directive No. 744-rp of the president of the Russian Federation); the licensing and customs formalization of the exports (transfers, exchanges) of goods and services applied in missile manufacture. 5. The List shall consist of two categories (parts). Category I shall include the complete rocket systems capable of delivering a payload weighing no less than 500 kg a distance of 300 km and more and the equipment and technology that are most significant in the manufacture of missile weapons, exports of which are, as a rule, banned. Category II shall include complete rocket systems that are capable of delivering a payload a distance of 300 km and more, but which are not part of the systems specified in Category I, and the material, equipment, and technology used in the manufacture of missile weapons that are exported by license. 6. Exports (transfers, exchanges) of complete rocket systems and goods and services included in categories I and II of the List and also of all missiles or remotely piloted vehicles shall be prohibited if there is reason to believe that they are intended for use as a system for the delivery of weapons of mass destruction. In the consideration of the applications specified in Clause 8 of this statute for the issue of findings on the possibility of exports (transfers, exchanges) of complete rocket systems and remotely piloted vehicles pertaining to Category II, and also the equipment, materials, and technology used in the said systems, account shall be taken of the possibility of a swap of distance for payload weight, as a result of which they would pertain to Category I. In the specific instances where equipment pertaining to Category I could in accordance with note 2 of the List be specified for export (transfer, exchange) in the procedure established for materials, equipment, and technology pertaining to Category II, the exporter must comply with the conditions specified in Clause 7 of this statute. Exports of specially designed production capacity intended for the development and production of complete rocket systems and the equipment (products) contained in Category I of the List shall be prohibited, except in the instances allowed in accordance with the international missile technology control regime. 7.

Goods and services included on the List shall be exported (transferred, exchanged) only in accordance with one-time licenses issued by the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations of the Russian Federation. The basis for the issue of a license shall be the findings of Export Control of Russia concerning the possibility of exports (transfers, exchanges) of goods and services used for the manufacture of missiles. To obtain findings the following shall be sent to the Ministry of Economics of the Russian Federation Export Control Department (1 Okhotnyy ryad, Moscow 103009): an application for the issue of findings concerning the possibility of exports (transfers, exchanges); an application for a license drafted in accordance with the requirements established by the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations of the Russian Federation; a copy of the contract; the originals of the documents containing the undertakings (guarantees) of the importer (in the event of their being absent from the text of the contract), and the official body of the importing country specified by Clause 7 of this statute. To obtain findings concerning the possibility of the temporary shipment outside of the Russian Federation of equipment (products), materials, and technology contained on the List for demonstration at exhibitions and fairs an application containing information as to the name of the exhibition (fair) and the location and timeframe of exhibition of the shipped items and also undertakings (guarantees) concerning the return of the exhibits without a change in their quantitative and qualitative characteristics shall be sent to the Ministry of Economics of the Russian Federation Export Control Department. Findings on the possibility of exports (transfers, exchanges) shall be issued within no more than 20 days following receipt by the Ministry of Economics of the Russian Federation Export Control Department of the listed documents.
