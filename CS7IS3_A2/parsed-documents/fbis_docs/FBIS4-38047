FBIS4-38047 "drnes124_r_94002" FBIS-NES-94-124 Daily Report 18 Jun 1994 India Russia Offers `Favorable Terms' on Combat Aircraft Russia Offers `Favorable Terms' on Combat Aircraft BK2406095594 Delhi THE ECONOMIC TIMES in English 18 Jun 94 p 21 BK2406095594 Delhi THE ECONOMIC TIMES English BFN [Text] With the visit of Mr Fedorov, managing director of Irkutsk Aircraft production association, which manufactures the frontline Russian combat aircraft Soyuz-30, the most advanced Russian military aircraft are being offered at favourable terms. A deal on MiGs, including sale of 30 MiG-29 fighters and upgrading MiG-21s by fitting it with an air-to-air missile, has been finalised by the two sides. It only needs to be formalised after settling the details of delivery schedules and payments. Now Mr Fedorov has offered to sell and manufacture 20 Soyuz-30 fighter aircraft under licence by HAL [Hindustan Aeronautics Limtited]. This dovetailing will be facilitated by the ongoing collaboration between HAL and Irkutsk aircraft for production of MiG-27 aircraft in India. However, the production of MiG-27 has to be phased out within two years. This will render the production capacity at HAL idle. It has been suggested by Mr Fedorov that the vacuum at HAL can be filled by producing Soyuz-30 under licence. The Soyuz offer creates a new situation in which Indian air defence planners can exercise a choice by going in for the most effective fighter aircraft in line with Indian needs, while obtaining the transfer. In obtaining the Russian set-up, the MiG and Soyuz design bureaus function independently and each has the authority to enter into sales or collaboration agreement with their foreign counter-parts. Thus, while the MiG design bureau has been finalising arrangement for MiGs with India's defence ministry, the Soyuz has now entered the scene with an offer through Irkutsk Aircraft producers, handling the manufacture and sales of Soyuz fighter planes. Defence experts hold the Soyuz-30 to be an effective fighter aircraft capable of taking on the American F-18 fighters. While MiG-29 is lighter, and therefore more manoeuvrable, Soyuz-30 has a longer range. In terms of the Indian environment, the MiG-29's range covers Pakistani targets right up to NWEP, while Soyuz-30 could go much further. Experts also feel that MiG-29 and Soyuz-30 could form an effective combination. The Soyuz-30, however, is far more expensive in its maintenance costs against the MiG-29, it is stated. The pricing of the plane can be attractive, in view of the keenness of the Irkutsk to have a big deal with Indian for Soyuz 30. Attractive commercial credit is also learnt to have been offered, presumably to settle the deal during tne Prime Minister, Mr Narasimha Rao's visit to Moscow.
