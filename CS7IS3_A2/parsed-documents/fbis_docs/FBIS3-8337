Yesterday, work at over a dozen plants associated in the National Steel Works Section of Solidarity was suspended; rallies were held in other plants and money was collected for strike funds. At a conference organized in the morning at the Office of the Council of Ministers [URM], the government stated that it is not able to change the Budget Law--it has been passed by parliament: it has been holding talks with trade unions since January, so Solidarity cannot accuse it of having too little good will to negotiate; Solidarity can negotiate its demands in the trilateral committee; miners are only "an instrument of force" and will not receive any money for striking; the strike by railroads workers is illegal. The government did not say this directly; however, it is not going to forward a special invitation for "Solidarity" to attend talks. Yesterday Steel Works, Tomorrow Miners Today in Lodz, the National Committee [KK] of Solidarity will hold a session. Unofficial information suggests that there appear to be two options for further action: one can either expect an escalation of the protest, or--this is more likely--Solidarity may suspend the protests in two weeks or so because of the uncompromising attitude adopted by the government. The same sources maintain that the collection of money for the strike fund "is going quite well." The funds will be placed in an interest-bearing account. In a few months' time, Solidarity may take advantage of the social dissatisfaction and, with the necessary financial means, may organize a serious action, perhaps not in all sectors of the economy but "in several important sectors that are vital from a strategic point of view." KK Press Spokesman Piotr Zak evaluated the 8 March strikes as a success for the trade union: "According to our information, participating in the protest action were four plants in the Koszalin voivodship, as well as 80 plants in the steel works branch--69 in the two-hour warning strike; in 11 plants money was collected for the strike fund." Fourteen steel plants were on strike in Silesia; in the other 11, money was collected for the strike fund--the workers earmarked 2 percent of their earnings to the cause. On strike were, among other plants, the following steel works: Bankowa, Zawiercie, Baildon, Batory, Bobrek, Zabrze, as well as Czestochowa and Sendzimira in Krakow. In the Lucchini-Warsaw steel works, only two rallies were organized, in which participating were only those employees (approximately 350 persons) who could leave their work posts without causing a drop in production. The plant decided that it could not afford to go on active strike in a situation where there were already production delays. During one of the rallies, Mazowsze Region Head Maciej Jankowski said that "what we are starting today may last as long as several months--fight for the rights of employees has always been long and calls for considerable determination." Warning strikes will be staged today at plants in and around Lodz, as well as at 100 selected plants in the Silesian-Dabrowa region. On 10 March, strikes are supposed to be staged in Gdansk and at pit-coal mines. Deputy Industry Minister Eugeniusz Morawski told URM that mining and energy "are not the area of the strike; they are the instruments of forcing decisions." He believes that here "the issue is political." He stated that the strike in these branches leads to destabilization and added that the violations of the law will be scrupulously registered; he will insist on coal partnerships not paying "a single penny" toward the strike. "If any of the partnerships does make any such payments, I will institute legal proceedings to find out about the results of such an unjustified gift." Railroads Workers "Illegally"? "The 10-hour strike by railroad workers is supposed to affect the entire Polish State Railroads [PKP] network, in both freight and passenger traffic. The protest will be organized between 0900 [0800 GMT] and 1900," assured Railroads Solidarity Head Krzysztof Maminski. He did not rule out the possibility, however, that the strikes may be staged as soon as Thursday. He assured that rescue and special trains will be allowed to pass; he also did not exclude the possibility that some international trains that near their destination when the strike starts, will be allowed to reach their destinations. At a URM news conference, PKP Director General Aleksander Janiszewski said that Solidarity was informed that their wage demands are impossible to meet--PKP would have to pay from 500 million to 1 billion zlotys of the popiwek [tax on excessive wage increases]. Therefore, lower increases were put into effect, which were agreed upon with the other trade unions. Janiszewski deemed the Solidarity strike illegal because the PKP General Administration "finds out about it from the press, whereas, in line with the law, it should have been informed about it five days ahead of time." As a consequence, PKP will take steps to oppose it. The Government Is Ready and Waiting Labor Minister Leszek Miller said on 8 March that the fact that Solidarity is forcing the government to hold talks with trade unions is like "forcing an opened door" because it has been holding such talks almost since the very first day it was established. According to him, the negotiations on social guarantees and the trilateral committee have such broad powers that they are a sufficient platform for discussions and negotiations on any demands. Miller stressed that the government cannot implement the demand that the budget be changed because the budget has already been passed by parliament; however, the trilateral committee may discuss next year's budget. Andrzej Baczkowski, deputy labor minister and head of the trilateral committee, added that the committee may discuss any topic, and it can be convened at once if Solidarity decides that it is willing talk.
