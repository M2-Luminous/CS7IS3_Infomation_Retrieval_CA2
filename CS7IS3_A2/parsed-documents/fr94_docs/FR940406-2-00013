FR940406-2-00013 FR940406-2-00006 [A&hyph;588&hyph;832] Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value and Postponement of Final Determination: Antidumping Duty Investigation of Color Negative Photographic Paper and Chemical Components Thereof From Japan Agency: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 6, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Bill Crow, Office of Antidumping Investigations, Import Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;0116. Preliminary Determination We preliminarily determine that color negative photographic paper and chemical components thereof (CNPP) from Japan are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value, as provided in section 733 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). The estimated margins are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice. Case History Since the initiation of this investigation on September 20, 1993 (58 FR 50331, September 27, 1993), the following events have occurred. On October 15, 1993, the International Trade Commission (ITC) issued an affirmative preliminary injury determination. On November 15, 1993, the Department presented an antidumping duty questionnaire for CNPP to Fuji Photo Film, Company, Ltd., hereinafter referred to as ``Fuji'' or ``respondent'' (see February 28, 1994, memorandum to the file). Respondent submitted sales questionnaire responses in December 1993 and January 1994. The Department issued supplemental sales questionnaires in February 1994. Respondent submitted the responses to these supplemental questionnaires in February and March 1994. On December 14, 1993, respondent submitted a statement in support of the Department postponing the preliminary determination in this investigation. On December 23, 1993, petitioner requested that the Department postpone the preliminary determination until March 29, 1994, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.15(c) (1993). The Department granted this request on January 6, 1994 (59 FR 1927, January 13, 1994). On March 2, 1994, petitioner submitted an allegation that critical circumstances exist with respect to imports of CNPP from Japan. On March 4, 1994, the Department sent respondent a critical circumstances questionnaire. Respondent submitted responses to the Department's critical circumstances questionnaire on March 18, 1994. On March 8, 1994, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.20(b), respondent requested that, in the event of an affirmative preliminary determination, the Department postpone the final determination. Scope of Investigation For purposes of this investigation, color negative photographic paper is all sensitized, unexposed silver-halide color negative photographic paper, whether in master rolls, smaller rolls or sheets. Chemical components include sensitized (whether chemically or spectrally) and unsensitized emulsions, couplers, and coupler dispersions used in making color negative photographic paper. Unsensitized silver-halide emulsions consist of silver-halide microcrystals dispersed in a gelatin and water matrix after preparation and washing to remove soluble salts. Unsensitized emulsions are naturally sensitive to blue and ultraviolet light, but cannot efficiently convert light to form a color image without further processing. Sensitized emulsions have been treated to increase their sensitivity across the entire spectrum and/or treated by the addition of spectral sensitizing dyes to make the emulsions selectively sensitive to specific wavelengths of light. A coupler is a colorless, water-insoluble chemical capable of reacting with a silver-halide development product to form a dye. A coupler dispersion consists of a coupler dispersed in a water-gel solution, and may contain organic solvents, chemicals to stabilize the coupler and other substances. Specifically excluded from this investigation are all paper and chemical products not used in the silver halide process which are used in other imaging technologies. Products outside the scope include toner and developer chemicals used in electrostatic or indirect imaging processes (e.g., xerography), products used in laser printing, and instant photography products. Also excluded from the scope of the investigation is paper that is designed exclusively for use in graphic arts proofing equipment and does not exceed 160 microns in thickness, and emulsions classified under subheading 3707.10.0000 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) that are used in the manufacture of monochrome graphic arts film or paper that are not used in the production of color negative photographic paper. The color negative photographic paper subject to this investigation is currently classifiable under HTSUS subheadings 3703.10.3030 and 3703.20.3030. Emulsions are currently classifiable under HTSUS subheadings 3707.10.0000 and 3707.90.3000. Couplers and coupler dispersions are currently classifiable under HTSUS subheadings 3707.90.3000, 3707.90.6000, 2933.19.3000, 2933.90.2500 and 2934.90.2000. Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this investigation is dispositive. To avoid suspension of liquidation of non-subject chemicals, those items entered under the HTSUS subheadings listed above, which are not for use in the color negative photographic paper production process, must be accompanied by an importer's declaration to the Customs Service to that effect. In order to be excluded from the suspension of liquidation ordered in this notice, all sensitized (whether chemically or spectrally) and unsensitized emulsions, couplers, and coupler dispersions entered into the United States must be accompanied by an importer's declaration to the Customs Service to the effect that they are not for use in the color negative photographic paper production process and will not be used in the color negative photographic paper production process. On February 18, 1994, petitioner and respondent submitted comments on whether the chemical components are in the same class or kind of merchandise as color negative photographic paper. Petitioner argues that the subject merchandise constitutes one class or kind of merchandise, whereas respondent argues that the merchandise included in the scope of investigation constitutes two classes or kinds of merchandise. We determined that color negative photographic paper and the chemical components constitute one class or kind of merchandise (see March 24, 1994, decision memorandum from Richard W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford). We based our determination on the criteria set forth in Diversified Products v. United States, 572 F. Supp. 883 (1983) and Kyowa Gas Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. v. United States, 582 F. Supp. 887 (1984). Period of Investigation The period of investigation (POI) is March 1, 1993, through August 31, 1993. Such or Similar Comparisons In this investigation, we have only examined sales of color negative photographic paper; we have not examined sales of chemical components because respondent did not make such sales during the POI (see October 22, 1993, memorandum from James Maeder to David Binder). We have determined for purposes of the preliminary determination that the color negative photographic paper covered by this investigation comprise a single category of ``such or similar'' merchandise. Respondent reported products that are identical according to the Department's matching criteria, but have minor cost differences based on the emulsions contained in each product. For purposes of the preliminary determination, we are treating these products as identical and are making no adjustments for differences in merchandise between the products as claimed by respondent in accordance with 19 CFR 353.57. This is because respondent failed to provide a narrative description for its adjustments for differences in merchandise that explains the exact nature, source, and size of each difference. We have instructed the respondent to submit a thorough description of its adjustments for differences in merchandise so that these adjustments can be considered for use in the final determination (see February 23, 1994, decision memorandum from Richard W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford). Fair Value Comparisons To determine whether sales of CNPP from Japan to the United States were made at less than fair value, we compared the United States price (USP) to the foreign market value (FMV), as specified in the ``United States Price'' and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice. United States Price We based USP on exporter's sales price (ESP), in accordance with section 772(c) of the Act, because the subject merchandise was sold to the first unrelated purchaser after importation into the United States.
