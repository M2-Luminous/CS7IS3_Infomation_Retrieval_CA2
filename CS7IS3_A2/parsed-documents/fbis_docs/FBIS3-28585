FBIS3-28585 "dreas026__a94006" FBIS-EAS-94-026-A Document Type:Daily Report 8 February 1994 ANNEX Japan Businessmen on U.S. Lifting Sanctions on SRV OW0702120894 Tokyo SANKEI SHIMBUN in Japanese 5 Feb 94 Morning Edition p 8 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0702120894 Tokyo SANKEI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] Japanese business circles have highly praised the 4 February U.S. decision to completely lift economic sanctions it previously imposed on the SRV, saying that "we should extend open arms to welcome it" (as stated by Akira Nishio, president of Nissho Iwai Corporation and chairman of the Japan-Vietnam Economic Committee under the Federation of Economic Organizations of Japan [Keidanren]). There are strong hopes that full-scale business operations in the SRV by U.S. firms "would help expand economic aid programs to the SRV, such as by the IMF, and help vitalize its market" (as stated by a Japan External Trade Organization official). This would also help diminish investment risks. Japanese businessmen thus welcome this latest U.S. move. Presuming that sanctions would be lifted, about 30 major U.S. businesses, including IBM Corporation and Coca Cola Enterprises Incorporated, have already made preparations to advance into the SRV market. For example, they have set up local branch offices staffed by their employees. Among Japanese firms, Nissho Iwai Corporation has worked things out "to the point where operations can begin immediately" regarding tie-ups with U.S. firms. For example, it embarked on a joint project last December to probe off-shore SRV oil fields with Mobil Corporation, a U.S. oil major, and other firms. Last year, Japanese trade with the SRV increased about 23 percent over the previous year to $1.6 billion. There is high Japanese business interest in the SRV since, among other reasons, yen appreciation has forced firms to search for cheap labor. After the end of the Vietnam war, Japanese firms resumed trade with the SRV in the early stages. They are said to be ahead of U.S. firms by seven years. For this reason, U.S. firms are deeply concerned about their "having made a late start." Thus, it is expected there will now be fierce competition between Japanese and U.S. firms.
