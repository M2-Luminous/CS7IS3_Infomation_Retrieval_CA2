In his inaugural speech at the 15th DGB Federal Congress in Berlin, Schulte said the trade unions will press full steam ahead for social justice and social unity. Before the 600 delegates, he called at the same time for using reform to strengthen the DGB and its trade unions. Schulte emphatically advocated long-term state-promoted employment in eastern and western Germany. It must be paid according to the wage scale, keeping to the principle of same wage for same work. He called mass unemployment the malignant tumor of industrial society. The nascent economic upswing cannot obscure the fact that there is a gulf between growth and employment, he said. According to Schulte, the DGB and its individual unions also want to struggle for Germany as an example of democracy and tolerance. Extreme-right provocateurs and arsonists must not have a chance, he said. In the afternoon, Christian Social Union Chairman Theo Waigel and Ludger Volmer, spokesman of the Alliance 90/Greens want to address the delegates.
