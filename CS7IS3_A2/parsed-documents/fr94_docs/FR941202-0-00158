FR941202-0-00158 FR941202-0-00014 Section 199.225(b)(4)(iii) specifies that, except as provided in ยง199.225(b)(4)(ii) (i.e., removal from covered functions for eight hours or until a test result of below 0.02), ``no operator shall take any action under [the RSPA alcohol misuse rule] against an employee based solely on the employee's behavior and appearance, in the absence of an alcohol test. This does not prohibit an operator with the authority independent of this [rule] from taking any action otherwise consistent with law.'' Under the RSPA rule, an operator is required to test an employee when the operator has reason to believe the employee is under the influence of or impaired by alcohol, or has violated any other prohibition in the RSPA rule. The operator may not simply remove the employee without conducting a test, unless conducting a test is physically impossible because the employee is in a remote location or the only available EBT is broken. In such a situation, where a test cannot be conducted, the operator must ensure that the employee does not perform any covered functions for eight hours or until a test result of below 0.02 is obtained, whichever comes first. The operator may take no other action against the employee under authority of the RSPA rule. If the operator wishes to take additional action under its own authority, it may do so, but it must conduct reasonable suspicion testing in accordance with the RSPA rule. As explained in the preamble to the RSPA final rule (59 FR 7427), RSPA will monitor the data that we receive from post-accident and reasonable suspicion tests to determine if further action is warranted. Alcohol misuse is a problem in society generally, and it is reasonable to expect that the pipeline industry is not immune from that problem. Testing is vital to determine the extent of any problem, and the resulting data is necessary to evaluate the alcohol misuse program and develop more effective strategies for eliminating alcohol misuse. Accordingly, no change to the rule is necessary. Regulatory Analyses and Notices Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures Although the February 15, 1994 alcohol misuse final rule was significant, this document is not significant because it merely clarifies the February 15 rule and makes no substantive changes to the rule text. Therefore, this document was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, and is not considered significant under the Regulatory Policies and Procedures of the Department of Transportation (44 FR 11034). A regulatory evaluation prepared for the February 15, 1994 final rule is available for review in the docket. Paperwork Reduction Act This document does not contain any new information collection requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act. Regulatory Flexibility Act This document merely clarifies the final rule published on February 15, 1994. Therefore, I certify under Section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.) that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Executive Order 12612 This action will not have substantial direct effects on states, on the relationship between the Federal Government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of Government. Therefore, RSPA has determined that this action does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
