They have turned to insurance. By the end of 1993 retirement insurance schemes had spread throughout the province, with over 1.85 million people paying premiums totalling 900 million yuan. So far, nearly 75,000 rural residents are drawing old-age pensions worth 30 yuan to 250 yuan a month. The insurance categories have been greatly expanded since the provincial insurance company started to offer services for the elderly in 1985. Now people can take out insurance policies for injury, crop failure and illness. Zhejiang farmers' income is on the top list in the country's rural areas. Their annual income averaged 1,746 yuan at the end of last year.
