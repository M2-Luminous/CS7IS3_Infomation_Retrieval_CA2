The China Securities Regulatory Commission, the Ministry of Finance and the People's Bank of China jointly issued a circular recently calling on parties to "resolutely stop" the short selling of treasury bonds. Local finance bureaus, branches of the central bank, and securities exchanges and centres must take effective measures against short-selling as of July 1. The action was taken because some securities intermediaries are selling more treasury bonds than they actually own by issuing custody certificates to buyers. This practice in effect expands the total amount of treasury bonds, endangering the country's macroeconomic management and investors' interests. According to the circular, which will go into effect on July 1, the treasury bonds traded over the counter should be the paper bonds issued by the State and not the custody certificates. Institutions trading bonds through securities exchanges or centres should put all their bonds, paper and paperless, under the central custody centres of the exchanges and trading centres . Only after that will they be able to trade their bonds on exchanges or State-approved electronic securities trading systems. If securities trading institutions issue custody certificates, they should have an equal amount of note bonds. If institutions have fewer paper bonds than the amount registered in the certificates already issued, they should make up the gap by June 20. Holders can exchange their certificates for paper bonds any time. No certificate issuer can refuse a request . The circular requires the Shanghai and Shenzhen securities exchanges and all local securities trading centres to draft their own self-regulating rules. These regulations will be reported to the Ministry of Finance. Bond-trading institutions violating the circular's stipulations will be suspended from doing business for three months to a year. Bond-trading institutions are responsible for arranging to be examined by the Ministry of Finance, the People's Bank of China and the China Securities Regulatory Commission. Trading institutions should set up different accounts for custody bonds and self-dealing bonds.
