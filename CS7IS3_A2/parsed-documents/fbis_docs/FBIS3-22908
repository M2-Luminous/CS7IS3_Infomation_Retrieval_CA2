[see pp. 5-6 of 12 January 1994 Terrorism Report for report of Iranians' expulsion] France's highest administrative court will have to determine whether France violated the European Convention on Extradition. In the eyes of the Swiss government, the credibility of the fight against terrorism is at stake, Federal Council Member Arnold Koller said. The Council of State confirmed Wednesday that this appeal is admissible. [background passage omitted] Respect Its Commitments The Federal Council feels that France has violated the European Convention on Extradition of 1957. This instrument is based on reciprocity and the obligation to provide a reason for any refusal of a request for extradition. Its legal force depends on the relations of confidence between the contracting countries regarding respect of human rights. The Swiss aim is to obtain a court ruling of one state's failure to comply with international commitments. A single breach in the system endangers the credibility of the fight against terrorism, Arnold Koller stressed. It is for this reason of principle that the Federal Council decided to bring the matter before a legal authority. Big Surprise Arnold Koller reiterated that Switzerland was all the more surprised by its neighbor's attitude since the French authorities announced four times that the extradition would take place. The surprise was also reinforced by the fact that in 1991 and 1992 Switzerland extradited to France two Iranians wanted for participating in the assassination of the former Iranian Prime Minister Shapur Bakhtiar. The French Council of State has a twofold mission: that of the supreme administrative court guaranteeing fundamental rights and liberties, and that of adviser to the government in drafting laws. Since 1977, it has also been referred to in contested extradition cases. [passage omitted on French comments] The Inquiry Continues Switzerland's action vis-a-vis the Council of State "overjoyed" Roland Chatelain, the examining magistrate for the canton of Vaud. He has not closed the file and is continuing his investigation into the responsibility of the Iranians -- 13 in all -- who are suspected in the assassination of Kazem Radjavi. Ernst Muehlemann, chairman of the Foreign Policy Committee of the Swiss National Council, also welcomed the Federal Council's decision.
