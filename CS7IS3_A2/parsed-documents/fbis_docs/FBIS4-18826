Cetin said he called Bosnian Premier Haris Silajdzic on the phone to talk about the developments happening in Bosnia and added that Silajdzic said during their searches in hospitals, they haven't met any evidence that chemical weapon was used in Gorazde. Cetin said there is no specific information that chemical weapons were used and the number of casualties in Gorazde were not known either. The foreign minister said NATO was ready for intervention however they haven't yet received any order from the UN representative in Bosnia. Cetin recalled that the situation in Gorazde was discussed during a Turkish-Bosnian-Croatian tripartite meeting which was held earlier this week "we called for the UN to take necessary measures against the situation" he added. "We have completed our preparations to call NATO and the UN Security Council for a meeting if the claims come true" Cetin said.
