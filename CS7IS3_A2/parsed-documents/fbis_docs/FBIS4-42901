On the evening before the European Milli Gorus congress in Antwerp, DE MORGEN spoke with Necmettin Efe, a member of the board of the Federation of Islamic Associations, Milli Gorus' Belgian section. Although virtually unknown to most Belgians, Milli Gorus (Turks for Islamic Perspective) is a very powerful organization in the Muslim world and in Flanders. In addition, the organization is expanding at a terrific pace. In 1976, the Belgian Milli Gorus was formed by 16 people. Today, the organization has 5 to 10 thousands members and supporters. "I estimate that within a few years, half of the 85,000 Turks in Belgium will be either members or supporters of Milli Gorus," Necmettin Efe says. "We have a lot of influence." Islam Rules In Flemish circles, Milli Gorus is often described as a fundamentalistic movement. Efe is not happy with that. Not because the organization is not strictly religious, but because the term evokes associations with, as Efe puts it, "the troublemakers from the Mideast." "We are no advocates of an Islamic state at all," Efe says. "On the contrary, we do not want the state to interfere in religion. That is why we are not in favor of so-called secular states such as Turkey and Belgium, either. Officially, the Church and the state are separated there, but in reality the state controls religion. This is also true for Belgium. The Catholics have a lot of influence in the state structure. Every year, an average of 1,200 Belgian francs [BFr] of tax money per citizen is appropriated for the official religions, against only BFr10 for every Muslim." Efe immediately seizes the opportunity to eliminate several misconceptions. Such as the contacts with the Gray Wolves. "I am a member of the board, and I am unaware of any such contacts. It is sheer nonsense." An alleged move of the European headquarters from Cologne to Antwerp? "I had to laugh about it." Money from Saudi Arabia? "I wish it were true." And how about the statements of the Turkish Milli Gorus leader Necmettin Erbakan? Last year in Genk, he said that Islam should determine the state's rule. Efe says: "Of course, I can hardly speak for Mr. Erbakan. I agree with some of his statements, I disagree with others. Erbakan is not familiar with the Belgian situation, and a statement like this is obviously not applicable to this country." [passage omitted] Another tricky matter when it comes to Milli Gorus is politics. In Turkey, the Refah party, the Turkish Milli Gorus' political wing, aims at an Islamic organization of society. "However, in Belgium we do not interfere in politics," Efe says. "Our only political view is that we are in favor of voting rights for migrants. An Islam party is out of the question. This way, we would only play into the hands of the Flemish Bloc. But I must admit that Milli Gorus did ask its members to be as actively involved in existing political parties as possible."
