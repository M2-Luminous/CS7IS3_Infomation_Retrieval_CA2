IPIC has bought 19.56 percent of the basic capital of the petroleum company (2.7 billion schillings). Beyond specific cooperation, Austria is viewed as an "ideal partner state in Europe" by the United Arab Emirates, the transportation minister told APA after his brief visit to Abu Dhabi. Sales cooperation thus applies to Central Europe as a whole. However, OeMV will continue to operate independently. Also, there is "neither an obligation nor the intention" on the part of the Arab partner to introduce its own gasoline brand into Central Europe. Klima also ruled out splitting the department responsible for natural gas deals from the concern.
