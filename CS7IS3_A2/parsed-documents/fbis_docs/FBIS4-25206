The visit to Hong Kong by another CPC big shot, however, was exceptionally played down and most Hong Kong people did not even know of his arrival. The big shot is Tian Jiyun, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and vice chairman of the National People's Congress [NPC]. He made a two-day stopover in Hong Kong on his way home from a visit to foreign countries in mid-May. But his stay in Hong Kong was kept strictly confidential. It was reported that Tian came to Hong Kong to take a rest. But anyone with a discerning eye knew that under the political situation in which "the Chinese side and the British Hong Kong Government are irreconcilably hostile to each other," "to take a rest" was a lame excuse. In reality, Tian, who was travel-worn and weary, did not take a good rest in Hong Kong. Instead, he met with Hong Kong NPC and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference deputies, Preliminary Working Committee for the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [PWC] members, and certain local businessmen--naturally those well-known tycoons he could trust. Clearly Tian was entrusted with the task of "putting a certain message across to local people." It appeared that the CPC leaders, who were dissatisfied with the results of Lu Ping's visit to Hong Kong, "which failed to achieve what it had been designed to achieve," were eager to send Tian to Hong Kong to offer some clarification on certain matters. The Proposal To Reclaim Hong Kong Ahead of Schedule Had Been Supported by the Majority of Party, Government, and Military Leaders At the meeting, Tian answered every question. He aired his "personal views" on many questions put to him in a great effort to reassure local people. Tian answered some sensitive questions concerning the latter half of the transitional period. Question: Will China reclaim Hong Kong ahead of time? Tian: When Britain changed its policy toward China in the fall of last year [as published] and had its own way in Hong Kong, many people on the mainland favored recovering sovereignty over Hong Kong before the due date. There was a strong demand for this in the party, in the NPC Standing Committee, and in the military. Some Hong Kong industrialists also went to Beijing to ask the central authorities to take decisive measures because they feared Hong Kong would get out of control and be plunged into confusion. Our comrades in the party and the government were also divided on whether the principle of "one country, two systems" could be put into effect. The central authorities finally decided that though the Chinese side had failed to obtain cooperation from the British side on Hong Kong's constitutional reform, it would try its best to achieve cooperation with the latter in other fields with a view to reducing the possible shocks and chaos in the transitional period to a certain extent while stepping up all necessary preparations against sudden incidents. Tian Predicts That Hong Kong Will Possibly Experience a Shock Question: Will there be turbulence in the latter half of the transitional period? Tian: In my view, in the transitional period, some people will create confusion and disturbance by taking advantage of the setting up of the PWC, the formation of the Special Administrative Government [SAR] Government, the transfer of political power to China by the Hong Kong colonialist government, the appointment of secretarial-level officials by the SAR Government, the abolition of laws and regulations contradicting the Basic Law, and the banning of some extremist organizations in accordance with the Basic Law. The central department concerned has studied all these possibilities. The central authorities have since 1990 made preparations against a big economic shock or even economic collapse. The mainland has injected more capital into Hong Kong than any other foreign country and has made substantial commitments to certain friendly countries and conglomerates. So if there is no great disturbance on the mainland, there will be no sustained economic shock or collapse in Hong Kong. However, social unrest and an economic shock may be unavoidable. We cannot pin any hope on the British authorities. "Hong Kong Will Be Worthless Without Stability" Question: Will China really carry out the principle of "one country, two systems" after 1997? Tian: The central government has pursued a consistent policy toward Hong Kong. No mainland system will be applied in Hong Kong and no attempts to turn Hong Kong into a city where all political forces wrestle with each other are allowed. Otherwise who will invest in Hong Kong? At the same time, we will prevent Hong Kong from evolving into a welfare society. Hong Kong is a small place short of natural resources, so an economic recession or a severe economic slump could easily occur. Hong Kong's value lies in its stable social environment, and it will be utterly worthless without stability. "Local People Will Be Allowed To Hurl Abuse at the CPC After 1997" Question: Will press freedom be guaranteed after 1997? Tian: After the founding of the SAR Government 1 July 1997, people will still be allowed to hurl abuse at the CPC and the press to publish articles criticizing mainland policies and systems. A sound political party enjoying popular support is immune to invective. Over the last few years, some people have cursed the CPC every day, criticizing everything. They even cooperated with Britons in cursing us. Mainland people reacted strongly to this abuse, but we persuaded them not to fight back. Naturally, no organized subversive, inflammatory, or hostile activities are allowed. Question: Will Shanghai take over Hong Kong's role by the end of this century or by 2005? Tian: Shanghai has grown rather rapidly due to favorable conditions. Shanghai is trying to rank among other big international cities in terms of defense and high-tech industries, finance, transportation, and trade. However, Hong Kong has its own characteristics and strong points, so it will not be replaced. The CPC Has Taken Action on Many Occasions To Shatter Hong Kong People's Vulnerable Confidence According to the businessmen who met with Tian, in contrast to those fierce officials responsible for Hong Kong affairs, Tian was undoubtedly much more amiable. Though what he said was cliches, he was sincere and did not dodge sensitive questions. The businessmen present appreciated his frankness and sincerity. As compared with Lu Ping, who made Hong Kong people feel ill at ease on his last visit, Tian certainly acted in a timely way to reassure local people. Tian said: The CPC is trying to cooperate with Britain in fields other than the political one. Does this imply that the CPC will carry out a tough political policy while adopting a "flexible economic policy"? This remark by Tian merits attention. However, there is a serious problem: The CPC has made sincere and solemn promises over the last 10 years, but it has taken action to kill Hong Kong people's weak and vulnerable confidence on various occasions. The principle of "one country, two system" and the promise "to keep Hong Kong's capitalist system unchanged for 50 years" have become terms which people ridicule. China, big country as it is, has actually failed to capture Hong Kong people's confidence. Such a distorted situation brought about by the rule of man is unfortunate for the CPC as well as for Hong Kong people.
