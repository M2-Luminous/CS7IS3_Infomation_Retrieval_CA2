FR941122-1-00077 FR941122-1-00018 Tuesday November 22, 1994 Part III Environmental Protection Agency 40 CFR Part 72 Acid Rain Program: Permits; Proposed Rule Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 224␣/␣Tuesday, November 22, 1994␣/␣Proposed Rules ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 72 [FRL&hyph;5109&hyph;7] RIN 2060-AF55 Acid Rain Program: Permits AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: Title IV of the Clean Air Act, as amended by Public Law 101&hyph;549, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the Act), authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) to establish the Acid Rain Program. On January 11, 1993, the Agency promulgated final rules under title IV. Several parties filed petitions for review of the rules. On August 10, 1994, EPA and other parties signed a settlement agreement addressing certain substitution plan issues. Based on a review of the record, the Agency concludes that the January 11, 1993 regulations concerning the eligibility of units to be designated as substitution units should be revised. Under sections 404(b) and (c) of the Act, a unit that is not listed in Table A of section 404 as being subject to Phase I of the Acid Rain Program (i.e., a non-Table A unit) and that is under the control of the owner or operator of a unit listed in Table A of section 404 (i.e., a Table A unit) may be designated as a substitution unit. The January 11, 1993 regulations state that the Table A unit and each non-Table A unit that the Table A unit designates as a substitution unit must have ``the same owner or operator.'' The Agency is proposing to revise the regulations in order to specify more clearly the circumstances under which the statutory ``control'' requirement for substitution plans is met. Because the rule revision is consistent with the August 10, 1994 settlement and the Agency does not anticipate receiving adverse comments, the revision is also being issued as a direct final rule in the final rules section of this Federal Register . DATES: Comments on the regulations proposed by this action must be received on or before December 22, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments. All written comments must be identified with the appropriate docket number and must be submitted in duplicate to: EPA Air Docket Section (LE&hyph;131), Waterside Mall, room 1500, lst floor, 401 M Street, SW., Washington DC 20460.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: If no significant, adverse comments are timely received, no further activity is contemplated in relation to this proposed rule and the direct final rule in the final rules section of this Federal Register will automatically go into effect on the date specified in that rule. If significant, adverse comments are timely received on any provision, that provision of the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comment received on that provision will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on the relevant portions of this proposed rule. Because the Agency will not institute a second comment period on this proposed rule, any parties interested in commenting should do so during this comment period. For further supplemental information, the detailed rationale, and the rule provisions, see the information provided in the direct final rule in the final rules section of this Federal Register .
