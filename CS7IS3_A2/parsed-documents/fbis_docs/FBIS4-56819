FBIS4-56819 "drlat090_i_94004" FBIS-LAT-94-090 Daily Report 4 May 1994 Nicaragua Sandinist Professionals, Technicians View `Crisis' Sandinist Professionals, Technicians View `Crisis' PA0805023394 Managua BARRICADA in Spanish 4 May 94 pp 1, 5 PA0805023394 Managua BARRICADA Spanish BFN [Report by Noel Irias] [Text] In a summons that exceeded all expectations, an assembly of more than 600 Sandinist professionals and technicians was held yesterday to discuss the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front] congress, the crisis within this organization, and its possible solutions. Most of these professionals did not participate in the rank and file discussions of reforms to the party statutes. Generally speaking, the participants who spoke called themselves members of "no particular current" or "dispersed Sandinists." Speaking on behalf of the Majority current, Carlos Fernando Chamorro said it was necessary to create spaces to allow a regrouping and political expression of dispersed Sandinists. Chamorro said professionals and technicians should "be viewed in the Sandinist ranks as individuals that have the right to speak and to decide, not as instruments of a group of enlightened." Upon explaining the position of the current of which he is a member, Chamorro insisted "the renovation of the FSLN must continue; it must go beyond Congress." Among those present, attorney Gonzalo Carrion and sociologist Luis Mora expressed their opposition to the currents. In particular, Luis Mora harshly criticized the Majority's position. Prominent businessman Jose Dolores Gomez said he is strongly "opposed to a continuation of the same leadership in the FSLN." Angela Rosa Acevedo and Mayra Pasos insisted women should have more opportunities for power within the party. Silvio Prado proposed to declare a permanent session and establish communication networks as part of the current political debate in the FSLN. Delegates From the Leftist Current Did Not Attend The results of a poll among the 216 participants has revealed that most of the participants believe it is necessary to change the name of the National Directorate, to legalize currents of opinion, and to establish a single category of FSLN members. Most participants also expressed their support for the civic methods of protest, territorial election of Sandinist candidates to public office, and power quotas for youths and women. According to Dr. Alejandro Martinez Cuenca, who organized this event, the original idea was to hear statements from two representatives of each current and then hear the proposals of participants, but the delegates from the Democratic Left did not show up. Martinez explained Julio Lopez Campos and William Grigsby, spokespersons for the Democratic Left current, and Conapro [National Confederation of Professional Associations] President Felix Contreras were convoked to participate in the debate. Both Martinez Cuenca and moderator Mario Flores expressed regretted over the nonparticipation of the delegates of that current. Henry Ruiz: The Most Popular Candidate The organizers of the event circulated a survey on the main reforms to the FSLN's statutes and on the candidates to the highest positions of leadership within the organization. The participants filled out 477 answer sheets, and by the time we went to press 216 sheets, namely, 45 percent, had been processed. These partial results were presented by Martinez Cuenca. According to 47 percent of those whose replies were processed, the possible candidates to the FSLN leadership would be, according to the number of votes, Henry Ruiz, Sergio Ramirez, Dora Maria Tellez, Daniel Ortega, Doris Tijerino, Luis Carrion, Mariano Fiallos, Monica Baltodano, Tomas Borge, Daniel Nunez, Carlos Fernando Chamorro, and Fernando Cardenal. In addition, Alejandro Martinez, Victor Tinoco, Carlos Tunnermann, Mirna Cunningham, Alejandro Serrano, Leticia Herrera, and Vilma Nunez appeared on the survey. Approximately 40.3 percent of those polled said the highest FSLN post should be occupied by Henry Ruiz, 18.1 chose Sergio Ramirez, and 17.1 percent preferred Daniel Ortega. Regarding the second highest party position, those polled preferred Henry Ruiz, with 14.4 percent, Dora Maria Tellez, with 13 percent, and Daniel Ortega, with 12.5 percent. The assembly was presided over by Alejandro Martinez Cuenca, Ernesto Medina, rector of the Unan [National Autonomous University of Nicaragua]-Leon Branch, Dr. Edgar Morin, attorney Linda Baez, architect Mario Flores, Ramiro Bermudez, and Dr. Benedicto Meneses. Medina closed the assembly by reflecting upon the issue of tolerance within Sandinism. JS [Sandinist Youth Association] To Hold An Assembly In addition, Larry Astorga, JS spokesman, reported yesterday that group will hold a forum on 13 May to discuss and approve a proposal of policies for the sector the FSLN must include. They will also discuss a proposal of political positions of the JS on the FSLN, Astorga added. Meanwhile, the Sandinists grouped in the university organizations will hold a similar working session on 17 May.
