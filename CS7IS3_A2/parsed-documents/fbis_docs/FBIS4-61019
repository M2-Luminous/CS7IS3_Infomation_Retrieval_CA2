The withdrawal package was signed by Presidents Guntis Ulmanis of Latvia and Boris Yeltsin of Russia in Moscow on Saturday. Clinton in his foreign policy radio address the same day called the Latvian-Russian agreement historic, adding that "these and other promising developments were made possible, in part, by American support and resolve." The United States had an important role in helping to overcome a deadlock during the talks on the issue of the Russian early-warning radar station at Skrunda, Latvia. The U.S. President at his visit to Moscow in January received Russia's proposal, according to which the facility remains under Russian control for the next four years, plus for a 1.5-year term necessary for its dismantling. This proposal, later accepted by Latvia, was turned over in Washington to Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis during his late January-early February visit.
