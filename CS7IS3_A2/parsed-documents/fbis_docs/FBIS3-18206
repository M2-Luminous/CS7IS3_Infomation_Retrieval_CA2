[Rifkind] Well, we hope it will be a one-off, because for the last few months the Bosnian-Serbs have not violated the no-fly zone; they have done so for the first time with fixed wing aircraft, and they have paid the penalty. I hope they now realize this must not be repeated. [Snow] There has been a catalogue of movements that have not been entirely satisfactory, but there was something very different about this particular incident? [Rifkind] Yes very different, the previous violations have been helicopters and it has always been very difficult to tell whether helicopters are being used for a civilian or a military purpose. What happened today was unique -- [this was] the first time fixed wing aircraft [were] being used, actually attacking positions on the ground, [with] no room for doubt, no room for confusion -- a quite clear violation of the Security Council resolution. [Snow] Do you have any intelligence on what may have been going on? [Rifkind] We don't have detailed information at this stage. It would appear that there was an attack on a ammunition factory, and the reports I have heard suggest that that ammunition factory might in any event have been within range of Serb artillery, so it's not clear what they might have been up to. [Snow] Clearly the danger must be that with the heat that's being put on the Sarajevo end of things, the Serbs are now trying it on elsewhere, and literally trying to test NATO wills and UN wills? [Rifkind] Well if that is their motive, then they have tested and they have found that that resolve was pretty strong, because what NATO said would happen has happened. [Snow] Clearly there is a worry though that this will lead to reprisals against our people on the ground, and indeed the necessity for more action in the air? [Rifkind] I think it would be have been more worrying if having tested NATO's resolve -- if NATO had been found wanting -- that would have simply encouraged not only the Bosnian Serbs, but also the other factions in this war to flout the various agreements that have been reached. I think that what has been most impressive particularly in recent weeks is how the UN and NATO have been able to demonstrate that the resolve is indeed substantial, and that if the Security Council resolutions are ignored, then indeed action follows. [Snow] The chain of command seems to have worked very efficiently, I mean, did NATO in fact have to refer to the top of the line before doing this? [Rifkind] Well, I am not familiar with the precise details, this was a matter for the UN commander, but there is a recognized procedure that if there is a violation, then the UN commander on the ground is able to ask for action to be taken, the NATO commander was able to respond and that is what has happened. [Snow] Now as attention switches away from Sarajevo, I mean the Tuzla area in particular has been under very heavy pressure today, and that involves much more likelihood of British activity? [Rifkind] You say more likelihood of British activity -- the British area is not in the Tuzla pocket, that is mostly a Nordic battalion of Swedes, Danes, and Norwegians who have the primary responsibility in Tuzla. [Snow] But on the other hand, we may yet be drawn in from Vitez or anywhere else in support, I mean what do we do? [Rifkind] Well you say in support, if there is any attempt to attack any UN forces, whether they be British or other forces then the UN has very powerful military assets at its disposal, including of course, as we have seen aircraft, we would not hesitate either at the UN level and certainly not at the British level in expecting all these military assets including air power to be used if it was necessary in the opinion of the local commanders to protect the physical safety of their men. [Snow] But given that the prime minister said in the Commons last week -- that he hoped to see Tuzla airport open within two to three weeks -- this not looking too good, is it? [Rifkind] Well, I think we must wait and see, clearly the position today is somewhat confused. I think it should be clearer over the 24 hours what is actually happening in the Tuzla area. I think what will have been important is that it will have been seen very clearly -- not just by the Serbs, but also by the Croats, and by the Bosnian-Muslim authorities that if the Security Council resolutions are flouted in such a substantial way, then that is not something which is treated with equanimity, and I think it is quite important that that point will now be clearly understood.
