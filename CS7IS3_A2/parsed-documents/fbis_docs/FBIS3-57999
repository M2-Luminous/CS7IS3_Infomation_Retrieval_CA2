With a view to Germany taking on the presidency itself in six months, he announced today that there would be "constructive collaboration." "This year, 1994, the EU is facing a new stage of European integration and enormous tasks, in view of profound upheavals in world politics and global economic challenges," Kinkel said. Particular attention must be paid to securing Europe as an investment location. It is also important to deepen relations between the EU and the states of Central and East Europe, and to support the reform process in Russia. Relations with the Asiatic region and the southern African states also have to be strengthened. Negotiations with the EFTA [European Free Trade Association] states (Norway, Finland, Sweden, and Austria) on expansion must be concluded by 1 March in order to allow these countries to join on 1 January 1995. In addition, cooperation has to be improved between the 12 EU states, particularly in the area of asylum law, Kinkel said.
