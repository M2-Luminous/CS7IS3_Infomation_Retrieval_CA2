FR940816-1-00067 FR940816-1-00010 Management of wolves in the experimental population would not result in any major change in existing private or public land-use restrictions (except at containment facilities during reintroduction) after 6 breeding pairs of wolves are established in this experimental area. When 5 or fewer breeding pairs are in this experimental area, land-use restrictions could be employed on an as needed basis, at the discretion of land management and natural resources agencies to control intrusive human disturbance. Temporary restrictions on human access, when 5 or fewer breeding pairs are established, may be required near active wolf den sites between April 1 and June 30. The Service, or Federal, State or Tribal agencies authorized by the Service would be allowed to promptly remove any wolf of the experimental population that the Service, or agency authorized by the Service, determined was presenting a threat to human life or safety. Although not a management option per se , it is noted that a person could legally kill or injure wolves in response to an immediate threat to human life. The incidental and accidental nonnegligent take in the course of otherwise lawful recreational activity, or take in defense of human life, would be permitted by the Service and Service-authorized agencies, provided that such taking is immediately (within 24 hours) reported to the authorized State or Federal authority. The Service or State, Federal, or Tribal agencies designated by the Service will control wolves that attack livestock (cattle, sheep, horses, and mules) by management measures that may include aversive conditioning, nonlethal control, and/or moving wolves when 5 or fewer breeding pairs are established, and by previously described measures. However, killing wolves or placing them in captivity may be considered and used as management options after 6 or more breeding pairs are established in the experimental population area. For depredation occurring on public land and prior to 6 breeding pairs becoming established, depredating females and their pups would be released on site prior to October 1. Wolves on private land under these circumstances would be moved. Wolves that attack other domestic animals and pets on private land 2 times in a calendar year would be moved. Chronic problem wolves (wolves that depredate on domestic animals after being moved for previous domestic animal depredations) would be removed from the wild. The Service, other Federal agencies, and Tribal and State Wildlife Agency personnel would be additionally authorized and should be prepared to take wolves under special circumstances where there was an immediate threat to livestock or property, or a need to move individuals for genetic purposes. Wolves could be captured alive and translocated to resolve demonstrated conflicts with State big-game management objectives or when they were outside designated wolf pack recovery areas. Take procedures in such instances would involve live capture and removal to a remote area, or if the animal is clearly unfit to remain in the wild, return to a captive facility. Killing of animals would be a last resort and would be authorized only if live capture attempts fail or there is some clear danger to human life. The Service and other authorized management agencies would use the following conditions and criteria in determining the problem status of wolves within the nonessential experimental population area: (1) Wounded livestock or some remains of a livestock carcass must be present with clear evidence (Roy and Dorrance 1976: Fritts 1982) that wolves were responsible for the damage and there must be reason to believe that additional losses would occur if the problem wolf or wolves were not controlled. Such evidence is essential since wolves may feed on carrion they have found while not being responsible for the kill. (2) Artificial or intentional feeding of wolves must not have occurred. Livestock carcasses not properly disposed of in an area where depredations have occurred will be considered attractants. On Federal lands, removal or resolution of such attractants must accompany any control action. Livestock carrion or carcasses on Federal land, not being used as bait in an authorized control action (by agencies authorized by the Service), must be removed, buried, burned, or otherwise disposed of so that the carcass(es) will not attract wolves. (3) On Federal lands, animal husbandry practices previously identified in existing approved allotment plans and annual operating plans for allotments must have been followed. Final Federal responsibility for protection of gray wolves in the experimental population under provisions of the Act would cease after: (1) A minimum of 10 breeding pairs are documented for three consecutive years in each of the three recovery areas presented by the revised wolf recovery plan (Service 1987), and evaluated by the environmental impact statement (Service 1994), providing that legal mechanisms are in place to conserve this population, and (2) gray wolves in Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming are delisted according to provisions of the Act. The Act specifies that the status of a species must be monitored for a 5-period after delisting. If, after delisting, the wolf population fell below the minimum criteria of 10 breeding pairs in any recovery area for two of three consecutive years, wolves in that area would be considered for relisting under the Act. Public Comments Solicited The Service intends that any final rule resulting from this proposal be as accurate and effective as possible. Therefore, comments or suggestions from the public, States, Tribes, other concerned governmental agencies, the scientific community, industry, or any other interested party concerning this proposed rule are hereby solicited. Comments must be received within 60 days of publication of the proposed rule in the Federal Register . Any final decision on this proposal will take into consideration the comments and any additional information received by the Service. Such communications may lead to a final rule that differs from this proposal.
