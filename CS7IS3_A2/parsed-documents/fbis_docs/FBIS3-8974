[Coposu] It is obvious that, regardless of the incompatibility and doctrine differences between various political groupings, there are also prospects of compatibility. Normally, each political grouping should give priority to the struggle for a program that can please the citizens they are representing. Consequently, this is a likely common target. Of course, one can also add that there are very many demagogic political groupings. However, one should generally proceed from the viewpoint -- incontestable, in principle -- that all parties want the good of the people. [Badralexi] What about the Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR]? [Coposu] This is a party without a program. It is being kept together by the temporary interests of its members. If these interests disappear, the party will disappear, too. However, even without this lack of a program, one cannot say that all its components are totally devoid of good intentions for the country. In my opinion, there are two trends within the PDSR. One -- which for the time being is in a majority -- is the radical trend, consisting of people with a crypto-communist mentality, who have not yet rid themselves of the Stalinist methods. [Badralexi] Can you give some names? [Coposu] I do not want to get that specific. There is a known group which has emerged along these lines and which does not make any bones about its orientation. Another group, more modest in numbers, which is unfortunately subject to the moral pressure of the radicals, has a more moderate tinge. Of course, there are valuable people among the moderates. Do not ask me to name them, because I will not become personal in this respect, either. [Badralexi] At least tell me what you think about Messrs. Nastase [PDSR executive president] and [Pdsr President] Gherman: Are they moderate or radical? [Coposu] Both are moderates, in my opinion. However, as I have already said, this group is unfortunately under the moral pressure of the others. Our older hopes about the increase of the moderate group's share have not come true. Therefore, if the situation is not worse than a few months ago, it is at least the same now as then. However, to answer your question, I will just refer to the moderate group. There would be some compatibility between that PDSR group and our party -- not necessarily programmatic, but a compatibility regarding the short-term common targets for this period and a pragmatic approach to working out a crisis program. [Badralexi] Is it possible that the PDSR might see no other way out at this point than to leave the initiative up to the moderate group? If so, do you think it possible that the PNTCD would back a monocolor PDSR government? [Coposu] In my opinion, it is not up to the PDSR or one of its two aforementioned groups to make concessions. This is the prerogative of President Ion Iliescu, who has a monopoly over the political power in Romania. But Mr. Iliescu is not ready to make any kind of concessions; he wants to keep all levers of power. [Badralexi] What might prevent him from realizing that he has no other choice? [Coposu] Maybe an unjustified fear of the consequences of a change in his absolute power. [Badralexi] Consequences that might affect him personally, or are you talking about political consequences? [Coposu] I think he is worried about his person. All the assurances we gave him were disregarded by him, as they are difficult to be believed by a man who thinks with another kind of logic than ours. Of course, Mr. Iliescu has not yet realized that our party and the opposition in general has other goals than witch hunting. Proof of our mentality is the fact that in the past four year no serious member of the PNTCD or the Association of Former Political Detainees [AFDP] has expressed any desire to take revenge against the inquisitors. [Badralexi] Will the president manage to suppress this fear for his own security? [Coposu] Unfortunately, I am pessimistic in this respect. My impression, which I do not want confirmed, is that the president is not ready to give up his monopoly of power, unless he is faced with the threat of popular wrath. This is something that should be avoided, since it might have a destabilizing effect and might delay the normalization of the situation in Romania. Therefore, as far as I am concerned, after following a logical line of thinking which I believe he has also followed, I have come to the conclusion that he is reticent about the usefulness of concessions that can lead to the pacification of Romanian society and to reconciliation. [Badralexi] Let us talk now about the president's government. Would a possible change of premiers also change your position on backing a monocolor government? [Coposu] No, because it is not Mr. Vacaroiu's presence that prevents a change of attitude. Right now, there are only two solutions: a change of the parliamentary majority or early elections. The governmental reshuffle should be done in such a way as to gain internal and external credibility. This cannot be achieved through a simple rotation of persons and an abusive interpretation of the constitution, by avoiding to submit the new cabinet members to the Parliament's vote. As long as a parliamentary majority that supports a credible and competent government cannot be put together, there is only the alternative of early elections. However, nobody wants them, since that would mean further social destabilization that could drag on for half a year, let alone the inherent expenses and the stagnation of reform that a ballot would imply. However, I would like to be proven wrong and a new parliamentary majority can be formed, a majority which will support a stable and more credible government than the one which has brought the country to the threshold of disaster. [Badralexi] Would a PDSR government with an authentic reforming program, which enjoys the support of the parliamentary opposition, imply a change of the parliamentary majority? [Coposu] Provided that this government is supported by that part of the PDSR which we have called moderate. But this is not the important thing. The important thing is to work out a crisis program supported by all responsible forces, at least for a certain period of time. [Badralexi] How do you concretely see such a parliamentary change? [Coposu] There are several aspects here. There is the possibility of a minority government which has abandoned its alliance with the extremist parties and is supported in all its democratic initiatives by the current opposition. What I have in mind is a government set up by the moderate wing of the PDSR and the representatives of the opposition, that is the Democratic Convention of Romania [CDR] and the Democratic Party [PD(FSN)]. Together, these forces could put together a comfortable majority. There is also the possibility of an opposition government supported by the PDSR moderate wing. [Badralexi] Would that be enough? [Coposu] Yes, provided that it gets the support of a part of the PDSR. This hypothesis cannot be excluded. However, in order to achieve this, there must be a political will for change -- something which unfortunately does not yet exist. For the time being, the only valid hypothesis remains that of a minority government. As far as the support of the opposition is concerned, this could be granted not only to back the implementation of the IMF memorandum, which is non-negotiable, but also to promote a number of indispensable laws which have been deliberately postponed until now. Without these laws, one cannot even dream of a process of normalization or a beginning of democratization. One must prove in actual fact the desire to carry out the reform. The first stage of any negotiations should be the working out of a program. The other aspects are secondary and giving priority to them is proof of a lack of seriousness. [Badralexi] If we believe that President Iliescu reaches the conclusion that he has no other choice than to make concessions and part with his pathological fear, what would be the maximum concessions that the PNTCD is ready to make for a possible cooperation with the rulers? [Coposu] Our party's principles are nonnegotiable. I believe that one should not ask from us to make any greater concessions than our declared readiness to support all the democratic measures designed to take the country out of the crisis. Therefore, instead of isolating ourselves and watching the catastrophe unfold, we have expressed our readiness to partake effectively in solving the crisis. However, I do not consider it as a concession, since this is the moral obligation of all responsible political factors in Romania. [Badralexi] Mr. Coposu, before we wind up this interview, I would like you to tell me whether a Romanian politician today can say what Iuliu Maniu [leader of the National Peasant Party between the two world wars] said at one time: "I have ruled the country for 20 years from the opposition." [Coposu] Well, Maniu did not lie... [Badralexi] We know that, but would such a thing be possible today? [Coposu] This would be possible -- if not today, then tomorrow. After all, the role of the opposition in a democracy is equally as important as the role of the government. The checking done to the government's administration by a strong opposition is equally as important as the governing act itself. Maniu was right, the country can also be governed from the opposition. On the other hand, the absence of an opposition leads to either totalitarianism or catastrophe. Particularly if the political power gets into the hands of incompetent people devoid of patriotism, whose only preoccupation is to ensure the endless prolongation of their power of decision, which they have acquired at a certain point.
