FBIS4-5571 "dreas070_d_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-070 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 South Korea Foreign Minister Leaves for Russia Via Tokyo Foreign Minister Leaves for Russia Via Tokyo OW1204061094 Tokyo KYODO in English 0602 GMT 12 Apr 94 OW1204061094 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Seoul, April 12 KYODO -- South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu flew to Tokyo on Tuesday [12 April] on his way for a weeklong visit to Russia, Britain and Belgium, government officials said. During a stopover in Tokyo, Han will meet Hans Blix, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), to discuss North Korea's refusal to grant inspectors unhampered access to its nuclear facilities. The IAEA has said two weeks of inspections in March were insufficient to decide whether Pyongyang has diverted nuclear materials for weapons purposes as alleged by the United States and other Western nations. North Korea says it has fully complied with inspection criteria previously agreed upon and maintains its nuclear program serves strictly civilian purposes. The nuclear row will top Han's agenda in Moscow, where he will meet Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and other government leaders from Wednesday through Friday. "I expect Moscow to bring up its earlier proposal for an eight- way conference on the North Korean nuclear issue and I will explain Seoul's position," YONHAP News Agency quoted Han as saying before departure. Moscow has suggested that both Koreas, China, the U.S., Russia, Japan, the United Nations and the IAEA try to resolve the nuclear controversy through a special conference. According to YONHAP, Han said Seoul welcomes the Russian proposal but prefers that the UN handles the North Korean issue for the time being. Han is scheduled to meet British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd in London on Saturday and will return to Seoul next Monday after attending a two-day conference of South Korean mission chiefs in Brussels.
