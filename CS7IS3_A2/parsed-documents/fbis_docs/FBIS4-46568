In 1949, he graduated from VVMIU [Higher Naval Engineering School] imeni F.E. Dzerzhinskiy, then served in the navy, and began working at the TsKB in 1953. Many models of nuclear and diesel submarines have been developed with Igor Dmitriyevich's participation and under his guidance. Having become the TsKB chief, I.D. Spasskiy fundamentally rejected the role of primary designer of individual models and as Chief Designer is now involved with resolving the primary issues. Igor Dmitriyevich was awarded the rank of Hero of Socialist Labor for success in the development of arms and military equipment for the country's Naval submarine fleet, he has been awarded four orders of the USSR, and he is a Lenin and State prize laureate. In 1987, he was selected as an academician of the USSR Academy of Sciences. The Naval Equipment TsKB was created in 1926 from a small collective at Baltiysk Plant. B.M. Malinin, who became the primary designer of the first Soviet submarines, was the first bureau chief. Already in 1928, the TsKB managed to develop the first ship from the "Dekabrist" series. Six of these ships were built during the period from 1928 through 1931. The "Narodovolets", the second submarine of this series, has been preserved to our days. It has been installed at Vasilyevskiy Island in Galernyy Harbor on the territory of the exhibition complex. They plan to open a pavilion through which entry into the submarine will be accomplished on the 300th Anniversary of the Russian Navy. Our TsKB is also participating in this work. A number of series of submarines, specifically, series of such famous submarines as "Shchuka" and "Malyutka" with which the Pacific Ocean Fleet was equipped, were developed at the TsKB prior to the Great Patriotic War. Nearly completed submarines were shipped by railroad (on special flat cars) to the Far East where they were completed because a special shipbuilding plant had not been created there. The largest submarine of the prewar period -- was the 14th series "K" class submarine -- which could complete long-range cruises. The submarines that were developed at the TsKB actively participated in the Great Patriotic War but much has already been written about that and there's no sense repeating that. After the war, a number of diesel submarines were developed that were in the Naval inventory for a long time. They were designs 611 and 613. Approximately 200 of the latter design were built. Later, many new classes of submarines were developed based upon them, specifically, it is on them that we began to familiarize ourselves with missile weapons. The idea of a single engine that permits a submarine to be submerged for a prolonged period of time was developed on design 615 submarines that appeared after 1953. At the beginning of the 1960's, submarines with nuclear power plants appeared but diesel submarines continued to be improved in parallel. Specifically, modifications of design 613 submarines were armed with cruise missiles. The latest diesel-electric submarine, developed at the TsKB --is the "Varshavyanka" (NATO designation -- Kilo). We need to note one other diesel electric submarine -- "Neptun". This is an excursion ship designed for 40 passengers that can remain submerged for nearly an hour. "Neptun", like other submarines developed by the TsKB, was built by "Sevmash" Production Association at Severodvinsk. Right now "Neptun" is being utilized to attract tourists to the Antilles Islands. Submarines with nuclear power plants, equipped with cruise missiles and ballistic missiles, were also developed at the TsKB. These submarines are known under the NATO designations Oscar, Delta and others. The latest, the largest submarine is the "Tayfun". The specifications of the submarines are listed in JANES, the well-known weapons reference book. If you compare our submarines with American submarines, we need to say that many technical solutions are very similar but there are differences in their architecture. We devote greater attention to the missions of survivability due to the complexity of accessing the open ocean. Ballistic and cruise missiles are strategic submarines' primary weapons. Domestically-produced missiles are heavier and larger than their foreign equivalents with approximately identical operating ranges. But we are striving to accommodate the same number of missiles on our submarines as on foreign submarines. Furthermore, domestically-produced onboard electronic equipment is also heavier and larger. All of this results in the fact that domestically-produced submarines are larger than foreign submarines. Some of their specifications are cited in the table.

By the end of the century, these probably will be Ohio and Los Angeles class submarines. In our country, we are proposing building "Tayfun" and Oscar class submarines. For a long time, our submarines had a high noise level and therefore were easily detected by acoustic instruments. However, during the last ten years, the noise level has been reduced and has become the same as that of American submarines. In the opinion of U.S. admirals, it has now become much more difficult to detect our submarines. For a long time the Maritime Equipment TsKB was the only KB [design bureau] for the development of submarines in the country. But two other KB's appeared in the USSR during the last 20-30 years: "Makhalit" and "Lazurit" which branched off from our TsKB. During the time of the USSR's existence, approximately 1,000 submarines were handed over to the Navy, of them more than 80% were developed at "Rubin" TsKB. Previously, our three KB's had a total of approximately 8,000 developers. In today's situation, that number of KB's and specialists-developers of submarines is excessive as a result of the appearance of the military concept of defensive sufficiency and the drastic reduction of defense orders. A similar situation is being observed not only in the sphere of military shipbuilding but also in all directions of weapons and military equipment. Some people are advocating the maintenance of all military directions and all defense enterprises. I think that this is incorrect and the main thing -- impossible. First and foremost, we need to preserve the scientific potential of the defense profile and to optimize the structure of enterprises and the number of their workers. That policy has been conducted in our KB for nearly five years. We understand that military orders will be substantially reduced and the productivity of design work is significantly increasing due to its computerization. Based upon anticipated orders from the Navy, we will be able to pay for the work of approximately 1,000 people. We have begun to reduce the number of KB workers. So, previously there were 4,000 designers in the KB and right now approximately 2,000 are left. We are conducting job placement for all of those people whose jobs have been eliminated, primarily in the small enterprises that are being formed around the KB and in other structures that are associated with us. A submarine is a very complex structure that is equipped with practically all types of equipment. If we are to develop a good submarine, then we need to have good specialists for each type of equipment and for each functional assembly, not only for the structural profile but also for various spheres of science and technology, and who analyze all of the processes of that assembly's interaction with other functional assemblies and systems. Proceeding from this, the number of designers must be no less than 1,500-2,000 people. So, it is impossible to count only on defense orders. While resolving the problem of ensuring the enterprise's stability and preserving the collective that is needed to develop a submarine, we have followed that path which major foreign firms have long followed: they have several different directions of activity. Previously, they thought that three were adequate and now they are orienting themselves on five directions. Then the firm will be stable under any cataclysms. Figuratively speaking, they stand on three (or five) legs. If one leg turns out to be removed, the enterprise's stability is nevertheless preserved. We at the TsKB have also begun to form other technical directions that are oriented on the needs of the national economy. Some of the TsKB's associates have transferred to these directions, utilizing their rich experience as designers in them. Generally speaking, it turns out to be useful for many developers to sometimes change work profiles. They contribute their ideas in the new direction which turn out to be very productive here. So, a mutual enrichment occurs both of the developers and of the technical directions to which they have transferred. We have noted several new directions of the TsKB's work. We have rejected some of them and some were grabbed by other firms. However, we have begun to develop at least three directions besides submarine building. First of all, I need to talk about the direction of the development of high-speed rolling stock for the St. Petersburg-Moscow Main Line. The TsKB has been involved with the development of this project for approximately a year. During that time, the cooperation of enterprises has been developed both on the design and also on the production of high-speed rolling stock and there are already a number of contracts. The TsKB has managed to gain prestige among those design collectives that were previously involved with these issues. Enterprises that were previously not part of the military-industrial complex have not managed to do this project because they were financed based upon the residual principle and did not have the capability to develop and retain good specialists, and so forth. The best cadres were concentrated in military-industrial complex enterprises and their involvement in national economic matters has had a positive impact because they are introducing new ideas. Not only our but also other defense enterprises have been attracted to this direction. Specifically, VNIItransmash [All-Union Scientific Institute of Machinery for Transportation], the director of which is E.K. Potemkin, is conducting the design of a special dolly. I think that we, jointly with other defense complex enterprises and rail transportation specialists from Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Riga, are successfully resolving this task in which the Maritime Equipment TsKB is performing the function of lead design and coordinating center. The manufacture of rolling stock will be conducted near St. Petersburg in the city of Tikhvin at the Transmash plant that previously produced transmissions for tractors and that accomplished some orders on a defense theme. The plant has been equipped with modern equipment and has good cadres and a technological culture. This enterprise will be the lead enterprise and will receive components from subcontractors. The Yakovlev KB has undertaken the design of the body from aluminum alloys, the control panel, and so forth. Our TsKB, as the lead design bureau, is involved with the critical analysis of all issues associated with the construction of the main line. The rail line has been laid through Novgorod. This rail line will be specialized and slow rolling stock will not move along it. They plan to attain rolling stock speeds of up to 350 kph in order for a train to cover the distance between St. Petersburg-Moscow in two hours. Launch of the rail line will be carried out gradually: the first rolling stock must begin movement already in 1996, indeed, its speed at the beginning will be somewhat less (250 kph). By utilizing the experience of the entire world (France, the United States, Japan and Italy) during the critical analysis, we hope to introduce original solutions to individual assemblies of the rolling stock that permit us to improve their quality. The second direction -- is the development of offshore platforms for oil and gas production on the continental shelf. This direction is close to our primary direction because these platforms are equipped with all kinds of life support, electrical and power systems just like submarines. We are oriented on the Northern and Sakhalin areas. In the Sakhalin area, we are working jointly with American, English and Japanese firms. We did the technical and economic feasibility (TEO) jointly with Americans in Houston. The technical and economic feasibility has been approved, however, the leadership on Sakhalin has changed right now and further work has slowed down for the time being. A great deal of work is being proposed in the Northern Area -- the Shtokmanovskiy Oil Field in the Barents Sea. This oil field is very large and oil production work can begin already in the near future. Although we are encountering fierce competition from foreign firms and everything is not clear organizationally, this direction will mandatorily be actively developed and significant forces of our TsKB will participate in it. The third direction is associated with electric power. Specifically, we are already participating on the Far East order in the design of underground AES's [nuclear power plants]. I think that this direction is the future of nuclear power engineering. Only at first glance does it appear that these AES's will be very expensive. However, they will occupy substantially less space, we have found a simpler solution to remove them from service, the safety of the plant itself is being sharply increased, and so forth. Consequently, these AES's will be even cheaper than surface AES's, if you take into account their entire life cycle, including the stage to remove them from service and scrap them. These three directions have permitted us to preserve the strength of our TsKB at approximately 2,000 people. Right now we are acquiring a large shipment of computers that will increase the labor productivity of designers and we will be able to dismiss a few more workers. I think that the remaining specialists will ensure the resolution of tasks in these three directions and the main thing -- they will be able to successfully continue work on our main profile -- the development of submarines. Right now, polemics are being conducted with regard to types of nuclear weapon delivery platforms. The polemics indicate that a shift to two types is possible: submarines and airborne platforms. Therefore submarines remain promising for another prolonged period of time and, consequently, we need to continue to develop our primary direction. As I have already pointed out, already five years ago the TsKB leadership arrived at the conclusion that they had to anticipate a substantial reduction of military orders and searches began for possible paths to support the future TsKB. For example, we built a business center. This is an entire complex: a 100-room European-level hotel equipped with modern communications systems and rooms for offices that have been leased to businessmen. Right now we are building a restaurant, a sports complex with a swimming pool, and a greenhouse in which vegetables will be cultivated the whole year round. Utilizing our previous experience of developing greenhouses on submarines that are going out on cruises for a prolonged period of time, we have already developed one greenhouse and we have adapted attic rooms to do that. We annually conduct four harvests of vegetables and we sell them to city restaurants. The Council on Conversion, headed by Retired Admiral Shcherbakov, has been created in St. Petersburg under the city administration. I serve as deputy on this Council. In our city, more than half of the work was in the defense complex. It is difficult to restructure all of these enterprises to civilian production. We did a great deal of work on the development of a data base on the city's converted enterprises, the information on which we gathered using specially created teams. We utilized the experience of East Germany, where a similar data base was also created. We have been working with a German firm for 2.5 years. Information on converted enterprises has been gathered in a separate book that has been published in English, entered into an electronic information system and introduced into the European Network. This helps to find foreign investors since all of this was done in a form that is accepted in Europe and America. I need to say that at first many foreign firms displayed interest in our enterprises. However, the political and economic instability in Russia and the absence of precise laws is delaying this process. It is very difficult to operate in that situation. How can you begin a new business venture if the tax system has not been formed in the country. New laws are continuously being adopted that transform all economic calculations. What was profitable yesterday becomes unprofitable today. Serious investors will not operate in this situation. I need to say that despite the difficulties that arise, work nevertheless continues. For example, Kirov Plant, jointly with the Germans, has set up the production of tractors for farmers. However, this work is still small. If "real" laws are adopted, the investment process will broadly expand and not only in our country. We will also be able to invest capital in the West and obtain a profit both for ourselves and for the country as a whole. We are counting on the fact that the required laws will be adopted in Russia in the near future.
