FBIS4-59766 "drnes096_j_94019" FBIS-NES-94-096 Daily Report 15 May 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen Commentary: Unity in Yemen `Irrevocable' Commentary: Unity in Yemen `Irrevocable' JN1505211494 Sanaa Yemeni Republic Radio Network in Arabic 1218 GMT 15 May 94 JN1505211494 Sanaa Yemeni Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Unattributed commentary] [Text] The destiny of and the belief in Yemeni unity continues to capture the feelings of Yemenis. It is an irrevocable fate. It is an objective we achieved after struggle and a long wait. The objective of unity has been realized and has achieved victory. It is now becoming firm and strong, deeply rooted in hearts and the land. Unity is spreading through time. How can we say no, while we watch the unionist heroes from the forces of unity and legitimacy brand unity with sweat, effort, steadfastness, and the unionists' march forward? We see the unionist citizens welcoming them with joy and support, united with them in all love and appreciation, and with all joy and belief in unity. We witnessed this in al-Dali', Abyan, Lahij, and other places. They are scenes that prove a belief in unity and a concern about it continuing, regardless of sacrifices and no matter how much the gangs of apostasy and secession try to harm it or hide from its overwhelming light in the burrows of apostasy, the dens of secession, and the labyrinths of their wicked conspiracy. With the amazing and delightful scenes that shine with the brightness of unity and love for it and faith in it, we hear support and see the rallying around Constitutional legitimacy and unionist leadership. We hear it, with satisfaction and peace of mind, in the cable from the people of al-Dali' to President Leader Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council and supreme commander of the Armed Forces. This cable disproves and silences all claims by the horns of apostasy and secession and puts their feet back in their mouths. The cable throws a stone at the secessionists and defies the evils of the secessionists. It is a cable that radiates with a right that cannot be avoided. It follows the road that cannot be changed and seeks to achieve the same objective we have. Perhaps what makes the issue deeper and clearer are the statements by the citizens to the Yemeni Television cameras, expressing their joy about the defeat of the positions of apostasy, removing the traces of secession, destroying the dens of partitioning, and defeating the remnants of the losing secessionist conspiracy, whose price has been paid. The citizens' words express their belief in unity and their adherence to it as an objective, a fate, and a hope that all the good people of Yemen sought to achieve. There is no argument that the leadership that believes in Yemeni unity and is the representative of Constitutional legitimacy expressed the hopes of the citizens and translated the feelings of all the people. It did so when President Leader Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council and supreme commander of the Armed forces, instructed the minister of defense to destroy all the positions that are linked to partitioning, or show signs of it, and to erase all traces of division and separation between the one Yemeni land and the one people. Yes, they are instructions that express the feelings of every Yemeni, translates his will and shows his fate. Therefore, the unionist forces along with the unionist masses in all areas embarked on destroying all these traces based on Salih's instructions. They translated these instruction into a tangible reality, out of their faith that this is right and is what the people want. All signs, events, actions, stands, and words show without any doubt that unity is rooted in the depths of the hearts and land, and is spreading through time. It will continue to reap its benefits everywhere and at all times--benefits that will not stop. The people will enjoy its benefits every time and will persistently defend its generosity in any circumstance. How can we say no, when unity is the greater objective and the irrevocable fate? It is the dream we achieved through sacrifices and struggle and through the perseverance and faith of the heroic men -- men who fulfilled what they had promised. They achieved the promise and lived up to the pledge, They gave birth to unity for all Yemen from the depths of time on the great day of 22 May. Here are the sons of all Yemen continuing to care for, protect, and defend it with all love, sincerity, faith and insistence, despite the gangs of apostasy and secession. Therefore, we are sure that the parasites of the gangs of secessionism will be uprooted from the land, God willing. Moreover, the apostasy will be disintegrated by the brightness of the sun of unity. God is with right and its people and with unity and those who protect it. God supports those who are sincere and faithful, defeats the liars and renegades, and destroys those who defy God's will and deviate from the masses' consensus. Seest thou not how God sets forth a parable? A goodly word like a goodly tree whose root is firmly fixed and its branches reach to the heavens. It brings forth its fruit at all times, by the leave of its lord. So God sets forth parables for men, in order that they may receive admonition. And the parable of an evil word is that of an evil tree. It is torn up by the root from the surface of the Earth. It has no stability. God will establish in strength those who believe, with the word that stands firm, in this world and in the hereafter; but God will leave, to stray, those who do wrong; God does what he wills. [Koranic verse]
