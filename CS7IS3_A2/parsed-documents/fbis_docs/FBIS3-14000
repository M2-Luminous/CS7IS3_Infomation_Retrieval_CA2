Bhatt] [Text] So long, the security forces have borne the brunt of the low-cost proxy war that Pakistan has been waging in Kashmir. They have shown exemplary patience and restraint in dealing with criminal elements trained, armed, and funded by Pakistan. Unfair and false accusations have been flung at them. The tragedy overall was that some elements in our own country were oblivious of the tremendous burden on the security men and were willing to be taken in by the untruthful propaganda. Now the answer to Pakistan and its supporters has come from the august Parliament of India. Both houses have adopted with unanimity a resolution warning Pakistan against aiding and abetting the terrorists in Kashmir. The people's representatives have demonstrated that India stands completely united as one man on preserving her integrity. The Parliament has also shown that when the time comes democracy can prove stronger that the plutocracy that our neighbor seems to have and stronger than any other form of government. We may have our differences on many issues. Different parties have different views on how and when the political process in Kashmir should be restarted. Differences persist on who would be the best persons to run the state in the meanwhile. But on the integrity of the nation, on Kashmir being an inalienable part of India and the need to drive out the terrorists sent from across the border, there are no two opinions. One wishes this warning to Pakistan had come somewhat earlier, but it has been satisfying to note that lately there has been the much desired clarity and firmness of resolve in the government's utterances and actions. The government seems to have grasped the meaning of the disturbing statements emanating from Washington which have given some strength to Pakistan's reckless actions in Kashmir. In a way, therefore, Parliament's resolution is a warning to both Islamabad and the United States. By a fortuitous and fortunate coincidence, the European ambassadors who recently toured Kashmir also spoke through a representative on the issue of terrorism in Kashmir. Their evaluation is of importance because they had complete freedom to observe whatever they felt they should see to form an opinion. They have found evidence of the terrorists, including foreign mercenaries, operating in strength. They also saw that the people are fed up with the prolonged militancy supported by Pakistan. India has also to be vigilant against any excesses and ensure that the people in Kashmir are protected and not allowed to come to harm. The voice of the people of India expressed by Parliament must serve as a strong warning to both the perpetrator of the armed intrusions and its long distanced supporter. *
