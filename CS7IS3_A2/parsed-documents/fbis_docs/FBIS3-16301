This was reported to journalists by the head of a parliamentary group and State Minister for Nationalities Sergey Shakhray. He said Communists, Liberal-Democrats, Democrats and the Agrarian Party voted against the debate as they felt the matter should be settled by the president himself. "These groups are either afraid of Dudayev, or of a controversy about the matter", Shakhray announced. Shakhray came out with the initiative of discussing the matter in both houses of the Federal Assembly.
