This new year will be a year in which the nation's reform and opening up endeavors and economic construction will gather speed on the basis of the experiences and brilliant successes gained and achieved in the past 15 years. Media at home and abroad commonly maintain that China's economic reform and development will both gather speed and will be successful, provided that the country proceeds carefully and practically, taking advantage of its economic and political stability. How can China's economic reform and development proceed faster? The nation's economic development in 1993 shows a new economic system must be established through reform and a new course should be set for development, and that these are two mutually dependent requirements. This is due to the fact that only by building a new economic system through reform can productive forces be significantly liberated and a sustained, fast, and healthy national economic development be ensured. The entire macroeconomic development shows that, compared with 1992, the nation's economy in 1993 grew approximately 13 percent, industrial output grew 19.5 percent, and investment in fixed assets grew 47 percent. Such high rates of economic growth did not give rise to any major problems specifically because reform has enabled us to control the economic "express train" by means of macroeconomic regulation and control, and consequently our enterprises' production and operations have become more vital and our country's overall economic strength has grown. Last year's macroeconomic regulation and control replaced the previous practice of simply relying on administrative measures with a combination of economic, administrative, and legal measures, emphasizing economic measures. Moreover, as result of replacing direct regulation and control with indirect regulation and control, the nation has achieved results totally different from those of the past: The chaos in the monetary and distribution spheres were brought under control, fast economic growth was maintained, and dramatic economic ups and downs were avoided. When viewed from another perspective, however, the major economic problems in 1993 are also problems that need to be resolved through reform. For example, 37.3 percent of state enterprises were operating in the red and their losses seriously restrained the growth in the returns of state businesses; and excessive investment in fixed assets and irrational investment seriously upset supply and demand. The solution to these problems lies in stronger reform measures, gradual establishment of a modern system for enterprise operations, pushing enterprises to take part in market competition, and fully restructuring the current investment pattern. Economic authority maintains: The current opportunity is one of development and reform, and if we disregard the opportunity of reform, we will lose the opportunity of development; there will hardly be development without carrying out reform; there will not be fast growth without accelerating reform; and reforms during the new period must target those deep-rooted problems obstructing fast and healthy economic development. According to relevant state authorities, with an approximately nine percent economic growth this year, the nation will still have "sustained, fast, and healthy" economic growth. Although this figure is smaller than that of last year, it is still quite high when compared with the economic situations of most countries. Economic experts assert that the principle of maintaining "sustained, fast, and healthy" growth has the following profound meanings: The real nature of socialism is to liberate and develop productive forces, achieve common prosperity, and speed up the process of liberating productive forces, which are the core of socialist construction; China's fast growth should not be tentative or short- termed, but should be fast and sustained; and the development must be healthy, meaning that it is in line with law, it is subjected to macroscopic regulation and control, and it is supported by law. The reform over the past 15 years proves that whenever a place has been successful in reform, it also enjoys fast growth. China's fast economic growth over the past two years is the result the nation has achieved while speeding up reform and opening wider to the outside world after Comrade Deng Xiaoping gave his important speech in southern China and after the convocation of the 14th national party congress. The current situation of reform is very good because the opportunity for reform is there and the goals have been clearly defined. However, the tasks of reform are also formidable. Under the situation where reform and development are both gathering speed, we should be aware that we cannot afford to carry out reform by suspending development. Fast growth is the result of reform, and only through reform can we master the "high tech" -- namely the new system -- for controlling the national economy during fast economic operations. We must learn the skills of speeding up reform under the circumstances when the economic development is fast and changes in the economic sector are fairly complex. The year 1994 is critical for China's reform and economic development and it should be a year in which China will be successful in these two areas.
