SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Section 4204 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, (``ERISA'' or ``the Act''), provides that a bona fide arm's-length sale of assets of a contributing employer to an unrelated party will not be considered to result in a withdrawal if three conditions are met. These conditions, enumerated in section 4204(a)(1)(A)&hyph;(C), are that_ (A) The purchaser has an obligation to contribute to the plan with respect to the operations for substantially the same number of contribution base units for which the seller was obligated to contribute; (B) The purchaser obtains a bond or places an amount in escrow, for a period of five plan years after the sale, in an amount equal to the greater of the seller's average required annual contribution to the plan for the three plan years preceding the year in which the sale occurred or the seller's required annual contribution for the plan year preceding the year in which the sale occurred (the amount of the bond or escrow is doubled if the plan is in reorganization in the year in which the sale occurred); and (C) The contract of sale provides that if the purchaser withdraws from the plan within the first five plan years beginning after the sale and fails to pay any of its liability to the plan, the seller shall be secondarily liable for the liability it (the seller) would have had but for section 4204. The bond or escrow described above would be paid to the plan if the purchaser withdraws from the plan or fails to make any required contributions to the plan within the first five plan years beginning after the sale. Additionally, section 4204(b)(1) provides that if a sale of assets is covered by section 4204, the purchaser assumes by operation of law the contribution record of the seller for the plan year in which the sale occurred and the preceding four plan years. Section 4204(c) of ERISA authorizes the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (``PBGC'') to grant individual or class variances or exemptions from the purchaser's bond/escrow requirement of section 4204(a)(1)(B) when warranted. The legislative history of section 4204 indicates a Congressional intent that the sale rules be administered in a manner that assures protection of the plan with the least practicable intrusion into normal business transactions. Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, 96th Cong., 2nd Sess., S.1076, The Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980: Summary and Analysis of Considerations 16 (Comm. Print, April 1980); 128 Cong. Rec. S10117 (July 29, 1980). The granting of an exemption or variance from the bond/escrow requirement does not constitute a finding by the PBGC that a particular transaction satisfies the other requirements of section 4204(a)(1). Such questions are to be decided by the plan sponsor in the first instance, and any disputes are to be resolved in arbitration. 29 U.S.C. 1382, 1399, 1401. Under the PBGC's regulation on variances for sales of assets (29 CFR Part 2643), a request for a variance or waiver of the bond/escrow requirement under any of the tests established in the regulation (29 CFR 2643.12&hyph;2643.14) is to be made to the plan in question. The PBGC will consider waiver requests only when the request is not based on satisfaction of one of the four regulatory tests or when the parties assert that the financial information necessary to show satisfaction of one of the regulatory tests is privileged or confidential financial information within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. section 552(b)(4) (the Freedom of Information Act). Under section 2643.3 of the regulation, the PBGC shall approve a request for a variance if it determines that approval of the request is warranted, in that it_ (1) would more effectively or equitably carry out the purposes of Title IV of the Act; and (2) would not significantly increase the risk of financial loss to the plan. Section 4204(c) of the ERISA and ยง2643.3(b) of the regulation require the PBGC to publish a notice of the pendency of a request for a variance or exemption in the Federal Register , and to provide interested parties with an opportunity to comment on the proposed variance or exemption.
