FR940106-1-00054 FR940106-1-00011 (7) Conclusion The position of the near-bottom 2 U salinity isohaline is an index of habitat conditions for estuarine resources at all trophic levels, including the supply of organic matter to the food web of Suisun Bay, an important nursery area. In other words, well-behaved statistical relationships exist between the near-bottom 2 U isohaline and many estuarine resources for which sufficient data exist to make appropriate analyses. Moreover, at least a rudimentary understanding exists for the causal mechanisms underlying many of these relationships. The location of the near-bottom 2 U isohaline is important either because it is a direct causal factor or because it is highly correlated with a direct causal factor (e.g., diversions). Preliminary analyses show that errors in prediction using models which incorporate only the position of the 2 U isohaline are comparable to the errors using more complex models which incorporate additional flow-related variables. In other words, given the present data sets, predictive models using only the position of the near-bottom 2 U isohaline perform as well as more complex models that incorporate other variables. However, some of these other variables may be very important in affecting habitat and the condition of biological resources of the estuary. Recommendations At this time , the most appropriate basis for setting salinity standards for the portion of the estuary on which this report concentrates is the position of the near-bottom 2 U isohaline alone , unless it can be shown either that another variable is the controlling variable or that incorporation of additional variables improves the predictive capability. * * * * * (10) Conclusion The actual setting of salinity standards_specifying the upstream locations of the near-bottom 2 U isohaline for different periods of the year_should be keyed to environmental goals: to achieving and sustaining some desired biological response level specified in terms of habitat protection or abundance and survival rates of important and diagnostic estuarine and wetland species. Recommendations Goals should be expressed in terms of desired conditions for some future time. Progress toward those goals should be monitored and reported widely. Environmental goals for the estuary will be most effective if they are expressed in terms of restoring conditions to those that existed at specific historical times.␣.␣.␣. In developing these conclusions, the workshop participants relied in part on a series of papers developed by Dr. Alan Jassby of the University of California at Davis and Dr. Wim Kimmerer of BioSystems Analysis, Inc. These papers concluded that the position of the 2 ppt isohaline is closely associated with the abundance of estuarine organisms at all trophic levels, as well as with the supply of organic matter from phytoplankton production and riverine loading (phytoplankton POC). The estuarine organisms include primary and secondary zooplankton consumers ( Neomysis and Crangon ), a major group of benthic consumers in Suisun Bay (mollusks), bottom-foraging fish (starry flounder), and both survival (striped bass) and abundance (striped bass and longfin smelt) of fish that feed in the water column. For each of these organisms, with the exception of mollusks, abundance levels increase as the position of the 2 ppt isohaline is located farther downstream (Jassby 1993). The SFEP's final report cautioned that these correlations are not proof of cause and effect relationships. That is, the report did not attempt to identify the causal mechanism linking the salinity regime and the abundance of estuarine organisms. Further, the report did not address other factors unrelated to water quality, such as overfishing, that may also have an impact on abundance of certain aquatic resources. Nevertheless, salinity integrates a number of important estuarine properties, is easy to measure, and is readily understood by all interested parties. The particular value of 2 ppt near-bottom salinity was selected because it occurs near the upstream limit of marine salt penetration, is higher than salinities derived from agricultural runoff, is close to the entrapment zone and is associated with little stratification of the water column. The group concluded that the location of the 2 ppt isohaline, measured as kilometers upstream from the Golden Gate Bridge, is the most appropriate index of habitat conditions underlying the variability in biological resources (SFEP 1993b). These findings in the SFEP workshop reports are entirely consistent with other scientific work in the Bay/Delta. For example, Dr. Peter Moyle testified to the State Board that nursery habitat (represented by areas of low salinity) in Suisun Bay is now more important than it was historically due to the high risks of entrainment 6 faced by fishes in the Delta. After discussing a variety of mechanisms that may be behind the declines of most aquatic populations of the upper estuary, Dr. Moyle concluded that ``[w]hile the exact mechanisms that account for the importance of having the [entrapment] zone in Suisun Bay (increased food supplies, physical concentration of organisms, association with higher flows, etc.) are being debated, there seems little doubt that many fish species depend on this location for their long-term survival'' (Moyle 1992, WRINT&hyph;NHI&hyph;9). Dr. Moyle recommended that in wetter years the zone of low salinity habitat should be located near Roe Island but that in drier years this requirement could be shifted upstream to Chipps Island. In addition, the USFWS cited the importance of low-salinity habitat in Suisun Bay in the January to June period in its 1991 proposal to designate critical habitat for Delta smelt under the ESA. 56 FR 50075 (October 3, 1991). 6 Strictly defined, ``entrainment'' is the displacement of fish or other aquatic organisms from their location in one waterbody to another as a result of the operation of a water diversion. In the Bay/Delta, however, the term ``entrainment'' is generally used to refer to the destruction of fish or larvae at the intake mechanisms of the many water diversion facilities in the Delta. Most entrainment occurs when fish or larvae are pulled into screens or pumps by the diversion apparatus. c. Ecological Significance of Salinity Levels EPA is selecting the 2 ppt isohaline as the basis for its proposed criteria in part because that isohaline incorporates a whole range of factors relevant to the estuary's health, even though the operation of some of these factors is not fully understood. Some species that show high correlations with the location of the 2 ppt isohaline are not abundant in low salinity habitat and are probably responding to river flow or other correlated factors. However, salinity in the 2 ppt range is clearly and directly important to a broad range of estuarine species and the location of this salinity is strongly associated with the abundance and distribution of many of these species. The SFEP Report emphasized that it is well established scientifically that salinity has direct ecological importance to many estuarine species in this estuary and others throughout the world (SFEP 1993b). In fact, much of the distribution of estuarine species can be explained by their association with specific salinity ranges and their ability to survive and reproduce within certain salinity limits. The following sections summarize the best available evidence on the direct effects of the location of low salinity habitat on the distribution and abundance of key species and habitats within the Bay/Delta estuary. This scientific evidence provides substantial support for the need for the proposed salinity criteria protecting the water quality necessary to sustain the ecological health of the estuary.
