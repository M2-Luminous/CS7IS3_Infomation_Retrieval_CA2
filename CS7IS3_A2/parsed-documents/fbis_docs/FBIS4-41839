What Now?" rubric: "Will We Be Able To Halt the Crime Wave?"] [Text] The Russian Federation president's edict "On Urgent Measures To Protect the Population from Banditry and Other Manifestations of Organized Crime" came into force yesterday. We continue the discussion of the merits and shortcomings of this document. ...On 13 May this year, in the village of Slobodka in Moscow Oblast's Klinskiy Rayon, staffers of the regional administration for combating organized crime "took" an armed gang. The criminals had brutally killed Militia Captain A. Grushevskiy. But first they had tortured him: There were 21 knife wounds on the captain's body, and they had drowned and burned him.... For what? They had demanded that he cooperate with an organized criminal grouping. It is said that when they "took" the criminals, the residents of Klin yelled: "Kill them!" But not a mark was left on the bandits' corpulent bodies, so professionally were they detained. Unfair? Yes. But staffers of law enforcement organs are not bandits.... The "work" methods (forgive the comparison) are different. One group has the law at their disposal, albeit a bad law, while the others are bloody inhuman people. Human life is nothing to them. It is against them that the Russian president's edict "On Urgent Measures To Protect the Population from Banditry and Other Manifestations of Organized Crime" must work. Militia Colonel General Mikhail Yegorov, Russian Federation first deputy minister of internal affairs and chief of the Russian Federation Ministry of Internal Affairs Main Organized Crime Administration, has expressed his position on the edict's application. In his opinion, the rejection of this edict by many officials and politicians is attributable to the fact that they themselves are businessmen and it is not to their advantage for law enforcement organs to gain access to commercial information or, more importantly, to be able to follow the tortuous paths along which their money proceeds. As M. Yegorov pointed out, today there are more than 200 well organized and armed-to-the-teeth criminal groupings operating in Moscow alone. Every month criminal groupings in Russia commit 1,500 crimes. More than 700 firearms are regularly confiscated from them, as well as material assets and money to the value of over 5 billion rubles. Every month. Over the past 18 months alone proceedings have been instituted in 46 criminal cases connected with contract killings, which today have become the most effective means of eliminating the "enemy." Corruption and organized crime in close tandem have penetrated all spheres of state management. During 1993 alone the militia got rid of over 500 operational workers who had cooperated (sold operational information!) with criminal groupings. There were also ones who "did" "wet" jobs together with bandits. Criminal proceedings were instituted against them, and they were dismissed from internal affairs organs. Several high-ranking officials were arrested in Vladimir Oblast, in Komi.... An analysis of the courts' verdicts in such a category of criminal cases as bribes is interesting. Last year 843 officials were convicted of this. Roughly the same verdicts are passed for illegal gun running. Just 19 percent of criminals convicted under Article 218 of the Russian Federation Criminal Code are in jail. And the rest? Some are dead, some are far distant.... But the ones who really are "far distant" today are the leaders of criminal groupings released on bail [pod zalog] from Moscow Oblast courtrooms. Seventeen thugs safe and sound! The dynamics of the growth in people released on bail [zalozhniki] is staggering. On 23 June 1991 there were two of them in Moscow. There were five on the same day in 1992, 16 in 1993, and 118 in 1994. This in Moscow alone! According to recent data obtained from foreign law enforcement organs, 24 Russian criminal groupings are working in the United States and have a connection with the Cosa Nostra, and six go to Italy. Some 100 criminal groupings are oriented toward other distant foreign countries, and 200 toward nearby foreign countries (the former USSR republics).
