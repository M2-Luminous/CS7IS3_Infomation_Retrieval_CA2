Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod declined to say what the figure might be, but he did not rule out that it could be close to the $20 billion suggested earlier by a senior official. The healthy financial position is set to benefit the construction of infrastructure projects, including the Chek Lap Kok Airport, as Sir Hamish conceded that higher reserves afforded the Government more choices in funding of public works plans. Sir Hamish for the first time said there would definitely be a surplus this year instead of the $3.36 billion deficit he projected in his March Budget speech. "There is going to be a surplus but I am not embarrassed by that. I am only embarrassed if we seriously underspend on public works," he said. Underspending by about $6 billion that occurred the previous financial year was unlikely to be repeated. Based on share transactions volume, the government income from the stock market is expected to be several billions bigger than the $9 billion forecast in March. Sir Hamish noted that mortgage lending by the banks had grown by about 15 percent, while property prices rose by 20 percent. But he stressed that the Government would continue the guideline of keeping the growth of public expenditure in line with the growth of the economy. "I don't think we should get too much in the frame of mind that simply because we have a surplus we can, or should, spend it," Sir Hamish said. Hong Kong finished with a $22 billion surplus for the last financial year and the expectation of another this year has prompted suggestions that the territory can afford to pump much more money into the airport plan than the $16.6 billion capital injection envisaged in the first financial package. But the Financial Secretary said affordability was a separate question from how much money was desirable to pump into the project. "I can't deny that if the reserves are better, we have more choices--whether it is to build other infrastructure projects or pump more money into the airport or anything else. It's just a statement of fact," he said.
