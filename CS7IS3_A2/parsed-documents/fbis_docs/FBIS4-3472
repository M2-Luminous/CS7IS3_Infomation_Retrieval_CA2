And profits grew faster than sales, according to the city's Economic Development Bureau. "This indicates that enterprises are operating efficiently," the bureau said. It is the first time for Shenzhen's industrial output value to exceed 10 billion yuan ($1.15 billion). And foreign-funded enterprises had a good start to the year. Their output rose by 43 per cent over the same period last year to reach 9.1 billion yuan ($1.1 billion). But the city's first-quarter growth rate of 33.9 per cent was down on previous years. And it was 5.7 per cent below that of the province as a whole during January and February. The city had previously led the province's economic boom. Insufficient funds and the rising cost of bank loans have dampened growth, city economists said. Raw materials, price hikes, and exchange rate fluctuations have also led to higher production costs. The city urged effective handling of these problems in a bid to maintain swift economic development. Foreign-funded firm exports reached more than 5.8 billion yuan ($682 million), going up by 14.2 per cent over the same period last year. First-quarter growth rate in the past four years has fallen from 49.2 per cent to 43.1 per cent to 37.9 per cent to 34.7 per cent.
