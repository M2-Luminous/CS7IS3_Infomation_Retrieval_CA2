[Begin Yi recording] A relevant authority of the North Korean mission to the United Nations said today that North Korea is willing to resume negotiations -- which are suspended at present -- with the United States if the ROK-U.S. joint military exercise is suspended and if the United States confirms to North Korea that it will resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula through dialogue. Japan's KYODO NEWS AGENCY reported: The North Korean authority expects negotiations with the United States to be resumed. Also, it reported that the authority said that North Korea would accept the additional inspections demanded by the International Atomic Energy Agency when the U.S.-North Korean high-level talks are held. The news agency reported: Such remarks by the North Korean authority seem to show that North Korea is intending to avoid the strong steps, including economic sanctions, by continuing dialogue with the United States. Also, Japan's SISA NEWS AGENCY reported that the United States had decided to immediately send U.S. Secretary of Defense Perry to the ROK and Japan on 17 April to discuss the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.
