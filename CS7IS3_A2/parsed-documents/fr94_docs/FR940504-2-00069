FR940504-2-00069 FR940504-2-00059 [Finance Docket No. 32481] GWI Switching Services, L.P. Operation Exemption; Rail Lines of Southern Pacific Transportation Company GWI Switching Services, L.P. (GWISS), whose general partner is noncarrier GWI Dayton, Inc., has filed a notice of exemption to operate a rail car storage yard owned by CMC Railroad I Ltd. (CMC), and to operate under incidental trackage rights over a rail owned by Southern Pacific Transportation Company (SP) between CMC's yard and SP's rail yard in the vicinity of Dayton, TX. SP's rail car storage yard is located at Lafayette Main Line SP milepost 328.0; CMC's rail car storage has entrance connections at Baytown Branch SP mileposts 2.0 and 3.3. The incidental trackage rights cover the rail line between the two rail yards from the Baytown Branch SP milepost 5.0 to Baytown Branch SP milepost 0.0, which is also Lafayette Main Line SP milepost 327.8, and then from that point to the entrance to the SP yard at Lafayette Main Line SP milepost 328.0. The proposed transaction was expected to be consummated on or after April 5, 1994. 1 1 Under 49 CFR 1150.32(b), a notice of exemption does not become effective until 7 days after filling. Here, because the notice was not filed until March 29, 1994, consummation should not have taken place until on or after April 5, 1994. Applicant's verified notice of exemption states that consummation is scheduled for on or about April 4, 1994, or immediate following the effective date of the notice, whichever is later. This proceeding is related to Finance Docket No. 32482, Genesee and Wyoming Industries, Inc._Continuance in Control Exemption_GWI Switching Services, L.P., wherein Genesee and Wyoming Industries, Inc., has concurrently filed a notice of exemption under 1180.2(d)(2) to continue in control of GWISS and eight other class III rail carriers 2 when GWISS becomes a class III rail carrier upon consummation of the transaction described in this notice. 3 2 Allegheny & Eastern Railroad, Inc., Bradford Industrial Rail, Inc., Buffalo & Pittsburgh Railroad, Inc., Dansville and Mount Morris Railroad Company, Genesee and Wyoming Railroad Company, Louisiana & Delta Railroad, Inc., Rochester & Southern Railroad, Inc., and Willamette & Pacific Railroad, Inc. 3 Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers (BLE) has filed a petition to reject the notices of exemption and the United Transportation Union (UTU) has filed a petition to revoke the notices of exemption and a motion to stay the transaction. BLE argues that the notices should be rejected because the Commission does not have jurisdiction over the transaction in Finance Docket No. 32481, as it involves yard operations which are exempt under 49 U.S.C. 10907 and not operations over a line of railroad under 49 U.S.C. 10901 and 49 CFR 1150.1. UTU argues that the exemption in Finance Docket No. 32481 should be revoked, alleging that this is a sham transaction to avoid Commission regulation and labor protective conditions under 49 U.S.C. 11343. These issues will be addressed in a separate decision. Any comments must be filed with the Commission and served on: James B. Gray, Jr., 700 Midtown Tower, Rochester, New York, NY 14604. This notice is filed under 49 CFR 1150.31. If the notice contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void ab initio. Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke will not automatically stay the transaction. Decided: April 28, 1994. By the Commission, David M. Konschnik, Director, Office of Proceedings. Sidney L. Strickland, Jr., Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;10692 Filed 5&hyph;3&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7035&hyph;01&hyph;P
