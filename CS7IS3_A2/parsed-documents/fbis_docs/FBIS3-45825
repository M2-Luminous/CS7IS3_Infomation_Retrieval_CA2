The prosperity along the coast and the development in the interior has inevitably been accompanied by massive migration. Even though this type of movement has been relatively well organized in some localities, generally speaking, it is still in a disorderly state. The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee proposed building a labor market. How can we help the building of the rural labor market proceed in a healthy manner and enable the rural work force to move onto the normal and orderly track? I recently interviewed Vice Labor Minister Zhu Jiazhen on this issue. The Job Problem Existing in the Rural Areas is a Necessary Element of the Market Economy Zhu Jiazhen thought that our country had already established a rudimentary labor market, which is nevertheless still in its initial stage of growth. The growth of such a market is not proceeding at the same rate in different regions and enterprises. Particularly in the vast rural areas, the building of labor market has just begun. For more than four decades, the state basically has not thought about the problem of jobs for the surplus rural labor force. Listing the rural labor force as part of the unified resources of the labor force in society when pondering policy decisions is a thing which has emerged only in the past few years. It is also a requirement for the development of the market economy. He said that, in fact, our country's rural labor force currently stands at 450 million people, 74 percent of the total labor force in society. There are approximately 1.4 billion mu of farmland in rural areas throughout the country, as well as some reserve land resources. According to a comprehensive analysis based on the current level of agricultural productive forces in our country, these lands can be operated well by 200 million laborers at most. In recent years, along with the development of secondary and tertiary industries, such as township and town enterprises in rural areas, approximately 110 million rural laborers have been absorbed, but there are still 100 million surplus laborers who have nothing to do. Most of these people live in the major grain- and cotton- producing areas and the economically undeveloped areas in central and western China. If this surplus labor force is not organized and guided to move in a steady and orderly manner, the contradiction between many people and little land will intensify, and this will seriously hinder the broad masses of peasants from improving their living conditions. Inevitably, there will by many problems. Our country's task of shifting the rural labor force is still very difficult, however, and the duty of building a rural labor market is even more arduous. Judged from our country's current development speed and analyzing according to prevalent international practices, the task of reasonably shifting the large number of surplus rural labor force cannot be accomplished in five or 10 years; it is a huge project which transcends the centuries. Attention Must Be Paid to the Difficulties Caused When Rural Laborers Seek Jobs in Other Localities In discussing the difficulties and problems associated with building the rural labor market, Vice Minister Zhu Jiazhen thought that first, the system of providing employment services for the surplus rural labor force must be perfected. For various reasons, many laborers are still not included in the service network; quick access to information is not available; the avenues for providing services cannot meet the demand; some localities are still characterized by the tendency of resorting to administrative measures; and some localities lack a rational structure. Second, there are no venues for training the rural labor force, and, even though some localities provide such vocational training, they cannot do so on a regular basis, and other corresponding service systems fail to catch up. Take the problem of insurance in rural areas as an example; some insurance systems are based on households and have yet to be expanded to include individual laborers. In addition, various services, which face the market, lack the necessary funds and policy support, to the extent that the service methods of market service systems are still in the primitive state of oral introduction and that corresponding file management and information processing systems have not been established. This does not meet the development needs of the labor market. As for the means of macro regulation and control, effective ways of meeting the needs of the labor market have yet to take shape, and macro regulation and control is lagging behind the cultivation and development of the labor market. The above-mentioned problems make the outward migration of the rural labor force chaotic and disorderly; in particular, before and after every spring festival, large "tides of laborers" take shape, concentrate, and flow, causing great pressure on railways, stations, piers, and other modes of transportation, having repercussions on cities and bringing about a series of social problems. Individual job seekers also suffer serious losses. Zhu Jiazhen thought that the phenomenon of "tides of laborers" reflects inadequate job opportunities in the rural areas, the inability of the current employment management system to cope, and especially the lagging behind of the building of the labor market in the rural areas. Trends show that, for a certain time to come, transregional rural labor migration will expand even further. Therefore, when we uphold the principle of developing local economies to enable a large number of laborers to change jobs in their own localities, we must earnestly improve labor market mechanisms and perfect market regulations, order, and corresponding management, service, regulatory, and control means, to make the transregional flow of labor force an orderly one. This will remove the negative effects of the "tides of laborers" and will open up smooth channels for rural laborers seeking jobs in other localities. Establish a New System of Employment and Implement the Plan for Coordinating Employment in Urban and Rural Areas In discussing the goal of building the rural labor market, Zhu Jiazhen pointed out that the country must form a basic system to manage the transregional migration of labor as it adapts to the market economy -- as well as a market information system and a service network -- to enable the major regions with larger scales of inward and outward rural labor flows to achieve an orderly migration. The outward flow should be organized, the inward flow should be managed, the flow itself should be serviced. There should be means of regulation and control, as well as diverting measures in case of emergency. In order to improve and perfect the rural labor market, the Labor Ministry recently proposed a three-year first-phase "plan to coordinate employment in the urban and rural areas." The plan will be implemented nationwide, and it targets the major areas with inward and outward labor flows, including the developed coastal areas such as Guangdong, Fujian, Shandong, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu and the municipalities of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai; it also targets those areas with relatively large volumes of outward labor flows, such as Sichuan, Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Jiangxi, Henan, Hebei, and Gansu. According to Vice Minister Zhu, in this project, efforts will first be made to sum up and promote Guangdong Province's experience in coordinating with the work force-exporting provinces in order to divert the "tides of laborers." Efforts will also be made to grasp the work in diverting laborers during the spring festival of 1994, and a preliminary set of plans and emergency measures will be formulated to divert the "tides of laborers." The second step is to establish labor market regulations and a system for managing the employment of outside laborers in the major work force-importing areas and to establish a system registering job seekers who leave the work force-exporting areas for other localities. A nationwide unified basic system will be established on this base. Third, to establish a labor market information exchange center in Guangdong, accomplish the building of a labor market information exchange center incorporating the three major regions of south, east, and north China, and form a system to collect, handle, and disseminate labor market information centering on various major work force- importing areas. The urban and rural employment service agencies in the work force-importing areas should thoroughly open up to the rural labor force, and the development of urban and rural employment service agencies and various kinds of nongovernmental service organizations should be promoted. By 1996, the key areas should be able to basically ensure orderly labor flows. Thereafter, the scope of implementation should expand from the key areas to the entire country, so as to thoroughly implement the basic transregional labor migration system.
