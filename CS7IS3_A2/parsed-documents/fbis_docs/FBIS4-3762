FBIS4-3762 "drchi079_v_94004" FBIS-CHI-94-079 Daily Report 22 Apr 1994 Taiwan Taiwan Lawmaker Accuses PLA of Involvement Taiwan Lawmaker Accuses PLA of Involvement OW2304044094 Taipei Voice of Free China in English 0200 GMT 22 Apr 94 OW2304044094 Taipei Voice of Free China English BFN [From the "News" program] [Text] About eight to 10 renegade soldiers of the People's Liberation Army [PLA] were involved in the mass murder of 24 Taiwan tourists last month and the three mainland civilians arrested were just scapegoats, lawmakers quoted Taiwan's top intelligence officials as saying. Lawmaker Chen Shui-pien quoted National Security Bureau Director (Yin Chung-wen) as saying that their intelligence sources in the Mainland showed that PLA soldiers were behind the Chientao [Qiandao] lake murder. From the beginning of the incident, the National Security Bureau sources indicated that it was a premeditated robbery and murder case, not an accident as earlier claimed by Chechiang [Zhejiang] authorities, the lawmaker said. Mainland authorities on Sunday [17 April] announced the arrest of three civilian suspects, all natives of Chechiang, on charges of murder, robbery, and arson but they gave few details about them or the evidence against the suspects. In Peking [Beijing] on Wednesday [20 April], an Mainland Foreign Ministry spokesman categorically denied Taiwan's allegation of army involvement in this pleasure boat arson.
