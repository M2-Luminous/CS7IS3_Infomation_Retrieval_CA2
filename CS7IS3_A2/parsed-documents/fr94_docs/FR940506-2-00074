FR940506-2-00074 FR940506-2-00047 Analysis of Consent Order To Aid Public Comment The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement, subject to final approval, to a proposed consent order from respondents LePage's, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation, and LP Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation. The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement and take other appropriate action, or make final the agreement's proposed order. This matter concerns the labeling and advertising of LePage's Biodegradable Transparent Tape. The Commission's complaint in this matter alleges that LePage's Biodegradable Transparent Tape is a cellophane tape made from wood pulp and adhesive material; that the retail tape product is sold with a hard clear non-foam polystyrene plastic dispenser that does not identify the type(s) of plastic resin from which it is made; and that the tape and dispenser are attached to a non-corrugated paperboard or cardboard backcard. The complaint charges that the respondents represented without substantiation that LePage's Biodegradable Transparent Tape will completely break down and return to nature_ i.e., decompose into elements found in nature_within a reasonably short period of time after customary disposal and that compared to other transparent tape, LePage's Biodegradable Transparent Tape offers a significant environmental benefit after customary disposal. The complaint further charges that the respondents falsely represented that the plastic tape dispenser and paperboard backcard of LePage's Biodegradable Transparent Tape are recyclable. In fact, the complaint alleges, the plastic tape dispenser and the paperboard package are not recyclable, because there are only a few collection facilities nationwide that will accept the non-foam polystyrene tape dispenser or the non-corrugated paperboard or cardboard backcard for recycling. The proposed consent order contains provisions designed to remedy the violations charged and to prevent the respondents from engaging in similar acts and practices in the future. Part I of the proposed order requires that the respondents cease and desist from representing, in any manner, directly or by implication, that any of their products or packages are degradable, biodegradable, or photodegradable, or more specifically through the use of such terms or similar terms that any such product or package offers any environmental benefits when consumers dispose of it as trash that is buried in a sanitary landfill, unless at the time of making such representation, the respondents possess and rely upon competent and reliable scientific evidence that substantiates such representation. Part II of the proposed order requires that the respondents cease and desist from misrepresenting, in any manner, directly or by implication, with respect to any product or package the extent to which it is capable of being recycled or to which recycling collection programs are available. Part II also contains a provision that allows the respondents to advertise non-foam polystyrene and non-corrugated paperboard and cardboard products or packages as recyclable without violating Part II of the order. The respondents may do so if they truthfully represent that such products or packages are capable of being recycled; disclose clearly, prominently and in close proximity to such claim (a) that such product or package is recyclable in the few communities with recycling collection programs for non-foam polystyrene or for non-corrugated paperboard or cardborad; or (b) the approximate number of U.S. communities with recycling collection programs for such product or package; or (c) the approximate percentage of U.S. population to which recycling collection programs for such product or package are available; and in addition, in the case of any non-foam polystyrene product or package, such product or package itself bears a clear identification of the specific plastic resin(s) from which it is made. Part III of the proposed order provides that if the respondents represent in advertising or labeling that any product or package offers any environmental benefit, they must have a reasonable basis consisting of competent and reliable evidence, which when appropriate must be competent and reliable scientific evidence, that substantiates the claims. The proposed order also requires the respondents to maintain materials relied upon to substantiate the claims covered by the order, to distribute copies of the order to certain company officials, to notify the Commission of any changes in corporate structure that might affect compliance with the order, and to file one or more reports detailing compliance with the order. The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order. It is not intended to constitute an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms. Donald S. Clark, Secretary.
