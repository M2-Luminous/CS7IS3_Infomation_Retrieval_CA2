FR940725-0-00163 FR940725-0-00019 NFPA (Ex. 6&hyph;10) agreed, and noted that, NFPA strongly supports the inclusion of a requirement that in addition to atmospheric tests the shipyard competent person should also be required to conduct a physical examination of the spaces and associated pipelines. NFPA 306, 2&hyph;1 requires the Marine Chemist to conduct a physical inspection and to conduct tests within the spaces. For high flash point, low vapor pressure products such as diesel, a test for flammable or combustible vapors is not sufficient, since at atmospheric temperatures there are not enough vapors being evolved for the combustible gas indicator to detect. It is essential that physical inspections be conducted. The Navy's Sea Systems Command (Ex. 6&hyph;12) commented, The purpose of the follow-up check is to ensure conditions have not deteriorated. The requirement [for a physical inspection] is endorsed for hot work rechecks. Similarly, the Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard commented, Because it is important for a Marine Chemist to make such examinations, it is even more important that the competent person also conducts such examinations. By making a physical examination of the confined space the competent person understands the tank conditions better, and it helps to stress the importance of looking for other potential problems in a confined space. For example, paraffinic residues on bulkheads are sometimes partially cleaned in areas where minor welding jobs will be done on the opposite side of the bulkhead (in the adjacent space). Welders are unable to determine if they are welding outside the cleaned area, but the competent person would have the opportunity to detect a problem. The Marine Chemist Association (Ex. 6&hyph;34) commented, The shipyard competent person should definitely conduct physical examinations of the interior of tanks and pipelines. Instrumentation used to test the atmosphere of these structures do not always reveal the presence of flammable or combustible materials. If these persons are required to maintain safe conditions in enclosed and confined spaced they must evaluate conditions other than atmosphere. Northwest Marine Chemist (Ex. 6&hyph;18) asserted that, There is no way to properly determine the condition of a space without physically entering. Independent Testing and Consulting, Inc. (Ex. 6&hyph;24) commented, The shipyard competent person should be required to conduct a physical examination of the tank (provided it is safe to enter) and make any necessary tests of piping provided that the piping has been approved for hot work on the Marine Chemists certificate. Chemical Engineering Service, Inc. (Ex. 6&hyph;25A) commented, The original intent for the position of shipyard competent person was to detect conditions where, for some reason, there was a decrease in oxygen or an accumulation of combustible gas. Left undetected, these situations could develop into acute hazards for shipyard personnel. While these conditions are relatively rare, their occurrence could easily lead to catastrophic loss of life and property. A much more chronic problem is fire hazards in the shipyard resulting from the introduction of flammable or combustible material subsequent to the initial internal inspection for hot work. This could be the result of leaking piping, accidental or intentional contamination, or gradual buildup of trash and other combustible materials. With the exception of liquids with a reasonably high vapor pressure, these fairly common conditions can only be detected with an internal inspection. If it is the intent of OSHA to utilize the shipyard competent person to control fire hazards in addition to atmospheric hazards, internal inspection of all spaces must be required. Atlantic Environmental & Marine Services (Ex. 6&hyph;27) commented, *␣*␣* Shipyard Competent Persons should be required to conduct an on-site survey of tanks and pipelines when making follow up inspections. The U.S. Navy's Environmental Health Center (Ex. 6&hyph;31) commented, Yes, the shipyard competent person should be required to conduct a physical examination of the tank and pipelines when making a follow-up inspection. The current foundation of the NAVSEA Technical Manual lists a requirement in Section 23.4 of reference (c) for conducting a physical examination of the tank and pipelines upon reinspection. The condition for entry must be defined, such as, use of ventilation, PPE, non-sparking tools, and whether there is to be continuous or periodic testing. Pacific Marine Testing (Ex. 6&hyph;33) commented, The shipyard competent person, when trained properly by a sanctioned training such as the one developed and presented by NFPA and its supporters, is taught to conduct a physical examination of the tank and pipelines when making a follow-up inspection. A determination of a safe condition can be made only when the shipyard competent person has conducted a physical examination. Only the Shipbuilders Council of America (Ex. 6&hyph;3, pg. 3) and the Newport News Shipbuilding (Ex. 6&hyph;6, pg. 4) urged OSHA to allow a qualified person to decide whether a physical examination is necessary. The qualified person should not be required to conduct a full physical examination of the tank and pipelines when making a follow-up inspection. . . . the qualified person should be given appropriate flexibility when making this determination based on all available data, including a physical inspection, where necessary. OSHA agrees with the majority of commenters on this issue and has concluded that, because of changing conditions, appropriate retesting must include a physical inspection of a tank or pipelines for leaks or other build-ups of hazardous substance within a certified space. Physical inspection of a space is an integral part of an effective follow-up inspection or monitoring program. For example, an actual physical examination is crucial in eliminating housekeeping debris that could be fire hazards such as rags, insulation, or heavy oil residues in the tank deep spot. Therefore, OSHA is requiring physical inspections be conducted during follow-up inspections of tested spaces.
