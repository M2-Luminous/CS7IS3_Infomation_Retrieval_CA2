He is Carlton "Carly" Dunkley, 37, businessman and former policeman of Westwood Apartments, Mandeville, Manchester, police sources say. The offences were alleged to have been committed in September when two drums of what was manifested as limestone, were taken to the Norman Manley International Airport in Kingston to be air-freighted to Miami, Florida. However when the drums were opened they were found to contain 600 lbs. of compressed ganja, wrapped in several packages. Friday morning, Narcotics Division agents raided Mr. Dunkley's apartment and arrested him on the three charges. He is being held in custody to be taken before the Kingston RM Court at Sutton Street tomorrow.
