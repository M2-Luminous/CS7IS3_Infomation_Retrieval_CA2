In a television news program of ASAHI National Broadcasting (ASAHI TV), Kanda said,"at the present stage, (the government) has been making a study on preparedness for various situations." The defense agency chief said, however, that the government has not yet reached a political decision on the matter. Kanda was quoted as saying, "the government has not yet decided to implement (emergency legislative arrangements)." Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa expressed a positive stance on the formulation of emergency legislative arrangements, during the same TV news show. Kakizawa commented that the Foreign Ministry will hold comprehensive talks on the matter with the Defense Agency, when he was asked if there is disagreement on the issue among cabinet ministers. In another ASAHI TV program Sunday, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai expressed reservations about the wisdom of early Japanese action in response to North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons programs, saying Japan is still hopeful that a diplomatic solution can be achieved. Such legislative measures apparently include revision of the Self-Defense Forces Law, which enables SDF planes to carry Japanese citizens residing overseas in an emergency. Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata told reporters Monday morning that he has not received any report by government representatives on the emergency legislative measure preparations. Hata said the government seems to be making a study (of the matter). But he added that he has not yet received any report on the issue. Hata made the remarks when he was asked about the reported preparation of emergency legislative arrangements disclosed by Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi kumagai in the Sunday TV program. A government source on Monday morning said, "the government has completed its preparations of security emergency legislative arrangements, but the government will not submit drafts to the diet." The source said that the government wants to avoid triggering a controversy, mindful of the fact that the Social Democratic Party [Social Democratic Party of Japan], which was the largest group in the former coalition, opposes such legislative measures.
