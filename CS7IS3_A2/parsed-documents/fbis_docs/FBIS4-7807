The margin of error linked to the size of the sample is plus or minus 2 percent. The survey establishes that the proportion of people voting for the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] has continued to increase among those who selected a party. The Independent Smallholders Party [FKGP] and the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] are coming increasingly closer to the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], which has lost further "votes." The MDF leads the list of unpopular parties, with a third of people who have an opinion saying that they would by no means vote for this party. The MDF is followed by the FKGP and the MSZP. Two-fifths of people who tried to predict the final result of the elections think that the MSZP will receive the most votes at the May parliamentary elections. Significantly fewer people give a winning chance to the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] or the MDF, which follow the MSZP. In the middle of March 1994, 24 percent of the population did not know which party they would vote for "if elections were held next Sunday in Hungary"; a tenth said that they would not vote, and 6 percent refused to answer this question. The uncertain people who do not (yet) know whom they would vote for are more common among women (28 percent) than among men (20 percent), and more among the over-60's (31 percent) and people with the least education (39 percent) than younger people (22 percent) and people who have at least completed eight years at school. Within this last group, the differences between the various educational levels are negligible because 23 percent of people with eight years of education and 20 percent of people with higher education do not know who to vote for. Some 61 percent of the population has party preferences. Some 31 percent of people who chose a party would vote for the MSZP, 4 percent more than in the previous month. The Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] and the SZDSZ are in second and third places with near equal support (15 and 14 percent). Since the end of February, the MDF has lost 3 percent, and at the time of the survey, it has the confidence of 10 percent of potential voters. The biggest governing party is closely followed by the FKGP (9 percent) and the KDNP (8 percent), and 12 percent would vote for other parties. Of these last ones, none would reach the necessary minimum to get into Parliament. Gallup measures the certainty of participating in the voting on a scale of seven. In the middle of March, 52 percent of respondents said that "it is very certain that they would vote next Sunday." However, within these "certain" voters, 18 percent do not yet know which party to support. Out of those who do know, 35 percent would choose the Socialists and 15 percent the Free Democrats. The Fidesz and the MDF would be supported at almost the same level (12 and 11 percent respectively). The Smallholders would receive 8 percent, the Christian Democrats 7 percent, and other parties 12 percent. If we examine the sympathizers of the various parties according to what proportion of them are "very certain" in participating in the elections, we have the following result: The MSZP's and the SZDSZ's potential voters are most determined about their intention to participate. Seventy-three percent of the former and 71 percent of the latter are very certain that they would vote. The MDF follows this line with 67 percent, then the FKGP (60 percent) and the KDNP (60 percent) with almost the same percentage. Half (49 percent) of the Fidesz's voters are determined that they would go to vote "next Sunday." The potential voters of the various parties also differ in how certain they are that they would vote for the currently preferred party "in the first round of the May parliamentary elections." Almost half (47 percent) of all people who selected a party are "very certain" about this: They would vote for the party they now sympathize with. A third (34 percent) of them are slightly less certain, they are "only" certain about this, and a fifth (18 percent) are "uncertain." Socialist sympathizers are most determined; 60 percent of the party's current supporters are "very certain" that their opinion will not change before the elections. Half of the Smallholder (51 percent) and Hungarian Democratic (48 percent) voters are also determined, and 42 percent of the KDNP's and SZDSZ's voters each are very certain on this issue. Of the parliamentary parties, the Fidesz again is the last: A third (32 percent) of their current supporters are very certain that they would vote for this party, but almost as many (27 percent) are rather uncertain. The survey also included the examination of secondary party preferences. People who chose a party were also asked "if, apart from this, is there another party that you would be happy to vote for?" and 29 percent of those questioned said that there is no such part and 7 percent said that they did not know. Out of those who named a party, the Fidesz was mentioned most frequently (22 percent), followed by the SZDSZ (18 percent). The rest were as follows: MSZP 13, KDNP 10, MDF 8, and FKGP 7 percent. A fifth (22 percent) of those who replied mentioned other parties, most of them the Entrepreneurs' Party (5 percent), the Republic Party (3 percent), and the Workers' Party (2 percent). The individual candidates of the various parties cannot expect the same level of support as their parties. Naturally, in the case of all parties, the majority of people would "certainly" vote for the individual candidate of the preferred party, but the deviations are noteworthy. At least seven-tenths of the Socialist, Free Democrat, and Smallholder voters are certain (75, 72, and 70 percent) that they would vote for their party's list as well as its individual candidates. In the case of the MDF and the KDNP, 65 and 63 percent of people hold this view. Again, the Fidesz is the last, 59 percent of its potential voters would also vote for the party's individual candidates. Examining antagonistic feelings to parties, Gallup asked people if "there is a party that they would definitely not vote for." Two-thirds (65 percent) of those surveyed selected a party from the list of 15 parties. The MDF was mentioned most often (33 percent), followed by the FKGP (21 percent). For a tenth (12 percent) of those who selected a party, the MSZP is out of the question, and almost as many reject the Workers' Party (9 percent) and the Hungarian Justice and Life Party [MIEP] (9 percent). Five percent would definitely not vote for the Fidesz, and 3 percent each for the SZDSZ and the KDNP. Half (52 percent) of the people who do not have a party preference also said "I do not know" to this question. Of the other half, the order of parties disliked is the same as above: MDF 28, FKGP 25, MSZP 14, MIEP 9, and Workers' Party 8 percent. Some 41 percent of respondents did not venture to predict the final outcome -- which party will receive the most votes -- of the elections. The vast majority of those who made a prediction named the MSZP (40 percent). Twenty-two percent predicted victory for the SZDSZ, and 17 percent for the MDF. The Fidesz is expected by 9 percent as winner, the FKGP by 6 percent, and the KDNP by 3 percent. This result is somewhat different when the question applies to "your electoral district." In this case, half (50 percent) the population would not make a prediction. Out of those who did, 31 percent selected the MSZP as winner, 20 percent the SZDSZ, 14 percent the FKGP, and 12 percent the MDF. Some 8 percent expect the Fidesz and 7 percent the KDNP to be winners in their electoral district.
