SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This notice has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866 and Departmental Regulation 1512&hyph;1 and has been determined not to be a significant regulatory action since it will not have any of the significant effects specified in that order. Furthermore, to the extent, if any, that the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601) apply to this notice, the Administrator, Foreign Agricultural Service, hereby certifies that this notice will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The adjustment of the country of origin from which the quota article specified herein may be entered does not restrict the ability of importers to import this quota article, but only permits 1,750,000 kilograms of the article allocated to Australia to be imported from certain other countries. Notice Subchapter IV of chapter 99 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) contains import limitations imposed on certain dairy products, including certain chocolate crumb. U.S. note 3(a)(iii) of subchapter IV of chapter 99 of the HTS permits the reallocation of the quota quantity of a dairy article listed in chapter 99 among the countries of origin specified for a given article if it is determined that the quota quantity assigned to a particular country is not likely to be entered from that country within a given calendar year. I hereby determine that it is not likely that 1,750,000 kilograms of chocolate crumb containing over 5.5 percent butterfat specified in HTS subheading 9904.10.63 for Australia will be entered from that country during calendar year 1994.
