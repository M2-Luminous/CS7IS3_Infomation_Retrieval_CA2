During the meeting, Nazarbayev expressed gratitude for the U.S. role in helping convert his country's military installations into civilian use. He also welcomed the U.S.-Russia accord, which compensates Kazakhstan for its uranium, an essential material for making strategic missiles. Perry and Kazakhstani Defense Minister Sagadat Nurmagambetov signed an agreement today on military conversion, under which the U.S. will grant another 15 million U.S. dollars to Kazakhstan, raising the amount of promised aid for this purpose to 70 million dollars. The U.S. is invited to participate in the privatization of the defense industry in Kazakhstan and the conversion of military establishments into civil enterprises. At a brief press conference after the signing ceremony, Nurmagambetov told reporters that the two sides have discussed wide-ranging military cooperation, but there is no immediate accord in sight. Liaison will soon be established, however, to expand military cooperation, he added. William Perry, on a week-long visit to four former Soviet republics, will next go to Ukraine and Belarus after visiting a renowned spaceflight center in Kazakhstan tomorrow.
