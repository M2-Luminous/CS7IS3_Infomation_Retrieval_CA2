FR940412-2-00089 FR940412-2-00068 Issuance of Proposed Decision and Order for Week of March 14 Through March 18, 1994 During the week of March 14 through March 18, 1994 the proposed decision and order summarized below was issued by the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Department of Energy with regard to an application for exception. Under the procedural regulations that apply to exception proceedings (10 CFR part 205, subpart D), any person who will be aggrieved by the issuance of a proposed decision and order in final form may file a written notice of objection within ten days of service. For purposes of the procedural regulations, the date of service of notice is deemed to be the date of publication of this Notice or the date an aggrieved person receives actual notice, whichever occurs first. The procedural regulations provide that an aggrieved party who fails to file a Notice of Objection within the time period specified in the regulations will be deemed to consent to the issuance of the proposed decision and order in final form. An aggrieved party who wishes to contest a determination made in a proposed decision and order must also file a detailed statement of objections within 30 days of the date of service of the proposed decision and order. In the statement of objections, the aggrieved party must specify each issue of fact or law that it intends to contest in any further proceeding involving the exception matter. Copies of the full text of this proposed decision and order are available in the Public Reference Room of the Office of Hearings and Appeals, room 1E&hyph;234, Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20585, Monday through Friday, between the hours of 1 p.m. and 5 p.m., except federal holidays. Dated: April 6, 1994. George B. Breznay, Director, Office of Hearings and Appeals. Midstream Fuel Service, Inc., Mobile, Alabama, Lee&hyph;0083, Reporting Requirements Midstream Fuel Service, Inc. (Midstream) filed an Application for Exception from the provision of filing Form EIA&hyph;782B, entitled ``Resellers'/Retailers' Monthly Petroleum Product Sales Report.'' The exception request, if granted, would permit Midstream to be exempted from filing Form EIA&hyph;782B. In considering the request, the DOE found that the firm was suffering a gross inequity due to the maternity leave of two of the firm's employees. On March 15, 1994, the DOE issued a Proposed Decision and Order which determined that the exception request be granted in part and that Midstream should be granted an extension of time until May 1994 in which to file the forms due between February 1, 1994, and May 1, 1994.
