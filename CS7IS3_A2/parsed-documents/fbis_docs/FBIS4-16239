Niyazov said the history which has repeatedly made the concept of such a union the subject of many discussions proves this point of view. "This idea has been repeatedly considered and rejected by the Russians as fatal for the nation since 1861," Niyazov added. It is not hard to predict the fate of another such idea, not a new one, which runs counter to the current processes of national revival in independent states, he said. At the same time, he warned against dashing from one idea or proposal to another, because each may have a grain of common sense. Haste and extremes are most dangerous for the Commonwealth of Independent States now, he said. The Turkmen leader praised Russian-Turkmen relations, saying he consideres them as a priority in his policy.
