While attending a cocktail party hosted by the Chinese General Commercial Chamber to mark the spring festival, Zhu Yucheng indicated to reporters that this behavior by the British side would injure the overall interests of Hong Kong residents and result in burdening Hong Kong's economy, so Hong Kong residents must heighten their vigilance against it. Zhu Yucheng said that the crux to the financial arrangements for the new airport was that the British side all along had wanted to spend money to the maximum, and to leave the debts incurred to the future special administrative region [SAR] government. The Sino-British Memorandum of Understanding on the New Airport and Related Issues already has stipulated explicitly that the debts incurred by the 10 core projects in building the new airport should not exceed HK$5 billion, but the British side all along has tried its best to break through this ceiling, and the financial plans it set out always aimed at leaving the financial burden to the SAR government. The fourth set of financial plans put forward by the British side continued to show that it wanted to shift HK$23 billion in debts onto the SAR government. Zhu Yucheng indicated that the British Hong Kong Government regarded the loans made by Hong Kong Airport Administration and MTR Company, which were spent in building the new airport, as non-governmental debts, but that was not convincing because both the aforesaid organizations are fully owned by the British Hong Kong Government, which is the sole shareholder in those two organizations. Naturally, the Hong Kong Government must bear responsibility for its debts. In actual fact, with the transfer of government in 1997, the tremendous sum of debts of those two organizations inevitably will result in pressure on Hong Kong's finances, which will be shifted onto the future SAR government. Beyond a doubt, it is none other than Hong Kong's taxpayers who will bear the burden in the final analysis. Zhu Yucheng added that the British side had used up all its tricks in making arrangements for use of the reclaimed land in the Chek Lap Kok project, in an attempt to profit by disturbances, while seizing the power to approve 100 hectares of land exclusively. Regarding the issue of selling plots of land along the railway, likewise, the British side excluded them from the annual plan for land approval, and did its best to sell land for cash.
