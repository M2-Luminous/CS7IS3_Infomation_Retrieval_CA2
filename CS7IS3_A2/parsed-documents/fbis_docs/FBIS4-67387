That we did not freeze to death is largely thanks to the concerted work of the AES [nuclear power station] collectives. In those months, they accounted for 40 percent of the total electricity produced in Ukraine. All together over the last year, AES's produced 75,238 million kilowatt/hours, or 33 percent of the total amount of electricity. Moreover, it costs half of that produced by conventional power stations. These figures were made public at a briefing held by the chairman of Ukraine's State Committee for Atomic Energy, Mykhaylo Umanets. Nuclear Power Engineering "We are pleased with the result," said Mykhaylo Umanets. "We have not let the country down, and this is what matters. Are we satisfied with the quality of our work? Safe operation is our quality. Accidents were prevented from happening. It is true that there were 11 incidents, but, in accordance with the international scale of nuclear and radiation safety, they were rated as incidents of first and second degrees, which do not have in any unexpected consequences." Mykhaylo Panteliyovych also regards the cancellation of the moratorium on the building of new power units, something that has undoubtedly opened up prospects to the industry, as a victory of common sense over political intrigue. A decision was also made to postpone the closure of the Chernobyl station. This will make it possible to prepare more thoroughly for its closure and, at the same time, have economic advantages. The station will continue to produce the electricity that we need so much for a few more years. What all of this has cost us! Quite recently, the press brought to the public's attention the desperate "SOS" by the nuclear industry, which, while selling the cheapest electricity to the state, did not have money to purchase fuel because of customers' failure to pay for the energy; it also sounded the alarm that specialists are leaving Ukraine's AES's en masse. The reason is the lack of social protection and salaries, which are lower than those in Russia. It appears that this alarm was heard. At any rate, the president issued an decree enabling nuclear specialists to resolve many of the burning problems by exporting some of the electricity. The fuel issue has also been taken off the agenda for several years. The stations will receive the fuel from Russia in exchange for nuclear warheads from strategic missiles. Considerable changes for the better have also been achieved in raising the level of the stations' operational safety. Over recent years, hundreds of specialists have received training at nuclear stations in Western countries. Recently a simulator started working at the Zaporizhzhya AES, and operators of VVR [water-water)-1,000 nuclear reactors will improve their qualifications with its help. The installation of a simulator presented to us by France will soon be completed at the Khmelnytskyy AES. Last year, for the first time, the Sevastopol Naval Institute admitted two groups of students to specialize in servicing AES's. The majority of the students are residents of towns with developed power engineering. The price we have had to pay for the moratorium will long remain a pain. Incidentally, it has not yet been determined numerically in terms of money. However, it is known that, owing to those politicians who rose high in their careers on anti-nuclear wings, we have lost 4 billion pre-inflation rubles. It is precisely such funding that Ukraine did not receive from the Union budget, after it stopped work building units that were at a high level of readiness. This moratorium has now been canceled. Some people have received political dividends from this and the state -- a headache: Where, in our budget made up of holes, can we get such astronomical sums? The sixth unit of the Zaporizhzhya AES has to be commissioned this year. The second unit of the Khmelnytskyy and the fourth of the Rivne stations must be commissioned in 1996. Nor will it be simple to fulfill this program in view of the fact that the construction and assembly collectives have, in fact, deserted the stations. Only superb specialists can and have the right to build such facilities. However, not even these problems are a matter of the greatest concern for departmental heads. Given our political situation, the lack of clarity is quite disturbing. Where are the guarantees that the new parliament will not pass a law on a new moratorium? Decisions to open or close the Chernobyl AES have been made five times. Despite everything, specialists are already looking to the future: the construction of new-generation fast-neutron power units, which are more economical and more reliable. Canadian, U.S., French, and Japanese specialists are offering their designs. We have our own scientifically substantiated concept on developing the industry under the headline of creating our own nuclear cycle in Ukraine. Of course, it is an expensive undertaking. However, it is worth the huge outlays, because not only is it economically advantageous, but also politically expedient, pointed out Mykhaylo Umanets. "At present, fuel accounts for 64 percent of the cost of the electricity produced by the nuclear stations," he reasoned. "Calculations have shown that this percentage could be halved, if we did not have to purchase that fuel abroad, considering that Ukraine is already capable of extracting and enriching uranium ore to a concentration of natural uranium. We send this ore to Russian enterprises where the fuel elements are manufactured. We also send zirconium there, from which the holders for the cassettes are made. Incidentally, Ukraine used to have a monopoly on the extraction and production of zirconium within the USSR. Since we possess it and have specialists at the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences who may ensure the scientific implementation of the project, we simply have no moral right not to use such a potential in the interests of our own state. These outlays will eventually be returned a hundredfold. Ukraine could lose its independence if it continues to receive energy from neighboring states, which often use it to put pressure on us.
