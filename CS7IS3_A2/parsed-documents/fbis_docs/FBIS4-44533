This has been attested to in the practice of economic and social development in every country of the world. A comparatively well-off standard of living is a new development stage that the Chinese people face now that the subsistence problem has been solved. It is also the ideal and the goal of the broad masses of people for improvement of their livelihood by 2000. Rural villages hold the key to the whole country's attainment of a comparatively well-off standard of living; and rise in peasant income is the key to rural villages attainment of a comparatively well-off standard of living. What is the minimum peasant income that must be attained for rural villages to have a comparatively well-off standard of living? Put another way, what is the base line for a comparatively well-off rural standard of living? This article seeks to make a preliminary analysis of the correlation between increase in peasant income and a comparatively well-off peasant standard of living, and to specify how to set a rural comparatively well-off line. Preliminary Assessment of Peasant Income Situation (1) Substantial Increase in Peasant Real Income. Within the short space of little more than a decade, peasant net per capita income has continuously increased first from 200 to 400, and then to 600 yuan. Income growth, which formerly derived primarily from farming, now comes from a combination of farming, livestock breeding and aquaculture, and from the all-around development of farming, industry, and business. Changes in production methods have spurred the development of agriculture. Outputs of principal farm products have increased. Not only do they satisfy the production and livelihood needs of the broad masses of peasants, but large surpluses greatly accelerate the commercialization of agriculture. At the same time, the broad masses of peasants have been freed from the shackles of traditional agriculture in active response to the new development of rural commodity markets. While producing grain and cotton according to national plan, they strive to open new production avenues and ways to increase income through the development of economic diversification. In 1978, peasant net per capita income was only 134 yuan; by 1980, it increased to nearly 200 yuan. This increase in peasant per capita income within two years was equal to the net increase in peasant per capita income for the entire 24 year period from 1954 to 1978. The increase from 200 to 400 yuan took only five years (1980 -1985), and the increase from 400 to 600 yuan took four years (1985-1989). In 1990, peasant net per capita income reached 686 yuan for a 2.6 fold increase over 1980. After deducting for price increases, this was an average annual 6.3 percent increase. The entire 1980s was the decade of fastest rural economic development, and it was also the decade in which peasant net per capita income increased fastest, and in which peasant living conditions improved most. Rural economic development changed the sources of income growth. In 1978, prior to rural reform, rural society's production activities were largely under leadership of people's communes and consisted primarily of the growing of staple farm crops such as grain and cotton. Rural commodity production and commodity business had no place; the peasants engaged solely in agricultural production; their net per capita income derived almost entirely from agricultural production; and the income from agricultural production derived, in turn, from the rural collectives' equal distribution. In 1978, when peasant net per capita income was 134 yuan, more than 80 percent of it came from agricultural production. Operating system reforms centering around the output-related contract responsibility system, and a series of reform policies that the state adopted in order to spur rural commodity production and commodity exchange greatly aroused the interest of the broad masses of peasants in rural commodity production and circulation. With the fairly rapid growth in gross output of farm products, rural secondary and tertiary industries also began to boom, and sources of peasant income also diversified. Now, income came not only from unified collective farming but also from family farming that the peasants did themselves. It came not only from farming, but also from secondary and tertiary industries for a change of pattern in which agricultural production and non-agricultural production were equally important. Comparison of the late 1980's with the late 1970's showed that income from uniform collective farming as a percentage of peasant net per capita income had declined from 60 to about 9 percent, and income from peasant household activities had increased from 30 to 83 percent. Income derived from agriculture fell from 81 to 63 percent; and income from other than agriculture rose from 8 to 28 percent. The portion of peasant net per capita income increase derived from other than agriculture increased markedly, rising 23 percentage points. Meanwhile, during the same period, the portion of income derived from agricultural production declined 17 percentage points. (2) Marked Widening of the Peasant Income Distribution Gap Encouraging some people to become rich first is an important policy that both the party and government have consistently advocated during the new era. This policy has played a tremendous role in encouraging "capable people" in rural villages to come forward, which had advanced development of the rural commodity economy. Accompanying economic growth has been a marked trend toward differentiation among individual peasants, peasant families, and the economy of different regions. The economic gap between one person and another, between one peasant family and another, and between one region and another has been readjusted, resources being reallocated. While adhering to unflagging implementation of plans and policies for "some people becoming rich first," one must also realize that a widening trend exists in the rural peasant income gap. 1. Widening of the income gap among different peasants. The Gini coefficient is commonly used internationally as an indicator for judging the degree of income equilibrium. The Gini coefficient's numerical value lies between 0 and 1. A numerical value of 0 means absolute balance; a numerical value of 1 means absolute imbalance. The greater the numerical value the greater the imbalance in income. State Statistical Bureau research data show that in China's rural villages, the Gini coefficient may be divided into four areas: "Below 0.2 shows high balance; 0.2-0.3 shows relative balance; 0.3-0.4 shows equitable distribution; and above 4 shows a fairly large gap." In 1980. the Gini coefficient for peasant income was 0.24; in 1985, it was 0.26; and in 1990, it rose further to 0.31. The entire 1980s was a period in which peasant income was relatively equal and developing toward rational distribution. The income gap among different peasants has changed from the former not very great difference toward marked difference. For the broad masses of peasants who have "shared poverty and wealth," and egalitarianly "eaten out of a large common pot" for so long, facing up to the present reality is rather painful. Furthermore, since an overwhelming majority of those peasants who have become rich first did so not by just growing grain and cotton, or by developing agricultural production but by developing industrial sideline occupations, by engaging in commodity circulation, or by going off to work elsewhere, this has somewhat intensified the disgruntlement of grain and cotton growing peasants. In 1990, peasant household income for the country as a whole exhibited an "inverted U" pattern. Needy households having a net per capita income of less than 300 yuan numbered 8.59 percent; households having a net per capita income of between 300 and 1,000 yuan numbered approximately 73.63 percent; and high income households having a net per capita income of more than 1,000 yuan numbered 17.78 percent. 2. Regional differences exhibited a widening trend. Natural, historical, and geographic factors produced an eastern, central, and western zone pattern of rural economic development. As the gap in the overall economic development of the three zones widened during the 1980s, regional differences in peasant net per capita income showed a widening trend. In 1980, the peasant net per capita income ratio of the eastern, central, and western economic zones was 1.39:1.11:1 (taking the western zone as 1). In 1985, it was 1.54:1.21:1; and in 1991, it widened further to 1.71:1.06:1. In terms of income category, widening of the difference between the highest income provinces and the lowest income provinces was even more marked. In 1980, the ratio of the highest income to the lowest income was 2.79:1. By 1990, it widened to 4.71:1. Simultaneous with the widening of the income gap between one region and another, even within the same region differences in income also exhibited a widening trend attributable to differences in the geographical environment, differences in the level of organization and management, and differences in technology and human resources. Even in the relatively developed eastern region, as the pace of economic development quickened, a "relative hardship situation in economic development" occurred in some areas. In the central and western regions, such hardship situations might be considered comparatively well-off or rich. According to data from Zhejiang Province, Yinxian County in Ningbo, which ranked nineteenth among the 100 strongest counties in the country, the gross industrial output value of some towns such as Wuxiang, Jiangshan, and Gulin reached 500 million yuan, and even as much as 1 billion yuan, yet the output value of some other towns was less than 100 million yuan. Net per capita income there was as high as more than 2,000 yuan, and as low as only 600 yuan. Among villages, differences were even greater. The gross output value of industry and agriculture in villages that had developed rapidly was more than 100 million. In slowly developing villages, it was less than 100 million, and some places were insolvent. The regional economic returns gap became the force behind the shift of surplus rural manpower out of these areas. The greater the gap became, the stronger the impetus for rural manpower to flow into developed areas. Inevitably this produced transportation and employment strains, which increased developed areas' development pressures, and sapped undeveloped areas development vitality. 3. Steady Widening of the Gap Between Cities and the Countryside. In order to hasten industrialization, ever since the founding of the people's republic the government has pursued a "price scissors" policy in agriculture and rural villages, which has widened the differences between city and countryside. Prior to 1980, the government instituted a low wages system for city staff members and workers, and practiced an egalitarian "work points system" form of distribution in rural villages, so the difference between city and rural wages was not great, nor were the historical differences between city and countryside much improved. During the early 1980s, city and town residents' income was about 1.8 times peasant income. Rural reform and decontrol, and rural economic development further narrowed the difference between city and countryside. Between 1980 and 1984, city and town residents' income increased 6.2 percent each year while peasant earnings increased by an annual 16.7 percent, thereby narrowing the gap between cities and the countryside by 5.6 percent. City and town residents' income was 1.7 times peasant income. However, after 1985, the ratio between city and countryside residents' income changed, city and town resident's income continuing to increase faster than peasant income. In 1985, city and town residents' income grew 1.6 percentage points faster than peasant income, but in 19.86 it increased 14.9 percentage points, and by 1990, the gap between city and countryside income widened from the 1.8:1 of 1982 to 2.2:1. The income gap was just one evidence of the gap between city and countryside. An even greater difference existed between city and countryside social welfare and social security. Peasant advances in education, medical care, housing, and employment derived mostly from the peasants themselves and the rural collective economy, but in cities, they came largely from state financial support. For the broad masses of peasants who had only just extricated themselves from poverty and achieved a subsistence standard of living, fine education and medical care could only be dreams. (3) Overall Peasant Income Level Still Fairly Low Proper assessment of the peasants' income situation is a prerequisite and the foundation for a correct evaluation of the rural economic situation leading to formulation of rural economic policy. Since the advent of reform and opening to the outside world, peasant income has risen substantially, the standard of living has improved markedly, and a large number of "upper income people" have appeared. The number of peasant households having an annual net per capita income of more than 2,000 yuan went from zero in the early 1980s to around 4.7 million, or about 22.5 million people. The appearance of rural "upper income people" generated a misconception in society. Seemingly, all the peasants had become wealthy. Actually, these "upper income people" accounted for only 2.11 percent of all peasant households, or about 2.51 percent of the rural population nationwide. They were an extremely small minority in rural villages. Overall, peasant households making a net per capita income of between 300 and 1,000 yuan per year were the largest percentage. Peasant net per capita income differs from city and town residents' income. It has its own distinctive character. First, peasant income is seasonal. Most of peasant net per capita income comes from agricultural production, and the seasonality of agricultural production means that peasants' income is seasonal. However, city and town residents' income is mostly wage and salary income obtained monthly. Second, some peasant income is spent for productive purposes. The income that peasants obtain not only has to be used for their own consumption, but also for family-run reproduction activities. By contrast, city and town residents' income is used largely for consumption and savings. In addition, the payments they make for housing and medical care as part of consumption are affected by the national welfare system. For the same level of support they pay less than the peasants pay. Therefore, in judging the amount of peasant income, one must pay attention mostly to the amount of income remaining after the peasants take care of their subsistence needs. Survey data verify that after deducting peasant consumer spending, the peasants have only enough income left to maintain simple reproduction. Therefore, the overall peasant income level remains fairly low. Actually, in 1990, peasant per capita living expenses were 585 yuan, 13 yuan lower than their theoretical expenditures. One sensible explanation for this is that in order to sustain and develop agricultural reproduction, the peasants cut back on immediate consumption to increase investment in production and savings. 2. Increased Income Is the Key to a Rural Comparatively Well-Off Standard of Living The journey from a subsistence to a comparatively well-off standard of living is a historical development process. During this historical advance, as the people's standard of living rises, consumer ideas and consumer demand changes correspondingly. Once subsistence problems have been solved, peasant income is elevated to the main position in the weighing of rural economic development objectives. (1) Increasing the agricultural work force's returns is the main line in development of the rural economy during the 1990s. If one says that increasing outputs of main agricultural products was the main line in development of the rural economy prior to the 1980s, then the main line in development of the rural economy during the 1990s is increasing the returns of workers in all rural trades and industries. 1) This stems from the way in which agriculture develops during the new era. The efforts made during the 1980s largely solved the subsistence problems of the people in rural villages and throughout the country as a whole. Not only do outputs of the main agricultural products satisfy the needs of the people of the whole country, but a certain amount of surplus has appeared. People's consumption patterns have also changed qualitatively, so the main emphasis in agriculture has shifted from quantity to quality. Changes in the development of agriculture mean that agriculture must follow a course in which its survival depends on the returns it provides, and its development depends on the quality it provides. During the 1990s, economic returns will become the most direct motivation for the broad masses of peasants to work in agriculture. 2) The rural socialist market economy system makes this so. During the 1980s, enormous successes were scored in development of the rural economy. These provided the basic framework for the rural socialist market economy system. The rural reform that began during the end of the 1970s enabled the broad masses of peasants to take the lead in becoming urban workers. They gained the right to select their own employment, becoming relatively free professionals. Because of the too large a number of peasants engaged in agriculture, large numbers "went south," "went north," or "headed west" where they engaged in non-agricultural activities, thereby forming a large nationwide rural manpower market. This lay a foundation for founding of the rural market economy system. A fundamental reason for the substantial development of the rural commodity economy during the 1980s was the state's planned decontrol of agricultural product markets, gradually reducing and eliminating fixed national prices for some agricultural products. The state eliminated the centralized procurement and assignment procurement system, replacing it with state fixed procurement and free buying and selling in markets. By 1990, except for some grain and cotton prices that the state continued to set, the marekt mechanism determined an overwhelming majority of agricultural product prices. The prosperity and development of rural markets spurred an increase in the degree to which rural villages became commodity economies and money economies. By 1990, the commodity rate for agricultural and sideline products reached 62.9 percent, up 8.5 percentage points from 1980. Peasant cash receipts and expenditures also rose from 53.5 percent in 1980 to 76 percent in 1989, a 22.5 percentage point increase. Money became the main medium through which the peasants sustained and developed production and their livelihood, and commodity production became the most direct goal of peasant production. (3) Necessity for consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. The peasants' interests have always been the main factor in rural and social development whether during land reform or in the rural reforms of the 1980s. "Adjustment and protection of the peasants' interests are implicit motivations in rural reform and the development of agricultural productivity." Adjustment and protection of the peasants' interests, and narrowing the differences between city and countryside are the foundation for consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance, and they are also objective requirements for building a distinctively Chinese brand of socialism. Without rural development, development of the urban economy, and even the entire national economy, is unimaginable. Unless the peasants, who account for 80 percent of the country's total population, achieve a comparatively well-off standard of living, the people of the whole country cannot achieve a comparatively well-off standard of living. Unless the far-flung rural villages attain a comparatively well-off standard of living, a comparatively well-off standard of living in cities is difficult to imagine. Widening of the gap between city and countryside is a most direct and most glaring indication of the widening of the gap between city and countryside residents' income. Not only does this affect the stability of rural society, but also will have a serious impact on urban life. The uneven development manifested in the decline of rural villages and the one-sided prosperity of cities that has occurred in the industrialization process in developed capitalist countries, which has not only restricted further development of the national economy but also has given rise to serious social problems should be heeded. (2) The key indicator of a comparatively well-off standard of living is peasant net per capita income. A comparatively well-off standard of living is a new stage of development that the Chinese people face following complete solution to their subsistence problem. It is a development phase that must be gone through on the way from subsistence to wealth. It is an objective necessity for realizing the second strategic objective of national economic and social development during the 1990s. The goal of attaining a comparatively well-off standard of living is a comprehensive socio-economic development goal that includes the economy, the society, and the environment. Peasant net per capita income is an important indicator listed in the rural comparatively well-off standard of living indicator system that all jurisdictions and departments concerned have put forward. Its weighting ranks it first among all indicators. Increase in peasant income is a prerequisite and the foundation for rural attainment of a comparatively well-off standard of living. Increase in peasant income lays a solid material foundation for a rise in peasant productive capacity and consumer purchasing power. It also gives impetus to early realization of other indicators of a comfortably well-of standard of living. Nevertheless, peasant income increase is only a requirement for realization of a comparatively well-off standard of living. Economic growth does not always bring an increase in social welfare and social progress, and economic growth frequently occasions economic phenomena such as environmental pollution and relative poverty. It may also occasion a loss of social precepts and ethics. A Peasant Net Per Capita Income of 1,200 Yuan Is a Basic Requirement for Rural Attainment of a Comparatively Well-Off Standard of Living Proposal of a Rural Comparatively Well-Off Line. The idea of a rural comparatively well-off line means that peasant net per capita income has reached the minimum limit for being comparatively well-off. This is to say that peasant net per capita income must at least reach a certain standard value in order to realize a comparatively well-off rural standard of living. 1. The national rural comparatively well-off line is 1,200 yuan per capita. Currently, society has two opinions about a comparatively well-off rural standard of living. One is represented primarily by the State Statistical Bureau, which holds that in 2000 the rural comparatively well-off line will be 1,100 yuan, figured at 1990 prices. This is 414 yuan more than the 686 yuan of 1990, an annual 4.8 percent increase. The other is represented primarily by the State Planning Commission, which maintains that the rural comparatively well-off line in 2000 will be 1,200 yuan figured at 1990 prices. This is 514 yuan more than in 1990 for an annual 5.8 percent increase. We feel that 1,200 yuan as a rural comparatively well-off line is about right. 1) A look at requirements for a rural comparatively well-off standard of living suggests that the rural Engels' coefficient will have to fall below 50 percent for rural villages to attain a comparatively well-off standard of living. For peasant per capita consumption expenditures to reach about 1,000 yuan, peasant net per capita income will have to reach at least 1,200 yuan. 2) A look at possibilities for rural economic development suggests that the main sources of increase in peasant income will be agricultural production and the development of rural township and town enterprises. According to an analysis of data for the 12 year period 1979-1990, increase in peasant net per capita income was very much related to the gross output value of agriculture and the number of people employed in township and town enterprises. Is agricultural production and the development of township and town enterprises up to the heavy task of bringing the rural comparatively well-off line up to 1,200 yuan? The answer is affirmative. In view of the requirements of the 10-year plan for rural economic development and of the Eighth Five-Year Plan, by 2000, the gross output value of agriculture will increase more than 4 percent each year. The gross output value of township and town enterprises will increase 11 percent, soaking up 47.45 million rural laborers in 10 years and bringing the number employed in such enterprises to 140 million in a 51.1 percent increase over 1990, a 4.2 percent annual rate of increase. Without taking price factors into account, the gross output value of agriculture will increase 4 percent each year; thus, peasant net per capita income will increase 3.12 percent each year, i.e., a cumulative 37.4 percent in 10 years. A 4.2 percent annual increase in the number of people employed in township and town enterprises will mean a 0.77 percent annual increase in peasant net per capita income, i.e., a cumulative 7.96 percent in 10 years. All in all, at the planned speed of increase, by 2000 peasant net per capita income will increase 45.4 percent to 997 yuan through the development of agricultural production and expansion of employment in other than agriculture. This is 83.1 percent of the rural comparatively well-off line, somewhat more than 200 yuan short of the requirement for a rural comparatively well-off standard of living. Moreover, the gap can be narrowed only by accelerating the pace of economic development. For the people of the whole country and the broad masses of peasants to attain a comparatively well-off standard of living by the end of the present century, the speed of rural economic development swill have to be increased. The development speed that the "10 Year Plan and the Eight Five-Year Plan propose will have to be amended. Following the high speed development of the 1980s, agricultural production gradually entered a mature stage during which economic growth was flat and in which maintenance of 4 percent growth was about right. Following three years of improving the economic environment and rectifying the economic order between 1989 and 1991, the speed of development picked up somewhat. Under the policy of accelerting development, development speed should have been somewhat faster, and manpower shuold have been absorbed faster too. Preliminary calculations show that at an annual 25 percent increase in the value of township and town enterprises (i.e., 14 percentage points higher than the 11 percent of the original plan), the township and town enterprise annual rate of employment increase should reach 9.55 percent, boosting the peasant annual net per capita income rate of increase by 1.75 percentage points. When increased income from the development of agriculture is added in, the peasant net per capita income rate of increase rises 4.87 percentage points, i.e., a 10 year cumulative 60.9 percent increase, peasant net per capita income reaching more than 1,100 yuan. The income that laborers obtain through direct production activities comes to 91.7 percent of the rural comparatively well-off line. The remaining approximately 9 percent can be obtained through other nonproduction activities. (3) The trend of historical development shows that after deducting for price increases, agricultural production increased 6.3 percent during the 1980s, a speed higher than necessary to reach the rural comparatively well-off line. Township and town enterprise growth reached 30.5 percent, including the relatively slow 25 percent speed of growth during the Seventh Five-Year Plan period. This was also higher than or equal to the speed of growth required to reach the rural comparatively well-off line. An increase in peasant net per capita income from 686 yuan in 1990 to 1,200 yuan in 2000, a 5.8 percent annual increase but still lower than the 63 percent growth of the 1980s, is realizable with effort. 2. The comparatively well-off line in high income areas is 1,500 yuan. For middle income areas, it is 1,200 yuan, and for low income areas it is 1,000 yuan. The area divisions used in this article are based on China's actual rural development. The division is based on the peasant mean net per capita income data for each province for 1990 and 1991. The two year mean, which eliminates annual peculiarities, increases the credibility of the regional division. The whole country is divided into three categories. In the first, peasant net per capita income ranges between 800 and 2,000 yuan. This applies to eight provinces (or municipalities), including Shanghai, Beijing, Zhejiang, Tianjin, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Liaoning, and Fujian (ranked by income from high to low, and the same applies hereinafter). In these eight provinces (or municipalities), the peasant mean net per capita income is 1,162 yuan, which is close to the national average rural comparatively well-off line. These three areas are concentrated in three large cities and developed coastal areas. In the second category, peasant net per capita income is between 600 and 800 yuan. This applies to 12 provinces (or autonomous regions), including Jilin, Heilongjiang, Shandong, Hainan, Xinjiang, Jiangxi, Tibet, Hunan, Hubei, Guangxi, Hebei, and Inner Mongolia. In these 12 provinces or autonomous regions, the peasant mean net per capita income is 687 yuan, which is equal to the peasant net per capita income nationwide in 1990. An overwhelming majority of these provinces (or autonomous regions) are principal grain and cotton growing areas. They are representative of agricultural provinces nationwide. In the third category, peasant net per capita income runs between 400 and 600 yuan. This applies to 10 provinces or autonomous regions including Shanxi, Ningxia, Sichuan, Qinghai, Yunnan, Shaanxi, Anhui, Guizhou, and Gansu. The peasant mean net per capita income for these 10 provinces or autonomous regions is 531 yuan. Most of these areas are concentrated in large agricultural provinces throughout the county, and in poorly developed areas of western and southwestern China. This includes Guizhou and Gansu province in which peasant net per capita income has not yet reached 500 yuan. At 450 and 439 yuan respectively, this is the lowest level in the country. One cannot directly determine the separate area rural comparatively well-off line by using the peasant mean net per capita income. An evaluation of purchasing power is also needed to eliminate the effect of area price differences. A so-called purchasing power evaluation means readjusting the income of different areas by using a standard purchasing power to make incomes more comparable. The income of the second category regions, which corresponds to the national average may serve as the standard purchasing power. Rural monetary purchasing power and the rural retail price index show a reciprocal correlation. As the price index rises, purchasing power declines; as the price index declines, purchasing power rises. In order to eliminate the effect of prices insofar as possible when evaluating purchasing power, selection of 1978 as the base year for the rural price index is rather appropriate inasmuch as rural reform began in 1978. Prior to 1978 (including 1978) China practiced a low wage, low price, and limited rural commodity economy development policy whereby the rural price level differed greatly from place to place throughout the country. The rural reforms of 1978 consisted primarily of an increase in farm product prices. The reforms had relatively little effect on the rural retail price index for that year. Calculations yield a purchasing power for category 1 areas that is 91.76 percent of standard purchasing power. Peasant net per capita income after adjusting prices is 1,065 yuan. In order to reach the national rural comparatively well-off line in 2000, at the peasant net per capita income increase, the rural comparatively well-off line will be 1,579 yuan, which is rounded down to 1,500 yuan. The category 2 areas are at the national mean where the rural comparatively well-off line is 1,200 yuan. In category 3 areas, where purchasing power is 103.32 percent of standard purchasing power, peasant net per capita income after adjusting prices is 548 yuan. Using as a standard the peasant net per capita income increase needed to reach the national rural comparatively well-off line, the rural comparatively well-off line for this category is 1,062 yuan, which has been rounded down to 1,000 yuan. (2) Favorable Conditions for Reaching the Rural Comparatively Well-Off Line. Attainment of the rural comparatively well-off line requires maintenance of an annual 5.8 percent increase in peasant net per capita income, which corresponds to the 1992 increase. Nationwide, three favorable conditions exist for attainment of the rural comparatively well-off line: 1. The rural economy will maintain steady increase; potential exists for further development. This is the basic underpinning for peasant income increase. The gross output value of agriculture will maintain a 5 percent growth rate during the first three years of the 1990s (1990-1992) at comparable prices. For the next eight years, increase in the gross output value of agriculture will not be less than 4 percent. The reasons are as follows: 1) As the basic industry in the national economy, agriculture will receive close attention from the party and government for a long time to come, and support will be provided in many ways, such as through legislation and administration, to develop agricultural production and to readjust and protect the peasants' interests, which will promote steady development of agricultural production. 2) Agricultural production holds tremendous potential. Two-thirds of the country's cultivated land consists of medium and low yield fields. Reserve resources also exist in the form of large amounts of barren mountains, unexploited water surfaces, and undeveloped flats. With full development for agriculture, they provide substantial potential for increased yields and increased income. 3) The structure of agriculture is facing readjustments. Use of science and technology to invigorate agriculture, development of high yield, premium quality, and high return agriculture, and increasing the added value of agricultural products have become the common cause of the broad masses of peasants. 2. Smooth reform of the farm products circulation mechanism will give impetus to the formation of a second upsurge in agricultural production. The government's gradual decontrol of procurement and marketing controls on main farm products such as grain and cotton, and guidance given the broad masses of peasants to enter the marketplace have accelerated the general adoption of market principles in rural areas. This will generate extremely great interest and impetus among the broad masses of peasants to develop commodity production and take part in market competition. It will bring about early completion of the task of readjusting the structure of agricultural production, thereby increasing peasant income. In addition, the grain reserve system and the wholesale market mechanism that the government has set up create a fine macroeconomic climate for the development of agriculture that will enable smooth reform and development of agriculture. 3. Accelerated development of township and town enterprises, and speedy urbanization of rural villages have given powerful impetus to a shift in surplus rural manpower, thereby promoting a tremendous rise in peasant income. The urbanization of rural villages and the development of rural tertiary industries provide new employment opportunities for the transfer out of agriculture of rural surplus manpower. In 1992, the gross output value of township and town enterprises reached 1.7643 trillion yuan, or one third of gross social output value. The annual rate of increase was more than 30 percent. Development of the rural economy has accelerated the movement of enterprises and funds to key cities and towns, and transportation centers. The development of rural small cities and towns has become the main vehicle for future enterprise concentration and the shift out of agriculture of rural surplus labor. It also enables rural tertiary industries to abandon scattered operations in favor of more centralized operations that offer the economies of scale. It may be safely predicted that rural manpower will move into non-agricultural industries on a larger scale and concentrate in small rural cities and towns. 3) Analysis of Difficulties in Reaching the Rural Comparatively Well-Off Line. Peasant income increases slowly, thereby adding to pressures for reaching the rural comparatively well-off line. The past five years of rural reform have seen the fastest increase in peasant income, which has grown at an average 15.1 percent per year. Between 1985 and 1988, it declined 4 percent, and for three years beginning in 1989 peasant income remained in limbo. Despite 1989's all-time high grain output, after deducting for price rises, peasant net per capita income was 1.8 percent less than for the previous year. This was the first year of negative growth since the advent of reform and opening to the outside world. In 1990, peasant income increased only 1.8 percent over the previous year. In 1991, it increased 2 percent over the previous year. From 1989 to 1991, it increased only an average 0.7 percent. Only nine years remain between now and the end of the present century. If peasant income increases at 2 percent per year, by 2000, only half the rural comparatively well-off line can be completed. Attainment of the rural comparatively well-off line of 1,200 yuan by 2000 will require a 6.2 percent increase in peasant per capita income, which is 0.4 percentage points more than the originally prescribed plan, and 0.4 percentage points higher than the actual 1992 increase. Second, the shift out of agriculture of rural surplus manpower is crucial to peasant income increase, and it is also the key to realizing a comparatively well-off rural standard of living. Today, approximately 100 million of China's 430 million work force are in a state of "hidden unemployment" in agricultural production. In addition is the 100 million rural labor force that will be added over the coming decade, so that by the end of the present century surplus rural manpower will increase to 200 million. Attainment of the comparatively well-off line in rural villages requires an annual shift of more than 13 million members of the rural work force into other lines of work. This means a shift of 130 million over the next 10 years, thereby increasing the number of people employed in township and town enterprises to more than 220 million. Such a large scale transfer is unprecedented since founding of the people's Republic. During the 1980s, for the first time large numbers of the rural work force entered nonagricultural industries, which grew on a fairly large scale at fairly high speed, an average of 6.3 million members of the work force entering them each year. Transferring surplus rural manpower during the 1990s at twice the 1980s scale and speed will pose substantial difficulties. Third, the peasants' burdens are fairly heavy, thereby adding to the difficulty in realizing a comparatively well-off rural standard of living. The increase in peasants' burdens is essentially an erosion of peasant's income, which has the effect of seriously sapping peasant's ability to improve and develop production. Peasant household survey data show that between 1985 and 1990, peasants' burdens nationwide (including only state taxation and collective withholdings) rose from 18.40 yuan to 38.20 yuan per capita in a 1.1 fold increase, or at an annual 15.7 percent. During 1989 and 1990, in particular, the per capita rate of increase in burdens exceeded the per capita net income rate of increase, the increase being respectively 15.5 and 12.3 percent higher than peasant per capita net income. Even more serious is the excessive increase in unreasonable rural fund raising and assessments, which exceed the nationally prescribed 5 percent. Peasant income increases with no increase in benefits. 4. Various Policy Ideas for Increasing Peasant Income (1) Updating Thinking, Making Readjustment and Protection of Peasants Interests the Main Line in the Development of Agriculture and the Rural Economy During the 1990s. The establishment and development of a socialist rural market economy system puts an interests mechanism at the heart of rural economic development. Protection and readjustment of peasants interests for a narrowing of the gap between cities and the countryside is a basic requirement for the building of a distinctively Chinese brand of socialism. The inauguration and implementation of reform measures including readjustment of the agricultural production structure, developing high yield, premium, and high return agriculture, reforming the agricultural product procurement and marketing system, improving the socialist market economy mechanism, etc. as the market requires cannot be done successfully without the active participation of the broad masses of peasants. Unless the peasants' interests are protected, not only will the peasant's income level and standard of living be adversely affected but, more importantly, peasant interest in developing production and taking part in reform will be impaired. Thus, this is not an economic issue but a political one. Therefore, during the 1990s, the emphasis of rural economic development and rural work has to shift from product output to the protection and readjustment of peasants' interests. It must change to increasing the income of rural laborers. (2) Maintaining the Continuity of Existing Policies To Consolidate the Agricultural Foundation Provides the Most Basic Underpinnings for Steady Increase in Peasant Income. Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy. Greater government protection and intervention in this foundation is extremely necessary during the new situation in developing a socialist market economy. On the one hand, a good job must be done in carrying out all policy measures. Actions must be taken in accordance with the provisions of "Agricultural Law of the People's Republic of China," the decisions of the Fourteenth Party Congress' decisions on the development of a socialist market economy, and the spirit of the Central Committee of the Rural Work Committee, using "Program for the Development of Chinese Agriculture During the 1990's" as a blueprint for maintaining continuity in rural economic policies, for giving substance to all policies and measures, for paying sincere and wholehearted attention to agriculture, for removing peasant apprehensions, for protecting and increase peasant interest in developing agricultural production and the rural economy, for wholeheartedly developing agricultural production and the rural economy, for increasing peasant income, and for creating a relaxed policy environment for realization of a comparatively well-off rural standard of living. On the other hand, governments at all levels must be encouraged to improve the agricultural infrastructure, to increase investment, to improve agricultural production conditions, to improve ability to prevent and withstand disasters, and to increase reserve strength for development. Readjustment of the Agricultural Production Structure for the Development of High Yield, Premium Quality, High Return Agriculture Is an Important Way To Increase Peasant Income. Development of agriculture by emphasizing returns is the outstanding feature of agriculture during the 1990s. The State Council's "Decisions on Accelerating the Development of High Yield, Premium Quality, and High Return Agriculture" provides policy support for the development of "Three Highs" agriculture. The key problems existing today as the peasants orient toward the market, readjust the production structure, and develop "three highs" agriculture is the general existence of new ways to increase income, and worries about market risks. In the process of developing the market economy, government has not stood idly by but rather has done what needs to be done. Even in developed capitalist countries, government regulation and control of agricultural production, and protection of the interests of farmers is fairly complete. The government must become the leader and the protector in the peasant's development of a socialist market economy so that the rural market economy changes gears smoothly. Right now, it must pay close attention to model pilot projects in "three highs" agriculture, exploring new avenues for development of the four combinations, namely farming, breeding, and processing; agriculture, industry, and commerce; domestic and foreign trade; and agriculture, science, and education, readjusting the agriculture production structure, and increasing peasant income. Accelerating the Development of Township and Town Enterprises, and Accelerating Transfers Out of Agriculture of Surplus Rural Manpower Is the Key To Increasing Peasant Income. The success or failure of rural economic development plans depends on whether more than 200 million surplus rural workers can be transferred out of agriculture. Whether the goal of a comparatively well-off rural standard of living can be smoothly attained also hinges on this. The development of township and town enterprises, and the widening of rural employment avenues are necessary for an increase in peasant income. First, the enterprise equity rights system must be improved. Establishment of a township and town enterprise microeconomic operating basis that is consistent with the modern enterprise system requires step-by-step, planned development of township and town enterprise equity rights registration work to clarify the enterprise equity rights situation. Experiences in the reform of the joint-stock system and the cooperative shares system, which is already underway, must be summarized promptly, and better guidance provided for gradual standardization of the systems. Second is faster development of township and town enterprises in central and western China. Special funds for the development of township and town enterprises must be managed well and used well as State Council "Decisions on Accelerating Development of Central and Western Township and Town Enterprises" requires, to raise the level of development of township and town enterprises in those areas. Third is the need to do a good job of building small rural cities and towns to hasten the urbanization of rural villages. National government agencies concerned must draw up rural small city and town development plans, making the building of small cities and towns the center of current economic and cultural activity. Fourth is the need to speed up the development of rural tertiary industries. This is a major way in which to soak up surplus rural labor. Fifth is putting scientific and technical progress to use in increasing the competitiveness of township and town enterprises. (5) Improvement of the Rural Products Circulation System, Establishing an Agricultural Protection Mechanism Is an Important Support for Increasing Peasant Income. First is the need to speed up the growth of the rural commodity circulation system. Supply and marketing cooperatives are the basic rural commodity circulation organizations. They are the main channels for the circulation of agricultural products. The supply and marketing system reforms of the past several years have begun to show results. While continuing the role of rural supply and marketing cooperatives, people in all walks of life and individual peasants must be encouraged to set up rural commodity circulation organizations in order to convert product strengths into commodity strengths that spur the development of rural commodity production. Second is further perfection of the basic infrastructure for commodity circulation including national reserves and wholesale markets to provide strong support for development of the rural market economy. The building of agricultural products wholesale markets must become the focus in fostering and improving agricultural product markets during the 1990s, energies concentrated on doing a good job of it. While summarizing experiences and perfecting the present wholesale markets, a "Wholesale Market Law" should be drawn up with all possible speed to establish wholesale markets as leaders in the business realm, particularly for fresh foods, using legal means to standardize and promote the development of wholesale markets. Third is the need for further perfection of the ceiling price procurement system, to control the degree of rise in prices of the means of agricultural production and to narrow the "price scissors" between industrial and agricultural products. (6) Concentration of Forces To Carry Out an Assault To Assist the Needy and Bring About Development. More than 80 million people in China have still not found a long-term solution to their subsistence problems, most of them living in high mountain and border areas, and in frequent natural disaster areas. Others live in old revolutionary base areas and minority nationality areas. The State Council has set a seven year period for solving the subsistence problems of these 80 million people, i.e., the "Eighth Seven-Year Assault Plan To Support the Needy." We must continue a good job of work-relief programs, stick to development plans to assist the needy, reshape the economic development mechanism in such areas, improving their self-invigorating mechanism to ensure victory in the assault. (8) Reduction of Peasant Burdens. Both the party and the government have drafted a series of policy measures to reduce peasant burdens, and limits on peasant burdens have also been written into law. The law clearly provides that no unit may increase peasant burdens on any pretext, peasant burdens to be held within 5 percent of previous year peasant net per capita income. Now the key lies in implementation. We must act in the spirit of the Central Rural Work Conference to improve leadership and supervision, making reduction of peasant burdens an important task in development of the rural economy during 1990 and realizing the goal of a comfortably well-off standard of living, putting it on the government's daily work agenda, and paying unremitting attention to it.
