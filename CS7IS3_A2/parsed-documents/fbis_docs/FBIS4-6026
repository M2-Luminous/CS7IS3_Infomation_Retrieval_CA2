We are meaningfully marking the respected and beloved leader's birthday at a time when all people's resolve and will to complete the socialist cause to the end under the leadership of the party and the leader [suryong] have been further consolidated and when the honor and dignity of our fatherland, which is advancing under the uplifted banner of chuche, are displayed vigorously. Our people and revolutionary people of the world are now celebrating the felicitous festival of April with great joys and emotion and extending the greatest honor to the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song. The respected and beloved leader's birth is the most significant historic event in which the people's great sun rose and a great festive event never before seen in the long history spanning 5,000 years. The proud history, in which our people have demonstrated lofty dignity as the masters of their own destinies after being united in close ties of kinship with the leader [suryong], and our fatherland's brilliant future are linked to this honorable day. As time passes and as the revolution advances far, our people's hearts are more and more filled with great national pride in upholding the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and a warm sense of loyalty and filial devotion with which to better serve [tojal mosigo] the leader [suryong] and uphold the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's leadership. Throughout the long period from the day when he embarked on the revolutionary road, the respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il- song has devoted himself to promoting the people's freedom and happiness. Throughout this long period, only the people have existed in the great leader's heart, and our leader [suryong] has always existed in our people's hearts. Today in our country this harmonious unity between the leader [suryong] and people is being further consolidated into an unbreakable one. This gives our people a belief in certain victory and boundless strength and firmly guarantees the bright future of the cause of socialism of our own style. Harmonious unity between the leader [suryong] and the people is the greatest achievement in the Korean revolution and the source of the invincible strength of the socialism of our own style. A fundamental key to victory in socialist construction and confrontation with the imperialists is harmonious unity between the leader [suryong] and the people. The leader [suryong] is the popular masses' top brain [choego noesu] and the leader [yongdoja] of the revolution, and the people are the masters of revolution and construction and those in charge of revolution and construction. The people can display their boundless strength as powerful main forces of the revolution, defeat any powerful enemy, and vigorously carry out revolution and construction when they achieve harmonious unity with the leader [suryong]. From the cultivating period of our revolution up until today, our people have resolutely waged struggles while upholding the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and strongly uniting around the leader [suryong]. The entire history in which our revolution was cultivated and advanced is brilliant as a proud annals in which harmonious unity was achieved between the leader [suryong] and the revolutionary warriors and the leader [suryong] and the people and in which victories were won based on the strength of such unity. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has pointed out: Since our revolution began, the Korean communists firmly believed that they can cultivate the turbulent road of the revolution only when they uphold the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song in the forefront and walked along the road of struggle and victory after overcoming all trials. They have also entrusted their entire destinies to the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and lived and fought with single- hearted loyalty toward the leader [suryong] though they might live even for a moment. The Korean revolution has embarked upon an ardent and complicated road ever since its beginning. Since the beginning of Comrade Kim Il-song's revolutionary activities, the great leader has always trusted in the people and found himself among them leading the revolution. As a result, he has unreservedly displayed the qualities and traits of the great leader of the people. Thanks to the greatness, prominent leadership traits, and lofty personality of the respected and beloved leader [suryong], the Korean communists and people have been able to forecast the victory of the revolution, as well as their future and have been able to trust and follow him as the savior of their destinies. The great leader [suryong] believes in the people and the latter trust and follow him. The bonds between the leader [suryong] and the people are those of kinship between the father and his children. Also, so unbreakable are their bonds that make it possible to do anything under any harsh circumstances. Thus, from the beginning, our revolution has began with harmonious unity between the leader [suryong] and the people and has traversed a brilliant course by its might. The harmonious unity between the leader [suryong] and the people is a great driving force that has constantly led our revolution and construction to become ever-victorious by withstanding the harsh storm of history. The revolution is accompanied by difficulties and trials. Because there is the harmonious unity between the leader [suryong] and the people, we can boldly defeat any imperialist powerful enemy, as well as overcome harsh difficulties under all circumstances. This is the truth that has been proven in the long and ardent history of our revolution. Our people had no other choice but to pioneer their destinies by confronting other powerful enemies all the time under the most disadvantageous and ardent situations. In this harsh course, there was once a difficult time that determines the destiny of the revolution, as well as periods in which we should carry out the vast and heavy tasks. However, we have been able to embark upon the single road of victory all the time without the slightest faltering as a result of the invincible unity and cohesion of our people who are firmly united around the respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song. Whenever we have a difficult time, the respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song has trusted our people and solved all problems with them. Also, our people have fought against enemies by entrusting their destines to the leader [suryong], thus respecting him. If we had not had the harmonious unity, in which the leader [suryong] and the people are firmly united, we would not have defeated the imperialists during the two rounds of wars against them, nor smashed [punswae] enemies' plots, nor effected the great upsurge of Chollima during the difficult period of the postwar, nor established the socialist power -- independent, self-reliant, and self-defensive -- on this land. Experience shows that the harmonious unity between the leader [suryong] and the people have a boundless might that makes it possible to defeat all powerful enemies and to effect a greater upturn in the socialist construction. The harmonious unity between the leader [suryong] and the people is a great might in resolutely safeguarding and adhering to socialism of our own style today. We are now carrying out the revolution and construction by acutely confronting the imperialists. The imperialists are now viciously maneuvering to isolate and crush [apsal] our country -- a fortress of socialism -- throughout all areas, such as politics, military affairs, the economy, and diplomacy. The single-hearted unity between the leader [suryong], the party, and the masses are, however, further strengthened. Now, our party and the revolutionary ranks have cherished a firm faith that one will surely win a victory only if one vigorously fights on under the leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong- il, thus upholding the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song. Our people today are the invincible people who have a firm faith and determination to endlessly share their destinies with the leader [suryong], thus cherishing deep in their hearts the greatness of their leader [suryong]. Because all people are firmly united around the leader [suryong] and the leader [yongdoja] with their burning faith to resolutely safeguard their leader [suryong] and their leader [yongdoja], we have boldly smashed [chippusida] any threat, blackmail, and maneuvers of aggression by the imperialists and have firmly safeguarded the socialist feats, as well as the nation's dignity and honor. This is a great demonstration of the invincible might displayed by the harmonious unity between the leader [suryong] and the people. It is the great pride of the Korean communist movement to have established the harmonious unity between the leader and the people early in the opening-up period of our revolution and to have advanced the revolution and construction with the might of the unity. The might of the harmonious unity between the leader and the people that has highly been displayed in our revolution lies, above all, in the fact that the leader and the people have become a community bound firmly together into a single life by common fate. The leader and the people are linked with each other by common fate. In the revolutionary struggle, the leader is the pioneer and protector of the people's destinies, and the people are an invincible fortress that protects and defends the leader. The revolutionary rank can demonstrate its limitless strength when relations between the leader and the people are not only those between a leader and his followers, but also those linked by blood, in which they share life and death. The whole course of the arduous and well-tried Korean revolution is literally a course in which the leader and the people have struggled while sharing sorrow and joy and entrusting their destinies and future to each other. The respected and beloved leader has trusted the revolutionary fighters and the people from his heart and regarded their destinies as his own, saying that always only a true heart can fuse our blood and the people's blood in an artery, while the people have absolutely trusted, resolutely protected, and defended the leader as the center of their lives and as their supreme head [choego noesu]. The Korean revolutionaries and people have fought by devoting their lives without hesitation to shield the respected and beloved leader against the enemy's bombshell with their hearts. This is their lofty trait. This exalted ideological and spiritual world can be personified only by faithful revolutionaries who identify not only their faith, will, ideology, and emotion but also their private thoughts with their leader's. This trait was the ideological and spiritual source of the creation and consolidation of the inseparable, harmonious unity between the leader and the people. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song is leading the people along the single road of socialism today, too, holding the responsibility of their destinies to the last, and the people are fighting with a firm faith to entrust their destinies to the party and the leader and to follow them to the end of the world. Because of this identity of fate, the harmonious unity between the leader and the people has constantly been consolidated and developed in our country. The might of the harmonious unity between the leader and the people also lies in the fact that they are a community bound together by common ideology and will. The most important tie that links the leader and the people is the identity of ideology. When the leader elucidates the victorious course of the revolution and renders ideological leadership, the people come to uphold the leader as their teacher and firmly unite themselves based on his ideology. Since the creation of the immortal chuche idea by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song in an early stage through a scientific envisagement of the demand of the times and the people's desire, our people have stoutly struggled with this revolutionary idea as a firm faith and as the only banner of unity. In those days of the struggle, our people learned by keen experience that they can achieve the prosperity of the fatherland and the victory of the revolution only by fighting along the road indicated by the respected and beloved leader, and they have upheld the leader as their great teacher. The linkage between the leader and the people has been guaranteed by the ideological identity of sharing will and destinies based on the chuche idea. Today, thanks to the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il who has constantly developed to complete the chuche idea, our people's ideological identity is being consolidated even further. Our party and the revolutionary ranks are the community of chuche-type revolutionaries -- who struggle with the leader's revolutionary ideology, the chuche idea, as a firm faith -- bound together by ideology and will. All party members and working people breathe, speak, and act only in conformity with our party's ideology and will. When the party and the leader present a new line or policy, the entire party and all people rise as one to live and struggle according only to it. Thus, the harmonious unity between the leader and the people has limitless strength. The might of the harmonious unity between the leader and the people also lies in the fact that it has been succeeded, developed, and consolidated through generations so as to consummate the socialist cause. Blood unity between the leader [suryong] and the people was and is very important and will be all the more important. The people wage struggles after strongly uniting around the leader [suryong] in order to complete the revolution to the end. As the revolution deepens and develops today in our country, harmonious unity between the leader [suryong] and the people is being further consolidated. The entire party, all the people, and the entire Army are vigorously fighting after strongly uniting around the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. It shows that the harmonious unity between the leader [suryong] and the people, which was formed and consolidated and developed historically, has eternal vitality and is brilliantly inherited. Through their actual experiences and realities all party members and workers have come to have the belief that they can enjoy worthwhile and happy lives and complete the socialist cause to the end when they uphold the dear comrade leader. They also entrust their entire destinies to the party and the leader [suryong]. As a result, our revolutionary rank takes pride in the fact that it is an invincible combatant rank that has achieved strong unity based on a single goal and aspiration and a single idea and will and advances to complete the chuche cause. The noble revolutionary spirit, with which this rank is filled, is the revolutionary belief and strong will that the rank, just like the fallen anti-Japanese revolutionaries who fought by even unhesitatingly risking their lives to resolutely defend the great leader, upholds the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il and fights forever. Thanks to this, harmonious unity between the leader [suryong] and the people highly demonstrates its boundless might in our country as time goes by. This provides our fatherland and revolution with bright prospects. When we recall the long history of the communist movement, the most solid harmonious unity between the leader [suryong] and the people is achieved only in the Korean revolution, which is led by the great leader. A crucial key to the achievement of this invincible unity is the greatness and nobleness of the ideas, leadership, and virtue of the respected and beloved leader, the great father [widaehan oboi] of our party members and workers and our fellow countrymen. The source of the solidity of our harmonious unity is the respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song's idea of believing in the people as in heaven. The idea of believing in the people as in heaven, an idea that one considers the people to be heaven, is an opinion and motto that the great leader cherishes in the entire course of revolution and construction. The chuche idea's profound principle that one considers the popular masses to be the masters of revolution and construction and relies on their strength comes from idea of believing in the people as in heaven. The chuche-oriented theories and leadership methods also come from this idea. In resolving any issues concerning revolution and construction, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has given priority to the people's interests, had their aspirations and demands reflected on all lines and policies, and made all efforts to implement those aspirations and demands. The idea of believing in the people as in heaven is reflected on all lines and policies Kim Il-song presented historically, from the lines on building the party, the country, and the Army, which he presented at the early stage of building new society, and to the party's revolutionary economic strategy today. The revolutionary strategies and tactics which the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song present for the sake of the popular masses; the people-oriented policies; the favors which the party and the leader [suryong] do each family and each individual on an equal basis give rise to the people's absolute trust for the party and the leader [suryong] and strongly connect the party and the people in a single artery. Just like the idea of believing in the people as in heaven is eternal, our solid harmonious unity which was achieved based on this great idea will not shake. The most solid blood ties between the leader [suryong] and the people were formed in our country because the achievements which the respected and beloved leader has brought about in the struggle for the popular masses' cause of independence are great. A great leader [yongdoja] wins respect and trust from the people not because someone stands him in front; he does so because of his own achievements. Numerous boundlessly difficult and massive tasks never before seen in history were presented in our people's struggle for sovereignty and independence. In the long revolutionary course, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has led every stage and type of struggle to victory in order to carry out the cause of independence in our era. And, in this process, he has brought about immortal achievements, which will remain brilliant forever in the history of mankind, in political, economic, political, and cultural fields and all the other fields. The achievements of building the chuche-type party and the people's government, which responsibly take care of the popular masses' destinies; the achievements of building the people's genuine revolutionary armed forces, which defend the people's freedom and happiness; the achievements of raising our people into revolutionary people who have a strong sense of independence; the achievements of building popular masses-centered socialism of our own style in this land where only backwardness and poverty prevailed; and all the other achievements which the respected and beloved leader has brought about win admiration from all people. The history of any other country in the East or West or in the past or present age has not seen a leader [yongdoja] like our respected and beloved leader, who has brought all historic achievements for the people as best as he can and raised the people's position to the peak of the era. The achievements which the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has brought about are immortal achievements which he has brought about for the people while riding out the road of arduous struggle with the people. In bringing about these achievements, the respected and beloved leader has faced all hardships that a revolutionary may face and has overcome trials and difficulties. During the days of the anti-Japanese struggle, he personally took the lead in the arduous march to break through the line of death and find a way out; after the liberation, he first embarked on the road toward building the country; and today, when he is over 80 years old, is giving on-the-spot guidance to plants and enterprises and farms across the country and devoting himself to giving greater happiness to our people. This devotion to and sleepless and restless efforts for the fatherland and people by the respected and beloved leader is incomparable to anyone else's. Therefore, every time they think of the great leader's achievements for them, our people consolidate their determination to better serve the leader [suryong] with loyalty, devotion, and single-mindedness. The most solid harmonious unity between the leader [suryong] and the people was achieved in our country because the respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song's virtue is great and because his people-oriented trait is boundlessly noble. A great politician has noble virtue, and the people become happy because of such a virtue. The respected and beloved leader's politics is the politics of love and trust and that of virtue. The great leader, who started the revolution by winning comrades, has not hesitated to face any hardship if it were for his comrades and people, considered having many comrades to be the most important asset, and considered winning love and trust from the people to be the greatest happiness. In this way, he has written the most beautiful annals of revolutionary comradeship and human love. Millions of members of our party rank were raised amid the respected and beloved leader's revolutionary comradeship and human love, and single-hearted unity was achieved in the entire society in which all people are strongly united based on comradely love and revolutionary moral obligation. The respected and beloved leader's is a great bosom that amazes all people and leads them into a single worthwhile revolutionary road. The boundless love in trusting anyone who has embarked on a revolutionary road and leading him to a worthwhile struggle; the boundless magnanimity in embracing even those who have different political views, religions, or classes and leading them to a noble patriot road; and the generosity in leading even those who have committed mistakes on a revolutionary road to make a fresh start and responsibly taking care of their destinies to the end: This is the nature of the great leader. Captivated by this character of the great leader Comrade Kim Il- song, who is a human being of human beings and a politician of politicians, the revolutionary warriors follow him, the people follow him, and all fellow countrymen follow him. The respected and beloved leader, who is best in ideology, best in achievements, and best in virtue, is truly the eternal sun for the survival of our people and nation. Today our people have an honorable and rewarding task of further solidifying the ties of kinship with their leader [suryong] and their leader [yongdoja] and vigorously accelerating the general onward march of our-style socialism with the might of wholehearted unity. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has noted: We should attach the greatest importance to the unity and cohesion of the party and the popular masses, strengthen and develop it onto a higher plane, and make the party a mighty party taking deeper root in the popular masses. The wholehearted unity of the leader, the party, and the people has been and will be the life line of our style socialism and the ever-victorious banner. We must make the road of our revolution's onward march a history of the strongest ties of kinship between the leader [suryong] and the people and between the leader [yongdoja] and the fighter. To do this, all the party members and working people should, above all, unite around the party and the leader with the great pride in being blessed with the happiness of having the leader. The greatest happiness of the people is enjoying the leadership of the great leader [widaehan suryong] who has brilliant wisdom, outstanding leadership, and noble virtue. Their greatest misfortune is having a wrong leader [kajang kun purhaengun yongdojarul chalmot mannanungosida]. This is well proven by the long history of the international communist movement and today's reality. Socialism, which was built over decades, fell in many countries, and the people in those countries are in distress. The fundamental cause of this was that they did not have the leader who is faithful to the cause of socialism and the people. Our people are a proud people who have always lived enjoying the tested leadership of the great leader [suryong] and the great leader [yongdoja] throughout the entire period of the revolution and construction. Upholding the respected and beloved Comrade Kim Il-song, our people have been able to display their glory of a great people who have traversed the road of independence and socialism without deviation. Upholding the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, they are able to display their pride in being a happy people inheriting and completing the cause of the revolution most brilliantly. The greatest blessing our people enjoy is the blessing of having the leader. Greeting the festive 15 April holiday, we must bear this happiness deeper in our hearts and renew our resolve to devote ourselves to the party and the leader with utmost loyalty and filial duty. We must have a firm faith that we will never fail to be victorious because we have the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il--the general of generals who is skilled in both literary and military arts and tames a fierce head wind--as the great leader [yongdoja] of our party and people and as the supreme commander of the revolutionary armed forces, and crush any maneuvers of the imperialists resolutely with a revolutionary offensive. Because we are blessed with the happiness of having the leader, we must be loyal and dutiful to the leader. The faith in and the revolutionary volition to the leader--this is a warm conscience not forgetting the benevolence of the leader who has brought us up as a revolutionary and who has given us true life, and it is a firm revolutionary principle of not deserting our pledge to the leader even in a solitary island in the distant sea or on a guillotine. The ties of kinship with our leader are more firmly connected and unbreakable by this faith and fidelity. All the party members and working people must not only cherish their loyalty to the great leader and the dear comrade leader as their firm faith but make it their conscience, morality, and life so that they can firmly prepare themselves to be loyalists and dutiful children not knowing any change of mind. Resolutely adhering and adding luster to our-style socialism, which was built by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and led by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is the loftiest duty of all the party members and working people. In the superior chuche socialist system and in all the gains of the revolution built in this land are the labors of the respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song which he devoted in the long and arduous path of the revolution, as well as the blood and perspiration of the revolutionary martyrs who were boundlessly loyal to the leader. No matter what complicated situation may be created against us and no matter what trials may overtake us, we can never give up these gains or allow them to be damaged. With unswerving confidence in the correctness and future of the chuche-based socialist cause pioneered on our own, all the people should more firmly bear the revolutionary determination to follow the road of socialism to the end under the leadership of respected and beloved supreme commander General Kim Chong-il. All the party members and working people should invariably implement revolutionary lines and principles, including the line of three revolutions, construction of self-reliant national economy, and the military line of self-reliance which have been consistently adhered to by the great leader and the comrade dear leader, and should further vigorously accelerate the general march movement of socialism of our own style. We should manifest the might of socialism of our own style to the whole world by marking a new advance in the struggle to implement the party's revolutionary economic strategy while highly displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude. Consolidating our party and people's single-hearted unity centered around the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il into an impregnable fortress is a firm guarantee for inheriting and completing the chuche-based socialist cause to the end. All functionaries and party members should inherit our revolution's tradition of single-hearted unity, always bear in mind the great leader's teaching that we should strengthen reunification and cohesion with the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as the center, and regard the teaching as a firm guidance to all party works and activities. As did the anti-Japanese revolutionary martyrs, who had the great Comrade Hanbyol as the center of the cohesion and leadership and staunchly defended him in the past, we should defend our destiny and defender Comrade Kim Chong-il as bullets and gun shells to the end. We should strengthen the ranks' principal cohesion based on the faithfulness toward the party and the leader and revolutionary comradeship, and make our society a big family with the great leader and the dear leader as our father, and develop it as a warm society where everyone helps and leads each other as real brothers. More than 80 years have passed since the great sun rose in the dark sky of Korea. What our people have invariably kept in their minds during the meaningful days when the most significant incidents of the 20th century took place is the enthusiastic wish to uphold the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song for thousands and tens of thousands of years until the sun and the moon vanish. Our people's respect grows as more new records are added to the chronicle of the chuche cause. With the great pride and self- confidence of upholding the great leader Comrade Kim Chong-il -- the most experienced leader of our times -- our people will vigorously fight on to complete the chuche-based socialist cause. Our revolutionary cause, which is vigorously advancing with the harmonious unity between the great leader and the great people, is forever victorious and indomitable.
