Since Japan maintains a wide-ranging relationship with Iran, Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin briefed the guest on the MIA's issue. The Japanese vice minister also met with Shim'on Sheves, the director general of the Prime Minister's Office, and with Foreign Ministry Director General Uri Savir, both of whom raised the importance of closer economic relations between the two countries and the issue of El Al's landing privileges in Japan. Shim'on Sheves told the visiting vice minister that the situation in which Israel buys $1 billion worth of Japanese goods, while Japan avoids investing in Israel, is unacceptable.
