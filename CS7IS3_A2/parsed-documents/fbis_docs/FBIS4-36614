Priority will be given to the completion of territorial integrity through the consecration of the return of the Saharan provinces to the homeland and the carrying on of efforts for the settlement of the territorial dispute with Spain over Sebta and Mellilia and the neighboring islands, the new prime minister said. Filali solemnly said the government 'will see to it that nothing put at stake the legitimate recovery by Morocco of its Saharan provinces and that the rights and peace of Moroccan citizens be strictly respected'. Concerning Sebta and Mellilia, Filali said wisdom and shared interests recommend that Spain and Morocco resort to dialog and understanding to settle the dispute over the Presidios. The government deems that King Hassan II's proposal to set up a reflection cell as the best means to reach a solution that respects Morocco's sovereign rights and preserves Spanish economic interests. Underlining the national mobilization around the territorial integrity issue, Filali said 'We hope that we can rely on this same mobilization to address, together, the sensitive internal issues we are facing up regarding the promotion of human rights, the improvement of the public service, the sound management of justice on the one hand and the improvement of the living standards of our co-citizens, of employment and of education on the other'. Filali pledged that the government will endeavor to consolidate the state of law and to see to it that all citizens enjoy their rights before listing all the initiatives made in this field during the past years. He said the government undertakes to further promote the respect and protection of human rights and to resolutely act to enhance the civil and political rights of citizens, improve their economic, social and cultural rights and consolidate the rights of women, children and vulnerable populations. At the economic and financial scale, Filali said the government will carry on efforts for the modernization of the Moroccan economy through the adoption of 'an economic and social policy based, in the short run, on maintaining the major basic balances and curbing public deficits'. The government also pledges 'to speed up the privatization process' and to continue the quest for a sustained development particularly in matters of employment. In this regard, Filali underlined that employment upgrading will be at the core of the action of the government, which will encourage all job-generating projects. In the social field, the government 'will strive to meet the basic needs of the population in matters of housing and health through the development of a social solidarity network.' The government will also 'continue, in line with the royal guidelines, discussions with the economic and social partners within a franc, responsible and constructive dialog with a view to edifying a prosperous society that opens new horizons for the lower layers of the society.' The prime minister stressed Morocco's will to efficiently participate in the edification of the grand Maghreb and to help Arab countries settle the Middle-East problems. As to Moroccan-European relations, Abdellatif Filali said these relations which 'have developed through years are still marked by some disequilibrium in trade, economic and financial matters'. Moroccan-European discussions on a new partnership accord 'are facing serious difficulties and suffer from a divergence in approach and vision', the prime minister said, adding the offer made by the union concerning a new partnership form was deemed insufficient by Morocco, which presented, last February, counter-proposals to the union based on a geo-strategic vision. 'Morocco cannot conclude a new accord with the union, unless it is founded on sound and balanced bases, guarantees a genuine and a mutually beneficial partnership and meets Morocco's requirements in social and economic matters', he said. The prime minister undertook to inform the parliament on the evolution of these questions and renewed his will to open up the channels of dialog with the parliament and create a new climate that consolidates the dignity of institutions. The governmental declaration, made following the setting up last Tuesday of a new cabinet, will be discussed by the parliament as of next Monday before the confidence vote.
