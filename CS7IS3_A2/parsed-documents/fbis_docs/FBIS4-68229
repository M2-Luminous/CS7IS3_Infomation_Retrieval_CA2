Despite some progress, the talks were difficult. The stumbling block is the agreement's second article, which deals with the time-table for withdrawing the 14th Army from Moldavia [Moldova]. Differences over it have yet to be overcome. As is known, the Moldavian [Moldovan] side is insisting that the army be withdrawn by July 1 of this year, while Russia would prefer to resolve this issue only after the special status of the Dniestr region has been defined and social guarantees provided for former servicemen and members of their families. The delegations exchanged new texts of the article in Kishinev and decided to continue its discussion in the next round. Anatol Tsaran, the Republic of Moldavia's [Moldova's] ambassador to the Russian Federation and the leader of the Moldavian delegation to the talks, said at a press conference that the Moldavian side had proposed a new time-table for withdrawing the units of the 14th Army over one year or a maximum of two years. The Russian side disagrees with this and is proposing a longer period of time on account of the social and housing problems involved in withdrawing the troops and, to a certain extent, the unresolved Dniestr region issue. So far, the talks have for the most part succeeded in resolving only the issue of the troops' status. During the just-ended round the delegation chiefs initialed a draft agreement between the two countries on issues of jurisdiction and mutual legal assistance with respect to matters relating to the temporary presence of Russian Army units on the territory of Moldavia, as well as an agreement between the Russian and Moldavian governments on social guarantees and pensions for former servicemen and members of their families. As regards the 14th Army's property and weapons, the Chief of the Russian delegation at the talks, special ambassador Vladimir Kitayev, stressed all of it is owned by Russia. Representatives of the Dniestr region participated in the talks, as they had done in previous rounds. The next round is to be held in May in Moscow.
