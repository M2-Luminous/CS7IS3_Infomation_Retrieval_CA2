FBIS4-59213 "drnes091_l_94010" FBIS-NES-94-091 Daily Report 11 May 1994 ISRAEL Jerusalem Mayor Interviewed on City's Future Jerusalem Mayor Interviewed on City's Future TA0605140794 TA0605140794 BFN [Editorial Report] Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew on 6 May on page B5 carries a 2,000-word interview with Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert by Nadav Shragay. The place and date of the interview are not given. Asked about Palestinian political activity emanating from Orient House and other PLO offices in East Jerusalem, Olmert says that the Palestinians are preparing for a difficult struggle over Jerusalem, adding that he has already warned the government about what is taking place in East Jerusalem. He remarks: "I do not know how much determination the government is evincing with regard to this issue. Let me say with all due caution: I am not claiming that Peres and Rabin want to divide the city. It would be unfair and unjust to say this, but this does not mean they are doing what is necessary to prevent this from happening. They are avoiding taking the necessary steps in order not to harm the negotiations with the PLO." Asked about steps he would implement in this respect, Olmert says: "I would take any step necessary to curb Palestinian political activity in East Jerusalem, barring infringements on civil rights, such as freedom of speech." He adds: "I would close down Orient House, and not only Orient House. I would not like to say anything beyond this." Asked about a purported secret agreement between Israel and the PLO, according to which the Arab villages in Jerusalem will be put under Palestinian sovereignty while the new Jewish neighborhoods will remain under Israeli sovereignty and the Old City will receive international status, Olmert says that such plans are occasionally floated unofficially; however, he emphasizes, "I know for certain that there is no such agreement or understanding." Asked whether it is possible to achieve peace with the Arab states and the Palestinians without compromising on Jerusalem, Olmert asserts: "The answer is unequivocally affirmative. They never really cared about Jerusalem. The city never served as the capital of any Arab country. At some future point, they will have to decide whether all the great achievements they have scored should be compromised in order to realize their demand for a political position in Jerusalem. I believe they realize that their room for maneuver in Jerusalem is negligible." Queried about his construction and development plans in Jerusalem, Olmert states: "If you want to know whether I support confiscation of land where necessary for construction and development in Jerusalem, the answer is: absolutely yes." He adds: "I believe Jerusalem should expand eastward, because further westward development would soon turn Jerusalem into a suburb of Tel Aviv." Olmert concedes that "naturally, this planning concept has political ramifications." Asked whether this concept might lead to the conclusion that the city's jurisdiction should be extended eastward to include land slated to be incorporated in the autonomy, Olmert answers: "This may very well be one of the results, and it might be necessary to do so in the near future."
