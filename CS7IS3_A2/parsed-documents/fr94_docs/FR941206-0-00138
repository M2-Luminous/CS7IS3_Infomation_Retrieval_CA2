FR941206-0-00138 FR941206-0-00019 Second, determination of the volatile organic concentration of the waste under the final rule is based on the organic composition of the waste at the ``point of waste origination'' (instead of the ``point of waste generation'' as proposed). The ``point of waste origination'' is defined in the final rule with respect to the point where the TSDF owner or operator first has possession of a hazardous waste. When the TSDF owner or operator is the generator of the hazardous waste, the ``point of waste origination'' means the point where a solid waste produced by a system, process, or waste management unit is determined to be a hazardous waste as defined in 40 CFR part 261. In this case, this term is being used in a similar manner to the use of the term ``point of generation'' in waste operations air standards established under authority of the Clean Air Act in 40 CFR parts 60, 61, and 63 of this chapter. When neither the TSDF owner nor operator is the generator of the hazardous waste, the ``point of waste origination'' means the point where the owner or operator accepts delivery or takes possession of the hazardous waste. Finally, the EPA revised the impact analysis used for this rulemaking after proposal to incorporate additional TSDF industry data. An opportunity for public comment on this analysis was provided by the EPA (refer to sections III.B and VI.B of this preamble). Based on the revised analysis results, the EPA selected a new value for the volatile organic concentration limit. Section V.C of this preamble presents the rationale for the selection of the control option used as the basis for the final rule. b. Treated hazardous waste exemption. Under the subpart CC standards, each affected tank, surface impoundment, and container that manages hazardous waste having an average volatile organic concentration equal to or greater than 100 ppmw, as determined by the procedures specified in the rule, is required to use air emission controls in accordance with the rule requirements. The owner or operator must install and operate the specified air emission controls on every affected tank, surface impoundment, and container used in the waste management sequence from the point of waste origination (as applies to the specific hazardous waste stream) through the point where the organics in the waste are removed or destroyed by a process in accordance with the requirements of the rule. If a particular hazardous waste is not treated to meet these requirements, then all affected units at the TSDF used in the waste management sequence for this hazardous waste are required to use the air emission controls specified by the subpart CC standards. If the hazardous waste is treated to remove or destroy the organics in the waste by a process that meets or exceeds a minimum level of performance as specified in the rule, then affected units at the TSDF operated downstream of the treatment process in the waste management sequence for this hazardous waste are not required to use the air emission controls specified by the subpart CC standards. It is important to emphasize that tanks, surface impoundments, and containers (subject to the rule) in which the treatment process is conducted are required to use the applicable air emission controls specified by the subpart CC standards with the exception of certain tanks and surface impoundments used for active biological treatment of hazardous waste and achieving the performance requirements specified in the rule (this exception is explained further in section VII.A.4 of this preamble).
