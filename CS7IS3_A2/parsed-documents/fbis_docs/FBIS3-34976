The ministry had threatened AFP with legal action for not publishing the government's version of two incidents on Monday--an attack on a bus carrying Romanian engineers in south Egypt, and an explosion in a northern town. The ministry summoned bureau chief David Daure on Tuesday who rejected accusations that AFP was giving a lopsided version of events in its coverage of the Muslim fundamentalist campaign against the government. Officials accepted his comments and said they considered the matter closed. The bus attack, which caused no injuries, was claimed by the underground al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah in a statement sent to AFP. The ministry, in comments carried by AFP, said the attack was aimed at the bus company because it had recently laid off staff and thus had nothing to do with the campaign against foreigners. In the explosion in the town of Tanta, which wounded seven people, police originally said it was caused by a bomb, but the ministry later said it was a leftover wartime shell, which AFP also reported. Relations between the government and foreign press have been strained since fundamentalists launched a campaign two years ago which has killed 301 people. The much-publicised campaign has frightened away foreign tourists, costing the government billions of dollars in lost revenue.
