This can be seen from a comparison between the Agriculture Ministry's analysis of salmonella in processed products from slaughterhouses and the Danish Slaughterhouse Associations' own study of salmonella in Swedish pork. The Nordic Council has set a limit of 5 percent on the content of salmonella in samples from slaughterhouses. At the annual meeting of the National Committee on Swine yesterday the chairman of the Danish Slaughterhouse Association, Bent Sloth, revealed that the Danish slaughterhouse average is 2.7 percent. On Friday the slaughterhouse group will meet with Agriculture Minister Bjorn Westh (Social Democrat) to discuss an action plan to combat salmonella.
