To give precedence to the ideological education of the party members and other working people is a consistent policy of the Workers' Party of Korea. The editorial says ideological education is the work to train the party members and other working people to be genuine revolutionaries of Chuche type and arouse them to the revolutionary struggle and construction work. Ideological revolution is the pilot of the revolution, the editorial notes, and goes on: Ideological front is an acute battlefront in confrontation with the imperialists. Today the imperialists are intensifying their anti-socialist ideological offensive as never before. In order to smash corrupt bourgeois ideology, morality and way of life and maintain the purity of socialism it is imperative to fully prepare the people ideologically. The ideological revolution is a mighty way of defeating imperialism and achieving the victory of socialism. Intensifying ideological education still further is a decisive guarantee for successfully carrying out the revolutionary tasks facing our party and revolution. Only when ideological education is intensified, is it possible to make the party members and other working people effect a fresh upswing on all fronts of socialist construction, breaking through difficulties. What is important in intensifying ideological education at present is to make all the party members and other working people cherish singlehearted loyalty and unite around the party and the leader as firm as a rock. The editorial also lays stress on continuously pushing ahead with the work of firmly arming the party members and other working people with the Chuche idea and the revolutionary traditions of our party and on intensifying education in socialist patriotism among them to infuse them with noble patriotism of defending the country. The editorial calls for concentrating efforts on the education of youth and children, the successor to the revolution in particular.
