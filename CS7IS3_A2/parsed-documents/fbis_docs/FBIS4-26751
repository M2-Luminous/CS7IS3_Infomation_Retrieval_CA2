FBIS4-26751 "drchi123_n_94017" FBIS-CHI-94-123 Daily Report 26 Jun 1994 Economic & Agricultural Audio, Video Copyright Certification System Implemented Audio, Video Copyright Certification System Implemented HK2606050794 Beijing CHINA DAILY in English 26 Jun 94 p 3 HK2606050794 Beijing CHINA DAILY English BFN [By Gao Jin'an: "Copyright Gets More Protection"] [Text] In a fresh move to further protect the rights and interests of overseas copyright owners, China is to implement a copyright certification system for audio and video products. Under the system, foreign agencies will be asked to provide copyright certificates for audio and video products which are to be distributed and shown in China. Wang Huapeng, director of the Copyright Department under the National Copyright Administration (NCA), said that the new system will help to protect overseas copyright owners while checking piracy. The Motion Picture Industiy Association (MPIA) of Hong Kong became the first agency to be entrusted to provide copyright certificates for Hong Kong videos and laser discs which are to be introduced into the mainland market. A memorandum on copyright certification between the NCA and MPIA of Hong Kong was signed yesterday in Beijing, marking the first step for the implementation of the certification system. Gao Linghan, a senior official from the NCA, disclosed that the administration is now contacting and negotiating with the London-based International Federation of the Phonograph Industry and two American associations for copyright certification. After the signing ceremony, Crucindo Hung, chairman of the MPIA, said that member companies of his association produce over 90 per cent of home videos in Hong Kong each year, and a large number of them are likely to be popular on the mainland. Hung hopes that his association's co-operation with the NCA will be further expanded. The MPLA was founded in 1986 and it now has 150 member companies in the territory. In the past years, Chinese audio and video companies have found it difficult to identify the copyright owners of overseas products. Some foreign crooks took the opportunity to cheat Chinese companies, thus putting them at risk of copyright infringement. China implemented its Copyright Law in 1991, placing all copyrights under legal protection. The country joined the World Intellectual Property Organization in 1980 and became a signatory of three more conventions in 1993, namely the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, the Universal Copyright Convention and the Convention for the Protection of Producers of Phonograms against Unauthorized Duplication of Their Phonograms in 1993.
