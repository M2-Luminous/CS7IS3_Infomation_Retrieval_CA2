During this interview with MEDIA DUEMILA, Colombo describes the difficulties of a ministry, that more than many others, and with less justification, is being affected by the sacrifices of a period of crisis. He was, almost without interruption, president of the ENEA [National Agency for New Technologies, Energy, and the Environment] from the end of the seventies to his nomination as minister in May. Colombo is 66 years old and comes from Leghorn, the same city as Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the prime minister. He graduated with a degree in physical chemistry from Pavia and then taught applied chemistry. Between 1967 and 1979 he was director of the Donegani research institute and was, therefore, responsible for the development strategies of Montedison. In 1979 he was nominated president of what was then the CNEN (today ENEA), a position that he left for a period of four months (November 1982-February 1983) to take on the presidency of ENI [National Hydrocarbons Corporation]. He returned to the CNEN in March 1983, at the time when the CNEN became the ENEA. Whilst he was president, ENEA changed from being responsible for nuclear energy at a national level, to managing three types of initiatives: the new technologies, energy (not just nuclear energy), and the environment. In recent years, under the guidance of Colombo, the attention of the ENEA has turned to the problems of global climatic changes (the greenhouse effect) and of development that is in harmony with our resources. Umberto Colombo is on the executive committee of the Rome club, and is a member of the Academia dei Lincei. In 1984 he won the Honda international prize for environmental technology. [MEDIA DUEMILA] Italy is the G7 country that spends the least on research as a percentage of GNP. You denounced this situation more than once before you became minister. What are you doing now, and what do you intend to do to change this situation? What margins do you have for maneuvers in the current context of reductions in public expenditure? [Colombo] We know that Italy's financial commitment to research and higher education is rather modest when compared to that of the other countries that we are usually compared with and we are doing everything possible to balance this situation despite difficulties regarding public funding. R&D expenditure is about 1.4 percent of GNP. This is about half what the other major western countries spend. The universities are in a similar situation. Not only does Italy have a low level of expenditure, but the efficiency with which this expenditure is managed is also weak. The most significant room for maneuver that we have at this time is that of improving efficiency and effectiveness. We are putting a lot of effort in this direction, using a number of different mechanisms: the coordination of programs, the evaluation and checking of the merit of research projects that are supported by public funding, and the streamlining of procedures. [MEDIA DUEMILA] Italian research has often had little to do with industrial applications and production. It has given priority to the fundamental and theoretical aspects. What do you think can be done to assist the transfer of innovation to industry, and eventually through the introduction of laws? How do you think any such action could improve the competitiveness of the Italian system and, furthermore, influence economic recovery and employment? [Colombo] By nature research must be subdivided into several levels, ranging from free basic research, to that with a fundamental direction, and the applied research that is conducted by industry. The problem is that of establishing forms of coordination between these various levels, singling out the subjects that are also of strategic importance for university and public research in such a way as to create the conditions required for technological development. We are putting these guidelines into practice by creating special commissions to direct research leading to the main socioeconomic goals that are of interest to the country. Every program should be monitored by expert evaluators from now on. They will also see to the exploitation of the results that are obtained in order to help transfer the results of public research. Then the peer review methods that are usual in advanced countries will also be applied in Italy. The effort of bringing our industry up to the potential of international competition requires the technological development that is obtained from being able to translate the results of research into innovation, particularly by favoring small and medium-sized companies. We are therefore promoting and reinforcing public and private instruments to support these actions: technological information bureaus, information networks, and networks providing company support and bringing the researchers in specific geographical areas together. Support for valid research is also a condition for maintaining and structurally developing employment in the country. Our culture has not understood well that it is only possible to keep jobs by promoting competitive production at an international level and quickly preparing products to meet a demand that is rapidly evolving. Technology is the key instrument for attaining these goals. [MEDIA DUEMILA] In which sectors of advanced research do you think Italy is best placed in a European and world context? On the other hand, in which sectors do you think the greatest efforts should be made? I would like your reply to concentrate on the sectors that are potentially strategic for the "Year 2000 Horizon" including telecommunications, computers, semiconductors and biotechnologies. [Colombo] It is true that generally speaking Italy holds an inferior position on the scientific and technological front with respect to the other advanced countries. However, it is also true that our research system is capable of exhibiting peaks of high, or extremely high, qualification in certain sectors. This is often thanks to individual researchers, or excellent small research groups. The problem is that these peaks cannot be amassed, or become a structural school. The main exception to this picture is that of high energy and nuclear physics, where the great traditions of the Italian school have been maintained in a preeminent position at an international level. We must try to develop these points of excellence in order to generate science-based productive activities around them. We are behind in the dominant and emerging technologies, such as computer science, advanced materials, and the new biotechnologies. Therefore our effort is being aimed at finding the strong points that can be levered, and these are not lacking here either, and singling out the scientific and technological segments that are structurally valid. In order to do this, we need to work closely with industry. Industry can work alongside the State effort, if we have a more longsighted strategic vision than at present. [MEDIA DUEMILA] Italian research has never played the role of a lion at an EC level; and it has rarely managed to get a slice of the EC funding cake that was even equal to the sums paid in. Furthermore, the participation of small and medium-sized companies in EC programs has hitherto been less than was expected. What initiatives have you taken, or do you intend to take to avoid delays and shortages? As far as the new EC research program for the coming years is concerned, what activities do you think Italian interest should be concentrated on? [Colombo] Italy does not manage to obtain the just return for research with respect to the contributions paid to the European Community. What are the reasons for this? A small volume of industrial research that mainly has short-term goals can only make the acquisition of European contracts difficult. Analogously, the small amount of internationalization of the companies, particularly the small companies, makes it difficult for them to find partners in other countries, and this is necessary to have access to EC funding. We are working to improve this situation by reinforcing the technical support structures at the ministry, with the inclusion of a strong industrial component, that had little presence before. [MEDIA DUEMILA] What is your opinion of the research priorities that have been hitherto suggested by the EC research programs that have been managed by Italian commissioners and by EUREKA [European Research Coordination Agency] since 1989? Do you think that the innovation gap between Europe and the world partners, the United States and Japan, is closing up or widening? [Colombo] Unfortunately we must recognize that, although praiseworthy efforts have been made, the gap is widening, and Europe is losing ground. This is due to the fact that it has not known how to gain competitive advantage from new factors that were not its traditional ones. This does not mean that the EC and EUREKA programs have not been useful. In fact, without them, things would have been undoubtedly worse. They have not sufficed, because they have not been aggressive enough. The definition of EC programs takes an intrinsically long time, and the "bottom-up" type process of EUREKA finishes with dispersive choices being made. Lengthy timing, too many projects, little concentration of resources, and above all a conservative attitude that does not completely renew goals and productive, organizational, and administrative structures, are the European problems, that EUREKA and the EC programs do not manage to overcome, but only to ease. [MEDIA DUEMILA] You have recently spent four months as a commissioner of the Italian Space Agency. Are there conditions for relaunching Italian space activity, and if so what are they, and how are they set out? [Colombo] The space agency is coming out of a state of crisis that has characterized the last few years of its work. This has, in part, been due to the problems that were created by the lack of a clear definition in the law that set it up. The space sector is a sector that looks to the future. Here Italy has won a position of respect, both in Europe, and at a world level. We need to make better use of the resources available. Amongst other things, we must create a better synergy than in the past between civilian space and military space, given that the international political picture has changed, and consequently the technological goals that defense must have in the space sector are different. More in general, and not just with reference to space, it is important to focus on the problem of the so-called "dual use" products, so that the general crisis of the defense industry does not strike again on the national production machine.
