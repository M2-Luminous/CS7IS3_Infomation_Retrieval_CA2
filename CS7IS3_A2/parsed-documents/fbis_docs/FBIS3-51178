On the afternoon of 11 January, six Alliance for Parliamentary Cohesion [ACP] senators joined the senators elected on 18 January to dismiss the president of the Senate, Senator Firmin Jean-Louis. Grand'Anse Sen. Bernard Sansaricq said President Jean-Louis' management is at the root of the threat of dissolution of the Haitian parliament brandished today by the far Right. [passage omitted] Furthermore, during this session at the Senate of the Republic, there was also the issue of setting the quorum at nine instead of 11 [senators]. After much discussion, the participants in this session adopted a resolution read by Sen. Osny Eugene, one of the parliamentarians elected 18 January. [Begin Sansaricq recording, in Creole] We know that the Senate of the Republic must remain the champion of democracy and freedom that it is. As a Haitian, I was saddened to hear that 200 people in Cite Soleil had lost their homes. Their houses were burned because the Senate was not there to do its job, because the far Right was able to go into the streets. In this respect, I personally accuse President Firmin Jean-Louis. If the Senate had been there to assume its responsibilities beside and leading the Haitian Army, the Army would not have let that happen in Cite Soleil. [end recording] This was Sen. Bernard Sansaricq in his intervention on 11 January at this session of the Senate of the Republic, a session in which the National Front for Change and Democracy members did not participate. We spoke of the resolution adopted at the Senate of Republic on 11 January by the ACP senators and the parliamentarians elected 18 January. The resolution set the quorum at nine instead of 11. Let us listen to this resolution as read by Sen. Osny Eugene. [Begin Eugene recording] Article 1. In order to have at our disposal new and sufficient statutory provisions to allow us to face the serious climate of the times, the provisional quorum of the Senate is hereby set at nine members. Article 2. The Senate Office formed by acclamation on Tuesday, 10 August, 1993 is and remains dismissed as of today. Article 3. A new Senate Provisional Office called the Office of the Safeguard of National Sovereignty and Public Safety, designated by the acronym BSNP, is constituted. The mission of BSNP is: first, urgently to proceed to elect a final Office; second, to ensure that the interests of the Senate of the Republic that is now endangered are safeguarded; third, expressly to address a copy to all those -- including civilian, military, parliamentary authorities, or individuals -- concerned by the present Resolution.
