The goal of summoning Hermoza is to have him explain the charges filed by EP Major Evaristo Castillo Aste (Ret) and EP Captain Ricardo Falconi Alvarez (Ret) on alleged support supplied by bad military elements to notorious drug traffickers and their ties. Moreyra's petition makes us recall what happened a few months ago when, summoned by the CCD Human Rights Committee chaired at that time by Roger Caceres (FNTC) (Workers and Peasants National Front), Hermoza Rios flatly denied that any Army members had anything to do with the disappearance of nine students and a professor from La Cantuta University and claimed that those who disputed his denial were conducting a campaign against our country's guardian institution. The following day the tanks were out on the streets. Maybe recalling this event, Moreyra makes it clear that his proposal is based "solely and exclusively on the fact that the bad elements who are wearing uniforms our country has given them and are openly--and with impunity--acting against national interests, degrading their institution, must be thoroughly investigated and exemplarily punished to safeguard the image, credibility, and respect of our Armed Forces."
