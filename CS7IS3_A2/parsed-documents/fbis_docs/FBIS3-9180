Has the government adopted measures to liquidate this daily? [Moravcik] The government does not have the means to liquidate dailies. Or does it? The press ought to be independent, also economically. I believe that it can fulfill its role only when it is independent. [REPUBLIKA] In other words, you have not dealt with the liquidation of REPUBLIKA in the government? [Moravcik] No, not yet.
