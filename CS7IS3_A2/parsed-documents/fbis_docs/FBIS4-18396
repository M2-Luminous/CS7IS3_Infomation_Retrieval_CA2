Ciller, True Path Party leader and prime minister, is continuing to seek a consensus in connection with the economic stability package. She first visited Motherland Party [ANAP] leader Mesut Yilmaz at his office in parliament. In a statement before the meeting, Ciller said that the main aim of her visit was to seek a consensus in connection with the economic measures. She said she would explain her views and listen to the views of the opposition leader. She said: [Begin Ciller recording] We are starting an important struggle. We want a consensus from every sector of the society. We will listen to the views of the opposition leader. Naturally, different views might be expressed. However, I consider this a national problem, therefore I think it is appropriate for me to set off with this approach. I will also have the opportunity to ask him for his opinion on other issues. [end recording] In a statement after the meeting, ANAP leader Yilmaz said that Ciller briefed him on the economic measures she will disclose tomorrow. He said that Ciller asked that this information not be divulged until she announces the measures tomorrow. Yilmaz said that he will express his views on the economic measures after the prime minister announces them. Asked if the prime minister asked for his support for the economic measures, Yilmaz replied: [Begin Yilmaz recording] She did not ask for our direct support. However, she stressed that these measures are inevitable given the current state of the economy, that they are, in fact, late in coming. She said that she expects us to approach the issue with this understanding. [end recording] Yilmaz pointed out that at the end of their meeting, the prime minister asked him his opinion about a unification of the right. Yilmaz said that he reiterated his earlier remarks on the issue. [Begin Yilmaz recording] I pointed out that there is a coalition government at the moment. I said that we do not consider it right, in principle, to discuss the issue as long as this coalition is in power. I said, however, that if this issue becomes actual in the future for whatever reason, if Turkey is faced with such a necessity, we will approach this issue constructively. [end recording] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller met with Prosperity Party leader Necmettin Erbakan. Before the meeting, the prime minister said that she would brief Erbakan on the economic package and listen to his views. She stressed that a first step will be taken tomorrow in implementing a series of important economic measures. Within this framework, she said, I will visit all the party leaders, adding: This is such a struggle but it can succeed if all the sectors in the country are united in supporting it as much as possible. In a statement after the meeting, Erbakan said that the package is nothing but new price hikes, taxes, and the closing of factories. He maintained that this will crush the people and said that he warned the prime minister that there will be social explosions in the end. He alleged that the economic package will further exacerbate the rate of inflation and unemployment. Asked if the prime minister asked for his party's support, Erbakan replied: [Begin Erbakan recording] We listened to the outline the prime minister gave us. It became clear once again that what they call a package involves nothing but price hikes, the closing down of numerous institutions, and new taxes -- everything to be carried out in periods of three months. We warned her about what these measures might lead to. [end recording] Prime Minister Ciller then briefed the True Path Party Assembly group on the economic measures. It was a closed session.
