In his turn, Vladimir Kryzhanovskiy [Volodymyr Kryzhanovskyy], Ukrainian ambassador to Russia, commented on the developments in Crimea of last night and today as follows: [Begin Kryzhanovskiy recording] What coup can they be talking about in the Crimea? A parliamentary session is being held there today, it is working calmly and taking decisions which may be right, or not quite right, or wrong. You know, special purpose troops can be sent to any part of Ukraine at any time -- but do I, as an ambassador, need to know about these things? Crimea is Ukrainian territory in the same sense as Ivano-Frankovsk, or Donetsk, or Zhitomir, or Odessa. All right, supposing special troops did go there -- so what? Do you think I am very much concerned about the movement of a mere 10 or 15 servicemen from the special troops around Ukraine? All is quiet in Ukraine, a session is in progress in Crimea -- so what coup d'etat are we talking about? [end recording]
