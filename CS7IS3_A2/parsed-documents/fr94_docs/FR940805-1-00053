FR940805-1-00053 FR940805-1-00012 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 48 CFR Parts 207, 237, and 252 Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement; Continuation of Essential Contractor Services During Crises AGENCY: Department of Defense (DoD). ACTION: Withdrawal of proposed rule. SUMMARY: The rule published September 30, 1993 (58 FR 51033), which proposed revisions to the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) to add policy, procedures, and a clause to require contractor agreement to continue performance of essential services during crisis situations is hereby withdrawn. This action is based on the determination that no additional clause is necessary to convey the contractor's duty to perform contracts. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Linda Holcome, telephone (703) 604&hyph;5929. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Defense Acquisition Regulations (DAR) Council, under DAR Case 91&hyph;071, proposed a revision to the DFARS in September 1993 to add a contract clause requiring the contractor to continue to perform essential contract services, and to assert its right to any adjustment necessitated by performance of the essential services, during periods of crisis. These revisions were proposed to implement DoDI 3020.37, Continuation of Essential DoD Contractor Service During Crises. After a review of the public comments, the DAR Council agreed to withdraw the proposed rule from further consideration. Existing FAR and DFARS clauses adequately address the Government's rights to terminate a contract and the contractor's duty to perform. Claudia L. Naugle, Deputy Director, Defense Acquisition Regulations Council. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;19125 Filed 8&hyph;4&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 5000&hyph;04&hyph;M
