The meeting was attended on the Algerian side by Foreign Minister Mohamed Salah Dembri; Mr. Ahmed Ouyahia, secretary of state for Maghreb affairs; Mr. Hedi Messaoudi, head of the Arab Affairs Department at the Foreign Ministry. It was attended on the Palestinian side by brothers Nabil Sha'th, Nasr Yusuf, and Hakam Bal'awi, members of the Fatah Central Committee; and the ambassador of the State of Palestine in Algiers. After his meeting with His Excellency Algerian President Liamine Zeroual, the brother President Abu Ammar made the following statement to reporters: ['Arafat] I put the president in the picture about the great conspiracy that took place in the form of the hideous massacre of our worshippers who were performing the dawn prayers inside the holy al-Ibrahim mosque and also about the collusion and the conspiracy in which elements of the Israeli Army and armed settlers were involved. This reminds us exactly of what happened between the French Secret Army Organization and the Algerian settlers, as if history were repeating itself in both Algeria and in Palestine. I asked the president for Algeria's support in the Security Council and in international circles in order to confront this hideous conspiracy, which is an attempt to obstruct the peace process and the Israeli withdrawal from our land and our homes. It is obvious that this conspiracy had many objectives. It aimed at undermining the safety of the Palestinian national. Hence, our insistence at the Security Council on rapid international protection for the Palestinian people, for our children, our women, and our Islamic and Christian holy places. I would like to remind everyone that this is the second massacre inside our holy places. Let me remind you of the massacre which occurred inside al-Aqsa mosque in holy Jerusalem some time ago, and now this massacre in al-Ibrahim mosque in Hebron, in addition to other Islamic and Christian holy places. Therefore we asked at the Security Council--we insist on it--for an international commission to investigate the crime and for the dispatch of international troops to protect our people from these conspiracies in which elements and units of the Israeli Army are involved with armed settlers. This has now become of paramount importance. I also put the president in the picture about the atmosphere which is ablaze inside our occupied land. There is a sweeping revolution and there are continuous clashes between us and the Israeli Army and also between us and Israeli settlers. It is noticeable, as is clear on all TV networks, that the patrols walking the streets are from the Israeli Army and Israeli settlers. On this very point, I would like to make clear that the Israeli cabinet meeting produced only empty words, and it would be appropriate to quote the saying, what a great to-do with precious little to show for it. It was nothing more than that. Therefore, I call on the world community, the Russian and U.S. peace conference co-sponsors, the European Union and all of the European states, the nonaligned states, the Islamic states, and the Arab countries to assume their responsibility to protect the Palestinian people and to force the Israeli Government to withdraw immediately from our Palestinian territories, starting with Gaza and Jericho and followed by the remainder of our occupied territories so that we can effectively establish our independent Palestinian state with holy Jerusalem as its capital. God willing, this will happen soon. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Mr. President, what is the fate of peace after this massacre? ['Arafat] Undoubtedly it should be clear, and I am addressing this talk to the whole world and the Russian and U.S. peace conference co-sponsors, that peace is blowing in the wind. It is clear that the Israeli side has no intention to be committed to what they have signed, and there is an attempt to evade the deadlines and the withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. [Correspondent] What are the decisions made yesterday after the meeting... ['Arafat, interrupting] In fact, we still are [pauses]... I have come only to brief the president and go back to continue the meeting today because the matter is serious and we are discussing all of its aspects. [Correspondent] What is your stance, especially after the withdrawal of some countries from the peace talks, Syria and Lebanon, for example? [Unidentified person to 'Arafat] Syria and Lebanon announced the withdrawal of their delegations from Washington today. ['Arafat] It is the same story, I have withdrawn all of the delegations, not only from Washington--my brother Nabil Sha'th from Taba, and Cairo and from Paris. We are convening all of the delegations, and I am going back [not further clarified] because all of the delegations are meeting now. That is to say, yesterday and today I have been meeting my brother heads of delegations to Washington, Taba, Paris, and Cairo to look into all details of this situation in the light of the developments and this massacre which is not only a massacre: It is a massacre and a conspiracy, an organized operation exactly like you have experienced in Algeria between the Secret Army Organization and the French settlers.
