The Turkish MP's yesterday arrived on an official visit at the invitation of the Bulgarian Parliament. The question about the participation of Turkish blue helmets in the UN peacekeeping forces in Bosnia was not raised, President's foreign policy adviser Kamen Velichkov said. The fact that this Turkish parliamentary delegation comprises members of four political parties indicates that good-neighbourliness was set the major principle of Turkey's policy by a political consensus, Mr. Cindoruk reportedly told President Zhelev. The two sides identified mutual interests in attracting foreign investments in the region and particularly for the construction of the regional infrastructure, Mr. Velichkov also said. "The Black Sea Economic Cooperation was mentioned along this line of reasoning," the president's adviser said, answering a journalist's question. Earlier in the afternoon the Turkish delegation met Deputy Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev, now sitting in for Prime Minister Berov during the latter's sick leave. The talks focused on the achievements of the military cooperation, control of drug trafficking and organized crime, and mutual interests in the construction of the east-west and north-south trunk roads. "I availed myself of the occasion to stress the losses this country is sustaining as a result of the Yugo-embargo and to call on Turkey to help solve this problem in its capacity as a member of international institutions," Mr. Matinchev said. The acting prime minister also raised the question of Turkey's 2 million U.S. dollar liability to Bulgaria for the water supplied last year. Mr. Matinchev said that the Turkish parliamentary speaker apologized and explained the settlement was belated by the bureaucratic machine in Turkey. He also pledged to address the Turkish prime minister for a speedy solution of this problem. This morning the Turkish guests held long meetings with the Parliamentary National Security and Foreign Policy Committees. Speaking to journalists after the meeting, the leaders of the two committees said that the Bulgarian MP's raised the question of the deployment of Turkish blue helmets in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Both committees reiterated this country's stand in favour of the Balkan countries' non-involvement in the conflict in former Yugoslavia. Mr. Cindoruk said in response that he respects Bulgaria's stance. "As to the Yugo-crisis, the two countries are acting within the framework of the UN decisions, each one of them taking its own stand," Mr. Cindoruk said. He once again explained that it is not Turkish troops but Turkish blue helmets that have been invited to join the UN peacekeeping forces in the Yugo-conflict. Parliamentary National Security Committee Chairman Nikolay Slatinski said that there were no serious debates as to the Turkish blue helmets. "But what we can say is that Turkey first asked to participate and only then was it invited by the UN Security Council," Mr. Slatinski went on to say. The National Security Committee and the Turkish guests discussed some other issues, including the Rezovska River, running along the Turkish-Bulgarian border, fishing in territorial waters in the Black Sea and Bulgarian plots in Turkey. MP's of this parliamentary committee voiced their opinion that it was high time the rights of Bulgarian Muslims were taken out of the Islamic Conference's agenda.
