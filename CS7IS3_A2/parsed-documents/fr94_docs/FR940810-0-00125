FR940810-0-00125 FR940810-0-00021 G. Siebert of the Office of the Secretary of Defense offered an alternate plan_a tiered approach in which thermal system insulation and sprayed-on or troweled-on surfacing materials would be considered high-risk PACM and would be labeled and notification carried out: other material which may contain asbestos (Ex. 162&hyph;13). He suggested that other material, should be handled as ACM unless sampling indicates that it does not contain asbestos, but that it not be required to be labeled. As suggested, OSHA considered extending its presumption requirement to other kinds of building materials which may contain asbestos. A limited extension has been made in two cases. Because of its accessibility and prevalence, the frequent difficulty of identifying its asbestos content and the frequency of maintenance activity which may disturb it matrix. The Agency is requiring that resilient flooring installed before 1980 be presumed to contain asbestos unless rebutted pursuant to the standard. Debris which is present in rooms, enclosures or areas where PACM or high risk ACM is present and not intact, is assumed to be asbestos-containing. Other building materials which may contain asbestos such as roofing material, ceiling tiles and miscellaneous products listed in EPA's ``Green Book'' have not been found to be both as widely prevalent and easily disturbed and damaged as are TSI and surfacing material or as widely prevalent, accessible and frequently disturbed as resilient flooring. Therefore, OSHA believes little additional benefit will result from treating all such building materials which uncommonly contain asbestos as if they do, rather than concentrating resources on protecting employees from exposure to materials when there is actual knowledge or reason to believe they contain asbestos. OSHA notes in this regard that an employer or building owner's duty to investigate the possibility that a material contains asbestos is stronger when the consequences of failing to inquire is increased hazard to employees. For example, in the case where a large section of damaged ceiling tiles installed before 1980 is to be removed, an employer may not ignore the possibility that the tiles are asbestos-containing. By not including some building materials in the presumption OSHA is not reducing an employer's duty to exercise ``due diligence'' when exposing employees to such kinds of materials. The Agency has determined merely that the record does not compel the adoption of a presumption for such materials; in any such specific case, circumstances may require the employer or building owner to sample and analyze building materials for asbestos content, or to treat the material as if it is asbestos-containing under the standard. On a different issue, OSHA is not specifying in the regulatory text the qualifications of the person who may designate materials as PACM. Under AHERA, inspections are required to be conducted by certified inspectors (40 CFR 763, also see recent revisions of Model Accreditation under ASHARA, 59 FR 5236&hyph;5260, February 3, 1994). The Agency has found that designation of the kinds of building materials as PACM is not an inspection. This process does not require technical training: thermal system insulation is easily recognized; sprayed on or troweled on surfacing material likewise is identifiable. Neither EPA's revised MAP nor OSHA requires specific training or accreditation of persons who only visually inspect the condition of ACM/PACM. OSHA emphasizes that the presumption must apply even where it appears to knowledgeable building personnel, that material is not asbestos-containing and is composed of other materials, such as fiberglass. Therefore, OSHA has not adopted the suggestion of some participants to specify that certain materials such as fiberglass and neoprene, because they are easily identifiable, should not be included in the presumption (see Ex. 162&hyph;57). OSHA notes that HEI distinguished a ``visual survey,'' i.e., the identification of suspect materials from more complete surveys, and notes that ``this type of survey may minimize the need for trained consultants.'' (HEI, Ex. 1&hyph;344, at 5.1) Some participants suggested that OSHA include the condition of the material in its ``high-risk'' category to be subject to the presumption. Although the condition of the material influences its risk potential, OSHA continues its practice of not distinguishing materials based on their friability. However, the condition of the material is relevant to whether debris, in the presence of ACM, must be presumed to be asbestos containing. The standard requires that debris in an enclosed area where TSI or surfacing ACM is present, and not intact, be presumed to be asbestos-containing. OSHA has not used friability to distinguish among asbestos containing materials. First, OSHA mainly regulates active disturbances of asbestos, and uses exposure levels as one element in assigning risk-based requirements. Since the friability of material will influence exposure levels, friability is partly subsumed by this reference to exposure levels. Second, the term's precise meaning is unclear, and thus, confusing to the regulated community. The EPA experience in distinguishing risk categories based on friability indicates the complexity of using this concept. In 1973 the EPA&hyph;NESHAP had regulated only friable ACM, but later issued a clarification which stated: *␣*␣*Even though the regulations address only material that is presently friable, it does not limit itself to material that is friable at the time of notification. Rather, if at any point during the renovation of demolition additional friable asbestos material is *␣*␣* created from non-friable forms, this additional friable material becomes subject to the regulations from the time of creation (Ex. 1&hyph;239, p. 48406). Third, OSHA's risk categories which are based on the type of material include the potential for friability. For example, surfacing material is loosely bound and therefore is potentially more friable than are other materials and thus is considered to present high risk.
