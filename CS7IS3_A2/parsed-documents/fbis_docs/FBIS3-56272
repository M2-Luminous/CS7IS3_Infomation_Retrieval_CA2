"All goes well," he told an Interfax correspondent after the first round of talks on Thursday morning [13 January], lasting 20 minutes longer than scheduled. President Bill Clinton arrived in Moscow at about 01:00 on Thursday en route from Kiev, where he held two hours of talks with Ukrainian leader Leonid Kravchuk during a brief stopover at the local airport. In a welcoming speech at the formal ceremony at the Kremlin, to which Clinton was ten minutes late, Yeltsin stressed that their previous summit in Vancouver laid down the groundwork of U.S.- Russian partnership and marked the start of their personal friendship. The Russian leader expressed the hope that current summit talks would be far-reaching, practical and comprehensive. In a reply speech, Clinton said this summit was taking place at an historic moment marking the start of bilateral cooperation for the sake of the future of Europe and the world at large. He pledged cooperation in creating a new security structure in Europe, advocating democratic values and a free economic system to help towards the advancement of all countries. Clinton said the two sides, meeting in full strength, would discuss concrete economic reforms that would help the Russian people reap real benefits from the ongoing transformations. "Russia will continue reforms and there is no question of their slow down." This remark, made by Yeltsin when he met with Clinton at the head of a larger delegation, became the theme of the second hour-long meeting of the two presidents in the Kremlin Thursday. Following the end of this round of talks Oleg Lobov, secretary of the National Security Council, told Interfax that the meeting had demonstrated "America's willingness to provide effective support for Russian reform by paying some of its social costs." In particular, Clinton assured the Russian president that he had succeeded in having Congress appropriate $900 Mn [million] for aid to Russia in 1995. Furthermore, numerous funds, especially one supporting small business, would be launched. The U.S. is prepared to allocate $300 Mn for that purpose. The Clinton Administration is making $100 Mn available for a recently established American-Russian reconstruction of large factories fund. "Solid support" has also been pledged for Russia's joining the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Duties will be lifted from 4,400 Russian products in the U.S. market. The U.S. secretary of Commerce will arrive in Russia in March with a team of experts to study the possibility of closer contacts between U.S. businessmen and Russian state- and privately owned businesses, Lobov said. In his words, Clinton asked Yeltsin to help in finding partners for U.S. businesses. Russia sees the NATO-approved Partnership for Peace program as an important step forward and a serious test of the existing partnership between Russia, the U.S. and other NATO states, Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev told Interfax. Speaking after a meeting with Acting Foreign Minister of Moldova Ion Botnaru, he said the expansion of NATO to include new members would be a simplistic solution. Kozyrev did not contest the right of other countries to join the alliance but "this could lead to the creation of new barriers in Europe if implemented." In his words, Russia's voice was heeded by NATO, Eastern and Central Europe. This is a case illustrating that a short cut is not always optimal, leading nowhere and to wrong decisions, Kozyrev said. By contrast, he added, a longer road can lead to the right destination. The minister said the Partnership for Peace proposal had been discussed by Yeltsin and Clinton on Thursday and that both of them were satisfied it implied partnership rather than membership. Kozyrev spoke of having discussed the problem with U.S. secretary of State Warren Christopher earlier in the day. "It is too early yet to say how the period of partnership will end," the minister said. "One option is to expand NATO by accepting new members, including Russia, something we do not rule out," he said. Other options are also possible, he said, including the creation of broader security systems and the consolidation of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council. The minister called for efforts to be taken in parallel in all those directions but all of these must end up in greater stability and cooperation in Europe. For his part, Botnaru spoke of seeing his talks with the Russian foreign minister as a step on the road to implementing the Partnership for Peace plan. Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who held discussions while Yeltsin and Clinton conferred elsewhere in the Kremlin, finalized four documents that have to be signed "at the ministerial level," in particular agreements on air traffic, on cooperation in health care and biomedical research, on cooperation in research in radiation impact on human health and the environment, and a memorandum of intent on cooperation in expert control, Galina Sidorova, the political adviser of the Russian foreign minister, told Interfax. She noted that Kozyrev and Christopher will also make a joint statement on the Middle East. "The presidents will issue a joint Moscow Declaration and make two statements, on human rights and on nuclear nonproliferation," she said. According to Sidorova, Kozyrev and Christopher also discussed the January 14 meeting of the Russian, U.S. and Ukrainian presidents. "We are confident that this meeting will culminate in signing documents on the nuclear weapons stationed in Ukraine. Kozyrev observed, however, that making sure that the documents are implemented was even more important," Sidorova said. She also told Interfax that Kozyrev and Christopher had a thorough talk on the results of the Brussels NATO summit. "The Russian foreign minister emphasized that Moscow regarded the Partnership for Peace program as an invitation for partnership and tangible cooperation with that organization rather than staying in its ante-room," Sidorova said. In her words, the most important item in that program for Russia was actual cooperation in military exercises and adjustment of military doctrines. "It would be premature to say now where this will lead to, whether Russia and other East European countries will join NATO or NATO and all of us will become a broader European security organization," the foreign minister's adviser said.
