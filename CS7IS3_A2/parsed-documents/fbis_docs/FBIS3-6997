They will be the first Australians to participate actively in the United Nations' Mozambique peacekeeping mission, which is preparing the way for national elections later this year. Mozambique suffered a protracted and devastating civil war which ended in 1992 when the government signed a peace agreement with right-wing rebels. The spokesman said some of the 16 policemen bound for Mozambique had gained experience of peacekeeping police work with the police contingent to Cambodia in 1992-93. He said the Australians would be monitoring the ceasefire and supplementing local police in the lead up to the election.
