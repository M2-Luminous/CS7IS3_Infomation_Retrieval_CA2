Aushev believes that the chief of the interim administration deliberately thwarted the implementation of the Russian president's decree of December 13, 1993 on the procedure of the return to places of permanent residence of refugees and enforced resettlers in territories of North Ossetia and Ingushetia". The Ingush president stated in his address that Vladimir Lozovoy more than once misled the Russian media, and, moreover, the Russian leadership and the Russian president by informing them that the return of refugees to places of permanent residence began on time and proceeds successfully. The Ingush president also noted that Lozovoy's being chief of the interim administration does nothing to stabilise the situation in the region, leads to its aggravation and to a new interethnic conflict. Similar addresses were sent on Friday to Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Chairman of the Federation Council Vladimir Shumeyko.
