[Koranic verse in Arabic omitted] We belong to God and to God we shall return. With sorrow and regret we were informed that the criminal hand of the enemies of Islam has been tainted with a great crime and, by desecrating the holy and pure shrine of Imam Reza, they have massacred a number of innocent people at the holy shrine of the eighth Imam, peace be upon him, on Imam Husayn's 'Ashura. With this action the hypocritical, hostile, and cruel enemies have shown that they adhere to no humanitarian standards, and that their enmity against the brave and pious nation has no bounds or limits. The blind-hearted and treacherous hypocrites [Mojahedin-e Khalq] have shown that they attach no value to the holy shrine of the member of the household of piety and purity; that such a great and holy time and place is no obstacle to their bloodthirsty and bestial nature and their savage grudge against the Iranian nation. The curse of God and His subjects be on those criminal hands and those black hearts. With such deeds the enemies of the Iranian nation have demonstrated their weakness and impotence and proved that they are doomed to isolation and destruction. I express condolences to the Hidden Imam and to those families whose dear ones have been sacrificed because of the malevolence and crime of the enemies and to the great, brave, and steadfast nation of Islamic Iran. I pray that those martyred in this heart-rending tragedy will receive the loftiest rank. I call on the authorities and the law-enforcement bodies to seriously pursue the perpetrators of this crime and, in the shortest possible time, bring to justice those blood-sucking bats. [Koranic verse in Arabic] And those who do wrong shall surely know by what overturning they will be overturned.
