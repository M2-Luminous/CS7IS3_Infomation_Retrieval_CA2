Soon after 1000 local time [1600 GMT], Cordeiro was taken from Rengua Penitentiary to Rancagua Courthouse, where she was officially notified of the Supreme Court ruling granting her release. Cordeiro was arrested by Investigative Police personnel in March on charges of participating in the holdup of a telephone company at Graneros together with two other persons. During an exclusive interview with the "24 Hours" news program, Cordeiro reiterated that she had been tortured and raped at the First Investigative Police Precinct. Judge Alejandro Solis was appointed to investigate her case. The result of the investigation conducted by Judge Solis proved that there was no concrete evidence to support Cordeiro's charges against the Investigative Police. Despite this, eight policemen have been indicted for arbitrary detention, psychological harassment, and counterfeiting documents.
