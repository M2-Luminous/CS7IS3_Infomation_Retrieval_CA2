V. Ptushenko, systems analyst: "Do We Need `Energiya?'"; first paragraph is source introduction] [Text] Systems analyst A. V. Ptushenko, a longtime writer for KHIMIYA I ZHIZN, comments on some of the positions taken with regard to the strategic program for the development of the Russian space program. It happens that two schools have long been crystallized in our space program, two approaches to the strategy for its development. One came from Tsiolkovskiy, a confirmed supporter of the "growth" of the space program out of aeronautics; the other got its start in the soil of a new type of armed forces created in the USSR -- the Missile Forces (there was never anything like it in any other army in the world -- in the United States, for example, missiles were shared by the army, air force, and navy). The first school always dreamed of reusable aerospace systems; the second adhered to the conviction that expendable, purely rocket, vertically launching systems were omnipotent. Supporting each school were prominent authorities, large institutes, large groups of specialists, solid traditions, and strict paradigms. Of course, both schools were of the same mind about the most important thing: both were convinced that mankind would not survive without cosmonautics. But they are far apart in their interpretation of the main routes to be taken in implementing that imperative. Their views differ on the priorities associated with this program or that program; on the role of geostationary satellites, which hover motionlessly over a given point on the Earth's surface; on the advisability of forcing a manned mission to Mars and creating a nuclear rocket engine; on the prospects for our country for having reusable aerospace systems and the feasibility of reoutfitting already developed expendable rockets into reusable rockets. It's too bad that V. P. Senkevich, a man I have great respect for, has given, essentially, no attention to these very important problems. Let's begin with what is perhaps the most pointedly disputed question in today's space program -- what to do with the Buran-Energiya system, on which we've already spent, by one set of figures, 16 billion rubles [R] and, by another set, 40 billion. Should we take it all the way, since so much money and labor has already been invested in it, or should we do just the opposite? In favor of the first solution is a seemingly reasonable consideration: the Americans have developed such a system and are more or less successfully operating it -- which means that we need it, too (we used to follow that principle unfailingly). But such an answer seems reasonable only at first glance. The fact is that we don't have the same geography, the same strategic position that the United States has. From its airbases, it could "get at" the whole of the European part of the former USSR with ordinary frontline aviation; but to do something similar to that, we would need superlong-range aircraft that don't yet exist. That means we have to use space systems in their place, primarily special-purpose space systems. The Americans, who didn't have that kind of problem, could involve themselves in the development of reusable transport systems whose job would be to loft the necessary facilities into the necessary orbits. But for us, that was luxury we couldn't allow ourselves. Space shuttles -- like the Buran-Energiya system -- are typical space transportation systems that are partially reusable (the Shuttle more so, Buran less so). But there is one essential difference. Lifting off from the United States, the Shuttle can place a payload of up to 1.5 tons into geostationary orbit; lifting off from our country, it wouldn't be able to loft anything into that orbit! Our country is located much farther to the north than is the United States -- from us to the equator, that is, to the plane in which geostationary orbit lies, is much farther. From the United States, the equator can be reached at an angle of 20-25�; from our country, at an angle of at least 48-50�. Baykonur (which no longer belongs to Russia) is located at 48� latitude; Plesetsk is much farther to the north. But a launched rocket, without additional maneuvers, is capable flying along an orthodromic only -- a great circle arc with its center in the center of the Earth --and the angle at which it intersects the equator cannot be less than the latitude of the launch site. In order to swing the rocket into the plane of the equator, several times more fuel is needed at launch from Baykonur than is needed from California or Florida, and its lift capacity simply isn't enough for the payload: after all, all the fuel needed for such a turn is also needed, during insertion into orbit, to initially boost to circular velocity. Let's continue the comparison of our system with that of the Americans (Figs. 1 and 2) [not reproduced here]. Both have expendable first stages that, after the propellant is expended, are separated and fall to the Earth. When the Shuttle launches from California, its boosters fall into the Pacific Ocean, bothering no one; when it launches from Florida, they fall into the Atlantic (Fig. 3) [not reproduced here]. But with us, the boosters have nowhere to fall: Baykonur is surrounded on all sides by populated areas. All that's left is the desert Chukotka and a few test facilities that have had to be dug out in various places in the former USSR. Because of that, accessible to us -- unlike with the United States -- are only a narrow range of launch azimuths, which also means an orbit with an inclination of 50-60�. Even worse is the fact that the orbital airplane Buran has no onboard booster engines. Here's how a launch goes with the Shuttle (Fig. 4) [not reproduced here]: at launch, all the engines are in operation at the same time, including the orbital airplane's engines -- they are fed an oxygen-hydrogen fuel from the tank. The solid-propellant boosters of the first stage, after expending their fuel, separate and drop into the ocean (from which they are later removed, put back into shape, and reused); the airplane, with a tank, continues the boost. Not long before the airplane enters the parking orbit, or so-called reference orbit, from which the "orbit-to-orbit towcraft" will start later, its tank, now empty, separates and, along the design trajectory -- that is, a precisely determined trajectory -- returns to the atmosphere, where it burns up safely; the airplane, by now flying on its own engines, which are fed by onboard fuel reserves, makes its way to reference orbit. With Buran, however, the picture is completely different. Since it has no booster engine (we simply weren't able to develop a powerful reusable liquid rocket engine), the second stage of the Energiya launch vehicle takes it to reference orbit. And of course, that stage remains in orbit itself. Over time, because of the resistance of the atmosphere -- despite the fact that it is extremely rarefied -- the velocity of the stage drops, and the stage moves toward Earth. Along an absolutely impossible-to-calculate trajectory: there are too many random factors affecting it. When the second stage enters the dense layers of the atmosphere, some of its burns up; but the engines don't burn up, because they were designed to withstand much higher temperatures. And they fall to the Earth's surface, wherever they please. They weigh, by the way, more than a ton. One conclusion thrusts itself at us. We need not a Buran with an Energiya, but an aerospace system with a reusable, winged first stage -- a booster aircraft outfitted with jet engines similar to those in regular aircraft. Such a system would be able to make it to the equator, and land wouldn't have to be taken out of production as a drop zone for the first stage, and the second stage wouldn't fall on anybody's head. Unfortunately, we succeeded in only the theoretical development of such systems (something I also took part in), and gave up in the face of the truly great difficulties associated with building them. But the Americans, who don't need them so badly, are about to pass us up here, too. But expendable, purely rocket systems, so favored by our "rocket" school, are, in essence, a big waste. I won't risk saying that our rocket builders don't understand that -- they understand it, but draw their own conclusions. These days, they see a way out in the appending of reusability to expendable rockets that have already been built, including the Energiya. But the principles of design for reusable spacecraft and expendable spacecraft are, as they say in Odessa, "two big differences." One must pay for reusability with structural weight; but for the rocket, the weight must be as small as possible -- otherwise, it simply won't have enough fuel for boost. The reusable spacecraft must use air (as the medium for creating bearing and control forces, as the working fluid of the engine, and as the oxidizer); but for a rocket, the atmosphere is just vexing interference; all its advantages show up in airless space only. So going that route, like trying to cross a chicken with a tiger, is useless. The Energiya rocket, of course, could be used alone, without the orbital aircraft Buran. Say, for putting large, heavy objects into reference orbit. But all the organic drawbacks of expendable launch vehicles about which we've already spoken would make themselves known in that context. There's one way out of the impasse: we need to create reusable systems with airplane-like winged first stages. Some thoughts on other priorities of our space program. These days, we, like the rest of mankind, need to be concerned first of all with solving global problems -- energy problems, environmental problems, and many others. Without a space problem, they obviously can't be solved. But for that very reason, many research programs today, including the mission to Mars, can in no way be declared top-priority programs. Life has shown how right the eminent American theoretical engineer K. A. Erike was when he wrote 20 years ago that the priority should belong to exploring near-Earth space in order to replenish the energy and material resources of mankind and to overcome the energy crisis. The essence of the crisis is not simply the lack of energy carriers -- oil and coal; it is much more profound and dangerous for mankind. On the surface of the Earth, we can develop energy systems only to a certain extent, in order to avoid overheating the atmosphere. There is only one way to get around that constraint without curtailing the growth of energy consumption -- send the energy systems outside the atmosphere. There, the primary energy source would be the Sun. With solar arrays, its radiant energy could be converted into electrical energy, which directional antennas could relay as microwave radiation down to energy receivers located on the Earth's surface. Given certain conditions, that radiation would not interact at all with the atmosphere. As for the planned revival of operations associated with the creation of nuclear rocket engines, the following can be said. On one hand, those are the only engines that are economical enough, that is, per unit of fuel mass, they can produce enough work for long-duration flights like the flight to Mars. But on the other hand, the same difficulties arise that arise with ground-based nuclear engineering: it's not clear how to ensure safety and what to do with the radioactive waste. And if we're talking about manned vehicles, the problem of a biological shield for them turns out to be virtually insurmountable. And if we say that a mission to Mars shouldn't be considered top priority, then work on a nuclear rocket engine can hardly be said to be urgent. Of course, in the limited space of a journal, it's impossible to examine all the problems of the domestic space program, however worthy of such they may be. In conclusion, I would like to add just one thing. God save us from converting the space industry into the riveting of pots! Spending on the space program is necessary if we want to save life on Earth. We just have to sensibly and clearly determine what in particular we need to spend the money on. In the opinion of those, like me, who belong to the school of Tsiolkovskiy-Tsander-Erike, the space program represents above all an opportunity to use sources of energy and material that are outside the bounds of Earth. That is what must determine our strategy for the near future. COPYRIGHT: Izdatelstvo "Nauka" "Khimiya i zhizn" 1993
