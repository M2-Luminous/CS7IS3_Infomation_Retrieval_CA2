Jalal Talabani, Patriotic Union of Kurdistan leader, described Monday's meeting [30 May] with Mas'ud Barzani, Kurdistan Democratic Party [KDP] leader, as `very successful.' However, representatives of the KDP claimed that their problem was not discussed in full detail during the meeting. Talabani told the Anatolian Agency in Damascus that claims that they violated a May 17 truce with the KDP were not true. `A joint agreement was made in Silopi to implement the cease-fire,' Talabani said. Talabani added that he would be happy to hold a planned meeting with Barzani, in Turkey at the earliest opportunity. KDP officials said that they wanted to bring an end to the clashes in the region through democratic means and were hoping that Talabani comes to their region to sit at the negotiating table.
