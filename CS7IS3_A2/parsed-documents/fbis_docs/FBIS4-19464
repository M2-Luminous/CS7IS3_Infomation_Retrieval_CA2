Denktas made a statement after meeting with members of the Turkish Cypriot Journalists Union Administrative Council. Commenting on U.S. President Bill Clinton's report to the U.S. Congress, Denktas remarked that this report has the same shortcomings as the UN secretary general's report. Denktas noted that Clinton's report concerns itself more with the contacts conducted on the Cyprus problem and underlines the importance the United States attaches to this subject, pointing out that the report does not mention the provocative armament efforts of the Greek Cypriots. The report refers to opportunities but does not outline the obstacles before these opportunities, Denktas said, adding that the report does not give any messages to the Greek Cypriots to the effect that they are on the wrong path. Denktas explained that he does not resent that the report refers to Kliridhis as president and to himself as honorable, while adding that this attitude spoils the Greek Cypriots by granting them the title of legitimate government and fails to assist in the solution of the Cyprus problem.
