Good morning. [Sanin] Good morning, Dario. [Arizmendi] What is the significance for Colombia of its chairing the Nonaligned Movement [NAM] for the next three years? [Sanin] For us, this is very important recognition of Colombia's international policies. It is very important that 110 countries have unanimously thought that Colombia could chair the NAM for three years and can host next year's meeting of the 110 presidents. [Arizmendi] In this case, who will preside over the meeting? The president or foreign minister? [Sanin] The head of state and president of Colombia. [Arizmendi] Do you not feel nostalgic that, after working to achieve this honorable designation for Colombia first, to receive the unanimous support of Latin America for Colombia's candidacy, and later to obtain the support of 110 countries, you will leave the post of foreign minister on 7 August and will not enjoy something you engineered? [Sanin] No. As long as Colombia maintains its leadership and is able to coordinate the NAM forum, I will be very satisfied. This will give Colombia an opportunity to have greater negotiating and coordinating ability to deepen ties with these 110 countries. This is very important for our country, and we are very satisfied with the recognition of President Gaviria's policies. [Arizmendi] Mrs. Foreign Minister, isn't NAM an organization that has lost importance in recent years? Isn't it a bureaucratic organization? [Sanin] That is not true. [words indistinct] obviously had a reason to exist when the Cold War was still going on and the world was bipolar, but today problems of developing countries are not yet over. This makes it necessary to have a policy or strategy to counter these problems. This will permit us to have the opportunity to negotiate problems at the United Nations. The NAM is very much heeded at the UN Security Council. A great deal of progress has been made in the area of disarmament thanks to the independence of countries that had colonization problems. A lot has been done in the area of the environment. Important positions were negotiated during the [UN] Earth Summit. [words indistinct] prevented taxing developing countries. Regarding human rights, we must establish important positions to prevent this issue from being politicized. In other words, we will be able to improve the negotiating capacity of developing countries in all areas and among ourselves. [Arizmendi] You have led President Cesar Gaviria to the post of OAS secretary general, and you have also led Colombia to the presidency of NAM for the next three years. With this political success, why didn't you run for the presidency of the Republic? [Sanin] [sighs] My work is here at the Foreign Affairs Ministry, but I also want to tell you these accomplishments are not mine. They belong to Colombia and its policies, as well as to the seriousness of our country. I thank you very much for your words, but it was not time for me to run for president. [Arizmendi] This was not the moment, but does that mean the right moment may come later? [Sanin] One never knows. [Arizmendi] You are not upset with our question? [Sanin] Well, I don't think anybody would be upset with such a question. [Arizmendi] Could you give this idea some thought and perhaps run for president within four years? [Sanin] I am now fulfilling my duty to work for Colombia, and this is a good job and a good campaign. [laughs] [Arizmendi] A few days ago we interviewed Dr. Ernesto Samper Pizano on our program "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast. We also did so on our television program "Face to Face." He told us that you were virtually the only Colombian who can afford to be taken to the presidency in the next government. He said that if you choose to, you could remain in the Foreign Ministry, but that you could perfectly well go to the Colombian Embassy in Washington, to the United Nations or to any Colombian diplomatic mission abroad. Which of all those posts would you like? Would you like to remain as the head of the Foreign Ministry? [Sanin] Look Dario, I have been so busy in the Colombian Foreign Ministry that I really have not had a chance to think about 7 August. We have the upcoming Ibero-American Summit, and we have to coordinate details on the environment. We have to prepare the commission for the transition of power to the next government. I truly have not had time to think of anything else. [Arizmendi] Mrs. Minister, what is there left for you to round out Colombia's international endeavors? [Sanin] We are reaching agreements with several countries. We are going to sign some agreements with (?China). We have to do well in the Ibero-American Summit, which 21 chiefs of state and the king and queen of Spain will attend. We are going to hold important talks on the Ibero-American community. We have to further integrate Latin America. We have to sign the free trade agreements on the Caribbean and Central America. The foreign trade minister is working arduously in that direction. We are rounding out our mission and are working to finish it. [Arizmendi] Mrs. Minister, the women's conference will be held in Beijing next year. This coming Tuesday, 7 June, the president will officially launch Colombia's programs and preparations with a view to that summit. As foreign minister and as a woman, what role have you had or will you have in this important world event? [Sanin] I am inside the vehicle and cannot hear your question well, would you mind repeating it? [Arizmendi] Mrs. Minister, I am asking you about the international women's conference that will be held next year in Beijing and whose official acts will be launched this coming 7 June by the president of the Republic. As a foreign minister and as a woman, what will be your participation in this event? [Sanin] I beg your pardon, but I am inside a vehicle passing through a street where there is a lot of interference. As soon as I arrive in my office, we can talk because I can't hear a thing. [Arizmendi] Do you hear me, Mrs. Minister? [Sanin] No, I'm sorry, I have interference. We'll talk again as soon as I get to the office.
