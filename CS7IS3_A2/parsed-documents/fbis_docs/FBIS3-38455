The opposition accuses the FRODEBU cadres and members of having organized the massacres in which tens of thousands of Tutsis were killed. The government, which has led a reclusive life in the Hotel du Lac since October, fearing that its surviving members might also be liquidated, has tried, with difficulty, to overcome its traumas. It has tried to do so with great distrust, because the putschists are still at liberty and Uganda has just refused to extradite four of them! An important stage was the appointment of a new head of state: This was achieved by a consensus between FRODEBU, which has a majority, and UPRONA [National Union and Progress Party], the main opposition party; Cyprien Ntaryamira won the votes of 78 out of 79 deputies in the National Assembly. This unanimity ought to have relaxed the atmosphere, but that was not the case: The radical opposition was in fact demanding that new presidential elections be organized, while the state of the country obviously makes the organization of such an election psychologically impossible and economically too costly. The extreme opposition, playing on legalism, also hoped that the Constitutional Court would back its interpretation of the Constitution. Following the election of Mr. Ntaryamira, the Constitutional Court was indeed consulted and, fearing that it might invalidate the vote in favor of the new president, the government preferred to dissolve it before it had even given its verdict, thus giving FRODEBU's opponents the pretext they were seeking to condemn the "civilian coup d'etat." [passage omitted] The humanitarian organizations, the only groups that dared move around Bujumbura, fear new explosions of violence. Indeed, it seems that the Hutu population is not prepared to accept that the paralysis of the institutions by excessive legalism should deprive it of the election victory it won last June. According to some reports, peasants in the hills have started cutting down trees and barricading roads again; perhaps to prevent incursions by the army. Perhaps the Tutsis also fear that new massacres are being planned.... It also seems clear that Tutsi extremists, whose putsch partly failed last October, are determined to paralyze government action. This would indicate that the coup d'etat, or rather the trial of strength, is not yet really over. [passage omitted]
