Answering questions raised by local reporters after attending a seminar here on Friday night, Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of the XINHUA news agency Hong Kong branch, disclosed a letter agreed between China and Britain on the Sino-British talks, which was excluded in the white paper. The letter was handed over to British Ambassador to Beijing Robin McLaren by the Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Jiang Enzhu on April 7 in reply to a March 30 British request for reopening talks with China. The letter contains the following five points: -- It is China's consistent position to resolve Sino-British differences through negotiations. China has made great efforts to this purpose and the British side should be sincere about the talks. -- The Sino-British talks must be held on the basis of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the principle of convergence with the Basic Law and the observation of agreements and understandings already reached between the two countries. -- The talks are matters between the Chinese and British Governments and should be conducted with only one Chinese and one British official present at the talks. Other officials should attend as advisers or experts. -- If the British side tables the political reform bill to the Legislative Council for discussions before the two sides reach agreements, it will show once again that the British has no sincerity about the talks and it means the termination of the talks. The letter also suggested the version of a news release to announce the talks. The British side had agreed with these points and it was on the basis of the five-point document that China and Britain opened the talks on April 22, 1993, Zhang said. "Why was the document excluded in the white paper? Has the British side abided by the understandings set in the document?" Zhang asked. By concealing such contents about the Sino-British talks, Zhang said, the British side is trying to mislead the public opinion and shift its responsibility for undermining the talks on China. "China will surely respond to the British move at a proper time," Zhang added.
