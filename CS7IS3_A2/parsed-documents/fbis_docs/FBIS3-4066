Although macroscopic regulation was strengthened from July and marked results were achieved, the annual national retail price index rose 13 percent and residents' cost of living expenses rose 14.7 percent, creating problems for the economy in 1994. The Growth Rate in 1994 Is Still High This year, the government is in a dilemma over macroscopic regulation. It has to maintain rapid economic growth but, on the other hand, it must once again keep inflation in check. If economic growth is too high, inflation will be exacerbated. If the growth rate drops excessively, it will also create problems though prices may tend to stabilize. On the one hand, there will be less supply but, on the other hand, many enterprises will be in a state of halted production or semi-production and some workers and staff do not have a sense of security regarding their livelihood, thus causing social instability. It is necessary to seek a balance of the two and properly handle it. Overall, the rapid growth last year was a trend and there will still be a high rate of growth this year. After the control over money supply was eased in the latter half of last year, the judgment of the economic situation by some localitites this year was faulty and they wrongly believed that they could arbitrarily increase investment this year. In consequence, the price of rolled steel, which had dropped, rebounded to a level which is almost as high as that before last July. As a matter of fact, it is still necessary to work through better macroscopic regulation this year to realize a "soft landing." Gradual steps must be taken to control the speed of economic growth within the following levels: 1. We must be able to integrate readjustment of the industrial structure with the speed of economic growth in a very good form, thus enabling the industrial structure to sustain rapid economic growth. In the first half of last year, the then industrial structure could not sustain the high rate of economic growth and the bottleneck constraints were aggravated. In this way, the high rate of economic growth dropped even though the government did not take the initiative to regulate it. This year, the speed should gradually drop to a level which the industrial structure, with step- by-step readjustment, can sustain. $10-Billion Trade Deficit Seen Last Year Last year, while enhancing macroscopic regulation, we took pains to readjust the industrial structure and to integrate macroscopic regulation with readjustment of the industrial structure, which was the correct direction. Since readjusting the industrial structure is a long-term task, this year, we must still make great efforts in this respect. Some departments should slow down, whereas some others must speed up their development, for example, in energy, communications, and raw and processed materials. If tangible results are achieved on structural readjustment this year, it will create good conditions for future economic development because only with a coordinated industrial structure can we achieve sustained and high-speed economic growth. 2. It is necessary to maintain the speed of economic growth at a level which foreign exchange reserves can sustain. If the speed is too rapid but we do not have sufficient domestic resources, we will have to spend a large amount of foreign exchange on imports. Last year, we imported a lot and there was a $10-billion trade deficit. In the long run, our foreign reserves will be exhausted and will not be able to meet the needs of repaying foreign debts and stabilizing the exchange rate of renminbi. However, if the speed of economic growth is too low, the growth of exports will be affected and there will be less foreign exchange. 3. Our finances must be able to sustain it. Overall, our country's economic growth is still mainly an extensive one and our country's financial revenue still relies mainly on state-run enterprises. If the rate of growth is too low, enterprises will have very poor benefits and there will be more financial difficulties. 4. The pressure of employment must be taken into account. There is a very great pressure of employment in our country, particularly in cities, and every year, we have two to three percent unemployment. If the speed of economic growth is too low, it will not only create problems for new employment but will also affect the employment of current staff and workers. Last year, many enterprises fully or partially halted production and some workers and staff took part of their wages and lived by selling small articles on the street. Hence, the economic growth rate cannot be too low and we have to take the pressure of employment into account. 5. When taking into account the rate of economic growth, we must pay special attention to the issue of controlling inflation. Under the current situation, it is unrealistic to achieve zero economic growth but, if we can control the economic growth rate within a certain limit, that is, the raise in the cost of living index not exceeding 10 percent, it will be a brilliant achievement. An outstanding issue in this year's economic development is how to bring inflation under control. The question now is no longer whether or not there is inflation because it has gone beyond the limit of mild inflation. If inflation is high for a short time, the people can bear it but this is not the case if inflation is persistently high. Last year, residents' anticipation of changes in prices precisely reflected this problem. We must understand that inflation affects various strata in different ways. That is, low-income groups and retired workers and staff, particularly those from plants which have fully or partially halted production, are most affected by inflation and their livlihood cannot be guaranteed. This year, the inflation situation is grim. Therefore, when taking into account the rate of economic growth, we must have an overall viewpoint. The economic growth rate cannot be too low and neither can inflation be further exacerbated. This year, price raises are determined by several factors: The first is the aftereffects of last year's price raises; the second is rising costs; and the third is the newly-introduced price reform, particularly raises in petroleum, coal, grain, and transportation and communications. This year, it will be quite difficult to keep the national retail price index below 10 percent and the raise is expected to exceed 10 percent. According to relevant statistics, due to the aftereffects of last year's price readjustment, the cost-of-living index will rise 5.5 percent this year; new factors of price readjustment this year can cause a two percent rise in retail prices; and the fact that total demand is greater than total supply in society will cause a four percent raise in retail prices. Merely because of these few factors, retail prices this year will increase 11.5 percent, whereas residents' expected effect of inflation, which may exist, is not included in the calculation. Seeking Economic Growth As Well As Bringing Inflation Under Control As far as the current macroscopic regulation is concerned, the government not only has to maintain rapid economic growth but also bring inflation under control so that prices will not soar. Confronted with this dilemma, the government is likely to adopt a policy which alternately tightens and relaxes control on the rate of economic growth. When the speed is too fast and inflation is exacerbated, controls should be tightened. After a certain period of time when the rate slows down and inflation eases up, the controls should be relaxed. This year, if we can keep the economic growth rate within, or slightly outside the limit of 10 percent, and maintain the national retail price index within or slightly beyond the limit of 10 percent, our economy this year will do quite well. However, we cannot sustain it if either the rate of price raises is as high as over 15 percent or the economic growth rate drops dramatically. The government's art of regulation is precisely to strike a balance between moderately rapid economic growth and sustainable inflation. With last year's experience in macroscopic regulation, we should do better this year in gradually slowing down the excessively high- speed economic growth, to alleviate inflation step by step and to realize a "soft landing."
