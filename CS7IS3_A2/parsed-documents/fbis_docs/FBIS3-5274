He said the request was welcome, although long overdue. If implemented it would definitely improve bilateral ties. The Supreme Command has asked police to issue arrest warrants for Vang Pao and Gen Thonglit Chokbengboun, reputed leaders of the anti-communist Hmong guerrillas, and also requested that the United States consider taking legal action against them. Vang Pao spent two years along the Thai-Lao border after the 1975 defeat of the US-backed guerrillas by troops of the communist government in Laos. The general then went to live in the United States and took up American citizenship but is reported to have returned frequently to Thailand. The Supreme Command said issuing warrents would allow authorities to act against the two men immediately if the return again. "It would be much appreciated if Thailand acted on the Supreme Command request for police to arrest General Vang Pao and General Thonglit Chokbengboun for allegedly violating Thai security laws," said Bounteng. "Thailand should have (issued warrants) a long time ago. We will keep watching to see if Thailand acts in accordance with the request," he said. Bounteng said that following up with strong action against rebels hiding out in Thailand would be a clear reflection of the strong feeling of co-operation and unity between the two countries, which have a long common border and close cultural and languages ties. "lssuing arrest warrants for Vang Pao and Thonglit would be an explicit affirmation by Thailand of its foreign policy of not allowing any group to use its territory as a base to launch attacks on neighbouring countries," he said. Bounteng believes that hundreds of Hmong living in Wat Tham Krabok drug treatment centre in Saraburi Province are members of Vang Pao's anti-Vientiane forces. "The Thai government should be aware that the Hmongs in the drug treatment centre are not all drug addicts," he said. The temple has a reputation for rehabilitating drug addicts from Thailand and other countries. The number of Hmongs entering the country without permission, reputedly to receive treatment, has increased in recent years. National Security Council chief Gen Charan Kunlawanit has said the Hmongs illegally living in the temple should be repatriated to Laos. Bounteng said Laos would welcome them back if they were prepared to work for the country's development. The Laotian people would help authorities keep a close watch on the returnees and report them if they showed any intention of disrupting the government or the country. "When the late Kaysone Phomvihan was asked several years ago about the number of people in Laos and the number of police, he answered that they are the same, about 3.5 million at that time," the minister said.
