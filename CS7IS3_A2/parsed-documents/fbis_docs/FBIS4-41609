Georgian head of state Eduard Shevardnadze has sent letters to the heads of 12 EU states and to European Commission chairman Jacques Delors. The Georgian head of state reviewed the difficult economic situation in Georgia and dramatic aftermath of the Abkhazian conflict that has had an adverse effect on current affairs. Apart from that, the letters point out what is thought to be impeding the establishment of democracy and market economy in the former Soviet republics. And finally, the letters call for the heads of state to support a request that the EU grant aid to Georgia in the face of a difficult winter expected in the country due to insufficient stocks of fuel and bread. Mr. Shevardnadze has indicated that a strategy to provide new independent states with economic assistance should be devised. This is essential for strengthening democracy and creating market economy in these countries, this being of major importance for stability worldwide.
