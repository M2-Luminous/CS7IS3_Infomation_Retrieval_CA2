The physicists hope to have the nuclear reactor operational by the end of the century. Andres Garcia, secretary of the Nuclear Affairs Executive Secretariat, explained to PRENSA LATINA that the project is part of a strategy aimed at the gradual advancement of the potential in this field that, even though it is seriously affected by material shortages, has the scientific capacity for the development of this type of technology. The idea of the reactor, Garcia said, is linked to the creation of a center for the production of radioactive isotopes that should be completed by late this year and that includes, among its main objectives, becoming a source of radionuclides for medicine and the pharmaceutical industry. We hope 50 percent of the reactor's technology will be produced in the country, Garcia added. Garcia said a small group of very highly qualified specialists are designing the nuclear reactor. From the very beginning, the Cuban nuclear program was conceived as a multiphase project and, together with nuclear energy (the production of electricity by the fission of an atom), the use of radioisotopes and radiation in various fields will also be developed. The center for the production of isotopes, located at the La Quebrada Research Center in southeastern Havana, is being built with the help of Invap S. Emn, an Argentine enterprise specializing in that technique. Regarding the construction of the Juragua Electro Nuclear Plant, which was being done with the help of the former USSR and is currently stopped, Garcia said talks are under way with Italian, British, and French companies interested in continuing the construction. The Cuban Atomic Center project included the supply of two VVER, model V-318, (water pressure) reactors. Each of these reactors can supply 417 megawatts of electricity.
