That is because the political situation in Russia has become unstable due to the ultranationalists' victory in the Russian parliamentary election. In addition, it is inevitable that the president's "reform line" will face a difficult situation in wake of the resignation by Yegor Gaydar, first deputy prime minister, who is in charge of President Yeltsin's economic policies. A top Foreign Ministry official disclosed the prospect that the first meeting of a working group for a peace treaty will be delayed from its originally scheduled January date to sometime in February. Formation of the working group was agreed upon during a meeting between Hosokawa and Yeltsin last October. Consequently, it appears unlikely that Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata will visit Moscow in the first half of the year as planned. The visit was partly intended to lay the groundwork for Prime Minister Hosokawa's trip to Moscow in the future. Following Russia-U.S. summit talks, Hata and his counterparts from the seven major developed countries (G-7) announced on 14 January a plan to continue supporting the Russian economy. However, while it is difficult to improve the northern territorial issue, some government officials are beginning to say that the "atmosphere of the G-7 is quite different from that of last spring, and they are tired of giving financial aid to Russia," (according to a Foreign Ministry source). It is expected that some countries may start to call for a review of their aid to Russia. Among other things, President Yeltsin, when he visited Japan last October, apologized to people detained in Siberia and admitted to the validity of various documents signed between Japan and the Soviet Union, including the 1956 Japan-USSR Joint Declaration. He displayed a diplomacy that could be called the first step toward establishing "normal relations," (according to a senior Foreign Ministry official). Immediately after the visit, however, it was revealed that Russia had been dumping radioactive waste materials into the Sea of Japan. Although the Japanese Government is trying, in a positive manner, to prevent waste dumping from happening again, many government officials are saying: "Fundamentally, this is an issue Russia has to solve by itself." A factor that is making Russo-Japanese relations more unstable is the victory of the Liberal Democratic Party, led by extreme nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. Regarding the territorial issue, the Japanese Government explained its stance of ignoring Zhirinovskiy's remarks, who said that "the territory will never be returned to Japan." But, the internal condition of the government is not calm. Some Foreign Ministry officials are beginning to think that "President Yeltsin may try to delay settlement of the territorial issue by taking advantage of Zhirinovskiy's remarks and behavior."
