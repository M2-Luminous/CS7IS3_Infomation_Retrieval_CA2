In a lengthy full-page article under the heading "Migration, Exile, and Political Manipulation: A Unique Case in History," the newspaper says it is logical for those sectors to want to be under the country's protection when it comes to constructing a better society and creating an integrated citizen. The author of the commentary, Felix Pita Astudillo, added: These Cubans living abroad concern themselves with improving their relations with their island roots because they "are proud of their Cuban citizenship or feel the nostalgia of those who live faraway and wish the best for their dear ones, here or there. "If they consider anything necessary, it is the need to tighten the relationship between the nation and the exiles, struggle for the free flow of citizens, improve postal and telecommunications services, regulate remittances to families, clean up migration statutes, abolish those laws that are still in force, but that date back to times of tension and Cold War, and revoke other proposals that surely will be made." Pita Astudillo makes a necessary distinction between Cubans who work and live abroad and those who "became U.S. nationals and today are U.S. citizens on the payrolls of foundations, platforms, and other such monsters, in order to live off their fellow men." He underlines as one of the differences between these emigres and other communities the fact that the so-called Cuban lobby lacks a strategic rearguard or a nation to support it, except U.S. offices and agencies. "They demand the right to represent Cuba, but, by their own choice, Jorge Mas Canosa became a U.S. citizen, Jorge Montaner became a Spanish citizen, and Diaz Balart, Ros, and Menendez took up other citizenships, because that is an essential requirement for being a member of the U.S. legislative body," the GRANMA article adds. Among the mirages that this group attempts to portray as real fact is the Cuban vote in Florida, which does not exist, Pita Astudillo says, because in that state it is necessary to be a U.S. citizen to vote. In addition, they have exaggerated support from authorities, a support that other communities, such as the Mexican community (which outnumbers the Cuban community five to one, according to official figures) have not obtained. All of this translates into overrepresentation through more mayors, municipal councilmen, state legislators, and Federal congressmen than any other group, the newspaper adds. "Despite such a controversial position, they demand the right to be part of a national reconciliation in Cuba as Cubans, but neither lobbyists, professional politicians, nor voters are in a position to demand that they be identified with those of us who once were their countrymen," Pita Astudillo says. The commentator says that the presence in Havana of more than 200 representatives of the exiles on 22, 23, and 24 April will destroy the myth that nation and emigration are centrifugal forces by definition. Any possible analysis "must face the basic cause of the conflict between the two sides: the age-old disagreement between the United States and Cuba." Later, the article points out that this disagreement started when Washington started to covet the then Spanish colony, continued down to our time, was aggravated in the past 35 years and became particularly bitter with the end of the bipolar world and the renewal of the United States' hegemonic aspirations. Regarding the phenomenon of emigration, the newspaper points out that in the past this was a basically economic occurrence, linked to the independence movement, and was ideologized and turned into a political activity contrary to the revolution. It is for all these reasons, Pita Astudillo adds, that emigration, which became political exile to accommodate different U.S. administrations, has now become a unique, unrepeatable occurrence in the world's history.
