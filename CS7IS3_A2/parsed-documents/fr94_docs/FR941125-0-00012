ACTION: Final rule; technical amendment. SUMMARY : The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is correcting a final rule that appeared in the Federal Register of August 26, 1993 (58 FR 45204). The document amended the final monograph for over-the-counter (OTC) antacid drug products to require that all antacid drug products contain the statement: ``Drug Interaction Precaution: Antacids may interact with certain prescription drugs. If you are presently taking a prescription drug, do not take this product without checking with your physician or other health professional.'' The document was published with an error in the amendatory language. This document corrects that error. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 25, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William E. Gilbertson, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (HFD&hyph;810), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, 301&hyph;594&hyph;5000. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : FDA has discovered that the amendatory language in the final rule published in the Federal Register of August 26, 1993 (58 FR 45204), was incorrect. The amendatory language, as published, revised the introductory text of ยง331.30(d); it should have revised ยง331.30(d) to remove paragraph (d)(1). Accordingly, FDA is removing paragraph (d)(1) to correct this error. List of Subjects in 21 CFR Part 331 Labeling, Over-the-counter drugs.
