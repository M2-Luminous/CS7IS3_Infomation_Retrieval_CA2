They said layout and development programmes for big and medium-sized cities must first be approved by the central government, the State Council. Construction Minister Hou Jie warned a recent urban planning conference in Beijing that continued unplanned development could have disastrous consequences on Chinese urban development. And Construction Vice-Minister Zhou Gangzhi said several problems already existed despite the improvements brought about by the rapid construction. Living conditions in some cities have deteriorated, he noted. Buildings have been put up on precious greenbelt land and valuable historic or cultural relics were damaged or destroyed. Traffic has also become more congested as roads have been taken over by sprawling markets or large buildings, experts said. They said large cities like Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin had done a better job of sticking to their urban layout programme as they built up their infrastructures. Ten-year development schemes covering Beijing and Qingdao, on the Shandong coast in East China, beyond the year 2000 were recently approved by the central government. Many other cities are now busily drawing up their own plans with State Council guidance, said Zhou. However, the real estate boom which began in 1992 has sent construction racing ahead of planning in many cities, creating havoc in their development, Zhou added. For example, the municipal government in Haikou, capital of Hainan Province, has been receiving several development applications a day. And in 1992, the city's development projects covered a record 6.25 million square metres. As a result, demand for water and electricity doubled in a year, creating daily power and water cuts, Zhou said. There were also more traffic jams. Another ministry official, Chen Xiaoli, said some local governments have tried to lure foreign investment at the expense of urban planning. Greenbelt and cultural sites disappeared to make way for luxury hotels, commercial plazas, and entertainment centres. In Hefei, capital of Anhui Province, developers built residential houses on the city's 5-kilometre-long round greenbelt. The city government in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, remains "hesitant" about allowing hotels to be built around the city's renowned West Lake, Chen said. Applications have been pouring in for development rights but most Hangzhou residents and environmentalists are against anything which will destroy the landscape. However, some municipal officials are reluctant to give up a "magnet for foreign investment" and profits for the city government, Chen said. Chen said the ministry has received another complaint from Wuhan City Planning Department. A developer there is set to build a huge commercial entertainment park on top of Guishan Mountain, Wuhan's "green pearl," Chen said. The project has not been approved by the city planning department. The case will face ministry investigation, Chen added.
