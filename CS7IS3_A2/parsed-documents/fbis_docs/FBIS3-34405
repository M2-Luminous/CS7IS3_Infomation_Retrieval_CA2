The airport was closed to air traffic last Tuesday when disturbances swept the city and then worsened later, developing into armed confrontations between security forces and armed elements opposed to the government. Eyewitnesses arriving from the city yesterday have said that the situation there is still tense and that security forces continue to search houses and buildings there. It has been reported that security forces have arrested scores of people and moved some of them to Tehran. A committee comprised of three mullah arrived in Zahedan yesterday. It is sent by the "Supreme Guide" 'Ali Khamene'i to hold negotiations with Sunni leaders in the city in connection with the people's complaints. It is worth noting that the Sunni represent over 80 percent of the city's population. The authorities believe that maybe this reality was one of the factors behind the uprising against the Shiite mullahs' regime in Tehran. However, Sunni leaders in the city have urged the city's inhabitants to remain calm, refuting the reports that the disturbances are linked to religious questions. Nevertheless, they have not yet announced their agreement to talk to the mullahs sent by Khamene'i from Tehran. Eyewitnesses say that organized groups of young men spread in the main street in the city last Tuesday and began to overturn government vehicles and set government building ablaze, burning portraits of Khomeyni and other mullahs of the regime. A crowd of the city's residents chanted when the young men began to burn the Khomeyni flag which replaced the historic Iranian flag in 1979. It has not yet been determined who was first to open fire, hence turning the peaceful demonstrations into violent incidents. However, individuals from the Baluchi tribes, which form much of the population in Zahedan, are usually armed to the teeth. Local police, who are limited in number, did not make any attempt to control demonstrators. At any rate, the regular police are the object of the mullah regime's suspicion, as their political allegiance is suspect. The demonstrators, who were angered by the opening of fire on them, tried to seize the local government's premises, but were forced to retreat after the guards opened fire on them. Two people were killed in the incident. An hour later the first Revolutionary Guard battalion arrived to scene aboard a helicopter from the nearby town of Khash. An armed confrontation erupted immediately between members of this battalion and unknown gunmen who tried to seize the radio station. Two members of the Guards were killed in the clash. The "Revolutionary Guards" succeeded in evacuating government officials and a number of mullahs who had sought shelter in the governor's residence in the city. Further violent actions occurred in the afternoon of the same day when a group of Shiites were brought to the area by government trucks from the nearby Bazman area to -- so it seemed -- intimidate the demonstrators. But the Bazman group, led by two government mullahs, had to retreat after a brief confrontation with the Sunni demonstrators. Eyewitnesses say that at least 50 people were wounded, and that 23 of them are still receiving treatment in local hospitals.
