He had taken part in a meeting between President Kravchuk and several members of Ukraine's parliament representing Crimea Monday evening. According to Sevastyanov, "at the meeting Kravchuk pointed to the unwillingness of Russia and the U.S. to revise borders or recognize the Crimean Republic after their statement signed in Moscow." Kravchuk also stressed that he himself has nothing against the candidates for the Crimean presidency, Sevastyanov noted. According to Sevastyanov, Kravchuk said that "the Ukrainian army will remain outside politics, and, should the situation destabilize, the existing structures of law-enforcement agencies will have to be used." Kravchuk made it clear that Crimea can use additional law-enforcement forces, "if it is in a position to keep them." At his meeting with the deputies from Crimea, President Kravchuk also said that neither the Ukrainian parliament nor he himself will interfere in the process of establishing an open economy in Crimea. According to the Ukrainian president, the efforts to achieve economic stabilization in Crimea will now depend solely on the measures the Crimean leadership will take. Kiev will support all Simferopol's initiatives, if they do not conflict with Ukraine's legislation, Kravchuk told the deputies from Crimea. In the first round of presidential elections in Crimea, the greatest number of votes was collected by the pro-Russian candidate, Yuriy Meshkov. In the second round, the present Speaker of the Crimean parliament, Nikolay Bahrov, will be his rival.
