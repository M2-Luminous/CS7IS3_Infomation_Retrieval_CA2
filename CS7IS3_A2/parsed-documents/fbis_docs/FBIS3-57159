So the policy of financial stabilization is now absolutely officially dead. Prematurely, without having achieved much of what could and should have been achieved. The deceased had been weak, of course, and was a lot of trouble for people, but some future hopes were pinned on it. "Granny," Korney Chukovskiy's young heroine asked, "when you die will they bury you in the ground?" "Yes," granny replied. "Deep?" "Deep." "Good, so I will be able to play with your sewing machine as much as I like." No doubt the "sewing machines" of the Main Administration for the Production of State Bank Notes, Coins, and Medals will be chattering away for all they are worth very soon. The Central Bank has already placed an order for the first quarter -- the volume of money to be printed exceeds the entire amount of cash available last year. We also know that 100,000-rouble [R] bills have been printed and the likelihood is that we will soon have them in our hands. It is perfectly clear that the printed bank notes will not be languishing in bank storerooms. Viktor Chernomyrdin, as head of the new-look cabinet, promised first to pay any money owing to farmers, the military-industrial complex, and budget-funded sectors. According to the most modest estimates, that is R10 trillion, not counting the R10 trillion the government was already intending to spend in the first quarter. Debts have to be paid, of course, but who, aside from the agrarian lobby, forced us to be beholden to the farmers at utterly absurd prices? Who is forcing military expenditure to remain at a level that is only appropriate for a country at war? It is clear that the claims by Vice Premier Aleksandr Zaveryukha, who has already prepared a decree on agriculture worth R26 trillion, are incompatible even with the moderate financial policy the now former finance minister had agreed to. If the finance minister says he cannot cooperate with the head of the Central Bank, while the premier does not see any reason why Gerashchenko should go, it is easy to guess who will remain in the boat. It should be remembered that there remains yet another principled opponent of Gerashchenko in the government -- Anatoliy Chubays, the last Gaydarite. He was one of the most vigorous critics of the Central Bank chief by virtue of the latter's operating a system of the reciprocal offsetting of state enterprises' debts, while Gerashchenko responded by saying that the "little Chubayses" were hindering normal operations. If the problem of which of them remains and which of them goes recurs in the future, it is easy to predict who will be favored. So, having left the cabinet practically bereft of those who designed and executed the former policy, Chernomyrdin announces that the course of reforms is unchanged. If the unchanged course consists in a switch from monetarist to nonmonetarist methods of combating inflation, as the premier promised, then there will certainly have to be different people in the government to continue it in that way. Although, it is rather difficult to imagine what the premier's new principles for combating inflation will be like in practice. Price freeze? Stronger state levers to influence economic activity? All this is very much akin to free medicines, concerning which it is said that free treatment means no treatment. Gaydar's former colleague, former Vice Premier Sergey Shakhray, who went to Chernomyrdin last May to try to persuade him to bring Russia's [former FRG Economics Minister] Erhard back into the government, now says that his vice premier colleagues are leaving the government to avoid being held responsible. Shakhray himself remains -- presumably because he is not afraid of his responsibility for interethnic conflicts? As for responsibility, why, one wonders, is it only the premier's deputies that are being blamed for all the policy failures? What about the premier himself, who has led the government for 13 months now -- has he nothing to do with it, and don't the results of the elections, which provided the political grounds for the reshuffle, affect him at all? Why not? Was he obediently carrying out Gaydar's will even during the period when he was absent and therefore is not responsible for the result? But if he was an independent leader, why does he not share the responsibility? It appears that our economy is on the brink of major changes, back to the old days. Fedorov has aligned himself with Gaydar, who a week before had said that he found it impossible to be a party to such changes. Maybe Fedorov will be one of the leaders of Irina Khakamada's new "Union of 12 December" Duma faction. Maybe he will head the banking subcommittee and hound Geraschenko from there. But the move by the reformist wing from government to parliament is unlikely to have a major effect on the body's work. Although one can hope that the liberal-agrarian-communist majority in parliament will have few quarrels with the present government and the long-awaited peace will be established between the two hostile branches of authority. But what will become of the economy?
