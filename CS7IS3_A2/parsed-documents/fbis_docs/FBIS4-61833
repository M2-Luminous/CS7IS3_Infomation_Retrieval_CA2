There are various opinions about this day. Some regard it as the day of victory over fascism. But there is also the opinion that it was not Georgia's war, the Georgians' war, and that we should not have taken part in this war, and so on and forth. What is your assessment of what happened 49 years ago today? [Shevardnadze] Thank you. First I would like to greet all veterans and participants in the war. I know almost all of them in person. [passage omitted] Now to that equivocal attitude. I was upset to a certain extent over parliament's failure to adopt a resolution [reinstituting 9 May as a holiday]. Some deputies have a different understanding of the importance of those years, and the contribution of the fallen heroes and those who are still with us today, toward the struggle for peace in the world. I think that people who do not understand this and believe that the veterans fought not for Georgia but for the interests of a foreign country, and that they served the interests of a different system, know little about the matter. [passage omitted] Those who fail to understand that the 300,000 people [from Georgia] who, while defending their own country, sacrificed themselves for the freedom of other nations, have a very vague understanding of the essence and purpose of national movement and of the people who truly fought for the interests of this movement. Although many might not have realized it at the time, or could have realized it subconsciously, the struggle against fascism was a struggle for universal ideals. The same universal ideals inspired the revolution of the eighties and the beginning of the nineties. This revolution gave freedom to nations, to Europe and to Georgia. Without victory over fascism, there would not have been the revolution of the eighties, the liberating revolution which brought about freedom and democracy in former Soviet Union republics. This is a logical chain and it cannot be denied. I think that people who do not understand it have failed to keep abreast of the times. Therefore, by marking 9 May, we are paying our respects to the memory of people who sacrificed themselves for the freedom of nations and for independence, to those who fought for these ideals. Today we talk about building a free and democratic Georgia. Without the cornerstone that these people laid by fighting against fascism, Georgia would not have gained its independence. [passage omitted] Finally, one of the major achievements of those great years was the (?emergence) of the United Nations Organization and its Security Council. We may not be impressed by the role this organization is playing today [word indistinct], but without it our planet would not have survived. [Words indistinct] people who fought against fascism created a certain guarantee of a peaceful life for future generations. [passage omitted]
