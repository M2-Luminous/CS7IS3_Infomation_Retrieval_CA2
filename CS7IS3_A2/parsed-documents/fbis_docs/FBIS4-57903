Under the title of "Pharisaism," journalist Felix Pita Astudillo recalls that on the day the United States installed a government in Cuba following military intervention, and now, 92 years later, this country intends to maintain annexationist ideas "with the intention of annexing us into its new world order at any cost." After pointing to the crudeness of the message's content, which seems more like an electoral diatribe directed at Miami -- in November, Floridians will go to the polls -- Pita Astudillo assesses in detail each of the four paragraphs that "the arrogant superpower produced to express its opinion about today's Cuba and to disseminate the unsolicited opinions of its government." The Cuban Government daily cites statistics that reflect the situation in the country prior to the 1959 revolutionary victory, and it notes that the Cuban people are not interested in the freedom advocated by the United States "because it is inhuman and belongs to the every-man-for-himself philosophy." Further on, the journalist notes that the wishes expressed by Clinton do not take into account "the right to life, work, education, food, health, or housing" in Cuba or in its neighboring Latin American countries. "There is no reference, at all, to the eradication of poverty, which requires well-balanced economic development and a better distribution of wealth because it only deals with age-old and worn- out references to individual civil liberties with a vague mention of the state of law," Pita Astudillo adds. The article describes the argument in the third paragraph as cynical because it defends the blockade, a blockade that "is aimed at making it impossible for the people of Cuba to attain prosperity and satisfy their basic needs as well as making us surrender through hunger." President Clinton's message, the journalist adds, indicates that Cuba and the United States "have a long history of cooperation and admiration." It is indeed long, Pita Astudillo remarks, but filled with voraciousness and disdain toward the "immoral dwarfs," as the North Americans used to describe Cubans in the last century. Describing it as having the nerve to refer to Jose Marti as someone whose ideas are consistent with Clinton's policy, Pita Astudillo recalls that it was precisely Marti who, 105 years ago, wrote: "The United States has never viewed Cuba as anything but a savory possession whose only inconvenience is its people, whom they view as impetuous, lazy, and loathsome." After noting that President Clinton had an opportunity not to endorse this shameful part of history, the journalist emphasizes with certainty that "there is something between us," adding that two different worlds separate us: one of policies of conquest and annexation and one of policies of friendship and hospitality. "We are an educated, friendly, and hospitable people, who also can be fierce and intransigent when our most beloved symbols are insulted with the language of pharisaism, and this is the language used in this message," Pita Astudillo concludes.
