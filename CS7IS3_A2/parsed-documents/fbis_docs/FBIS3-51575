As Barcelona and Puerto La Cruz are slowly returning to normalcy, the police have announced the arrest of scores of people involved in neighborhood riots. The National Guard has implemented continuous patrols in Barcelona and Puerto La Cruz neighborhoods to prevent any outbreak of violence. General Miguel Aparicio Ramirez, commander of the Anzoategui State military force, has said that the riots were economically motivated and that they took place to protest the implementation of the value-added tax and the increase in public bus fares. He urged the population to remain calm and not to take any action against private or public property, because people involved in such actions will be prosecuted under the Vagrancy and Hoodlum Law. [Begin Ramirez recording] We are ready. We have implemented the Sovereignty Plan which permits the deployment of the National Armed Forces when police forces cannot effectively check public order disruptions. So far there has been no need to use any Armed Forces units, and I hope that they are not needed. [end recording]
