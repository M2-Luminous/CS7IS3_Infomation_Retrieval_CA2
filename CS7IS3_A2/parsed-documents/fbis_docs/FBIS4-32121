Regarding the census, Mendu Thaci, deputy chairman of the Party for Democratic Prosperity Party [PDP], declared to the Albanian Radio and Television: [Thaci] The public has been informed that in 1991, the Albanians boycotted the census held at that time. This was an expression of civil disobedience on the part of Albanians, practically the lack of belief toward the administration staff. The Law on Census, which was approved some time ago by the parliament of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, is in fact more respectful of minorities than that of 1991, but when attaching to it the bad will of the administration staff that applies this law, this means that Albanians will be discriminated from the beginning at this level. Article 24 of this law states that nationalities here should be represented on the basis of a proportional number. In fact, this law is not respected, because according to the official data in 1991, Albanians were 21 percent and more, while now in the census commissions and registration groups, Albanians in this republic take part with 12.8 percent. It is known that the Macedonian administration staff particularly creates a terrible confusion with documentation, especially in ensuring the nationality of this republic. At the present level, there are more than 60 percent of Albanians who have not arranged the problem of nationality. Moreover, something that was not in 1991 is included, which is the fact that all the Albanians who work abroad will be considered as a non-resident population and will not be counted. The census is really a very important act, but I would say that it is not an historic act. The PDP does not bear responsibility for the failure of this census, because it is not this party that participated in drafting the law, various consultations in commissions, and lately it is not the one that voted for the law in the parliament of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The responsibility falls on those who make manipulations and such non-serious projects.
