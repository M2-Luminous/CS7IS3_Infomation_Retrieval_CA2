FBIS4-61800 "drsov090_v_94009" FBIS-SOV-94-090 Daily Report 26 Apr 1994 Lithuania `State Coup Scenario' Said To Serve LDDP Activities `State Coup Scenario' Said To Serve LDDP Activities WS1005081194 Vilnius RESPUBLIKA in Lithuanian 26 Apr 94 No. 80 p 2 WS1005081194 Vilnius RESPUBLIKA Lithuanian BFN [Report by Ricardas Jarmalavicius: "Another `State Coup Scenario' or Echoes of Moscow in Vilnius"] [Text] Seimas [parliament] deputies yesterday found a "state coup scenario" in their office mail boxes, which was allegedly discovered on the eve of 1994 in Vilnius, near one of the "villas in Turniskes." Copies of the scenario were distributed at the request of A. Kuncinas, deputy chairman of the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP] faction. This "scenario" and the "version No. 1," which caused a scandal in Moscow a month ago but which proved to be a journalists' forgery, are like two peas in a pod. According to the authors of this "document," the implementation of the "coup" requires the incitement of society through a variety of methods, including the staging of strikes and the organization of referendums. This would allow for the ousting of Lithuania's current government and the legalization of a new one. One of the LDDP faction leaders, who wanted to remain anonymous, told a RESPUBLIKA reporter that he had had copies of "those documents" as early as six months ago. However, he failed to "leak" them to the public (the newspaper has some information that those "documents" were circulated to other editorial offices four months ago, but no one wanted to publish them). The aforementioned LDDP leader says that he cannot find any arguments to refute that the "scenario" was written by the LDDP itself. The LDDP activist, who fears publicity, claims that he knows that this "plan" emerged immediately after the right-wing political forces lost the Seimas elections. According to RESPUBLIKA information, the "coup scenario" will promptly prove useful for new actions scheduled by the LDDP. First of all, the latter intends to torpedo the referendum organized by the Homeland Union concerning the adoption of the law "On Illegal Privatization, Devalued Deposits and Stocks, and Law Enforcement Violations." The LDDP does not fear the law but the possibility of including a question about early Seimas elections on the referendum ballot at the very last moment. The LDDP can apply to the Constitutional Court with a request to examine whether the referendum law, which was adopted in the times of the Lithuanian SSR, does not violate the Constitution.
