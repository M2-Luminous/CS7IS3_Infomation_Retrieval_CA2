FBIS3-43218 "cr00000005194001" 28 January 1994 Article Type:FBIS Document Type:FOREIGN MEDIA NOTE--FB PN 94-012--CHINA SPENDING SPREE OF "NEWLY RICH" REFLECTS INCOME DISPARITY, SOCIAL PROBLEMS Recent Hong Kong and PRC media reporting have contrasted the excessive spending habits of newly wealthy individuals on food, clothing, entertainment, or expensive private schools, with the continuing struggle of people in the poor, remote areas to provide for their basic needs. The lavish life style of the rich appears to have contributed to social uneasiness and discontent. An article in the 15 November issue of the Hong Kong monthly TANG TAI (CONTEMPORARY) reports that some of the "upstarts" in Shanghai show off their wealth by purchasing expensive clothes and other things. Examples cited include a boutique store owner who sold 60 pieces of fur and leather clothing, ranging in cost from $138 to $1,150, in less than a month, a jewelry store which sold a diamond ring for over $3,448, and an entrepreneur who had made a fortune in the stock market who spent $11,500 on his wedding banquet. Health clubs and golfing have reportedly become popular in the past few years with international golf club membership fees rising from $20,000 in 1989 to $59,000 in 1992. Pets have also become a new status symbol with a pair of Pekinese recently being sold for $7,356, according to the article. An article in the 18 September 1993 issue of the Hong Kong monthly NAN PEI CHI (NORTH AND SOUTH POLES) reports that a "Dakuan" (nickname for the newly rich people) paid $5,747 to a singer for a one-song performance. Luxurious private schools have emerged in the past year as part of the spending trend for the rich. According to a 15 October TANG TAI article, nearly 100 "aristocratic schools" were established in the past year. They have swanky offices, modern electronic classrooms, libraries with rich collections, indoor and outdoor gyms, swimming pools, tennis courts, and music halls. Teachers' salaries reportedly range from $70 to $150 per month. One example of such schools is Beijing Jinghua Elementary School which reportedly charges a tuition of over $115 per month per student, plus a one-time entrance fee of $3,450. While a small number of teachers enjoy a comfortable income, most teachers in public schools have been struggling to make ends meet. According to an article in the 8 October issue of Hong Kong PAIHSING HSINWEN CHOUAAN (PAIHSING NEWSWEEK), a teacher's salary in the countryside averages only $11.50-23 per month. Even that amount is not guaranteed, because many local governments are behind in paying their teachers, forcing them to take a second job to support themselves. Beijing GONGREN RIBAO on 29 September cites a teacher in a remote mountain area who had to commute a long distance to teach two or three different grades of students, and work over 10 hours a day just to earn 250 jin (=125 kilogram) of potatoes a semester which he later sold for $3. The Chinese press notes that the gap between the rich and the poor has become so great that it may negatively affect social stability. (Beijing JINGJI RIBAO of 23 September reports some 80 million people in China are still below the poverty line.) According to an article in the 23 August issue of the Beijing monthly ZHONGGUO JINGJI TIZHI GAIGE (CHINA'S ECONOMIC STRUCTURE REFORM), published by the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy, the "wantonly extravagant" life style of a small number of people who have used legal or illegal means to gain a windfall has "polluted" society, causing strong public resentment. The paper notes that some people have spent $40,230 for a table for 10 at a restaurant, or $46,000 for a rare breed of fish, while others go gambling, use drugs, or engage prostitutes. The crime rate has reportedly increased and public order has steadily deteriorated. According to a 15 December TANG TAI article, from January to June, serious criminal cases in Shanghai increased 38.4 percent compared to the same period in 1992. Embezzlement, murder, rape, robbery, drug peddling, and prostitution have increasingly been on the rise, the article said. (AUTHOR: CHINN.
