ATMs typically are connected by telephone wires to a computer that provides processing, also known as driving, for several ATMs. That computer often is connected to a network switch, such as the MAC switch, for interchange of transactions among otherwise unaffiliated banks. An ATM network typically charges a switch fee per transaction, and may also charge various monthly or annual membership fees. The processor charges a separate fee for its services. Outside the MAC network, the driving computer might be operated by the bank, by a network, or by an independent data processing firm, and driving computer might connect those ATMs to several different networks. MAC's rules and practices, however, constrain interconnection of different ATM networks. 18. Banks seek to participate in shared ATM networks, such as MAC, in order to give their depositors ubiquitous access to their accounts. While a bank can deploy its own ATMs, the advantage to a shared ATM network is that a bank's depositors will be able to use ATMs at many more locations than one bank alone could practicably support. The areas a bank seeks to serve through a shared ATM network include the areas in which its depositors live, work and ship, and the broader areas in which they move regularly. A bank's ability to offer its depositors access to other bank's ATMs, and thereby to offer its depositors convenient access to their accounts, is in most bankers' view necessary to attract and retain deposits. A bank_particularly a small bank, thrift or credit union with one or only a few offices_would be at a competitive disadvantage if it could not offer its depositors access to many conveniently located ATMs. Because no other service constitutes a reasonably close substitute for regional ATM network access, regional ATM networks constitutes a product market and a line of commerce within the meaning of the antitrust laws. 19. The MAC network is the dominant ATM network in the affected states. In Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware, more than 90% of the ATMs are connected to MAC; in New Hampshire, approximately 80% of the ATMs are connected to MAC. No other regional network has a significant presence in Pennsylvania, Delaware, West Virginia or New Hampshire. Although the New York Cash Exchange (``NYCE``) ATM network has a presence in New Jersey, for reasons set forth below, EPS's MAC network nonetheless has monopoly or market power in New Jersey. 20. Nearly all banks in the affected states believe they have no choice but to participate in the MAC network. Banks in the affected states affiliate with MAC because MAC is the only ATM network that provides ubiquitous ATM network access throughout all or most of the contiguous affected states. Banks that do not seek to provide regional ATM network access in areas smaller than these States do not have significantly greater alternatives than do statewide banks. 21. Banks in the affected states often obtain ATM network access from MAC even though defendant's switching and processing fees, and other costs of doing business with MAC, are higher than those charged by other networks and by independent processors. Defendant has market power in the market for regional ATM network access in the affected states. That market power is of sufficient size and durability to constitute monopoly power. 22. Until 1992, MAC generally did not permit its customers to participate in rival ATM networks while also participating in MAC. While the rule against multiple affiliations was formally dropped in 1992, MAC engages in practices that make it impractical for many participating banks_particularly smaller banks_to belong to a rival network while belonging to MAC. In particular, MAC requires banks either to obtain ATM driving from defendant or to provide ATM driving in-house as intercept processors, which is prohibitively expensive for many smaller banks, thrifts and credit unions. MAC generally forbids its network customers from obtaining ATM driving from any of the several data processing firms that provide that service in a national market. 23. There are several regional and national firms in the business of ATM processing that could and would seek to compete to provide ATM driving services to MAC network members. Absent MAC's prohibition, many MAC customers would seek to obtain ATM processing from these or other firms. Defendant's rules and practices thus prevent willing buyers and sellers from conducting business at competitively determined prices and terms. 24. Once defendant drives a bank's ATM, defendant can prevent that bank from connecting its ATM to another network. To connect to a network other than MAC, MAC must establish the connection. MAC generally has not provided connections to the ATM networks that would be its strongest competitors.
