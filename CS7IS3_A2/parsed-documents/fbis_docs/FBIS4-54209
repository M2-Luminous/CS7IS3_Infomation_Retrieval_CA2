FBIS4-54209 "dreas102_d_94009" FBIS-EAS-94-102 Daily Report 26 May 1994 South Korea * Interview With ROK Ambassador to China * Interview With ROK Ambassador to China 942C0032 Seoul WOLGAN CHOSON in Korean Nov 93 pp 414-425 942C0032 Seoul WOLGAN CHOSON Korean CSO [Excerpts] Ambassador to China Hwang Pyong-tae, 58, is not a career diplomat, although he passed the foreign service examination upon graduation from the Economics Department, College of Commerce of Seoul National University; most of his government career was with the Economic Planning Ministry. But he is not widely remembered as an official of the Economic Planning Ministry, either. After the position of deputy assistant at the ministry, he went for to study in the United States. Returning from this study, he pursued an academic career. However, his academic career did not last forever. He transformed himself into a politician, assuming the role of a political advisor on international affairs to now President Kim after meeting the President during his tenure as the director of Foreign Language Institute. He had served as a member of the 13th National Assembly representing Kangnam district of Seoul. And, with the advent of the Kim Yong-sam administration, he is now a diplomat: Korean Ambassador to Beijing, with which our government established an official relationship less than a year ago and things have not been quite settled yet. It has been only five months since Ambassador Hwang took office as the ambassador in late May 1993. With his various career experiences come the stories. It has been reported that he was in charge of political funds for President Pak Chong-hui as a deputy assistant minister of the Economic Planning Ministry. [passage omitted] [Pak] Reforms in Korea and those in China are completely different..., how would you define, in fact, the nature of China's reforms? [Hwang] There was a surprising news article in the paper this morning. The article said that China will recruit 14,000 professionals in the fields of economics and technology. According to China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping's latest comment, the engine of China's socioeconomic development is China's elite. He further insisted that the elite should take the lead to lighten the burden borne by the general public. This implies, it seems to me, that he sees Chinese society as two tiered: the elite and the general public. What do you think of that? Officially, China pursues a socialistic path but in reality its economy is entirely similar to that of a capitalist system. The difference you would find between our current economic system and that of China, if you really have to look for one, is in name only. Our market economy may be called an enlightened market economy. The only distinction we might draw between our economic approach of the 70's and the 80's, and the socialist approach, is that we called ours government planning and guidance instead of socialism. In some aspects, China is more open than we were. A typical example of this is the broad recognition of a local government authority over its economy. Local governments have jurisdiction over foreign trade activities under 20 million dollars. Most import authority, except for major items such as automobiles and TDX's (Transistor Data Exchanges), have been transferred to local governments. We should also note that China is training professionals and entrepreneurs. In spite of systemic problems in its socialist mechanism, China currently practices a market economy backed by the Government. Whatever discrepancy there is, it's merely semantic. In substance, it's exactly a market economy. Recently Lawrence Kline, during the seminar he conducted in China, said: The economy we see in China, called a socialistic market economy, is a transitional phenomenon from socialism to market capitalism, i.e. from a planned economy to a market economy. Jiang Zemin, president and Communist Party General Secretary, questioned (Kline) for an hour and a half. What China is hoping for is that it would eventually arrive at a system--through the course it is taking--in which all systems would function under a market economy, except its political power structure, which would remain controlled by the Communist Party. Of course, one big question still remains: Can the Communist Party can keep its grip on power as the economy transforms into a market-oriented system. My view is this: The Chinese Communist Party could be successful, for a while anyway, because the Chinese people recognize and accept a one party dictatorship of the Communist Party. The Chinese accept this, whereas the Russians would not. This is why, lately, President Pak Chong-hui's economic development models implemented in the early days of our economic development, and his biography are gaining popularity in China. [passage omitted] I repeat: there are a great many similarities between China today and Korea in the early days of President Pak Chong-hui's rule. How the people of China manage the current of democratic change would greatly affect the record rate of China's economic development seen at the present time. [Pak] Right after the Tiananmen Square incident, a scholar named Ha Shin of the China Academy of Social Science (CASS) came up with a theory called neo-authoritarianism which summarized what you, Mr. Ambassador, have just said. In short, the conclusion of this neo-authoritarianism theory is that "political authoritarianism is necessary to bring about economic development in Asia." Validity of the theory has been evident in the Nationalist Party system in Taiwan, the Lee Kuan Yew system of Singapore, the period of Japan immediately following Meiji Restoration, and our own past. Not long ago Mr. Peter Hyon [Hyon Ung] related the following episode as I met with him in Beijing. Some time ago, Mr. Peter Hyon asked President Pak, "When are we going to have democracy in our country?" And, President Pak was said to have replied: "At the present, we can hardly expect to see true democracy in our country because we do not have the middle class as a nation. But it is probable that we will have democracy once formation of the middle class becomes reality as the result of successful implementation of my economic development policies." Mr. Peter Hyon seems to imply that there is irony in our country's political scene. What he means is that it was President Pak's successful economic development, which brought about the formation of the middle class in our country, that made the advent of a civilian government of President Kim Yong-sam. He was the most critical political adversary of President Pak's. The power base of this government is the middle class. Nevertheless, I wonder if we can genuinely call the current political system in Korea democratic rather than authoritarian. There seems to be something amiss in the system, though we can not exactly pinpoint it, in spite of the expectations we all had for the new administration early on. The reform measures carried out in Korea seem to be "forcedly administered" in accordance with President Kim's visions, by any definition. This seems to be incompatible with the current worldwide trend. Although, I suppose, future scholars of political science would sort out President Kim's reforms..., how about, Mr. Ambassador, giving us your views on this? (As soon as I presented this question to him, Ambassador Hwang asked me to change the subject. And he wanted our conversation centered around the events in China. Thus, our subject of conversation turned to China.) [Hwang] Let us look at what the future holds for China. In addition to the fact that China's economy is currently growing at the rate of more than ten percent yearly, one thing we have to pay close attention to is the national trait of Chinese people. I mean their patience in spite of everything. I believe the people of China, with their patience and forbearance, will definitely surprise the world. They are showing, these days, the kind of economic growth observed in the record-rate growth of Japan in the 60's and in our own economic growth of the 70's. By the time the 21st century rolls around, their economic growth will definitely surprise the world. And, as the economy grows, the democracy will follow; wouldn't you say? Here, once again, the question one might raise is how long the socialist ruling system of the Communist Party could last. Although this is strictly my own personal opinion, we are the only country among Asian nations that arrived at democracy as the result of economic growth. Where Korea has arrived is only a natural outcome, considering that the path it took was a textbook case of the Western theories. Yet, it remains to be seen whether the case of Korea could be considered a general rule applicable to the development history of all Asian nations or an exception. It would be difficult to expect, even after the year 2000, that there would be a change in China from the state of the system in which the press were censored and that the Communist Party would not cling to the system of one party rule. But I suspect there would be a change in division of power between the central and the local governments in China. What I mean by this is that the central government would deal with foreign policies and national defense, and economic matters would become the responsibilities of various local governments. In other words, I am contemplating the possibility of China, with such vast territory, becoming a "United States of China" as the result of division of power between its central and provincial governments. [Pak] However, publications in Hong Kong gave the impression that the reform faction, who attempted the delegation of power to provincial governments, had been crushed during the course of Tiananmen Square incident. They said that, at the time, Za Ji-yang, the General Secretary of the Party, initiated the process of delegating authority to local governments, having concluded that "the centralized power was not the answer," and came to encounter the Tiananmen Square incident, and that Premier Li Peng, after the Tiananmen Square incident, stalled the delegation of power process and began to reinforce centralization of power. [Hwang] Nonetheless, currently, the most often debated subject is actually local governments' rights to separation of power. They say that this is a major subject of research at the Chinese Academy of Social Science. There have been numerous books written about it and I recall an article stating, "The worst enemy of China is in the provincial issues." At any rate, there is hardly a sense of insecurity about openness and reform in China today. The people feel confident enough in carrying out reforms to be adventurous. One other indisputable fact is that Mao Zedong's populism is finished in China. But it seems that this is not the case in our country. I remember reading a Korean newspaper article, in which the writer stated, "Ten percent of the public are reluctant to endorse the reform although 90 percent welcome it." The point the writer is making is that the ten percent still deserve critical attention even though the reform was being applauded by the other 90 percent. In socialism, certain measures are designed for popularity with the masses rather than being based on their own merits, but the reform measures in China today are based on their own strengths. For farmers, the only measure taken by the state is economic assistance such as providing the development funds, otherwise, they are left alone. Thus, the populism is disappearing in the economic front, as well. [Pak] There is Ozawa in Japan and there is Deng Xiaoping, though aged, in China. Who, in your opinion, would be the comparable leader in our country who would lead the nation with a set of objectives? [Hwang] In my opinion, President Kim holds the idea that "power is inherently corrupt," having spent 30 years as an opposition party leader. Accordingly, he is strong on dissecting things but seems to have somewhat detached optimism toward a subject matter, once sorted out, in following it through. He seems to believe that things do get better when you shake them up. For the truth of the matter, we will just have to wait and see. Economic matters do not always seem to follow this reasoning. [Pak] As for the precedence in China of controlling cultural life being an impossible task as seen in the short-lived Cultural Revolution initiated by Mao Zedong... [Hwang] What it amounts to is that Mao Zedong stepped on a tiger's tail. [Pak] Cultural Revolution ended in 1976 Tiananmen incident. The forcible control of the incident by the military killed the Cultural Revolution. Learning a lesson from this, do you think it at all possible that the reform in Korea might end in the same fashion one day suddenly like the demonstrators in front of Seoul City Hall, crushed with force because of the policies that encourage and please only the poor and lower strata of our society? [Hwang] It seems unlikely. President Kim has long, hard experience with political dissent. He is identified with the mass participatory democracy (democracy in which the mass public participates). The mass democracy surrounding the Cultural Revolution was not quite the same thing. Should I have to define the current state in Korea whether it was a mass democracy or an elitism democracy, I would at the moment, tend to call it a mass democracy. If detracted, a mass democracy could result in a populism. What started as a mass democracy could, by one misstep, become a populism. However, in any event, there will be a period of pause for reassessment our reform after it reaches a certain point. You cannot just tear things down nonstop, of course. If things begin to generate fears, there could be little chance for any further construction. The way I see is that the house-cleaning and the symbolic phases of reform have been concluded with the implementation of the real name financial system. What remain would be reform efforts in areas such as education, administration and financial system. I can not imagine that the President would make any wrong move. He is now at the threshold of his policy for which he would need a metaphysical perspective and operations management skills. In the case of Mao Zedong, there is strong evidence that he was reaching for equality of consequences and horizontal equality; in other words, he was not only for economic but also political equality. But President Kim, quite apart from what Mao Zedong personified, is trying to realize much more liberal democracy, through his reform which is a reflection of reassessment and surgical in nature. There is no comparison between President Kim and Mao Zedong because what President Kim is trying to accomplish is not to realize equality for all but to carry out a "surgical operation" as the necessary intermittent course of action. And, there is no paralled between the two. [Pak] Russia is lately going through turmoil. Originally, Russia and China had the same political system; yet, China seems to keep things relatively well under control and Russia seems to have such difficulty; what could be the reason? [Hwang] There are two reasons. Russia has been a country which has not meant to be one nation. What binds a nation together is its nationalism; is it not? A sovereign state has to have a common sense of a nation in order to establish itself as a nation and the Soviet Union was not able to establish itself as a nation from the very beginning. The reason the Soviet Union, despite this, became a nation is that it used the ideology, socialism, as the common thread binding the nation instead of nationality. Thus, the first reason: The Soviet Union had used the oppressive policies of communism. The biggest distinction we see between China and the Soviet Union is that China still retains its nationality even after the worldwide demise of socialist foundation. And the second reason is that China, backed by this nationality and through its economic development, was able to give its citizens hope that they would have a better living. I think the foundation for better living in the Soviet Union fell also after the fall of socialist foundation, don't you? Thus, I believe the nation which benefits the most from the disintegration of the Soviet Union is China. The People of China are confident. I think the people of China themselves care very little about issues such as freedom and so forth but are all for making money right now, although the outside world has been busy lately talking about the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square incident; don't you? They concern themselves little with things like human rights. [Pak] I remember a story. At the time of the fall of the Soviet Union, Deng Xiaoping was said to have remarked: "In Russia, the man named Gorbachev violated a cardinal rule. Disregarding Marx's maxim that, for an organization, the change of its upper echelon would naturally follow if its base units were successfully changed, Gorbachev initiated perostroyka which was intended for reform of the upper structure and ended up in miserable failure for the lower structure too of the Soviet Union." And Deng Xiaoping was said to have instructed that the firm grips on the upper echelon should continue but there should be diligent efforts to nurture and strengthen the lower echelon. [Hwang] The story has a good point. The Soviet Union had to deal with the additional problem of geographic sectarianism in addition to the fall of its two main ideologies: socialism and equality. And the Soviet Union ended in turmoil, as it was not equipped with an ideology to overcome this sectarianism, and the central government authority disintegrated. Furthermore, the third contributing factor was the fact that the hope for a better future of its people, too, has been destroyed; hasn't it? Contrasting this, there is a superabundant hope among its people in China that the 1.2 billion population will have a better future with improved living standards, don't you think? [Pak] Some say that the reforms currently in progress in Korea do not accompany a strong lower-level structure, organizationally. What they are saying is that the whole system could become shaky as the result of the current frequent practice of restructuring and cutting the upper echelon under the assumption that all is well with the lower echelon as the upper echelon in the days of (5-6 Kong) could easily have been manipulated to implement successful economic policies for their ineptitude. [Hwang] They have a point. Because we realize that what President Pak had practiced was the economy pulled by an enlightened government. This economy pulled by an enlightened government seems to be in a state of confusion because it lost its center post one morning as the political scene had changed. Supposing that you wake up one morning to find that for a government assistance to your business had been dashed, you would naturally be overcome by the fear of your bankruptcy; wouldn't you? I would like to call it regimentation, i.e. business health maintenance. Although President Kim had already stated along the same lines, I believe, the system should be able to nourish businesses despite the change in political power structure. We cannot afford the government's hands-off policy neglecting the health maintenance of businesses. You know as well as I do that a patient's life depends on the care given for recovery after surgery. This is precisely the type of problem our nation's economy faces right now. it raises a vital concern for us to contemplate where we would be in the next few years with economic growth of only four percent per year compared to the 13 percent annual growth rate of China with a population of 1.2 billion. One other point here: it would indeed be a grave situation if the relationship between our economy and China's ever became competitive. We must keep the relationship to be one of co-existence and cooperation. From the start, we and China were not to compete against each other. The point I would like to make is that we should place strong emphasis on investment in China rather than trade. Our investment would lead a path to a joint progress through our technological resource and China's labor force. This is a relationship of coexistence and cooperation. We ought to cultivate a strategic relationship of cooperation with China through our investment in such industrial fields such as the automotive industry. If we limit ourselves to short-term trade, which is bound to be competitive in nature, we would not last for very long. The objectives of Korea-China relations should be coexistence-cohabitation centered around investment rather than trade. [Pak] Although what you have just said is probably true in an economic field, China appears to hold its prescribed opinions on its neighboring countries as was shown in the political situation of Cambodia. It seems that China would like to have the governments of the nations near its border under its influence as was demonstrated in its welcome for Sihanouk with open arms when he had nowhere else to turn to. China has maintained its own plans on North Korea and I wonder if it has not had its operating objectives toward South Korea, with which it had not had official relations for the past 40 years, to realize a structural change in, South Korea, receptive to its political influence. [Hwang] In the past, there had been a period in China when its internal politics were dictated by Mao Zedong and its foreign policies by Chou En-lai. During the period, Chou En-lai left a monumental legacy, considered to be of timeless soundness, for the conduct of international politics. To be exact, it consists of five principles of peaceful coexistence. Those five principles are still adhered to, today by the government of China. I believe some of the results of China's foreign policy based on the five principles are seen precisely in the cases of Cambodia's Sihanouk and also of Arafat; wouldn't you say? I heard that Arafat visited China more than 30 times. There has been not a single deviation in China's foreign policy conduct from the five principles of peace. (Chon Ki-song), (foreign minister of China), has been saying the same thing at the United Nations recently. Ever since the Bandung Conference of 1955, they have consistently been the guiding principles of China's foreign policy. During that time, even faced with some hard choices, China has been consistent in maintaining its posture adhering to the principles without a compromise. This is the foundation, I believe, on which China has been able to maintain consistent relations with Sihanouk and Arafat. China's move on North-South Korea relations is based on the principles, as well. I understand China made its position clear stating that it "supported negotiated relsolution through dialogues but opposed any rival conflict as a means of solution for the North-South Korea relations and firmly believed in nuclear-free Korean peninsula." These principles maintained by China impressed Kim Il-son recently, as well. It appears that Kim Il-song acknowledged them, for the first time. He said, "China's reform and open policies are going rather well." China's five principles of peace are having great effects on the relations between the United States and North Korea. I suspect the reasons behind North Korea's approach to the United States, of course, are to prevent a United States military attack or economic embargo. However, the principal cause for North Korea's overture to the United States was, above all, the application by China of its five principles of peace to the issues of Korean peninsula. Eventually, North Korea had little choice but to follow the Chinese initiative. As you may recall, North Korea clearly stated that it would maintain dialogues with the United States as China wished, and lead a policy toward foundation for stability in Korean peninsula and its borders," to Ho Kum-su, a regular member of the Chinese Communist Party Political Bureau, and Wang Han-mu, Vice Chairman of the Standing committee of the National People's Congress of China, during their visits to Pyongyang. I wrote about this in my report to Seoul not long ago. North Korea's openness would follow once the nuclear issue between the United States and North Korea, and the problems between South and North Korea and between North Korea and the International Atomic Energy agency were resolved. Kim Il-song would move quickly to openness. That was my report. Also, I sent a long report concerning our approach, had North Korea decided to take the road of reform and openness. We would benefit from China's five principles of peace, just as Sihanouk of Cambodia did. [Pak] If my memory serves me correctly, I believe diplomatic issues had been nearly non-existent in China during the Cultural Revolution because of preoccupation with internal problems. There had not been, on China's part, any mention of the five principles of peaceful coexistence for some time, even after the Cultural Revolution. About the fall of 1989 China all of a sudden proclaimed "We will resurrect the five principles of peaceful coexistence we had in past and adopt them as the principles for foreign policy of today. It seems to me that this revival of the five principles of peaceful coexistence of the 50's happened because China saw the need for peace and order in carrying out its reform, openness, and economic development, as it was experiencing internal difficulties surrounding the incident of Tiananmen Square. Lately, the five principles of peaceful coexistence are being applied to the issues of Korean peninsula as well. Have you not observed any attempt or move by China to secure a leverage for its influence in Korea, i.e. to install a group supporting China by forming a pro-China political faction in Seoul, etc.? [Hwang] On that point, the Chinese do not seem to be overly anxious. The way they see it, it seems, is that China could return to its past glory as a strong power by uplifting its economy as a nation, and freeing itself of foreign economic pressures. What they are trying to do preponderantly seems to be to maintain good-neighbor relations with most of the nations of the world, but to be alert enough not to be ignored or intimidated by any. They seem to think that the number of the nation's population, 1.2 billion, in and by itself gives them a supremacy. [Pak] Not long ago, Kim Il-song had made, it seems to me, a remark of major proportion when he said, "China's reform is encouraging to us, North Koreans," during the visit to Pyongyan by (Wang Han-mu), (Vice Chairman of the National People's Congress (NPC)) of China. [Hwang] Kim Il-song came to Beijing 99 times, but, since the establishment of diplomatic relations between South Korea and China last year, he has not made a single visit to Beijing. China discontinued its once brisk exchanges with North Korea and high-level exchange has become infrequent. After one year of this kind of atmosphere, Kim Il-song had no choice but to say that China's reform was the right course of action. That portion of Kim Il-song's speech in which he said that "China had become a nation of wealth through its reform and openness" deserves a special attention. The word "wealth" is reminiscent of the old concept of "a nation of wealth and mighty army" and not of a vocabulary conducive to the socialistic ideals. In other words, the word connotes the idea of luxury living; wouldn't you agree? The word takes the bite out of combative spirit. Thus, we might say that what Kim Il-song said was that Chinas' becoming a nation of wealth had been an encouragement to North Korea. Realizing this, we can understand why Kim Il-song said to China "there would be no rival conflict in Korean peninsula." And, about the nuclear issue, he said that there would be satisfactory dialogues with the United States. This, I believe, was the meaning of Kim Il-song's statement. Although it might be somewhat premature to draw a conclusion definitely as such, I suspect, reading fine points in what Kim Il-song said, that North Korea would join hands with China soon, is pursuing its reform and openness. In this context, it calls our attention to the fact that North Korea is ready to accept China's venture capital in the Nachin frontier area, north of Chongjin. One other interesting development is the story being circulated that North Korea would give a 50 year lease of Chongjin to China. My gut feeling is that North Korea is trying to develop the area of the Nachin frontier and Tumen river basin to such a massive scale that, once completed, would resemble nothing we have seen or heard of so far in North Korea. What North Korea is betting on is that once China invests its capital in the region, naturally South Korea would follow and, then, Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong and so forth, as well. It would be a big mistake if we did not take our part in the investment and left when China invested its capital in North Korea. We have to prepare ourselves for this. As for Kim Il-song, I doubt he would ask for a direct dealing with South Korea. He would probably look for the dealings with South Korea through China. This is one of the reasons why our relationship with China is critical to us. [Pak] If and when such a prediction becomes reality, I suppose our economic potency, above all, would be a critical factor; do you think we might be left out because of our less than ideal economic posture? [Hwang] There are a few facts that should make us feel safe as far as China is concerned. First, we are at least 10 years ahead of China in economic development. Secondly, we as a people have always been very cost conscious, i.e. driven for efficiency. In contrast, cost consciousness or cost accounting is not the norm in China. This is, in a way, a detrimental shortcoming of China's economy. Thirdly, people in China are used to being ordered around by bureaucrats to manage their economic lives. It would take a long time for China to arrive at the properly functional mechanism and system of its economy, including those financial and monetary areas. Recently, they have been studying Japan's monetary system. Setting up the system alone would take China the next four to five years at least, as they are currently debating about institution of a taxation system. As for economic systems, I believe China is 10 to 15 years behind us. I don't think we have to worry much if China continues at this current pace. If we fail to invest more capital and improve our technology, and China keeps up its economic growth at the current rate, which is 13 percent per year, we will have a big problem. However, we need not worry, I believe, if we deal with the situation, as we did before, with new investment and continued improvement on management technology of our industry. [Pak] Yasushi Akashi, a former Japanese Ambassador to Thailand, is famous for having made it possible for Japan to expand outward. As an ambassador to a Southeast Asian nation, he led Japan into Southeast Asia. Have you, Ambassador, considered yourself the Korean version of Yasushi Akashi regarding our relationship with China? [Hwang] There has been a lot of criticism lately. As you probably heard, the Germans rushed into their reunification too hastily. What is clear to us is that the reunification of North and South Korea is the most important of all issues regardless of its final shape or form. Nevertheless, we can learn a lesson from the case of East and West Germany and be ready to let North Korea choose its own way of life, which, I believe, is terribly important. Even after the fundamental issues were ironed out, I am afraid that there would be a considerably long period in which North and South Korea would be in a state of commonwealth or federation, meaning one nation with two different systems. In order to achieve all these, we must maintain our close relationship with China. The reason for this is obvious. North Korea is currently in a situation where it would welcome any party that came jointly with China. The timing and the laying of foundations for unification should also be attempted and attained with the help of China. [Pak] It has been over five months now since you arrived in May of this year. How do you, Mr. Ambassador, assess the situation? Has it been a wise policy decision, on our part, that China should lend a helping hand in order to keep North Korea from causing any trouble? [Hwang] North Korea at present still remains a country whose people are have a hard time just affording three meals a day. In contrast, per capita income in South Korea is more than 6,000 dollars and if the two countries merge, with this backdrop, it is highly probable that this disparity would cause a further division internally for the nation. The economic disparity would naturally lead into cultural discord and adversely affect the very lives of the people. We must exercise the utmost care in order not to rush into things as even Mr. Kim Tae-chung stressed. It takes time to solve socioeconomic problems. I believe any hasty action out of political expendiencey could simply compound the problem. [Pak] I recall seeing Mr. Han Sung-ju, once in the early part of this year, prior to becoming the Foreign Minister, on television conversing with Professor Lester Thurow of the United States. As Minister Han said "we were greatly concerned about the cost of unification," Professor Thurow, with a grin in his face, was saying: "West Germany had a detailed plan to improve the East German living standard to the same level as West Germany's within five years. Part of this plan included a program to install a $3,000 cellular telephone for East German families despite the fact that the West Germans used an 800 dollar telephone in their homes. This was an example of why it was necessary for West Germany to deal with unification cost. But I would question, indeed, if such preposterous measures would necessarily be considered a part of Korean unification cost." He seemed to be saying, in other words, it could be a strategic mistake for South Korea to place too heavy an emphasis on unification planning, and... [Hwang] Professor Thurow is purely an academic economist. Economic solutions alone would not bring answers to politico-cultural questions and the emotional question of a nation within. We should consider unification cost a secondary issue. Problems we would face as a nation are political though they contain elements of economics, too, to a degree. Consider, if you will, that there are people who shed tears simply by viewing Kim Il-song, in North Korea, particularly. This is not the same as the East Germans felt about Honecker. We have to look and see things beyond their superficial appearances. Even the Japanese are getting worried that there might be an influx of the North Korean refugees as the result of a riot in North Korea... Consider this for a moment, if you would. Supposing that a mass of North Koreans came and lived in Uichongbu, it would bring hardship to people living in Seoul, also. We should be concerned about what in reality had happened in Germany, i.e. a flood of East Germans came and lived in rural areas of West Germany. [Pak] What should be the role of our embassy in China and what can we expect the embassy would accomplish? Please tell me your views on this, from the experience you have had so far. [Hwang] The role of Korean Ambassador to China is to seek out the best ways to maintain comfortable coexistence between Korea and China, especially, in the future, in the 21st century. In short, the role should be to enhance the relations of the two countries based on economic matters, also to go above and beyond economics and, thus, coexist.
