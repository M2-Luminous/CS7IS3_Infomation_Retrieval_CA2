The security agencies in many countries have started to take seriously Colonel al-Qadhdhafi's threats to liquidate the regime's opposition abroad. Following complications in the Lockerbie file and evidence of the opposition factions' ability to infiltrate Libya and ignite rebellion similar to what happened in Misratah, al-Qadhdhafi made changes in his security apparati to protect his regime, assigning all these jobs to his family members. Colonel al-Qadhdhafi has issued a document, entitled "The Revolutionary Legitimacy," which for the first time contains no slogans but rather sets out strict security instructions. The document was distributed among the big five in Libya: 'Abd-al-Salam Jallud, Major al-Khuwaylidi al-Humaydi, Colonel Mustafa al-Kharrubi, Abu-Bakr Yunus, in addition to al-Qadhdhafi himself. It was a big surprise when 'Ali 'Abd-al-Fadil, director of al-Qadhdhafi's bureau, was told that the document ordered the reorganization of the security organs as a precaution against the difficult days to come due to the repercussions of the Lockerbie issue. Accordingly, al-Kharrubi's authorities were withdrawn and he was appointed as inspector in the armed forces, Defense Minister Abu-Bakr Yunus was "given no responsibilities," nor was Major al-Khuwaylidi al-Humaydi, who was formerly responsible for foreign, domestic, and military security. They were all put at the disposal of the colonel, who is to assign them specific tasks. 'Abd-al-Salam Jallud's role in the people's congresses was restricted. He is said to live in a private house on the Canary Islands. His tribe, the al-Mafarihah, has been disarmed, thus making them vulnerable to rival tribes like the Durfillis and al-Buray'isat. The colonel has succeeded with his divide-and-rule policy and in taming the tribal factor and exploiting it to serve his regime. Al-Qadhdhafi has set up a security team that supervises all security apparati, foreign and domestic, operating in Tripoli. Known as the Leader's Information Bureau, the team is comprised of presidents of apparati and security consultants. Captain Ahmad Ramadan al-Asabi'ah supervises the bureau and he is responsible for security, second only to al-Qadhdhafi. He studied security in East Germany and Bulgaria and mastered the art of planning and preparing. The name Mas'ud 'Abd-al-Hafiz al-Qadhdhafi, of the al-Hazrah clan--a branch of the al-Qadhdhafi tribe--is prominent as head of the "security battalions," selected military units composed of airborne troops that surround the big cities. They are prepared to abort any rebellion or coup attempt. People close to Mas'ud say that he has recruited many young people in the cities and that he has strong ties with Rome, Madrid, and Ndjamina. According to reports from Libya, 12 personalities are threats to lead coups against al-Qadhdhafi. These include Mansur al-Kikhya and Muhammad al-Maqrif, who resides in America. Reports indicate that the names listed in that (?document) will tell the security agencies who kidnapped al-Kikhya in Cairo, particularly because al-Qadhdhafi had given instructions to kidnap three of his major opponents: Muhammad al-Maqrif, who lives in America; Mansur al-Kikhya; and 'Abd-al-Mun'im al-Huni, who is living in Cairo at present.
