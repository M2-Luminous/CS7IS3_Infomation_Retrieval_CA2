FBIS3-11793 "drlat059_c_94012" FBIS-LAT-94-059 Document Type:Daily Report 27 Mar 1994 MEXICO Report Questions Whether Killer Acted Alone PA2703040994 Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0131 GMT 27 Mar 94 PA2703040994 Mexico City Radio ACIR Network Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [Text] Newspapers are insisting there are still many holes in the investigation into Luis Donaldo Colosio's slaying. It has been said that two men may have killed Colosio. The bullets that killed PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio may have been fired by two attackers, Mario Aburto Martinez and Jose Antonio Sanchez Ortega, because paraffin tests conducted on both men turned out positive. Tijuana Judicial Police Commander Jorge Alvarez Barrieri made this announcement. However, the Attorney General's Office has stated that Mario Aburto Martinez is the only assassin and that he has confessed to firing two shots. The press also reported that 17 people at one time or another had owned the gun with which Colosio was killed on the tragic evening of 23 March in Tijuana, Baja California. There has also been speculation about statements made by Mario Aburto Martinez after he was arrested following Colosio's killing. According to Jose Luis Perez Canchola, Baja California human rights ombudsman who was present during the questioning, it is very unlikely the killer acted alone. It was also said that Mario Aburto Martinez is refusing to answer questions concerning which armed groups he may have belonged to, or whether he acted alone or whether the attack was part of a conspiracy. I must remind listeners that these are not official statements by the Attorney General's Office. I am just reporting what has been said aside from official statements from the Attorney General's Office. It has been reported that Mario Aburto Martinez said in his deposition that he purchased the .38-caliber gun in California to injure Luis Donaldo Colosio, to attract the media's attention, and to explain his pacifist ideas before the national and international press, as well as to disclose information he has on armed groups in different areas of Mexico. None of the aforementioned statements is official. It was also mentioned that Mario Aburto Martinez may have belonged to a political group. His girlfriend said he spent four weeks in Chiapas. It was also confirmed that he was influenced by the sect known as the Jehovah's Witnesses. It has also been learned that residents of Zamora, Michoacan, have been angered by this situation, because Zamora, Michoacan, is the hometown of Mario Aburto Martinez, who has confessed to having fired on and killing Luis Donaldo Colosio.
