FR940407-0-00003 FR940407-0-00001 Statement of Consideration This rule terminates the seasonal plans for paying producers under the New England and New York-New Jersey Federal orders. These seasonal payment plans provide for making deductions from prices paid to producers during the normal flush-production months of March through June and returning to producers the deducted amounts during the normal short-production months of August through November. The plans are intended to provide an incentive for dairy farmers to level out their production during the year. The termination of the payment plans was requested by cooperative associations that represent dairy farmers who supply handlers regulated under the orders. Collectively, these cooperatives represent about 51 percent of the producers associated with the New England marketing area and about 48 percent of the producers associated with the New York-New Jersey marketing area. The cooperative associations proposing the terminations are Agri-Mark, Inc.; Allied Federated Cooperatives, Inc.; Atlantic Dairy Cooperative, Inc.; Dairylea Cooperative, Inc., and its members cooperatives: Cortland Bulk Milk Producers Cooperative, Oneida-Madison Milk Producers Cooperative Association, Inc., and Steamburg Milk Producers Cooperative Association, Inc., and its affiliated cooperatives: Deer River Bulk Milk Cooperative, Inc., and Jefferson Bulk Milk Cooperative, Inc.; Eastern Milk Producers Cooperative Association, Inc., and its affiliated cooperatives: Chateaugay Co-operative Marketing Association, Inc., Konhokton Milk Producers Co-operative Association, Inc., Middlebury Milk Producers Cooperative Association, Inc., and Sullivan County Co-operative Dairy Association, Inc.; and Upstate Milk Cooperatives, Inc. Proponents contend that the ``Louisville'' seasonal payment plans are no longer effective or necessary to reduce the seasonal spring-to-fall swings in milk production as was intended when they were first provided for in these orders some 25 years ago. Proponents indicated that the seasonal payment plans are largely ineffective because of a general lack of awareness about the plans in the dairy farming community. They also contend that the price differentials are too low relative to milk prices to provide an incentive for dairy farmers to modify their seasonal production patterns. The proponents further indicated concern about the impact of reducing returns to producers during the spring months when producer milk prices are already generally lower than during other times of the year. In addition, it has been noted that the seasonal incentive payment plans are no longer necessary or effective since they have been suspended for the past three years. The proponents point out that these past suspension actions were supported by the need for dairy farmers to have additional monies available during the spring months during which prices to producers decline precipitously. Proponents expect that milk prices will decline in the spring months of 1994 and in the spring months of future years. They also maintain that retaining the payment plans will continue to put cash flow pressures on dairy farmers during a time of increased cash needs for spring planting. In the comments, Agri-Mark reiterated its support for the termination of the seasonal payment plans. The cooperative's primary support for termination involves the volatility of milk prices at low levels for the past several years. Agri-Mark maintains that if the Louisville seasonal payment plan had been in effect, about $20 million would have been removed from producer payments in the spring planting months and would have resulted in cash flow difficulties for many farms. Agri-Mark said that even those farmers who have contra-seasonal milk production would have reduced income during the spring and summer months. In further support for the termination of the seasonal payment plans, Agri-Mark indicated that actual seasonal price movements in the marketplace, to some extent, accomplished the fall price incentives originally intended by the Louisville payment plan. The cooperative noted that during the past three years, while the Louisville plans were suspended, the blend price in the August-November period averaged slightly more that $1.00 above the March-June period in both the New England and New York-New Jersey orders. Agri-Mark expects this pattern to generally continue.
