In addition to Mr. Feissel, the two-day consultations were also attended by two Rauf Denktas advisers; Robert Lamb, U.S. special coordinator on Cyprus; and Turkish Deputy Foreign Minister Tugay Ulucevik. In a statement made after his return, Mr. Feissel noted that all of the elements needed to implement the confidence-building measures were discussed at the Vienna consultations. He said he would be submitting a report to the UN secretary general, and added: Of course, we are proceeding with the UN secretary general's report to the Security Council, which is expected to circulate around the middle of this month as scheduled. Responding to a question on the results of the Vienna meetings, Mr. Feissel said he did not want to discuss it because the UN secretary general should be briefed first. He added: I would like to note that we have covered all aspects because we want to know where the Turkish Cypriots stand; this is important as the time is nearing for Mr. Butrus-Ghali's report to be submitted to the Security Council. Asked if progress was made at the talks on the confidence-building measures, Mr. Feissel reiterated that he did not want to divulge the details of what transpired but he described the meeting as useful. Mr. Feissel responded negatively to a question on whether he plans any more meetings before the Butrus-Ghali report is submitted, but he added that he would be briefing President Glavkos Kliridhis next week. At the same time, Robert Lamb left Vienna for London, where this evening he will meet with Joe Berg, acting director of the South European Department at the British Foreign Office. According to our London correspondent, this meeting is a briefing on the latest Vienna talks and will also be attended by (William Shapcoat), director of the Foreign Office bureau on the Cyprus issue.
