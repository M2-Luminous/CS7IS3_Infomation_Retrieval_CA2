FR940513-2-00118 FR940513-2-00049 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Fish and Wildlife Service Availability of the Draft Environmental Assessment and Land Protection Plan Proposed Establishment of Cossatot National Wildlife Refuge, Sevier County, Arkansas AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. ACTION: Notice of availability of the draft environmental assessment and land protection plan for the proposed establishment of Cossatot National Wildlife Refuge. SUMMARY: This notice advises the public that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Southeast Region, proposes to establish a national wildlife refuge in the vicinity of Sevier County, Arkansas. The purpose of the proposed refuge is to protect and manage up to 30,000 acres of bottomland hardwoods and their associated fish and wildlife in southwestern Arkansas. A Draft Environmental Assessment and Land Protection Plan for the proposed refuge has been developed by Service biologists in coordination with the State of Arkansas, the Sevier County Judge, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Soil Conservation Service, and The Nature Conservancy. The assessment considers the biological, environmental, and socioeconomic effects of establishing the refuge. The assessment also evaluates four alternative actions and their potential impacts on the environment. Written comments or recommendations concerning the proposal are welcomed and should be sent to the address below. DATES: Land acquisition planning for the project is currently underway. The draft assessment and land protection plan will be available to the public for review and comment on May 16, 1994. Written comments must be received no later than June 17, 1994, to be considered. ADDRESSES: Comments and requests for copies of the assessment and further information should be addressed to Mr. Charles R. Danner, Chief, Branch of Project Development, Office of Refuges and Wildlife, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 1875 Century Boulevard, Atlanta, Georgia 30345. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The primary objectives of the proposed Cossatot National Wildlife Refuge are to (1) preserve wetland and bottomland hardwood habitat for a natural diversity of wildlife, (2) provide habitat for neotropical migratory birds, (3) provide wintering habitat for migratory waterfowl, (4) provide breeding and nesting habitat for wood ducks, and (5) provide opportunities for compatible public outdoor recreation, such as hunting, fishing, hiking, birdwatching, and environmental education and interpretation. The proposed refuge area lies in the floodplain between the Cossatot and Little Rivers in Sevier County, Arkansas. Pond Creek and Little Creek meander through the area and several scenic oxbow lakes, lined with cypress trees, are prominent. Beavers have created numerous small ponds and flooded depressions. The habitat is primarily bottomland hardwoods with scattered pines. About 25,722 acres or 85 percent of the proposed refuge area is owned by the Weyerhaeuser Corporation and has been offered for sale or exchange to the Service. Weyerhaeuser has extensive land holdings in Arkansas and Oklahoma which are being managed for the production of pine timber. The proposed refuge area is primarily a low bottomland hardwood site that Weyerhaeuser has determined to be surplus to its future management needs. The remaining lands (approximately 4,300 acres) within the proposed refuge boundary are owned by about 30 private landowners. The Service proposes to acquire these lands through fee title purchases and/or land exchanges. Acquisition of these lands would be pursued under the authority of the Emergency Wetland Resources Act of 1986, unless special legislation is provided to facilitate the possible exchange of lands between the Weyerhaeuser Corporation and the Federal government. Dated: April 26, 1994. James W. Pulliam, Jr., Regional Director. Harold W. Benson, Acting Regional Director. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;11639 Filed 5&hyph;12&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;55&hyph;M
