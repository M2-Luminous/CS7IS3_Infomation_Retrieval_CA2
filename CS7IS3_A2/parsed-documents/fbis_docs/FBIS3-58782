Ciller did not receive the enthusiastic welcome she had expected from the crowd in her recent swing to Adana nor on her campaign stop in Malatya last weekend. Following the rally in Malatya, eggs and tangerines were thrown at her. Due to the tension within her party, she could not even announce the DYP's mayoral candidate for Malatya. Her mood influenced by her disappointment over the domestic tours, Ciller harshly reproached the columnists whom she takes on every domestic tour. When Ciller arrived at Malatya airport, the people showed their anger over the behavior of the police during the protest march of the civil servants the previous day, in which around 30 demonstrators were taken into custody. Inonu Square, where Ciller was to deliver her speech, was mostly filled with people from opposition parties and civil servants. While Ciller was delivering her address, pro Welfare Party (RP) people were giving the thumbs-up and the Grand Unity Party (BBP) members were making the wolf-sign in a bid to identify themselves. Ciller had to cut her speech short due to the incessant whistling and shouting. She later visited the governor of Malatya, Saffet Arikan Beduk, whom she held responsible for what had happened. Ciller became involved in more unpleasant situations before and after her visit to the Malatya mayor, who had joined the RP. A group of RP members and ultranationalists known as "ulkucu" (idealists) protested against her. Police used batons to disperse them. Meanwhile, one of the eggs and an orange thrown at the DYP convoy hit Ciller. Despite the protests, Ciller always kept a smile on her face. Explaining the reasons for the government's decision to extend the period of military service, Ciller said that the government aimed at preventing separatist terrorists from recovering their strength during the winter months. She said that the government did not have any other alternative but to extend the term of military service, since shifting troops from the western or northern regions to the Southeast seemed impossible because of developments in Greece and Russia.
