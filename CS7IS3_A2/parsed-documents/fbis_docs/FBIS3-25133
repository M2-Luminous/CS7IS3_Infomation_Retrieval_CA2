The statement said the defense minister's utterances are far from the actual situation in Somalia. This is not the first time the Italian defense minister has issued such disinformation. The statement said it is unfortunate that such remarks should be made by an Italian senior minister, adding that it is an issue that could seriously dent the excellent bilateral relations and cooperation existing between the two nations. The statement said it has become a habit of senior Italian officials to make misleading statements about Somalia with the deliberate intention of painting a negative picture of the prevailing situation in Somalia. The statement said the remarks made by the Italian defense minister are unfortunate, misleading, and made without proper research on the subject. The statement said the recent confrontation that took place in Balcad, Shabeelaha Dhexe region, was caused by an intentional provocation by the Italian soldiers, which led to deaths and injuries on both sides. The statement said the Government of Somalia is optimistic that, in the future, Italian leaders will consult their representative in Somalia before uttering misleading statements that could cause disinformation about a particular incident. It warned Italian officers against dramatizing minor incidents as well as avoiding matters that might trigger provocation between Italian soldiers and the local people. The statement advised Italian soldiers and officers to carry out their duties in accordance with the UN Operation in Somalia mandate.
