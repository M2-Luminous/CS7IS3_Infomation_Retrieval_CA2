Nevertheless, only three reactors have been shut down since 1992 on the site of the Kurchatov Research Center, and they could be back in use again shortly. This has been advised by Vladimir Kuznetsov, chief of the Moscow inspectorate of the State Committee for the Supervision of Nuclear and Radiation Safety.
