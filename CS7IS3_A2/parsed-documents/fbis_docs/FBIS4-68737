One of these means is called the law. What is this: Yet another declaration, or something real? [Alekseyev] Our former state adhered to unnatural factors that united various peoples, nations, and ethnic groups in its framework. Authoritarian power figured as the main factor for everyone. It was this that determined political principles not only of the former imperial state, but of society as well. There is no such factor today. Therefore, we should not foster unrealizable hopes associated with the creation of a new Union. This is already impossible. Nor will the institutions of foreign administrative power, on which some politicians set their hopes, "jump into action." Heads of state and members of their governments assemble, adopt various documents and statements about integration, but there was none and is none. Although this does not mean that integration is impossible, or is not necessary. Consequently there is a need to find a universal and effective factor of unification that is comprehensible to everyone. Strictly speaking there is no need to search for it. This is the law and the creation of a unified rule-of-law space that does not depend on the whim of leaders or any kind of official persons whatsoever. [OBSHCHAYA GAZETA] However, what does law mean? This, after all, is a very multidimensional concept, which in many ways is tied to the specific nature of the existence of one or another state. [Alekseyev] But I am talking about strictly specific things. I have in mind a legal principle that ORGANICALLY operates in practically all states and determines a significant part of their mutual relations. This is private law. The same that is based on Roman law and eternal legal values: property law, freedom of contract. Roman law, which spanned the entire history of human civilization, has not lost its influence on modern jurisprudence. But there is a reason for saying that Rome conquered the world three times. First, with force, then with religion, finally, with law. It is precisely the postulates developed by ancient Roman jurists that unite West Europe today. I am asserting this not without proof, but based on my experience in work in the court of the European Community in Luxembourg and contacts with colleagues who are prominent Western jurists in this work. And all of this because this law in turn originates from trade and the market economy. This is also the main path of integration for the CIS countries. At least, because nothing better has been devised. [OBSHCHAYA GAZETA] Yes, but with all their similarity, different systems of law operate in the Commonwealth states. [Alekseyev] I agree. But a working organ already exists that could resolve the "problem of disjunction." It is not necessary to reinvent the wheel. There is a center for research on private law in Russia. Its activity can be applied to the entire territory of the CIS. The task of the center: To develop a draft law concerning civil law (and this, really, is private law), which in its totality would form a certain unified system. [OBSHCHAYA GAZETA] But, after all, CIS members might not like your draft law. [Alekseyev] Of course. If draft laws of this kind lack quality. But the center guarantees precisely quality, inasmuch as they are being prepared and will be prepared by the very highest class of specialists. Moreover, Nazarbayev has already expressed his opinion in the sense that Kazakhstan is preparing its Civil Code with the help of Russian jurists. In addition, the private law center, even in its strictly Russian role, is inviting prominent jurists from the former Union republics to collaborate. We are working with Professor Basin from Almaty, Professor Krupnyy from Kyrgyzstan, and Ukrainian jurists. Thus, we are talking about giving the center the status of an organization within the scope of the entire CIS. [OBSHCHAYA GAZETA] But what is to be done with the pride of the leaders of the republics? They will want strictly THEIR OWN national Civil Codes? [Alekseyev] They will not be able to oppose absolute necessity. No matter what they say, market relations inside the CIS are a reality. They cannot exist outside the law. This means that they need an adequate juridical rigging, a form, if you wish. But it has turned out historically that there simply is no other form, besides the Civil Code, that is built on the principles of private law. Otherwise all these discussions about a new economy, a free market economic system, and entrepreneurship are pointless. As the saying goes, there is no alternative. In the whole world, civil society (and all CIS members want this) began with Civil Codes. While already in exile, Napoleon claimed that the Civil Code of France, which was established with his direct participation, was superior to all his 40 victories.
