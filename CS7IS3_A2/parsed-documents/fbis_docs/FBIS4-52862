He stressed that the wives and children of the Indonesian Embassy staff would be evacuated first if the situation worsens. The evacuation process will be coordinated with the other foreign missions. Since the recent outbreak of civil war between North and South Yemen, a steady stream of refugees has been seen leaving the affected zones daily. Touching on the issue concerning a group of New Zealand parliamentarians feeling agitated over the East Timor issue, Alatas stressed that they were not given complete and true information with regard to the East Timor issue. According to the minister, the attitude of the parliamentarians stems from the concern of a minor group of people who were ill-informed about the East Timor issue.
