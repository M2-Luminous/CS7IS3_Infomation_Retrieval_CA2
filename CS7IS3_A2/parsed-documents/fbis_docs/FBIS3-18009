[passage omitted] [Correspondent] The agreement exists on paper, but the Latvian Government has not taken a final decision on it and there is strong opposition in the parliament to some of the points in the agreement. One stumbling block has been the Russian radar base in Skrunda in west Latvia, but that is allowed to remain during a dismantling period of approximately five years. Bildt said that Sweden can think of economically assisting the dismantling. [passage omitted on Latvia's problem with retired Russian military personnel] During his visit to Riga, Bildt held meetings with President Guntis Ulmanis and Premier Valdis Birkavs and representatives of the opposition. Russia is not treating its former obedient Latvia with enough respect. The Latvians for their part must understand that Latvians have most to gain from an agreement with the Russians -- that was Bildt's message. This is what Bildt said on what was discussed in Riga today:. [begin Bildt recording] We have discussed the continuing process and this means both the process toward Russia -- where a meeting between President Ulmanis and President Yeltsin is currently being prepared, where certain outstanding questions will be solved -- and the process which must continue when we are creating increased understanding both in Latvia and in western countries for the Latvian security situation and concerns.
