"If the situation when vital issues of regional and nationality policies are solved without participation of the government member responsible for these issues remains, I will not be able to work in the cabinet," he told INTERFAX today. According to well-informed sources in the staff, Shakhray is virtually debarred from solving regional issues. For instance, the president transferred the responsibility for monitoring talks with Tatarstan on concluding a bilateral treaty on power-sharing from Shakhray to Vice Prime Minister Yuriy Yarov. It was Yarov and the head of the presidential staff, Sergey Filatov, who held a conference with the regional leaders without asking Shakhray to join them. Without his participation and despite his recommendations, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin held consultations with a representative of the Chechen president, M. Mugadayev, on Friday. INTERFAX learned that Shakhray did not participate in the first meeting of the reshuffled government. Prior to this, he put forward two conditions for his joining the government, i.e. his ministry's direct subordination to the head of the government and membership in the government presidium. However, he has never received an answer to the demands.
