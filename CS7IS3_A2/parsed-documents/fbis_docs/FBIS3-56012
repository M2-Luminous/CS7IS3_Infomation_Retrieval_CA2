Documents pertaining to the "Partnership for Peace" programme signed by the heads of state and government of the NATO member-states in Brussels on January 10 confirm provisions of the 1949 Washington Treaty to the effect that NATO remains open for other European states to join it. Participants in the session of the North Atlantic alliance reiterated that the expansion of the NATO to the east will be carried out on the basis of an evolutional process and that countries claiming NATO membership must first prove their capacity to "contribute to ensuring security of the North Atlantic region." The documents neither set any term for admitting new members into the alliance, nor name probable candidates. On the eve of the Brussels summit the U.S. president's aide for National Security Anthony Lake declared that hasty admission of new member-states into the alliance might lead to the destabilisation of the situation in the European region, which meets neither NATO's interests nor the interests of the states of Central and Eastern Europe. The U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher expressed the opinion that none of the NATO member-states considers new applicants to be prepared for membership in the alliance. It seems that both the United States and other NATO member-states are interested in maintaining existing tendencies in countries, which formerly belonged to the Warsaw Treaty Organisation, as well as Ukraine, Belarus, and the Baltic states, and seek to fortify the current situation by military and political measures. However, participants in the Brussels summit realise that the immediate admission of new members into the alliance will cause a negative response in Russia, since in the long run, military alliances are usually targeted against some state or a bloc of states. The immediate admission of former Warsaw Treaty member-states, with Russia being left out, might be seen as a discriminatory and unfriendly step against the Russian Federation. Such developments are not likely to strengthen stability in Europe or democratic processes in Russia. "Partnership for Peace" adopted at the NATO session in Brussels is, perhaps, the best option of resolving uneasy problems of the European security. This programme envisages a number of measures of a military and political character for ensuring security of the programme participants and maintaining stability in the European region. These measures include joint military operations with NATO member-states, joint planning and joint military exercises, and envisage consultations with NATO by any member-state of the "partnership" if it decides that it is being threatened.
