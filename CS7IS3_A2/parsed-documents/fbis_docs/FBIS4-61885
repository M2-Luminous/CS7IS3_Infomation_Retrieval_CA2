The minister said that Karabakh needs no large-scale military assistance at present, because the armed forces of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic can effectively rebuff all attacks of the Azeri Army. The situation at the front in Nagorno-Karabakh has sharply improved in favour of the Karabakh Army and the initiative is in the latter's hands. The Azeri Army has suffered considerable losses in manpower and military equipment, the minister said. According to his estimates, Azerbaijan has lost about 12 thousand soldiers and officers since December 18, and 650-700 officers and soldiers, two combat aircraft, twelve T-72 tanks, six armoured vehicles, four artillery guns, two tractors and several truckfuls of ammunition since the beginning of the April offensive. During the same period, Karabakh lost 70 men, three tanks and two armoured vehicles. The Armenian minister said Azerbaijan's leaders are trying to hide the amount of their Army's recent losses in the Mardakert and Agdam districts and are exaggerating the losses sustained by Karabakh. The Armenian minister rejected allegations that the Armenian Armed Forces are involved in battles in Nagorno-Karabakh. He said the Karabakh Armenians make up the bulk of the fighters in Nagorno-Karabakh and a few tens of volunteers of Karabakh extraction from Armenia cannot change the overall picture. "We cannot forbid small groups of volunteers from Armenia to go to Karabakh in order to protect their relatives and friends, no more than we can regard them as armed forces," he said. Sargsyan said Azerbaijan's authorities are seeking to involve Yerevan in the war in order to portray the Karabakh conflict as a result of territorial claims of one country to another, instead of the Nagorno-Karabakh's people national liberation struggle for self-determination. Azerbaijan's leaders "are ashamed to admit that the small Karabakh formations have been routing for a number of years larger Azeri forces armed with modern weapons and reinforced with Afghan Mojahedins, Turkish instructors and Ukrainian and Pakistani mercenaries," the minister said. The Armenian leader rejected allegations that special units of the Russian Army are taking part in battles on the side of Nagorno-Karabakh to capture Azeri positions and hand them over to the Karabakh military. "Frankly speaking it would be good if the Russian Army were really involved there. But unfortunately, the Azeri allegations have nothing in common with reality," Sargsyan said.
