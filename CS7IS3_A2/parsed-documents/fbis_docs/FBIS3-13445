Speaking to our army affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe, the sources said the steps were designed to prevent confusion among soldiers caused by a Border Police officer's testimony before the Shamgar Commission. Our correspondent notes that the steps are designed to elucidate the existing instructions, according to which weapons are not to be used when enforcing law and public order on Israelis in the territories. Nevertheless, when observing an Israeli civilian shooting to hit others, or endangering others' lives without being in a life-threatening situation himself, the soldiers have to take every reasonable measure, including the use of firearms.
