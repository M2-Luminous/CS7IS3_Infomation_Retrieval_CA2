Also invited were government officials and security forces. Earlier, an unidentified man bombed two mosques, apparently in retaliation for the bombing of the San Pedro Cathedral in Davao City, southern Philippines. In the Davao blast, six persons were killed while some 130 others were wounded. The other explosion was in Bonifacio, Misamis Occidental on Christmas Eve, killing five persons and injuring about 40 others. AFP [Armed Forces of the Philippines] Chief of Staff Lisandro Abadia says the spate of bombings in Mindanao could be the handiwork of some extremists group out to derail the peace process. Nur Misuari, chairman of the Moro National Liberation Front, MNLF, strongly deplored the bombing incident in Davao City last Sunday. Misuari issued this strongly worded statement during yesterday's meeting of the joint ad hoc technical working committee of both the government panel and the MNLF in Timbangan, Indanan, Jolo. In condemning the attacks, Misuari said the bombings of different places are deplorable and cowardly acts. He said, it is also a blasphemy which the MNLF will never allow or condone.
