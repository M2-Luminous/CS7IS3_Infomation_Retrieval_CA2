[(Geronez)] We plan to keep an ensemble of measures after the conclusion of this campaign. The first thing we are going to do is work at the current level of intensity throughout the time the harvest is taking place. The harvest is to last until the end of April, more or less, possibly through the first days of May. After that, we plan to keep up a certain level of harassment, with checkpoints on the main roads linking our province with the City of Havana and also at certain points linking Pinar del Rio Province -- necessarily passing through our province -- with the City of Havana. A large quantity of products comes from Pinar del Rio and these products need to be protected until they reach the product-concentrating market [mercado concentrador] and, finally, the local produce market [placita]. [Alemany] According to Lt. Col. (Geronez) of the Havana Province Ministry of Interior [Minint] Office, all the forces responsible for agricultural products' reaching the cold-storage facilities and the wholesale and retail produce markets for equitable distribution among the population will thoroughly carry out their mission to guarantee that the population is supplied with foodstuffs. [(Geronez)] We comrades absorbed in this task, in this harvest, are working meticulously and arduously so that our population can feel secure, can trust that the products earmarked for cold-storage facilities will go there; and that those earmarked for the product-concentrating markets for direct consumption by the population will arrive and reach the people. It is important for all the products earmarked for cold-storage facilities to arrive and be stored because that is what is going to permit the systematic provisioning of the population with an entire series of products throughout the year, products that are going to be in short supply because they will be out of season, in short supply from the point of view of agricultural production, I mean. Because we think that the quantities being put into cold storage can guarantee a certain level of supply. [Alemany] Lastly, Lt. Col. (Geronez) said Havana Province's Minint forces will always fulfill their duty of preventing unscrupulous or criminal individuals from continuing to affect the security and tranquility of the citizenry. [(Geronez)] It is truly a commitment of ours, all us Minint comrades, all our institution's officers corps, troops, and auxiliaries, to have those products reach the population, have those products contribute to alleviating our country's food situation. And we are going to work, struggle, make the greatest effort so that our people will feel satisfaction with all the work we are doing.
