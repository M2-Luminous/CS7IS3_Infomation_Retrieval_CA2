The party's [word indistinct] decision-making Central Standing Committee at a regular meeting endorsed a proposal that James Chu, director of the party's Cultural Affairs Department, be promoted to deputy secretary-general. The post vacated by Chu will be filled by Chien Han-sun, now the chairman of the KMT Taipei Municipal Committee, and Chien will be succeeded by Tiao You-ping, secretary-general of the Taipei city government. The KMT also appointed Wu Wan-lan, deputy director of the China Youth Corps, the director of the party's Social Affairs Department, to replace Chung Jung-chi, who was elevated to the post of chairman of the KMT provincial committee after Tu Te-chi stepped down last week to placate widespread anger over the vote-buying scandal surrounding the March 1 elections for speakers and deputy speakers of 21 city and county councils. Local newspapers reported that KMT Secretary-General Hu Shui-the started planning the reshuffle soon after his return from the Philippines Monday evening. A party worker who requested anonymity said the appointments of Tsao and Wu had surprised many party members because neither of the two men has held a position in the party before. Chien said at a press conference following the meeting that he would dedicate himself to communicating with other political parties, "so as to help promote Taiwan's party politics."
