The head of the Iranian delegation criticized the Swiss and the Netherlands policies on this issue. Luciano Violante, vice president of the Italian Parliament, had proposed to liberalize soft drugs like hashish. Such a measure, he said, would facilitate the fight against the mafia. Argentine's Adolfo Beria, president of the UN Council for the fight against crime, explained that the conference had rejected this proposal. "In the name of Allah," the Iranian delegate, Mehdi Mirafzai, strongly condemned any liberalization. He expressed his deep concern over the ongoing legalization processes in several countries, particularly in Switzerland and in the Netherlands. He called for a survey which should assess the effects of the liberalization of drugs on the fight against money laundering.
