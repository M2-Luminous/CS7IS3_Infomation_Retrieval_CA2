SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background States with final authorization under section 3006(b) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA or the Act''), 42 U.S.C. 6926(b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous waste program. Revisions to State hazardous waste programs are necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority is modified or when certain other changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR parts 124, 260 through 268, and 270. B. Arkansas Arkansas initially received final authorization on January 25, 1985, (see 50 FR 1513) to implement its base hazardous waste management program. Arkansas received authorization for revisions to its program on August 23, 1985, May 29, 1990 (see 55 FR 11192), November 18, 1991 (see 56 FR 57593 and 56 FR 47153), and December 4, 1992 (see 57 FR 45721 and 57 FR 45722). The authorized Arkansas RCRA program was incorporated by reference into the Code of Federal Regulations effective December 13, 1993 (see 58 FR 52674). On June 9, 1994, Arkansas submitted a final complete program revision application for additional program approvals. Today, Arkansas is seeking approval of its program revision in accordance with 40 CFR 271.21(b)(3). EPA has reviewed the State of Arkansas's application, and decided that Arkansas's hazardous waste program revision satisfies all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Consequently, EPA intends to grant final authorization for Arkansas's additional program modifications. The public may submit written comments on EPA's final decision until November 21, 1994. Copies of Arkansas's application for program revision are available for inspection and copying at the locations indicated in the ADDRESSES section of this notice.
