Chris Patten, since his assumption of the governorship of Hong Kong, has simply been ignoring these binding agreements, doing whatever he wants to do, taking unilateral actions, undermining steady transition, and creating chaos with a view to extending British rule and gaining more colonial interests. The man who totally disregards the agreements may think himself very clever. But, in fact, what he has done will prove to be the most stupid trick, since British interests rest on the agreements between China and Britain, too. If the British forsake these agreements and take their own way, they will finally find out that British interests will be hurt, and Chris Patten will reap what he has sown. As far as the airport issue is concerned, Chris Patten has always been playing the "piecemeal" appropriation tactics, acting first and reporting afterward, as he believes that what has been done cannot be undone. His trick is to let the excess in the construction costs keep accumulating and the "callable equity" keep aggregating, and then leave the awful mess to the special administrative region [SAR] government. In doing so Chris Patten definitely has impaired the interests of Hong Kong people and totally violated the Sino-British memorandum on the new Hong Kong airport project. An airport project with constantly inflating construction costs will certainly be a project of high costs and poor returns. The new Hong Kong airport is not to be built with pounds Chris Patten brings from his home country. Therefore, he is not entitled to be generous at Hong Kong's expense and to dispose of Hong Kong people's money lavishly. The memorandum has ruled that the liabilities related to the airport construction to be left behind by the British Hong Kong Government shall not exceed Hong Kong $5 million. Now the increase in construction costs and repeated financial appropriations as a result of unilateral acts taken by the British Hong Kong Government will leave a HK$45 billion worth of liabilities to be borne by the SAR government after 1997, which will be more than nine times as much as the limit set by the memorandum. The British Hong Kong Government's financial appropriations in violation of the guideline on liabilities as prescribed by the memorandum are bound to arouse reaction from the Chinese side. In order to safeguard the interests of Hong Kong people, to ensure sound financing for the SAR government, and to achieve a steady transition, the Chinese side will have to take some precautionary measures. In a statement made yesterday, the spokesman for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council declared: Unless the Chinese and British sides reach an agreement on the financing of the new Hong Kong airport project, 1) the Chinese side and the future SAR government will take no responsibility for any financial outlays and liabilities arising from the new airport project. 2) All land leases related to the new airport project and the revenues arising therefrom, including the airport reclamation and plots of land along the airport railway, are, with no exception, subject to negotiations and approval by the Sino-British Land Commission, in accordance with the provisions of Annex III to the Sino-British Joint Declaration. 3) All contracts related to the new airport project, striding over 30 June 1997, and signed by the British Hong Kong Government without the prior consent of the Chinese side will be null and void as of 1 July 1997. 4) All legislation related to the new airport project passed in the British Hong Kong Legislative Council will be null and void as of 1 July 1997. It is not that the Chinese side does not endorse the construction of the new airport. In fact, the Chinese side has so far approved the Central and Wanchai land reclamation projects and the Western cross-harbor tunnel project. The Chinese side's very intention is to ensure that all financial outlays conform with the memorandum, to minimize the huge amount of liabilities left over to the SAR government, and to urge the British side to return to the negotiating table and stop arbitrarily spending and appropriating. With a financial surplus of over HK$100 billion, the British side now resorts to an idea of shifting liabilities onto the SAR government by encroaching on the SAR's land lease revenue and securing a huge amount of loans. This destructive [chai lan wu 2135 3620 3064] behavior will undermine cooperation and steady transition. And the British side's purpose in doing so is to take away the money from Hong Kong people and turn it into staggering profits in British consortia's pockets. For example, the Chingma Bridge project promises a profit rate as high as 50 percent. And that is the reason why the British cabinet committee does not hesitate to support Chris Patten in breaching agreements and acting recklessly during the late transitional period. The practice to leave over to the SAR government an amount of liabilities nine times as much as the limit prescribed by the memorandum is a wishful thinking on the part of Chris Patten. But now the Chinese side has declared that it will not take any responsibility for such financial outlays and liabilities. This will warn international consortia not to be fooled by the British Hong Kong authorities and not to grant loans at risk. This actually will prevent the British from arbitrarily spending money and leaving huge debts to Hong Kong people. The British side is also trying to pave the way for acquiring greater economic benefits after 1997, by such means as reassignment, signing contracts, granting franchises, authorizing the airport corporation to grant land leases, and formulating the new airport corporation bill to make the corporation an "independent kingdom" and thus sidestep supervision. But any losses arising thereof will be borne by Hong Kong people. Therefore, the Chinese side will not possibly recognize any laws and ordinances, contracts, and franchises concerned before any agreement is reached. The purpose in doing so is to guard against the attempt by the British Hong Kong Government to anticipate and exhaust Hong Kong's financial resources. Lots of historical facts, as well as what is taking place now, show that the British are trying to create chaos and then fish in troubled waters, making money by every means. The disputes between China and Britain on the airport issue are, in substance, an issue of whether to observe the memorandum in running the airport project or not and whether to handle transition affairs through negotiations and cooperation or not. Everyone who loves the motherland and Hong Kong will support the Chinese side's sensible, reasonable, and legal measures and oppose any arbitrary acts taken by the colonial authorities out of selfish consideration.
