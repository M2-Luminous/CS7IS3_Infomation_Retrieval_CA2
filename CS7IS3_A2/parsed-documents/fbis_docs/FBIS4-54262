The gist of this message is as follows: 1. HE Khieu Samphan joyfully expressed his support for a unified and undivided Cambodia, with its territorial integrity in line with the frontiers recognized internationally from 1963 to 1969. He also voiced support for Cambodia's national ideals of peace, (?solidarity), unity, and progress toward rebuilding (?Cambodia). 2. H.E. Khieu Samphan also stressed the cease-fire issue to the king. He said the situation in Cambodia is very complicated because of the 24-year war. The Vietnamese war of aggression alone has already lasted for 15 years. In addition, foreigners -- both old and new -- have come to interfere in Cambodia's internal affairs, both militarily and as civilians. For this reason, to enable the cease-fire to proceed genuinely, clearly, and permanently, H.E. Khieu Samphan and the PDK proposed to the king that foreign observers from five countries be chosen from among the following 10 countries: Brunei, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Switzerland, Austria, Finland, the Philippines, and Egypt. H.E. Khieu Samphan proposed that these neutral foreign observers join the Cambodian joint commission in monitoring the cease-fire. H.E. Khieu Samphan proposed cease-fire monitoring in the central, western, and eastern parts of Cambodia and on Cambodia's seas. This will ensure the cease-fire and prevent foreign troops and arms from entering Cambodia. The cease-fire may begin any day as long as cease-fire monitoring is thoroughly arranged. H.E. Khieu Samphan stressed that a cease-fire would be a chance at a solution to end the war and achieve national reconciliation and peace. Therefore, it should be thoroughly arranged. All of Cambodia's problems should be discussed at the roundtable meeting without any preconditions. This will enable all Cambodian parties to discuss and settle all problems -- big and small -- in line with the goals (?of) genuine national reconciliation and peace which constitute the profound desire of our entire Cambodian nation and people.
