FR940516-2-00140 FR940516-2-00094 ( ii ) New Mexico; ( iii ) Puerto Rico; and ( iv ) Wyoming. ( 2 ) A preference of five additional points will be given for applications that propose to establish new fair housing enforcement organizations in localities within any of the following underserved areas: ( i ) Alabama; ( ii ) Louisiana; ( iii ) Mississippi; ( iv ) Nebraska; ( v ) Oregon; and ( vi ) Utah. ( 3 ) An applicant may seek funding to establish a new organization in a locality not included in the list of target areas, above, but in such a case, the applicant must submit sufficient evidence to establish the proposed area as being currently underserved by fair housing enforcement organizations and as containing large concentrations of protected classes. An applicant may provide additional evidence of the need to establish a fair housing organization in a locality by citing data and studies that indicate the presence of housing discrimination and/or segregation in the locality. An example of evidence that may be used for this purpose is provided in (but is not limited to) the study, American Apartheid: Segregation and the Making of the Underclass, by Nancy A. Denton and Douglas S. Massey (Harvard University Press, 1993). (D) Additional requirements. The following requirements apply to activities funded under the Establishing New Organizations purpose of the FHO Initiative: ( 1 ) Term of contract. Two-year projects must be twenty-four months in duration, and funding for the second year of a project is subject to a performance review of the first year's activities and available annual appropriations. (iii) Additional Requirements. The following requirements apply to all activities funded under the Fair Housing Organizations Initiative: (A) Testers in testing activities funded with FHO Initiative funds must not have prior felony convictions or convictions of crimes involving fraud or perjury, and they must receive training or be experienced in testing procedures and techniques. (B) Projects that appear to be aimed solely or primarily at research or data-gathering unrelated to existing or planned fair housing enforcement programs will not be approved. Data-gathering activities will require OMB approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act before commencement of the activity. (C) No recipient of assistance under the FHO Initiative may use any funds provided by the Department for the payment of expenses in connection with litigation against the United States. (D) Recipients of funds under the FHO Initiative shall be required to record, in a case tracking log (or Fair Housing Enforcement Log) to be supplied by HUD, information appropriate to the funded project relating to the number of complaints of discrimination received; the basis of these complaints; the type and number of tests utilized in the investigation of each allegation; the time for case processing, including administrative or judicial proceedings; the cost of testing activities and case processing; and case outcome or relief provided. The recipient must agree to make this log available to HUD. (d) Selection Criteria/Ranking Factors (1) Selection Criteria for Ranking Applications for Assistance In addition to the preference points indicated in section I.(c) for particular activities, all projects proposed in applications will be ranked on the basis of the following criteria for selection: (i) The anticipated impact of the project proposed on the concerns identified in the application. (25 points) In determining the anticipated impact of the proposed project, HUD will consider the degree to which a proposed project addresses problems and issues that are significant fair housing problems and issues, as explained in the application, or based upon other information available to HUD. (The clarity and thoroughness of the project description can be considered in this determination.) This criterion will be judged on the basis of the applicant's submissions in response to paragraph III. (a)(1) of this NOFA under the heading ``Checklist of Application Submission Requirements.'' (ii) The extent to which the project will provide benefits in support of fair housing after funded activities have been completed. (25 points) In determining the extent to which the project will provide benefits after funded activities have been completed, HUD will consider the degree to which the project will be of continuing use in dealing with housing discrimination after funded activities have been completed. This criterion will be judged on the basis of the applicant's submissions in response to paragraph III.(a)(6) and III.(a)(7) of this NOFA under the heading ``Checklist of Application Submission Requirements.''
