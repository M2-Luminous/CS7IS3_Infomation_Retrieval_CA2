ACTION: Notice of amendment to final results of antidumping duty administrative reviews. SUMMARY: On July 26, 1993, the Department of Commerce published the final results of its administrative reviews of the antidumping duty orders on antifriction bearings (other than tapered roller bearings) and parts thereof from France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Romania, Singapore, Sweden, Thailand and the United Kingdom. The classes or kinds of merchandise covered by these reviews are ball bearings and parts thereof, cylindrical roller bearings and parts thereof, and spherical plain bearings and parts thereof. The reviews covered 41 manufacturers/exporters and the period May 1, 1991 through April 30, 1992. Based on the correction of ministerial errors, we are amending the final results with respect to Japanese ball bearings, cylindrical roller bearings and spherical plain bearings sold by one company. EFFECTIVE DATE: February 28, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Philip Marchal or Michael Rill, Office of Antidumping Compliance, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230; telephone (202)482&hyph;4733. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On July 26, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the Federal Register the final results of its administrative reviews of the antidumping duty orders on antifriction bearings (other than tapered roller bearings) and parts thereof (AFBs) from France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Romania, Singapore, Sweden, Thailand and the United Kingdom (58 FR 39729). The classes or kinds of merchandise covered by these reviews were ball bearings and parts thereof (BBs), cylindrical roller bearings and parts thereof (CRBs), and spherical plain bearings and parts thereof (SPBs). The reviews covered 41 manufacturers/exporters and the period May 1, 1991 through April 30, 1992. After publication of our final results, we received timely allegations of ministerial errors from Honda Motor Company concerning the final results for AFBs from Japan sold by Honda. We agree with one of these allegations and have made the necessary correction. Specifically, Honda had submitted two sets of home market data. Although we had intended in our final results to use only certain portions of each of these datasets, we used the wrong portions in our final results. We have therefore corrected our analysis by using the correct portions of Honda's submitted home market datasets. Amended Final Results of Reviews As a result of our corrections of ministerial errors, we have determined the following percentage weighted-average margins to exist for the period May 1, 1991 through April 30, 1992: ‚ê£ 1Company 1BBs 1CRBs 1SPBs Honda 0.04 0.16 0.16 The Department shall determine, and the Customs Service shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries. Individual differences between United States price and foreign market value may vary from the percentages stated above. The Department will issue appraisement instructions on each exporter directly to the Customs Service. Because these rates for Honda are less than 0.50 percent and, therefore, de minimis for cash deposit purposes, the Department will require a cash deposit of zero for all entries of the above merchandise from Honda. These deposit requirements are effective for all shipments of the subject merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of this notice and shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative reviews. This notice also serves as a reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. This notice is published in accordance with section 751(f) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1675(f)) and 19 CFR 353.28(c). Dated: February 15, 1994. Joseph A. Spetrini, Acting Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;4504 Filed 2&hyph;25&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;P
