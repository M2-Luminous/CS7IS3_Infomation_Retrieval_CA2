This disclosure was made today at the Colloquium on the Drug Traffic, Security, and Human Rights. Those participating in the event agreed that now that the Colombian drug trafficker, Pablo Escobar Gaviria, is dead there will be many others to take his place. The director of strategic studies at the National Institute To Combat Drugs, Efren Ortiz Villasenor, commented, ``Much attention is being paid to the effects of the drug traffic, and not so much to its causes; however, we must make use of prevention.'' He declared: ``Education is the most important factor enabling people to develop a critical capacity, because conducting campaigns with moralistic or censuring focuses brings no results.'' He stressed, ``It is no longer a matter of merely fighting drug consumption and trafficking. Rather, it entails a more ambitious effort: determining how to achieve a rational control over them. ``The drug traffic, attacking the nation's fundamental values, should be viewed as a national security problem, and all the necessary resources should be activated to prevent it.'' [passage omitted] Alejandro Reyes Posada, a researcher from the Institute of Political Studies and International Relations at the National University of Colombia, claimed that the illegal status of drugs ``has created an artificial market with large profits. The more their trafficking and production are repressed, the greater the increase in the drug dealers' profits.'' He emphasized that the illegal status of the latter's activity induces them to protect their interests by using violence and corrupting civil servants. He also noted: ``The most dangerous threat to any country's security insofar as the Mafias are concerned is that they become associated with big capital, because of the lucrative nature of the drug trafficking business and its great capacity for violence. As a result, movements of a fascist type appear.'' He indicated, ``The genuine weapon of societies in their battle against those groups is the reinforcement of the state, the law, and justice, as well as of democracy and civilian society. ``Involving university students in the discussion and understanding of the problem is part of an effort to organize and strengthen societies, so as to prevent the Mafias engaged in this illicit business from absorbing and destroying them.'' The rector of the University of Guadalajara, Raul Padilla Lopez, observed: ``In our time, the drug traffic has become a serious public security problem. It is impossible to disregard the frequent occasions on which the battle against it has led to violations of individual guarantees and human rights.'' He added that a global problem such as the one described demands solutions of an equal magnitude, which do not exempt nations from a clear commitment to combat it within their borders. It also requires ``an extensive, pluralistic dialogue with society.'' The state attorney, Leobardo Larios Guzman, who opened the meeting representing Governor Carlos Rivera Aceves, claimed that fighting the drug traffic is not an exclusive function of the government system, because the whole society, through its various sectors, is also committed to it, particularly in the area of prevention.
