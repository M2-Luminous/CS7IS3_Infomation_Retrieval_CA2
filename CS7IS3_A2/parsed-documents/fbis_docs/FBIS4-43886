The Belgian foreign minister also let it be understood that the aim of French intervention was to create a "safe area" in western Rwanda (which is still controlled by the Rwandan Government Army) or in Zaire to protect the people. Claes told the press, however, that this operation could lead to a "massive evacuation" of Tutsis to neighboring countries, most likely Zaire, to shelter them temporarily from the massacres, with the hope of subsequently returning them to Rwanda. "We will not provide troops, but we are prepared to provide logistical support," Mr. Claes said, referring to food aid and telecommunications support. According to the minister, sending Belgian troops, or even civilians, within the framework of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), to Rwanda has been ruled out as long as the anti-Belgian campaign continues in Rwanda. This campaign has been fed by Hutu extremist radio stations which accuse Belgium of being responsible for the death of President Juvenal Habyarimana last 6 April in a mysterious plane accident. Mr. Claes stated, however, that "Belgium was expecting Paris to give it a list of what it wants. The United States is also prepared to provide logistical support," he noted. The minister also called on France not to underestimate the "military risks" of a direct confrontation with the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) during the operation for which it is currently trying to get the go-ahead from the UN Security Council, despite the opposition of certain French politicians, the OAU, and the RPF. According to Claes, it is to avoid such confrontation that the French Government has chosen to operate out of Goma, a Zairian town located on the Rwandan border and alongside lake Kivu. Claes added that ``Paris has initiated informal contacts with the RPF in several countries to try and convince the rebel movement that its initiative was genuinely humanitarian and was aimed at saving Tutsis who are still in the area controlled by the Rwandan Government Army. ``I do not think that the French, who in my opinion, are acting under pressure from French public opinion, have an interest in consolidating the positions of the government Army,'' Mr. Claes added. Claes went on to explain that the maximum duration of two months for intervention was set by France to await the implementation of UNAMIR-II [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda] by the United Nations. UNAMIR-II should primarily be composed of African blue helmets.
