It is the greatest happiness and fortune of the Korean people to have Comrade Kim Il-song who regards the people as heaven and devotes everything to the noble cause for the people all his life. This is stressed in an editorial article of MINJU CHOSON Tuesday. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song is quoted as saying: "`To believe in the people as in heaven' is my maxim and philosophy. Ever since I embarked on the road of revolution, I have served the masses of people, regarding them as heaven and made the revolution in reliance on their strength." In the first part, the article says respected Comrade Kim Il-song is the people's leader who has made the noble idea of "believing in the people as in heaven" his maxim and philosophy. This outstanding idea calls for regarding the people as the most valuable and greatest beings in the world, absolutely trusting them and relying on them at all times. Proceeding from his unshakable viewpoint and position that the masses of people are responsible for the revolution and construction and in charge of them, the respected leader propounded the great idea that when one believes in the people as in heaven and relies on them, one gains everything and wins victory every time. Go to the people when difficulties crop up in the way of revolution, when you are hungry, when you are thirsty and when you are sad. This is the unshakable creed of our respected leader. With this creed, he began his revolutionary struggle with mixing with the people, and has always found himself among the people, never neglecting his contact with them, and triumphantly fought his way through the protracted trials of revolution, sharing weal and woe with them. His idea of "believing in the people as in heaven" is the basic idea running through the immortal chuche idea, the guiding idea of our party. This idea serves as an invariable guiding compass which provides the revolutionaries and communists with a scientific knowledge of the decisive role of the people, who transform the world and shape their own destiny, and enables them to resolve every problem in reliance on the inexhaustible strength of the people. In the second part, the article says Comrade Kim Il-song is a great leader who has brilliantly embodied in our revolutionary practice the noble idea of "believing in the people as in heaven," his maxim and philosophy. He has mapped up lines and policies reflecting the will and interests of the people and carried them into effect and established the most popular mode of politics -- the work system and order for service to the people. He expounded that the revolutionary struggle and constructive work are chiefly aimed at realising the desire and demand of the people for independence, and saw that the revolutionary lines and strategy and tactics were worked out always our own way on the basis of the people's desire and demand and every problem was solved with their own efforts. He regards the will and demand of the people as absolute, respects them to the maximum and solves every problem to suit their tastes, saying that the revolution is for the people and what they say is good is always good. This fundamental idea runs through the course of his shaping lines and policies. He formed chuche-type political organisations whose noble mission it is to serve the people and established within them a well-regulated work system and order of looking after the people's destiny in a responsible manner. All the officials subordinate everything to the people and do anything in their interest as required by the party's slogan "We serve the people" and a unique mode of politics suited to the essential nature of Korean-style socialist society centred on the masses has been established throughout society. This is a patent proof of the sagacity of Comrade Kim Il-song's leadership. In the third part, the article explains that the respected leader's noble idea of "believing in the people as in heaven" is a great idea which has been applied to our revolutionary practice and displayed a great vitality. Our people have boldly broken the established concepts, common knowledge and all mysticism and established their new tradition and new model with unprecedented heroism and creativity and ushered in a new history of epoch-making changes in this land. The source of the strength of this great creation is the idea of "believing in the people as in heaven." This noble idea of Comrade Kim Il-song is being unswervingly carried forward and brought into fuller play by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, an outstanding thinker and theoretician and a tested statesman. The dear leader enjoys deep respect and trust from the Korean people and the world revolutionary people and has the highest authority among the state leaders in the world for his great traits of always leading the revolution and construction victoriously under the fast-changing situation, turning adversity into favorable conditions with a firm belief in the people and in reliance on them and for his imperishable exploits for the party and the revolution, the country and the people.
