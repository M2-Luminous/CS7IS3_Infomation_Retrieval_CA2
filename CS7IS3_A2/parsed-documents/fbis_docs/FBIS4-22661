FBIS4-22661 "jpusr043___94014" FBIS-USR-94-043 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 21 April 1994 UKRAINE ECONOMIC AFFAIRS Antidumping Suit Against Steel Firm Viewed Antidumping Suit Against Steel Firm Viewed 944K1089A Lvov POST-POSTUP in Ukrainian No 9, 1-7 Apr p B4 944K1089A Lvov POST-POSTUP Ukrainian CSO [Unattributed article: "The Ukrainian Government Considers That Canada Has Begun an Antidumping Investigation Against the Azovstal AT Without Any Grounds for Doing So"] Four Canadian producers of carbon steel--Algoma Steel, Inc., Steelco, Inc., Ipso, Inc., and CNT Steel--have begun a "hunting season" on the exporters of steel to Canada. Over the period of the first eight months of last year 40 percent of the imports of this metal to the country of the maple leaf were designated as dumping. Toward the end of last year Ukraine was added to the list of the other three "violators"--Spain, Italy, and Korea. On 18 October Canada's Department of National Profits instituted an antidumping suit against the Azovstal AT [Joint-Stock Company], which is located in Mariopol. According to this department's data, the average price of Ukrainian steel is set at only 76.1 percent of its true value (the dumping mark ranged from 69.5 to 83.3 percent). Despite the fact that during the period since 1991 the states of the EC [European Communities] and America have instituted nine antidumping suits against Ukraine, this latest instance cannot have the best influence on mutual relations between Ukraine and Canada. On Ukraine's part, this case is being handled by the intersector and interministerial commssions which have been set up under the Ukeainian Council of Ministers. As is known, the Ukrainian side has the intention of striving to close this case because of the lack of direct proofs that the Azovstal AT has engaged in any antidumping operations in the Canadia market. It is also known that--in the case at hand--Ukraine is allowing for the possibility of appealing to higher international juridical institutions. The fact of the matter is that last year Azovstal delivered 14,000 tonnes of steel (FOB at the Ukrainian port) to the German firm of Klopner at a price between 258,000 and 259,000 U.S. dollars. The Germans re-exported 7,800 tonnes of this amount to Canada. It was specifically the steel re-exported by Klopner that became the occasion for the antidumping investigation. But according to the contract between Azovstal and Klopner, the former bears no responsibility for any further profits made on the steel sold to the German firm. Moreover, officials in Kiev have asserted that the export price of this steel from the Mariopol AT corresponds to the upper limit indicated (260 U.S dollars), as well as to the average level of world prices. In elucidating the pluses and minuses for Ukraine in this case, far from the last-place role will be played by yet another global factor. In the case at hand, according to all international standards, the responsibility for the actions of the accused Azovstal AT shall be borne by the state as a whole, inasmuch as--at present--the Ukrainian economy has the status of a nonmarket economy. Proceeding on the grounds that Ukraine did not give Canada sufficient information about its exporters, the Canadian side was compelled to apply with regard to Ukraine the same conditions under which Belgium, Denmark, Spain, and Great Britain operate in Canada. And Great Britain was designated as the analogous country (it has been asserted that--on this occasion--even the Canadians felt sorry for Ukraine); and, as a result of this, the benchmark price was set at 500 U.S. dollars per tonne. It is interesting that almost immediately after this conflict-type situation arose, the Ukrainian office of the Canadian firm Smith, Lyons, Torrance, Stevenson, and Mayer offered to defend the Ukrainian interests in this case. In the words of Mark Kovalskyy, a lawyer from this firm, the offer would have legal force only on condition that the Ukrainian government make an official request with regard to a defense of its rights. At the same time Klopner would have to provide its own lega defense in cooperation with Azovstal. However, a contractual agreement had been signed with the Trakon law firm at the very end of last year--that is, after the case had already been instituted. And, therefore, Trakon has remained on the sidelines of this investigation. Thus Azovstal could take a retroactive court action against Klopner in connection with the nonperformance on that article in the contract which concerns a legal defense. The recent visit by a Ukrainian delegation to Canada did not produce the anticipated results. Official Kiev intends to place the examination of this case before the Canadian Trade Tribunal because it considers that it would be significantly better to defend its own interests there. At least its chances would look more realistic with the absence of tricks by Canadian industry. According to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), dumping is not subject to condemnation, provided that it does not cause harm to the enconomy of that country in which the goods are sold. And the percentage of Ukrainian steel within the total amount of this metal on the Canadian market is less than 1 percent. The Canadian side, in turn, does not dispute this point, but instead bases its argument on the position that--after an analysis had been conducted--it was discovered that 100 percent of the total amount of the Ukrainian steel had been sold on the Ukrainian market at dumping prices. Yet another possible relief for Ukraine (even prior to appealing the case) could be the negotiations which are now going on between Klopner and Algoma Steel with regard to the delivery of Azovstal's steel ingots. By the way, it is an interesting situation. The guilty party in these Ukrainian-Canadia misunderstandings--the German firm of Klopner--has, for some reason retreated to the background, and for some reason nobody is saying much about its role in this matter. ...If the Ukrainian government believes that it will prevail in the above-mentioned Trade Tribunal, knows that the law is on its side, and that such accusations are without any grounds, it must make sure that--after this case-- nobody will treat us like a little boy to be beaten--one who can be infringed against and who will then only whine and whimper.
