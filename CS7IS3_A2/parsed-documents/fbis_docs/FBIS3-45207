Wu Bangguo, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and secretary of the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee, delivered an important speech at the meeting. The speech was entitled: "Accelerate Reform and Development and Strive To Create a New Situation of Shanghai's Work Under the Guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's Theory of Building Socialism With Chinese Characteristics." Huang Ju, deputy secretary of the municipal party committee and mayor of Shanghai, made a report on Shanghai's arrangements for implementing the guidelines of the national conference on economic work. The main themes of the discussion at the meeting were to further study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and the "decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; to emancipate the mind and unify the understanding under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; to sum up this year's work and put forward ideas for next year's work; to mobilize all party members and the people in Shanghai to seize the opportunity to speed up reform and development; to strive to make a breakthrough in taking the lead in building the operating mechanisms of a socialist market economy; and to make efforts to maintain the favorable momentum of sustained, rapid, and healthy development of our national economy. The plenary session maintained: In the current year, a new situation has been created in the various aspects of Shanghai's work under the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, and through the common efforts of the broad masses of cadres and people throughout the municipality. The national economy continues to follow a favorable trend of development on the foundation of last year's rapid growth. Our economic restructuring has been further deepened, and the basic role of the market in the allocation of resources has been further enhanced; new progress has been made in our efforts to attract foreign capital and develop Pudong; fruitful results have been accomplished in infrastructural construction, and new achievements have been made in various undertakings. The changeover of leading groups at various levels in the party and the government has been smoothly completed, and party building has been further strengthened. Presently, the overall situation in Shanghai is good, being characterized by political and social stability, and economic development. The confidence of the people in realizing a glorious tomorrow has been boosted. The plenary session held that Shanghai's new achievements this year in the building of the material and spiritual civilizations have been made with the concern and support of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, as well as that of Comrade Deng Xiaoping and other revolutionaries of the older generation; that they are also the fruits of arduous struggle and hard work of the broad masses of people; and that they could not have been made without the efforts of the municipal party committees and governments over the years in laying a solid foundation, as well as without the staunch support shown by the various ministries and commissions under the central government, without the support given by various brotherly provinces and municipalities, and without the participation and support of the broad masses of commanders and fighters from the troops stationed in Shanghai. The plenary session stressed: The economic work for next year will be launched on the basis of the sustained, rapid, and healthy economic growth over the past two years, and it must have a higher starting point. We should maintain the favorable momentum of Shanghai's economic development under the premise of combining the market, product quality, and economic benefits. We should continue to increase the proportion of the tertiary industry in our gross national product. We must give priority to road and power construction, speed up urban infrastructural construction, and strive to complete a number of major engineering projects. We should accelerate Pudong's pace of development and opening up to the outside world, and keep up the forceful momentum of economic development in the new area. We should, on the basis of our economic development, further raise the actual living standards of urban and rural people. Economic development calls for new ideas, and it is necessary to firmly grasp the key links that have a bearing on the overall situation of Shanghai, and to earnestly study the new situation and new problems that have emerged in the course of our economic work so as to really direct our economic construction onto the track of improving our economic results. We must further heighten our consciousness toward market competition, actively develop domestic and foreign markets, strengthen our business management, and enhance our enterprises' quality and competitive edge. We must, under the guidance of macro-control, raise funds through multichannels and make good use of the funds to increase our economic returns. We should further expand our scale of bringing in foreign capital, broaden the scope for utilizing foreign funds, and strive to integrate our utilization of foreign funds with readjustment of industrial structure, product structure, and development of new economic growth, as well as give full play to Shanghai's superiority in technology and qualified personnel to develop new and high-technology industries along with a new generation of pillar industry, and establish a number of major groups and large companies with an international competitive edge. We must practically consolidate the role of agriculture as the foundation of the national economy, strive to develop agriculture that produces high-yield, high quality products with high economic efficiency, develop village and town enterprises as well as the tertiary industry, and push forward the urbanization construction in the rural areas. The plenary session pointed out: In the past few years Shanghai's economy has been able to maintain a favorable momentum of development mainly because it has benefited from reform and opening up to the outside world. We must consolidate our reform achievements, and we must uphold and strive to constantly improve what has proven effective. In accordance with the requirements of the "decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, we should make the deepening of reform and the active exploration for a modern enterprise system the emphasis of accelerating the reform next year. We must give play to the basic role of the market in the allocation of resources under macroeconomic control, further cultivate and develop markets for production factors, strengthen the standardized administration of the market, and actively carry out reform of prices in a steady way. In line with the unified plan of the central authorities, we should actively accelerate reform of the taxation, financial, investment, and planning systems. While promoting the development of the state- owned and collectively owned sectors of the economy, we should encourage the development of individual undertakings and privately owned and foreign-owned enterprises. In the new year, leading cadres at all levels should keep in mind the overall situation, straighten out the overall structure and relationship of interests among different sectors, do a good job in ideological work, show concern for the vital interests of the masses, and ensure the smooth implementation of all reform measures. The plenary session held: Strengthening the building of a socialist spiritual civilization and sticking to the principle that both material civilization and spiritual civilization should be promoted in real earnest and neither aspect should be neglected constitute the important content of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; the requirements for Shanghai's work set by the party Central Committee, the State Council, and Comrade Deng Xiaoping; and the wish of the Shanghai people. In the course of developing a socialist market economy, we should strengthen education on patriotism, collectivism, and socialism; strengthen the building of professional ethics, social morality, and family moral principles; and actively carry forward the 64-character pioneering spirit initiated by Comrade Jiang Zemin. We should carry out our propaganda work and education in conjunction with the education on cherishing Shanghai and on realizing the goal of creating major changes in three years and with the efforts to improve Shanghai's appearance and environment, to provide civilized good-quality services, to flourish our cultural undertakings, and to mobilize all trades and professions to achieve outstanding results and present them as a gift to the 45th anniversary of the founding of New China. We should further strengthen our comprehensive effort to improve social security, crack down on criminal activities according to law, resolutely check all ugly phenomena in society, persist in launching the anticorruption struggle, and create a favorable social environment for reforms, opening up to the outside world, and economic construction. The plenary session issued the following requirements: Party organizations at all levels must take the study of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and the "decisions" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee as their priority tasks for 1994, unify their thinking, and unify their action. Party and government leading cadres should take the lead in studying the works. They should read the original works seriously, trying to understand and master them. They should carry forward the Marxist study style of integrating theory with practice, consciously integrate the guidelines of the Central Committee with work in their localities and departments, and improve their work style and leading ability. In studying the works, they must stick to the quintessence of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from fact; seize "the last opportunity" for Shanghai's development in the 1990's; enhance their sense of responsibility and urgency; be modest and prudent; continue to advance; consciously adhere to the principle of "conducive to three causes" -- conducive to developing the productive forces of our socialist society, increasing the overall strength of our socialist country, improving the people's living standards; be fearless in practice; be brave in pushing forward reform and construction; and creatively do their tasks well. The plenary session issued the following calls: All communist party members and people in Shanghai, under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and under the leadership of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, conscientiously implement the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, work with one heart and one mind, unite in struggle, and make new contributions to fulfilling Shanghai's grand goal of reform and construction. The plenary session decided to promote Bao Qifan, alternate member of the municipal party committee, to its member. Attending the session were 51 members and alternate members of the municipal party committee. More than 150 party and government responsible cadres from various departments, commissions, offices, districts, counties, and bureaus attended the session as observers.
