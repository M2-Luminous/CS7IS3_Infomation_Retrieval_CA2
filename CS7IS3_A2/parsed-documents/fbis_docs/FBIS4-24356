Initially, the former "super gendarme" from the GIGN [National Gendarmerie Intervention Group] had assured the daily LE MONDE that he had the black box of the Falcon 50 in which the Rwandan and Burundian presidents were killed, and that he had gone to Kigali to look for it on behalf of [deceased] Rwandan President Habyarimana family. Next, talking live on France 2 [television network] yesterday [28 June] at noon, the former officer went much further: He claimed that he had recordings of the conversations with the control tower, in which, he says, he recognized "Belgian" accents. These recordings were made by the Rwandan Armed Forces. He also confirmed that he had satellite photos indicating an offensive on the Ugandan border begun on 6 April. Someone who tries too hard to show something ends up not convincing anyone, or even raising questions about the exact nature of his mission. In this connection, LE CANARD ENCHAINE wrote that the former member of the presidential palace's gendarme "cell," who has not totally broken with his former employers, actually went to Kigali to recover President Habyarimana's files. It was therefore dangerous, to say the least, to hurriedly send someone as controversial as him to center stage. Indeed, Barril's statements are peppered with contradictions and inaccuracies. First of all, it is amazing that a private individual should still have access to satellite photos, the use of which is supposed to be reserved for military personnel. As for the place from where the missiles were fired on 6 April, that was an area controlled by the Presidential Guard. The RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] did not arrive until May. As for the black box itself, the mystery has not been cleared up at all: Dassault maintenance personnel say that this type of airplane did not have a black box and a pilot thinks that the object submitted by Barril was just a radio-compass box. The fact remains, however, that shortly after the crash, an object resembling the black box was picked up in the wreckage of the airplane by a French military volunteer. Who handed it over to Paul Barril? The Rwandan Government, to whom the object was supposedly given afterward? One might also wonder whether the remains of the black box shown on French television were not something put together to make people forget the existence of a compromising "original." In addition, Barril supposedly discovered parts of the SAM-7 missile launchers in Massaka. So the elite shooters, undoubtedly professionals, were absentminded, were they? In any case, in May, when the RPF held the area, the land had clearly been gone over with a fine-tooth comb, so it would have been with the help of the previous occupants, the Presidential Guard, that Barril made his discoveries. There is another inaccuracy in Barril's statements: He maintains that no international inquiry has been requested. In actual fact, in the first few hours after the attack, and once again when the Belgian Blue Helmets were accused of having assassinated the president, something which led to the death of 10 of them, the Belgian Government asked the International Civil Aviation Organization to open an inquiry. This request is regularly called up by Brussels. Nevertheless, it remains to be seen whether the Mystere Falcon, piloted by a crew comprising former military personnel, should be considered a civilian aircraft. Apart from the contradictions in the testimony, it is now important to wonder why the family of the dead president, and other sponsors, asked Barril to put his talents as a storyteller and editor at the service of a version which is slowly losing its plausibility, namely a version which claims that there was Belgian involvement, in collaboration with the RPF. Increasingly, a theory is gaining ground which says that the "tough guys" of the regime, members of president's wife's family, instigated the attack and provided the inspiration for the massacres. Even the fact that Elie Sagatwa, considered the leader of the regime's "hawks," was also in the airplane along with the chief of staff, does not prove anything: President Habyarimana knew he was under threat, a coup had already been prepared for 23 March and a number of high-ranking officers had already let it be known that important events were being prepared. President Habyarimana could have been trying to protect himself by surrounding himself with heavyweight personalities and having himself accompanied by the Burundian president. It is also impossible not to notice that Captain Barril's explosion onto the media scene followed the publication in LE SOIR of a theory which is still being looked into by the Belgian military prosecutor's office and which involves two French nationals. Screens In reality, Paul Barril's intervention could have something in common with "Operation Turquoise," namely that both are "screen" operations with hidden motives. "Operation Turquoise" despite preventing further massacres, could be considered as a humanitarian enterprise concealing other objectives. Among other things, it would be a matter of bringing out people who have stuck with the government or pulling local collaborators out of the Rwandan hell. These people do not face the greatest danger but they know a great deal. Radio messages have been broadcast, calling on those who can to reach Kibuye. The members of the Mille Collines Radio are also said to be preparing to be evacuated by the French. In the Zairian city of Goma, observers have noted the presence of soldiers who do not belong to any officially engaged unit. And the push of the French Army to Gikongoro, a few km from the front line, worries those who fear a clash between the RPF and "Operation Turquoise." This clash could easily take place elsewhere: A witness at Bangui airport in the Central African Republic saw French soldiers equipped with parachutes. They seemed convinced that they would be required to jump on Kigali in the coming hours and therefore directly face the RPF. Moreover "Operation Turquoise," which is clearly being required to act circumspectly by the Balladur government, is producing secondary effects: The media deployment it has caused is revealing the extent of the genocide and inevitably leading to questions about everyone's responsibilities. The "screen" operations are also seeking to turn these questions toward other targets. Now that at last, and too late, all the attention is going to Rwanda, its neighbor Burundi is living through very critical times. Provisional President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya said that his country was on the brink and that distrust between citizens had reached new heights. It appears that large Israeli arms deliveries are at present reaching Burundi via Goma. They are probably intended for the extremist Palipehutu movement and the Burundi Democratic Front hard-liners. At this moment on the hills of Burundi, people are being taught how to use M-16's and Uzi machine guns.
