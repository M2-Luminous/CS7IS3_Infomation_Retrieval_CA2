FBIS4-54021 "dreas101__a94029" FBIS-EAS-94-101-A Daily Report 11 May 1994 ANNEX Japan City Banks Increase Overseas Lending in FY93 City Banks Increase Overseas Lending in FY93 942A0244A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 11 May 94 p 7--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0244A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Text] City banks plan to increase fiscal year 1994 lending in overseas areas by about 3 percent over the last fiscal year. The reason is that in addition to the expected expansion in the U.S. economy, the demand for capital is expanding in Asia based on a high-growth economy. Aside from a substantially higher growth rate for overseas loans compared to domestic loans, it is anticipated that the balance of overseas loans on a yen-denominated basis will increase for the first time in three years. At Fuji Bank and Sakura Bank, fiscal year 1994 lending in the United States will increase about 3 percent over the last fiscal year, and will increase about 10 percent in Asia. According to Managing Director Hisao Kobayashi of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, "Overseas lending will increase beginning in the January-March quarter." Sumitomo Bank and Asahi Bank also have similar plans primarily for the Asian region. Trends of the above nature had become conspicuous after October 1993. According to a Bank of Japan [BOJ] survey, the balance of loans issued by overseas branches at the end of January 1994 stood at 49.0423 trillion yen, an increase of about 1.5 trillion yen in four months. The BOJ has arrived at the opinion that "overseas lending will most likely increase in the future with the second half of 1993 representing the turning point." One reason city banks' overseas lending is on the rise is that domestic lending has stopped growing. Some signs of improvement have been seen in the domestic economy, but it is expected that demand for capital will remain sluggish and growth in domestic loans is expected to range about 1-2 percent over the last fiscal year. City banks' equity ratios as of the end of March had reached 9 percent, which is above the minimum specified by the Bank for International Settlements. This improvement has enabled a substantial increase in yen-denominated overseas assets, providing a favorable impact on city banks' capabilities to expand loans in overseas areas. Growth in Asia is the greatest on a regional basis. There is a boom in the location of Japanese businesses centered in China and ASEAN nation are experiencing strong demand for capital to handle the construction of infrastructure. City banks intend to maintain a growth rate of around 10 percent for loans in the region. Even lending activity in the United States, which had dropped steadily since 1990, has stopped falling in response to an economic recovery. Demand for new loans is expanding in a broad spectrum of businesses ranging primarily from manufacturing to small and medium businesses. Fuji Bank reveals it has "expanded loans to U.S. firms at the rate of 10 to 15 percent above the levels in the last fiscal year."
