FR940504-2-00012 FR940504-2-00010 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [I.D. 042094B] Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Receipt of applications for experimental fishing permits. SUMMARY: NMFS announces receipt of experimental fishing permit (EFP) applications from Terra Marine Research and Education (TMRE), and Coastal Villages Fishing Cooperative (CVFC) and Golden Age Fisheries (GAF). TMRE requests approval of an EFP to retain salmon caught incidentally in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI) during the 1994 pollock ``B'' and the 1995 pollock ``A'' season fisheries and the 1995 BSAI directed Pacific cod trawl fishery. The purpose is to assess whether the quantities of salmon donated to a foodbank program are sufficient to justify the costs associated with the processing and shipping of the product. CVFC and GAF request approval of an EFP to assess the feasibility of the establishment of an inshore fishery in the Kuskokwim Bay in the BSAI by the residents of this area. ADDRESSES: Comments should be addressed to and copies of the EFP applications are available from Steven Pennoyer, Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, P.O. Box 21668, Juneau, AK 99802 (Attn: Lori Gravel). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ellen R. Varosi, Fisheries Management Division, NMFS (907&hyph;586&hyph;7230). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Fishery Management Plan (FMP) and its implementing regulations specify that EFPs may be issued to authorize fishing that otherwise would be prohibited by the FMP and regulations. The procedures for issuing permits are contained in the regulations at ยง675.6. The EFP applications submitted by TMRE, CVFC, AND GAF have been accepted for review and copies were forwarded to the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council). The Council reviewed these applications at its April 18&hyph;22, 1994, meeting, which was held in Anchorage, AK. TMRE proposes to assess the feasibility of a voluntary donation of salmon caught incidentally in the directed 1994 pollock ``B'' and the 1995 pollock ``A'' season fisheries and the 1995 BSAI directed Pacific cod trawl fishery for the purpose of distribution to foodbanks. CVFC and GAF propose to assess the commercial feasibility of fishing for groundfish in the Kuskokwim Bay by the residents of this area by establishing a 500 metric ton allocation of groundfish in this area during the period May 1 through September 30, 1994. Vessels participating in these EFPs will accommodate a NMFS-certified observer at all times with costs paid for by operators of vessels fishing for the applicants. Information regarding project design, disposition of fish harvested, and other matters is contained in the applications. Copies of the applications may be obtained from and comments should be addressed to the NMFS Regional Director (see ADDRESSES ). Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. Dated: April 28, 1994. Joe P. Clem, Acting Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;10639 Filed 4&hyph;29&hyph;94; 11:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;22&hyph;P
