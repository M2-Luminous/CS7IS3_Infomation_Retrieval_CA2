FBIS4-47883 "drafr087_c_94036" FBIS-AFR-94-087 Daily Report 4 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA MK Members Receiving Training at Air Force Base MK Members Receiving Training at Air Force Base MB0505081394 Johannesburg SAPA in English 2116 GMT 4 May 94 MB0505081394 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] Pretoria May 4 SAPA -- Two hundred Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing -- MK] instructors are undergoing "induction training" at the South African Air Force Gymnasium in Pretoria in preparation for the integration of MK with the National Defence Force. The South African National Defence Force's [SANDF] internal communication bulletin this week said the two-week course, to end on May 13, would enable the African National Congress military wing members to give induction training to their colleagues in assembly-point areas, "thus contributing to a smoother process of integration". The group is being trained in military terminology, military law, personal financial planning and military etiquette, including mess etiquette. The bulletin said the course would overcome any shortcomings in military skills among the trainees, adding that their basic training might have been different to that approved by the Joint Military Co-ordinating Council of the SANDF. "This will ensure that they suffer no relative disadvantage in relation to the members of the other forces involved in the integration process," it said. "This is a pure orientation course, therefore no formal evaluation will be done." The bulletin said the trainees would be under the command of the officer commanding the gymnasium and a high standard of discipline would be expected. The bulletin also said other MK members were being trained in ceremonial drill to prepare them to form part of the guard of honour at the inauguration of the new president on May 10.
