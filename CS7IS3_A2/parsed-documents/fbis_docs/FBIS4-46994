Clinton's visit to the Russian Federation (in January 1994) a large memo was prepared for him, "On the Sociopolitical and Economic Situation in Russia at the End of 1993 and the Beginning of 1994." It was noted in the economics section that the 1993 Russian Federation GNP had decreased by 18 percent, and the rates of uncompensated decline of the industrial-production potential decreased 2.3 times more rapidly than in 1992, which was evidence of an irreversible decline of reserves of accumulation and reproduction in many branches. In three months of 1993 the decline of production reached the greatest amount in all the time of the reforms (35 percent). Monetary measures for financial and credit stabilization led to a "stagflation tailspin" that was continually perpetuated with each round. This enabled the West basically to solve strategic problems: demilitarizing Russia's economy, adapting the resource potential of the CIS countries to the existing world economic system, and making it impossible to rapidly restore Russia's military-industrial complex in the event that forces unfriendly to the West were to come to power. At the same time it was noted that the inadequate "elasticity" of Russia's leadership regarding U.S. recommendations to follow the political technologies of the transition period led to a situation where the possibility that ultra-nationalistic forces would come to power in Russia became more than real. The economic situation in the country could contribute to this to a significant degree if B. Yeltsin's regime continues to pursue its present economic policy. In this case the stabilizing influence will reduce inflation by the end of 1994 to 3-5 percent per month, there will be a significant reduction of the interest rate on interbank credit, and the exchange rate with the dollar, which depends on the world parity balance of prices of the main raw material goods exported from Russia, will be reinforced. This, in turn, will lead to a decline of the GNP by another 20-25 percent, complete destructuring of Russia's economy, the elimination of exports with the exception of energy sources in keeping with GATT quotas, and investments mainly in fuel extracting branches, the infrastructures that serve them, trade, and service, as well as the degradation of private production and the banking system. According to data contained in the report, unemployment will increase to 15-18 million (including hidden). The differentiation in incomes will amount to 30 units. There is a real threat of an economic "stagflation infarct" during the May-June 1994 period: the effect of the direct halting of the movement of production prices, because of the rapidly growing shortfalls of deliveries of resources based on the explosive growth of nonpayments, which, in turn, occurred because of the absence of the regular portion of preferential credit for reproduction, resonating with the seasonal background of procurements for agricultural work and the regular price hike in order to increase profitability and make up for the consequences of the high inflation. But such a development of events is not likely to occur since the impact of the strongest social factor, reflected in the form of political pressure from the State Duma and the powerful lobbying of the production part of the government, will force Russia's leadership in April-May 1994 to resort to another inflationary invigoration of production resulting from pumping money into the national economy through preferential credit, as occurred in June-July 1992 and May-June 1993, each time with more severe sociopolitical consequences. Such half-measures at a lower circle of the "stagflationary spiral" will promote a further considerable reduction of the political influence of reformist forces as a whole. Moreover, they will significantly weaken the forces of that part of the political elite on whose assumption of power in the post-Yeltsin period the U.S. leadership was tacitly placing its bets. The transfer of power was to have begun in September-October 1993 and it was to have ended president. These American recommendations were presented to individuals close to President B. Yeltsin who formulate the country's domestic political policy, and they expressed their agreement. It was a matter of a comprehensive program for "stage-by-stage adaptation" of the economic and sociopolitical situation in Russia to world economic and political realities, developed on the basis of the theory of "discreteness of periods of crisis pressure" and "shock-absorbing stage-like nation of social adjustment," geared to Russian parameters (the model of seasonal-diametric periodicity of the political process and imposed upon it a stage-by-stage, "gradual-graduated" transition to a new socioeconomic quality with "social respites" at each "stage" of the reform). The program included a gradual transfer of power to groups of the Russian elite who are loyal to the West and who were supposed to crowd out extremist, nationalist, and communist forces with effective political and sociolegal reforms, being in "soft opposition to Yeltsin." These economic transformations were to be based on Yavlinskiy's program of "bisectoral planning-market structurization of the national economy" on the basis of political stabilization--Shakhray's regional-centrist policy. It was also noted in the report that under Russia's concrete conditions, in addition to relying on specific elite groupings and taking into account the personal peculiarities of the president of the Russian Federation, it is extremely important to continue to work actively with those closest to him, meaning above all A. Korzhakov, E. Pain, and Yu. Baturin. Korzhakov and Baturin have been exerting the most influence on the president recently. They have practically completely monopolized all channels of information of any kind, including that from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and intelligence, and they have taken full charge of the final editing of drafts of legislative and administrative acts okayed by leaders of government departments and signed by the president. If Korzhakov and Ilyushin control the administrative-information block of the distributive-state infrastructure, Yu. Baturin is the key figure in the formation of the strategic line of the head of state. According to figures in the report, Yu. Baturin is the "architect" and main "pusher" of all the most radical political decisions adopted by the president in 1993. Referring to the opinions of the aforementioned individuals from B. Yeltsin's inner circle, the latter is prepared to listen to recommendations from his Western friends concerning a reasonable adjustment of the economic and political reforms, but he will take real steps only if he has no opposition at all. No pressure on himself or apparent concessions can be expected from the president, especially at the present time when he is convinced that he is supported by power structures that are faithful to him. The report gives assessments of the "Zhirinovskiy phenomenon." It was necessary for the ruling groupings to support this phenomenon for a certain amount of time (not Zhirinovskiy, but precisely his phenomenon). Here they assume that without Zhirinovskiy his faction would rapidly become a branch of the Russian Federation Communist Party. As long as Zhirinovskiy is present he will not allow this but during the time of his parliamentary activity he will completely discredit himself and will not be able to run seriously for the post of president. Additionally, his presence will contribute to support from the West for Russia's president. And, conversely, Zhirinovskiy's rapid departure from the arena will considerably strengthen the position of neo-communist forces and statesmen and could make their assumption of power a reality. The report recommended to Bill Clinton: that he personally exert a constant influence on Russia's president since B.N. has a sharply negative reaction to influence from third parties; taking into account the situation that has developed, recommendations must be aimed at adjusting the reforms in the direction of social priorities, expanding the social base of support for the president, firing the most odious figures, providing more effective publicity for economic and political reforms, etc.; U.S. political leadership should expand the range of interaction with the most diverse political forces in Russia, taking into account the complexity and unpredictability of the development of the situation; special attention should be devoted to work with all the "elite" groupings in the high echelons of power; in parallel, active work should be done to arrange cooperation with other CIS countries in order not to allow the restoration of another confederation; taking into account the economic situation and other difficulties in the Russian Federation, within the framework of diplomatic etiquette, there should be a certain amount of strictness and consistency in the achievement of results needed in the West. The main purpose of Clinton's visit to the Russian Federation was worded as "to achieve results favorable for the national interests of the United States" (within the framework of the doctrine of "Partnership for Peace") and to keep Russia on the track of "democratic" transformations. Of course Clinton and his circle also planned to raise the "political" rating of the U.S. President and have the maximum possible "favorable" effect on the population of Russia. Clinton managed to achieve practically all of the goals that were set. The main results of his visit amounted to the following: he forced the Russian Federation to accept the majority of his conditions while at the same time avoiding any commitments to render any kind of appreciable economic aid to Russia; he promised the Russian Federation president to make reimbursement for "all costs of dismantling nuclear weapons in Ukraine." More than $1 billion guaranteed to Kravchuk for dismantling nuclear warheads will be paid to Russia for delivering oil, gas, etc. to Kiev; as compensation for this service, he achieved agreement from the Russian Federation to participate in the privatization of Russian enterprises (the possibilities of acquiring shares for hard currency) "to be credited to repayment of part of the immense Russian debt to the United States"; B. Yeltsin's attempts to obtain special advantages in relations with the CIS countries were roundly rejected by Clinton. But he made it clearly understood that because of national-ethnic, economic, and other factors the United States would not object to the development of relations between the Russian Federation and Belarus. Clinton approved the personnel reshuffling carried out before his visit (Yakovlev, Baturin, Chubays) and, out of "essential tactical" considerations, he agreed to the resignation of Gaydar and his team. The corresponding strategic assessments and recommendations were submitted to the U.S. President in December 1993. The events that occurred during the past four months show that the American program for influencing "Moscow's policy" continues to be implemented fairly effectively with respect to its basic points.
