The two ministers consider the Greek move to be both politically reprehensible and in contravention of Community law within the European Union. This was learned Monday [21 February] during an official visit to The Hague by the FYROM minister. The Netherlands is the first member state of the European Union to receive a member of the FYROM Government on an official visit. The FYROM is appreciative of the Dutch support it received in connection with rescheduling its debt with the World Bank. During the meeting with Minister Kooijmans, Crvenkovski emphasized that his government is prepared to resume negotiations with Greece aimed at eliminating contentious issues, such as the name and flag of the FYROM. [passage omitted] According to a spokesman at the Foreign Ministry, Kooijmans and Crvenkovski also exchanged views on the situation of the Albanian minority in the FYROM, and on the guarantees of equality for all inhabitants of the FYROM which are enshrined in the [country's] constitution. Crvenkovski thanked Kooijmans for his support for Skopje's attempt to gain admission to the CSCE. Until now, the admission of the FYROM has been blocked by both Greece and Albania.
