Apart from studying the power and the intentions of the Croatian Army, they are also considering the total Serb potential in case another great Serb-Croat war breaks out. Bearing in mind the lessons of the fighting in Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina, the strategists of the regular Serbian army believe that, at the very beginning of serious conflicts with the Croats, as strong forces as possible should be be deployed at the crucial point on the battlefield. To achieve that, it is necessary to choose the appropriate operational direction and avoid the unpleasant experiences of Vukovar. The present Serbian commanders (all of whom got a good taste of gunpowder during 1991 and 1992) are simply obsessed with the importance of selecting the best strategy. They are considering all the advantages and disadvantages of simple and a complex strategies in relation to Croatia and its defense. They will consider the strategy that would, in a given situation, enable bringing more of their own forces than enemy troops to be best. At any point, the battle is not won by troops noted down on lists or scattered, but those that had been collected earlier, trained well, equipped excellently, and prepared to go into action at the crucial point on the battlefield immediately. Where Will the Serbs Strike? It has still not been decided in Belgrade where they should strike first to "cut the entrails of Croatia." In any case, if Serbia starts an open war again (which will be the case if the "Krajinas" are endangered), it will not be able to do anything without the coordinated support of the army of the Bosnian Serbs and joint plans. There is another thing to be clarified. Whatever our opinion of the Serbs may be, it has to be admitted that they have what military theory defines as stamina, elasticity, and the will to survive regardless of the conditions, the rationality and justifiability of their political opinions, the balance of power, and external pressures. The Croat side must, by no means, put all its hopes on the economic exhaustion of Serbia and its monetary breakdown. North Vietnam also went bankrupt in the Vietnam war, and in the late Sixties, instead of the completely devalued local currency, the dong, a pack of cigarettes became the unofficial means of payment (the clever or lucky Vietnamese who possessed a carton of Marlboros were considered rich). In spite of everything, Hanoi fought against the Americans for 15 years, with the income per capita being $100, and the Vietnamese constantly sending weapons and experts to their ideological supporters in South Vietnam. Belgrade still does not deprive its cousins in the rebel areas of Croatia of heavy weapons, military equipment, and the means of transporting troops. On the contrary, while the people in Belgrade are fighting and stepping over one another for a loaf of bread, and waiting in lines for hours to receive a free Christmas cookie, the Serb military industry works at full capacity. This time we will present, in detail, three new systems that are already being delivered to the "Krajinas" and Ratko Mladic's [commander of the armed forces of the republic of Srpska] units assigned to intervene as soon as the new round of war starts in Croatia and around it. Having fought against the Croats, the Serbs have learned that they have to remove the losses from the frontlines and deliver new stocks fast. This is why they have not sent the remaining T-55 tanks to the breaker's yards: 390 of those veterans, made in the Sixties, are undergoing many changes and improvements to increase their power, armored protection, and mobility. The same steering system that the modern M-84 contains has been installed in the changed Serbian tank T-55. Its power has been increased by installing two launching rails (on the turret) for armor-piercing Maljutka guided missiles. The French first implemented this idea three decades ago (on small tanks AMX-13); the Serbs have now applied it to their still most-numerous basic combat tank. The Maljutkas are guided to the target (armored vehicles and fortified facilities at a distance between 500 and 3,000 meters), from the guiding control panel situated in the tank itself. The pitch of the missile is regulated by the mechanism for elevating the gun barrel, and the operator guides the missile by watching through the existing tank telescope sight, the magnification factor of which is increased with additional optics. With the two missiles that are on the launchers all the time, there are also four more Maljutkas within the tank turret. The Systematic Arming of the "Krajina" With further modifications, the Serbs improved the characteristics of the artillery ammunition for the T-55, and, by installing thermal insulation cover on the outer surface of the barrel of the 100-mm caliber gun, the traces appearing as a result of uneven cooling are reduced by 80 percent. This has increased the precision of the gun itself. The 12.7-mm caliber DSKM [expansion unknown] heavy machine gun was retained on the turret, as well as the matching 7.62-mm caliber PKT [expansion unknown] machine gun. The Serb engineers have also installed the anti-cumulative screens, protecting the sides of the tank, below the supports for cases and reservoirs, the critical junction of the armored panels of the tank floor and the sides, and the surface at the level of the junction of the tank turret and the armored body. The Serbs want to secure the survival of this veteran primarily on the Croatian battlefields. On the front of the turret they installed 12 smoke launchers that can fire smoke canisters distances greater than 100 meters (the equipment is identical to that used on the M-84 tank). Apart from creating a smokescreen, the launching barrels for firing smoke canisters increase the anti-cumulative protection of the turret (on hitting these barrels, enemy missiles are activated too early, and their total effect is decreased). Since most of the improved T-55's will be sent to Baranja and east Slavonia to reinforce the existing armored units, they have also installed an entrenching plow (on the lower front glacis plate). Entrenching takes 15 to 20 minutes (depending on the type and category of soil). The plow switches from use to the mobile position and vice versa in 2 to 3 minutes. This improvement makes the T-55 independent in creating shelter, and the additional armored panel on the plow increases the armored protection of the tank front. For close anti-armor fighting, the Serbs have developed a new light rocket launcher (they call it a "tank destroyer") that introduces a new quality in the offensive and defensive activities of their infantry. It is a simple 120-mm caliber weapon (the M91 rocket launcher is more powerful than the Zolja and Osa) whose main purpose is to break active and reactive tank shields. It is most effective at 400 to 500 meters distance, with a precision that provides for a deviation of 20 centimeters from the target. The system is weatherproof (within a temperature range from -30 to +50 degrees Centigrade); sand, dust, rain, snow, and ice will not harm it. The minimum distance using the launcher is 25 meters. The rocket will not fail at angles of incidence greater than 20 degrees; the fuse is of a quality providing reliable efficiency at all projected distances. The launcher is disposable, and a telescope or passive night sight can be installed on it. This is the variant sent to the Bosnian Serbs and the rebel Serb areas in Croatia, while the laser target markers will only be fitted to launchers on the ground of mother Serbian (for fear of their being captured). From this light, serially produced system, the Serbs are developing a similar type of rocket launcher for multiple use. What everyone is looking forward to in the "Krajinas" is a new 100-m caliber M-91 Topaz anti-tank gun (the Serbs call it a gem among guns). Its main purpose is anti-armored fighting at distances between 2,000 and 3,000 meters. The Serbs designed and started the serial production of this piece, which has a low firing height, with the internal ballistic design of the Russian T-12 anti-tank gun (which is also of 100-mm caliber). The differences in relation to the T-12 is the following: Topaz uses the elements of the three-legged gun carriage of the Serb 122-mm D30-J howitzer, which provides a 360-degree field of fire. Above its barrel Topaz has an installed anti-recoil device, which the 122-mm D30-J howitzer also contains, increasing stability during firing. Moreover, Topaz is 2 meters shorter in transport than the T-12 gun (the piece is connected to the vehicle through the Topaz gas break). A day-and-night fire-control system [SUV -- fire-control system] has been developed for the Topaz. The system can be used on the Russian 100-mm T-12 and MT-12 caliber anti-tank guns (they are still part of the Serb armament; Croatia also has them), and they are ballistically fully compatible with Topaz. The fire- control system determines and visualizes all the necessary elements of indirect and direct fire at immobile and mobile targets. The probability of hitting a mobile target (at the distances of efficient destruction range) with the first bullet is greater than 70 percent, and the system reaction time at battery level is less than 15 seconds. Let Us Not Fool Ourselves, They Are Not Finished! Let us summarize: The claim one can often hear around here is: "The Serbs are finished." However, this is contrary to the undoubted Serb vitality in continuing to add links to its chain of technical and technological equipment despite the embargo and the losses they have suffered. This is why, instead of short-term propaganda, it is more important for our state to cut off the logistic tail of the Serbian rebellion that wishes to hold out with new weapons, in which the messages of fighting in these areas over the past three years are inbuilt. For Croatia it is a matter of long-term survival. For the Serbs it is a misfortune that is only waiting to happen.
