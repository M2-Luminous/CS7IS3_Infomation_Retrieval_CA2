They are meeting to agree questions connected with the implementation of the agreement on the Black Sea Fleet, signed in Moscow on 15 April by Boris Yeltsin and Leonid Kravchuk. Before the talks started, the two defense ministers held a private conversation. During the morning, Pavel Grachev met with Black Sea sailors. He said "the Black Sea fleet was, is, and will remain our national pride and glory and it must be retained for Russia," stressing that he will do his utmost to ensure that "Sevastopol becomes Russia's main base on the Black Sea." Pavel Grachev thinks the fleet's problems must be resolved in the interests of Russia, Ukraine, and Crimea. "If we manage to agree to leave 85 percent of the Black Sea Fleet to Russia, it can be regarded as a sensible compromise in the talks," the Russian defense minister stressed. Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov also thinks the Black Sea Fleet ought to be Russian. On the eve of the talks in Sevastopol, in which he is not taking part, he told journalists he regarded the siting of the Ukrainian Navy headquarters on the territory of the peninsula as inadmissible and that he intends to ensure that the highest authorities in the Crimea give their consent for any redeployment of military formations. The Russian side is also represented at the talks in Sevastopol by presidential envoy Yuriy Dubynin and Navy Commander in Chief Feliks Gromov.
