She took office in June 1993, according to the decision of the influential Party of the Right Way. She succeeded Mr. Demirel, who became the president of Turkey. When he was prime minister, he appointed her minister of economics and accepted her slogan about "two keys" (for the house and the car). As minister of economics, she bravely tackled the large national debt, inflation, structural state problems, and conquering financial markets. The new prime minister has very quickly shown the energy of the young generation and has become prominent as a radical reformist in many areas. She immediately replaced 17 out of 20 members of the cabinet, and her team, which is mostly drawn from the young generation, has reached the very top in terms of service to the state. She has also launched numerous initiatives, especially economic ones. Politician and Scholar She was born in 1946; she majored in economics at Robert College (today the Bosphorus University), the English University in Istanbul. She got her master's degree and her doctorate at New Hampshire, Connecticut, and Yale Universities. She is now an economics fellow at Bosphorus University and associate professor at all three universities in the United States. She has written many books on the subject of economics, and several research papers, articles, and essays. Her husband is an entrepreneur in Istanbul, and they have two children. [Zvizdic] What do you think about current political relations between Turkey and Croatia? [Ciller] Relations between Turkey and Croatia are developing in all areas, and I would like to use this opportunity to pay tribute to the late President Ozal, who visited Zagreb in 1993 and contributed much to the development of our bilateral relations. President Tudjman's visit to Ankara last year was also a significant contribution to our friendly relations. Furthermore, we would like to see Croatia cooperate with the Bosniaks. We think that there is no alternative to the Croat-Bosniak-Muslim alliance, for that alliance is a natural development and a historical necessity, not something imposed from abroad or a tactical move. If Croatia wants to stop Serbian aggression and the realization of a greater Serbia, there really is no alternative to the Croat-Bosniak-Muslim alliance. The progress and development of relations with Turkey will depend on the relation of Croatia and the Bosniaks. Turkey and Croatia have much in common; first, they are both democratic countries, and both believe in democratic institutions and values. Second, they are both secular countries. Religion is a matter of personal choice and does not govern the state, and religious tolerance is most important in a state. And third, both countries have a free market economy with a process of privatization of state-owned firms. And lastly, let me point out that they are both European countries and hope to become full members of the European Community in the next couple of years. I am convinced that there will be joint Turkish-Croatian-Bosniak economic investment when conditions for peace and stability are re-established. [Zvizdic] In Croatia, we often hear that three very capable ambassadors -- of Turkey, Germany, and the United States -- play an important role in mediation for better relations and understanding between Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Is the involvement of these three ambassadors of a special kind? [Ciller] You mentioned three members of NATO who are closely cooperating within NATO and outside it. Those three countries hold the same views on many problems, including the solution for the problem of Bosnia-Herzegovina on several levels. I believe Germany and the United States, just like Turkey, are convinced that there is no alternative to cooperation and an alliance of Croatia and the Bosniaks. I also believe that the Turkish ambassador has friendly relations and closely cooperates with his German and U.S. counterparts. [Zvizdic] What was your main reason for going to Sarajevo? Does it have something to do with the meeting of foreign ministers of Turkey and Great Britain that was held in Ankara? [Ciller] My brief visit to Sarajevo with [Pakistani] Prime Minister Bhutto was a humanitarian gesture, for we did not go there primarily as prime ministers, but mostly as concerned mothers. We went there to share the grief, unbearable sadness, and incredible suffering of all the people in the besieged city, regardless of their religion and nationality. Air Strikes or Lifting the Arms Embargo That tragedy in the heart of Europe in this day and age is incomprehensible! It is sad, for the whole world is watching helplessly and doing practically nothing to stop the drama with the means that it has at its disposal. Prime Minister Bhutto and myself wanted to draw the attention of the world to the alarming humanitarian catastrophe of Sarajevo and remind them that the right to live is the most important human right and that it must be respected. International organizations like the United Nations and NATO must guarantee that inalienable right to life, and if they cannot, the world must establish the necessary mechanism and unite its forces to that end. What is now happening in Bosnia-Herzegovina is a reign of terror that must be unconditionally and immediately stopped. The entire international community is against terrorism and this terror against innocent people, civilians, must, of course, be stopped by the appropriate action. How to achieve that? There are two ways to stop terror and aggression: One is to carry out immediate air strikes against the aggressor, or, if the world cannot agree to that, we must lift the arms embargo so that the Bosnians can defend themselves. In the last two years, Turkey has been doing everything to reactivate the UN and NATO regarding the problem. We must preserve traditional values, principles of the international law and norms of civilized behavior. [Zvizdic] How do you evaluate political relations between Turkey and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Muslim leadership? Do you think the local Muslim leadership does not take your advice with regard to stopping the war and finding solutions through peace negotiations? [Ciller] Turkey is playing the role of a mediator between Croatia and the Bosniaks, and both sides trust our country and its Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin. He maintains contact with Mr. Silajdzic and Mr. Granic, and I think they will soon meet again. Turkey does not offer ready-made solutions nor peace plans, for we do not intend to impose solutions; it is up to the warring factions whether they will reach an agreement or not. [Zvizdic] Does Turkey's interest in the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina stem from the five-century presence of Turkey in the Balkans, or has Turkey, as a big country, a military power, and a member of NATO, been given the task, or that is, taken up the responsibility to help solve the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina? Union Must Be Preserved [Ciller] The Turkish public has been following the events in Bosnia-Herzegovina over n the past two years with great concern, and I would like to point out that some 4 million Turks are of Bosnian origin and still have relatives and close family ties in Bosnia-Herzegovina. What is happening in Bosnia is not a civil war, as the Serbs are trying to present it; rather, it is open aggression. It is an occupation by a foreign country, the spreading out of one ethnic group at the expense of another; it is imperialism, ethnic cleansing, and genocide. It is not Islam against Christianity, nor Islamic jihad, or spreading fundamentalism. The right to self-defense of a country that is a UN member is being denied. The Turks not only have historical ties with the Bosnians, but also with the Croats, Macedonians, Albanians, and the Serbs. Historically, politically, and culturally, Turkey is a Balkan country. [Zvizdic] In Bonn, President Tudjman offered the possibility of a confederal organization between the Republic of Croatia, the Bosniak-Muslim republic, and the Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia within the Bosnia-Herzegovina Republic, or just with the Bosniak-Muslim republic in case the union does not survive. Can you comment on this offer? [Ciller] Turkey advocates the territorial integrity of an independent and sovereign Bosnia-Herzegovina and we think the union must be preserved. Internationally recognized borders must be protected from this pure aggression. The multi-ethnic character of Bosnia-Herzegovina was once the pride of Europe and, if possible, it must be preserved and cherished. It is then up to the warring factions to decide on their future. [Zvizdic] Can you comment on the politics of Croatia toward Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Ciller] Croat-Bosnian friendship and mutual trust must be regained and measures must be taken to that end. Croat-Muslim conflicts were unjustified and unnecessary. Tudjman and Izetbegovic Are Friends [Zvizdic] Do you think the policies of the Muslim leadership under Mr. Izetbegovic are correct? [Ciller] Mr. Alija Izetbegovic was elected president of Bosnia-Herzegovina. We trust him, and think he is a capable and experienced statesman. He is a friend of Turkey and, to my knowledge, also an old friend of President Tudjman. Turkey supports President Izetbegovic and his Prime Minister Silajdzic and their sound policies for reaching a just, honest, and lasting peace. [Zvizdic] Could the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina end this year? And in the light of that, how do you evaluate the role of the broader international community? [Ciller] The war in Bosnia has been going on for too long: 200,000 Bosnians have lost their lives, 500,000 have been wounded, 1 million are in exile. A terrible price for preserving Bosnian independence and sovereignty. However, I hope this year will be the year of reconciliation, understanding, and peace. Many things indicate that this could happen, but a lasting peace can be established only if it is just for all parties involved. The international community is present throughout the peace process, but peace efforts will succeed only if the formula for peace is acceptable to all sides. Only the warring factions can establish peace, and the participation of the international community is here necessary, but it can be marginal as well.
