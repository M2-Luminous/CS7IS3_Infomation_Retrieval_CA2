He considered this act as an attempt to kill the peace process. In an exclusive interview with AL-QUDS, al-Rajub said that the Palestinian leadership regards the Fatah Hawks as part of the forces that have to protect the national authority. Consequently, we have to provide security for them. Regarding the peace process, al-Rajub accused Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin of responsibility for hampering the peace process, and said: We realize that Rabin is the key figure in Israel, but apparently he regrets signing the Oslo accord. Therefore, he is trying to hinder what was agreed on in Davos. Al-Rajub said that the PLO is ready to sign the drafts that were agreed on in Davos. It is also ready to take over power within 24 hours after the Israeli withdrawal. 'Arafat's occupied territories' affairs adviser said that the Palestinian side considers a Palestinian-Israeli summit to be warranted. He also expressed his apprehension at the perpetuation of the current situation, which can only lead to frustration, opposition to the peace process, and an increase in the phenomena of internal and foreign violence.
