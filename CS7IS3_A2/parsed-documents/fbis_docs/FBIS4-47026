All the top customs men, headed by FECD chief Oleg Sviridov, came to the meeting with journalists. There were many questions, and many people to answer them. Therefore, without getting specific about particular persons, we will relate the most interesting parts of what was said at the press conference. [Question] What return does the kray get from customs activities? [Answer] Since the time the decree came out allowing to transfer 10 percent of the customs duties collected into the local budget, Maritime Kray has received R6.664 billion and more than $3 million. [Question] What violations does the customs encounter most? [Answer] In the Far Eastern region, the prevalent type of violation is illegal export of foreign currency. Over the first quarter of 1994 alone, the FECD uncovered such violations in the amount equivalent to R1 billion. At the Russian-Chinese border there are frequent attempts to take Russian currency out of the country. Over the same period, the "catch" comprised R50 million. [Question] We frequently hear about corruption in customs. Is there a struggle to "keep the ranks clean"? [Answer] We have to admit that the customs has not avoided this sad fate. Incidents of corruption have occurred in almost all major FECD units. Over 1993 in the entire Far Eastern region, criminal proceedings for abuse of official position were initiated against six officers, and 299 persons were subjected to disciplinary measures. This does not mean that "everyone is on the take"--more often it is instances of violating the Customs Code. By the way, we have set up a special unit to watch over the work of customs units. [Question] Bribe-taking is associated with low pay. How much are customs officers paid? [Answer] The average salary of a customs officer in Maritime Kray is R290,000. [Question] This is not a lot. Nevertheless, there is competition for jobs in the customs organs. [Answer] Competition is a mandatory condition in order to get a job at the customs. This is the directive of the Main Customs Administration. It is true that in some specializations there are up to 10 applicants for a job. Our goal is to make a guaranteed social protection of our staff more valuable than high salaries. [Question] What effect has the increase in custom duties had on the state of the automobile market? Who benefits from this increase? [Answer] With the introduction of new custom duties in February-March, the automobile market in Maritime Kray went into a lull. A pick-up began in April after a certain cable from the State Customs Committee, which envisaged customs relief until 1 July for cars imported for the purpose of commercial activities. We can predict that after this date the duty will at least double. This undoubtedly will cause a slump in the automobile business. Who benefits from it is anybody's guess, but it certainly is not the treasury. After all, in the first quarter of 1994 the Far Eastern customs alone delivered to the treasury R6.792 billion in "car" money. [Question] Did the customs participate in Operation Fishing '94? [Answer] Very actively. In cooperation with two border protection districts, our organs uncovered 11 customs violations. The work was done mostly in the area of the Kuril Ridge and South Sakhalin and zeroed in on illegal export of fish--as a rule, by the way, by our compatriots. [Question] On the problem of plundering of the national fish resources. Do the Japanese authorities show interest in this issue? After all, illegal exports of fish also affect the interests of that country. [Answer] Alas, this problem has not been looked into on either the government or any other level. Our Japanese colleagues are more concerned about the smuggling of arms and drugs, which is acquiring an increasingly larger scale.
