Khmelyuk and A. Malyshev, senior scientific associate] [Text] The PP-91 bridge train is designed for erecting bridge and ferry crossings over water obstacles. The set includes 32 river, 4 shore, and 8 motor sections, 4 towing launches, 4 flooring sections, and auxiliary equipment that can be transported on KrAZ-260G bridge-train motor vehicles and ZIL-4334 launch vehicles. In the opened position, each river section is a finished section of floating bridge or ferry 7.2 meters long. To use the section after unloading it from the vehicle into the water, it is only necessary to close two deck and four bottom locking devices. The capacity of one river section is 22.5 tonnes. A shore section is distinguished from a river section by the slope of the deck and by the stronger design of the pontoons. Floating bridges and ferries can be assembled from the river and shore sections by connecting them using the docking devices on transoms. The obliquely symmetrical position of these devices makes it possible to connect the river sections regardless of how the transoms are positioned relative to one another. Motor sections are arranged between the river sections. Each river section is equipped with anchor winches with anchors to secure the bridges in a current and ramps for making entrances to the ferries. Floating bridges and ferries have high floodability, ensured by the large number of water-displacing sections, each of which consists of four pontoons divided into two watertight compartments. The good repairability of the sections makes it possible to restore them quickly in field conditions. The PP-91 bridge train makes it possible to bring all troop equipment across virtually any water obstacle. Based on its specifications, the bridge train has nothing similar to it in the world practice of bridge building. It can be successfully used without design modifications in various sectors of the national economy, especially when building and restoring permanent bridges, when erecting temporary crossings in logging, in agricultural work, and also when cleaning up after natural disasters in areas of extensive flooding. The PP-91 is delivered to consumers in various complete sets.
