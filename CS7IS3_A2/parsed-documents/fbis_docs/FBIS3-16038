Saburov thinks a program of economic reforms can be developed in the near future to ensure the improvement of financial relations with Russia, better banking and privatization system, changes in the taxation system and attraction of foreign investors. The Russian economist praised the current Crimean Government and said only a few new people will be introduced in the Crimean cabinet. The parliament meeting put on the agenda the cancellation of moratorium on referendum on the Crimean state status and refused to consider the application of Parliament Speaker Nikolay Bagrov for resignation. The parliament made no comments on the Ukrainian Parliament resolution on bringing the Crimean legislation in correspondence to the Ukrainian laws and voted down the proposal to restore the Crimean Constitution of May 6, 1992, that declared independence of the Crimea. The law-makers listened to ministers' reports on draft plans of Crimean economic and social development, republican and local budgets for 1994 and discussed the documents in commissions.
