Villanueva] [Text] President Ramos has issued four executive orders [EO] that will implement the Philippine program of reducing tariff rates of 15 groups of products effective January 1994 in compliance with the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA). The president issued EO 145 up to 148 which he signed on Monday, 27 December -- all of which will take effect 1 January 1994 except EO 148, which takes effect 30 days after publication of the directive in two newspapers of general circulation. For this purpose, the president approved the modified rates of duty as provided for under the Tariff and Customs Code of 1978, as amended, to implement the 1994 Philippine schedule of tariff reductions on the 15 articles included in the accelerated and normal programs of the Common Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT) scheme for the AFTA. The 15 groups of products included in the CEPT scheme for accelerated tariff reductions are: vegetable oils, cement, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, fertilizers, plastics, rubber products, leather products, pulp, textiles, ceramics and glass products, gems and jewelry, copper cathodes, electronics, and, wooden and rattan furnitures. In EO 145, the president said that the six member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have agreed that there is a need to remove tariff and non-tariff barriers that only serve to impede intra-ASEAN trade. The six member countries of the ASEAN includes the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore, and Thailand. The ASEAN member countries have agreed to improve the existing Preferential Trading Arrangements (PTA) in this regard. To boost economic cooperation and intra-ASEAN trading, the ASEAN member countries have agreed to do this through the CEPT scheme which set a time frame of 15 years beginning January 1993 to reduce tariff rates from zero to five percent. EO 145 says that products identified by the Philippines for accelerated rate reduction under the CEPT scheme for the AFTA, tariff rates (MFN/PTA) [expansion unknown] of 20 percent or below shall be reduced to five percent and zero by 1 Jan 2000, while tariff rates (MFN/PTA) above 20 percent shall be reduced to five percent and zero by 1 January 2003. For products identified by the Philippines for "normal rate reduction," the tariff reduction to five percent and zero shall be done in two stages, namely: -- For products with existing tariff rates (MFN/PTA) of 20 percent or below, tariffs shall be reduced to five percent and zero through a seven-year program starting 1 January 1996 up to 1 January 2003; and, -- For products with existing tariff rates (MFN/PTA) above 20 percent, tariffs shall be reduced to 20 percent by 1 January 2001. The subsequent reduction of tariff rates from 20 percent to five percent and zero shall be done within seven years, with the minimum rate of reduction set at five percentage points every two years starting 1 January 2004 up to 1 January 2008. EO 146 amends EO 43, series of 1992 by modifying the margins of preference (MOP) and the applicable ASEAN Preferential Tariffs on certain items included in the coverage in the Philippine Exclusion List. In EO 43, the rates of duty of certain imported articles as provided for under the Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines of 1978, as amended, provided a minimum level of 25 percent MOPs in certain items in the exclusion list. EO 147 modifies the rates of duty on certain imported articles as provided for in the Tariff Code to implement the 10 percent (MOP) granted by the Philippines under the agreement on the Global System of Trade Preferences (GSTP) among developing countries as set forth in the Philippine schedule of concessions. The agreement on the GSTP was ratified by the Philippine Senate on 2 September 1991 but the government has yet to implement this international trade pact it inked with 47 other developing countries. EO 148, modifies the rates of duty on certain imported articles as provided for under Presidential Decree 1464, as amended, otherwise known as the Tariff Code of 1978. Under the country's 1987 Constitution, the president is empowered to amend tariff rates in case Congress is not in session. Congress adjourned for the Christmas holidays and will not resume sessions until next month. In the case of cane or best sugar and chemically pure sucrose in solid form, including raw sugar, not containing added flavoring or coloring matter, the existing duty rate of 70 percent was reduced to 60 percent effective 1 July 1994 and down farther to 50 percent by 1 July 1995. Prawn feeds remained at 20 percent import duty, as well as gelatin, pharmaceutical grade and closed sterile water system for inhalation, both at 10 percent. Unassembled starter motors will remain at three percent. Vulcanized rubber thread and cord will remain at the present 30 percent duty rate until July 1994 but will be reduced to 20 percent by 1995. Pile fabrics of 100 percent polyester staple fibers used in the manufacture of paint rollers measuring 2-1/2 to 3 inches in width will be reduced to 10 percent.
