According to the trade union, over 54,000 persons in 137 enterprises participated in the labor action. Zwickel, the chairman of the metalworking trade union, pointed out that the first working day after the end of the commitment to maintain industrial peace has shown how "angry" the employees in the metalworking and electrical industry are about the employers' calls for wage reductions. At the same time, he called on the regional employers to offer immediate new negotiations. The other side must now show flexibility. So far, only the metalworkers trade union has submitted substantive proposals at the negotiating table, Zwickel stressed. The trade union has presented proposals on the length and organization of working hours and suggested various models within the framework of area wage agreements. IG Metall has announced that it will spread its token strikes on Tuesday [1 February]. Gottschol, president of the employers' association in the metalworking industry, stated: "We are ready to hold constructive talks with IG Metall at every level and at any place." The competitiveness of German enterprises can only be increased by lowering costs in the companies. Gottschol spoke in favor of a collective agreement that grants the enterprises great flexibility. He again stressed that 600,000 jobs have disappeared in the metal working industry since the spring of 1991. Kirchner, the manager of the employers' association, appealed to IG Metall to assume its share of responsiblity for safeguarding jobs. A strike would be "socially irresponsible," Kirchner pointed out. On Monday [31 January] officials from the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] and Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] warned the parties to the collective agreements against industrial action. SPD Chairman Scharping called for more flexibility on the part of the employers. He also pleaded in favor of longer machine times that might be linked to shorter working hours. Full wage compensation is naturally not possible. SPD Deputy Chairman Lafontaine stated that strikes are not compatible with the current economic landscape. FDP Chairman Kinkel considers threatening industrial action as the "most dangerous and unfortuante development" imaginable. The wage settlement must be designed to create new jobs. Kinkel praised the agreement achieved in the chemical industry as a model, providing for wage increases of 1.5 percent and allowing the enterprises great flexibility over working hours. On Monday morning, workers in Mainz, Ludwigshafen, Berlin, Neckarsulm, and a number of other towns went on strike for several hours. According to IG Metall, the strikes were most widespread in Bavaria, Baden-Wuerttemberg, Lower Saxony, and West Berlin.
