But after what has happened in Hebron there can no longer be any postponement. Yitzhaq Rabin must choose: peace or the settlements." This is what Ahmad al-Tibi maintains. He is currently the most authoritative individual among the Palestinians in the territories: He is in charge of relations with PLO headquarters in Tunis. Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres met with al-Tibi on 27 February to discuss the measures adopted by the government to put a stop to the actions of extremist colonists. [L'UNITA] How do you judge the measures taken by the Israeli Government against the extreme right-wing Jewish movements? [Al-Tibi] The measures adopted by Rabin can perhaps reduce the pain but they do not extirpate the disease. The disease that can terminate the peace process is represented by the Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip and on the West Bank. [L'UNITA] But is the disarmament of the more extremist faction of the colonists not a first step to reopening the issue of the future of the settlements? [Al-Tibi] I would not be so confident. I think that the measures currently adopted represent the maximum "concession" that Rabin is willing to make, not only to the Palestinians but also to the left wing of his party and the government. Rabin talks of disarming the extremist elements among the colonists but it is precisely on the concept of "extremists" that we disagree with the Israeli prime minister. [L'UNITA] Do you think that there are extremists in the settlements? [Al-Tibi] Certainly, and not only the "Kakh" activists. In the meeting held Sunday evening with Peres, I asked a question and am still waiting for a response: How does the Israeli Government judge the head of the Kiryat Arba settlement who refused to condemn the massacre at the Tomb of the Patriarchs: Is he an extremist or not? There are extremist groups that have not yet committed crimes like the one in Hebron, but their militants play an active role in the Arab manhunt, attack Palestinians in the streets, destroy their cars, and impede any productive activity. My question to Rabin is: Are these not extremists who should be disarmed? As far as we are concerned, the answer is yes. Even these elements, and there are thousands of them, should be disarmed. Before returning to the negotiating table, we want to verify the criteria that the Israeli authorities will use to determine who is extremist and must be disarmed and who instead has the right to go about the Occupied Territories with a machine gun and pistols. [L'UNITA] The "Meretz" leaders, who also have never approved the colonization of the territories carried out by right-wing governments, maintain that Israel could not support a sudden turnabout on the settlements. [Al-Tibi] I understand their concern, but they must also realize that the politics of always postponing, and delaying, the issue of dismantling the settlements to "a later date," has only produced hate, violence, and death in the territories. On the other hand, we did not ask that all the settlements disappear as of tomorrow. Our request is simply to place this topic first on the negotiations agenda. In view of what happened in Hebron, quite frankly this does not seem to be an "extremist" request. [L'UNITA] In concrete terms, what do you Palestinians consider as being the best way to solve the problem of the settlements? [Al-Tibi] Our principal concern today is that of protecting the population in the territories from the violence of the colonists. We feel that the best solution is to reconcile the schedules for the evacuation of the settlements with the withdrawal of the Israeli Army from Gaza and Jericho. This being for a reason that Israel cannot refuse to acknowledge: If another massacre like the one at Hebron were to take place after the entry into effect of the independence of the two territories, the Palestinian population would accuse the PLO of being jointly responsible for that crime, for having accepted that the settlements remain standing. And this would mean playing the game of the Hamas integralists. [L'UNITA] 'Arafat in Tunis has once again asked the United Nations to guarantee international protection for the Palestinians in the territories, but Israel has rejected this proposal. [Al-Tibi] I find this rigidity by the Tel Aviv government entirely unjustifiable, and I am saying this precisely on the basis of what is sanctioned by the additional protocol of Article 3 of the Declaration of Principles set out in Oslo. The appendix reads: "A temporary international presence may be provided for in the area of Gaza and Jericho to guarantee the implementation of the accords." This is what we are asking for today. Nothing more. [L'UNITA] Among the decisions adopted by the Israeli Government is the establishment of a commission of inquiry into the Hebron massacre. What do you expect from this commission? [Al-Tibi] The verification that the military authorities were responsible for not having guaranteed safety in holy places. It is not sufficient to punish the soldiers who fired at the exit of the mosque. The Israeli Army is called upon to guarantee safety to all inhabitants of the West Bank. But up to now it has interpreted this mandate in a unilateral sense: For the Israeli military commandos, the Palestinians are the potential terrorists and not people to be protected from the violence of the colonists. [L'UNITA] But the Israeli Government is claiming that disarming all the colonists would be the same as handing them over to "Hamas." [Al-Tibi] It is the opposite: It is the presence of the colonists, with their charge of violence that is helping Hamas to justify their armed battle. Because those settlements, together with the massive presence of the Israeli Army, are the living symbol of an occupation that is still present, despite Washington. The only way to save peace is by separating the two communities. [L'UNITA] And now, Dr. al-Tibi, what will happen? [Al-Tibi] The future of the talks is hanging by a thread: It is up to Israel and the United States not to break it. More than five months have passed since the signing of the accords on Gaza and Jericho, but life in the territories has not improved: People continue to suffer and die. What has been promised must be implemented, and it must be done as soon as possible. Today the restart of talks passes necessarily through Kiryat Arba, Ariel, and the other Jewish settlements in the territories. Peace is incompatible with this presence. Rabin must take note of this. But if the colonists are not disarmed, if Israel once again refuses to discuss the times and the ways for dismantling the settlements, then we will be obliged to tell our people to pick up their weapons, because this would be the only way of protecting ourselves.
