FBIS4-52195 "dreas089_c_94016" FBIS-EAS-94-089 Daily Report 6 May 1994 North Korea Hanminjon on South Developing Chemical Weapons Hanminjon on South Developing Chemical Weapons SK0705002494 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1523 GMT 6 May 94 SK0705002494 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, May 6 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of the South Korean National Democratic Front (Hanminjon) published an open letter on April 30 exposing the anti-national and inhumanitarian development of chemical weapons by the South Korean authorities, according to the Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation. The letter says: It was in the late 1960s and the early 1970s that the South Korean military fascist group made the development of chemical weapons its policy. When Nixon made public the "Guam Declaration" in 1969, the military fascist regime defined it as the keynote policy of the dictatorial regime to develop chemical weapons along with nuclear weapons under the pretext of "filling up the blanket caused by the reduction of the U.S. Forces." This policy was pursued by the traitor Pak Chong-hui and then in the days of Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u and is now being stepped up by Kim Yong-sam. South Korea has produced large quantities of chemical weapons. The authorities have introduced many chemical weapon factories. There are eleven companies producing MIC (methyl isocyanate) in South Korea, all of them brought from the United States. In an Asian country, this poison gas leaked from a chemical factory for 12 hours to leave some 4,000 people dead, 20,000 blind and 200,000 poisoned within the radius of 40 kilometres. The authorities are building by themselves many factories of awfully deadly poison gas. Factories producing such kind of toxic gas number ten or more, among them the TDI (toluene diisocyanate) in the Imhae complex, Kunsan, the Inchon factory of the oriental chemical industrial company, the Korea Pacific Chemical Corporation and the Sam Yang Chemical Company. They produce chemical weapons under the cover of production of chemicals for civil use, and deliver them to the military. TDI and phosgene, chlorine and other materials used in it are strong poisonous substances which are themselves chemical weapons. The annual production of phosgene is 96,000 tons in South Korea (SEOUL SINMUN January 12, 1993) and gaseous chlorine stockpiled amounts to thousands of tons. Producers of poisonous chemical materials used for the production of chemical weapons number more than 30 and the scale of the annual production of materials liable to control has exceeded 120,000 tons (SEOUL SINMUN, January 12, 1993.) The ruling group of traitors has developed and stockpiled nerve gas, suffocative toxicant and other kinds of chemical weapons designed for attack, killing of domestic animals and destruction of forests in military areas and densely populated areas in the rear. Deployed in the whole frontline areas are 15 chemical attack units including chemical depot No. 31 of the second logistic command of the Army, chemical depot No. 12 of the third Army support command, the 16th chemical support battalion under the sixth Army and the chemical battalion under the third Army. The chemical units continue tests of exploding, throwing and launching handgrenades, mines, bombs, shells, rockets, warheads of missile and other firing or launched and jet-propelled weapons which are charged with various kinds of chemical materials. The Korean nation may suffer not only from poison gas made by South Korea but also from gas bombs of the U.S. Forces. The United States, which had brought a large quantity of chemical weapons into South Korea, has deployed many binary chemical weapons in main military operational areas according to the decision of the 18th "South Korea-U.S. Annual Security Meeting" in 1986. The United States and the South Korean traitors have steadily cultivated the tactics of using chemical weapons together with nuclear weapons in the Team Spirit manoeuvres directed against the North, regarding chemical weapons as "one of the main elements of military potentials." The open letter concludes with the following words: The criminal production and deployment of chemical weapons by the South Korean authorities are not only a total challenge to the September, 1992, international accord prohibiting the development, production, stockpile and use of chemical weapons but also a hostile act going against the North-South agreement on nonaggression. The United States and the Kim Yong-sam group are now crying over "the issue of chemical weapons" of the North. This is a premeditated ruse to cover up their criminal preparations for chemical warfare. Our people must rise up resolutely in the massive struggle for removing the danger of a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula and, at the same time, checking the production and use of chemical weapons, the most heinous, brutal, anti-national and anti-human act, by the South Korean authorities.
