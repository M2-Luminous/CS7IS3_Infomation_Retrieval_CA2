Speaking from the Foreign Ministry's regular forum today, Dr. Abu-Salih said the success of the current round of negotiations in Nairobi between the government and the rebellion basically depended on starting it from the point at which the earlier talks had ended. His excellency referred to Sudan's participation in the Arab League meeting to be held at foreign minister level in Cairo on 26 March, saying that the participants would discuss Arab security and, for the first time, southern Sudan in the context of foreign interference there and attempts to exploit the issue for personal interests. Dr. Abu-Salih stressed that there were quarters striving to perpetuate the war in the south in the service of their interests. His excellency denied reports to the effect that Sudan lacked seriousness in solving the southern issue. The foreign minister also referred to the visit of an envoy of the American President and a U.S. representative to Sudan expected by the end of March with the aim of studying the efforts being made to establish peace in the country. Ambassador Mahdi Ibrahim, director of the Political Department at the Foreign Ministry, also speaking from the forum, reported that a Romanian delegation would be visiting the country with a view to developing bilateral relations. Ambassador 'Abd-al-Hadi Siddiq, director of the Horn of Africa Department at the Foreign Ministry, reported that a Sudanese delegation would participate in the seventh African conference to be held in Kampala in April.
