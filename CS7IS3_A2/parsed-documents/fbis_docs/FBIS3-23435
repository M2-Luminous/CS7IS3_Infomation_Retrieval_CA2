For a long time, the security authorities have had information about hostilities, and these have been reinforced with Theofilos Yeoryiadhis' murder. However, the authorities cannot make any arrests due to lack of evidence. They simply observe the moves and activities of people who are acting as spies against the Republic of Cyprus. Intense activity by Turkish agents has been noted in the past two months and cause concern to the police who are studying the issue at various conferences. The Turkish agents reportedly enter the free areas through the British bases sometime during the night and they contact various people who live in the free areas.
