Ransome-Kuti was reelected at a convention on Sunday in Ibadan, some 140 kilometres (85 miles) north of Lagos. A group within the CD, led by Chima Ubani, the former CD secretary-general, last month accused Dr. Ransome-Kuti of "collaborating" with the regime of military ruler General Sani Abacha, thereby "compromising" the association. Ransome-Kuti has denied the charges. An attempt by the dissenters to pass a vote of no confidence in Ransome-Kuti's leadership was defeated by majority of participants, sparking a walkout by a number of prominent opponents of Ransome-Kuti before the leadership vote, conference sources said. Some activists said they would not rule out the formation of another human rights group by the opponents of Ransome-Kuti's leadership.
