Roman Babayan reports from Simferopol: [Babayan] The fact is that almost all of last week the deputies, together with Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov and Deputy Prime Minister Yevgeniy Saburov, discussed the nominations for future republican ministers. But they failed to reach any decisions. Each side gives their own explanation of this. Deputy Prime Minister Yevgeniy Saburov believes that the deputies are being obstinate over the issue of approving the Cabinet of Ministers because the parliamentarians do not want to have a pro-presidential government in the Crimea. Yevgeniy Saburov noted that in the very near future deputies of the Crimean parliament will try to kick out Yuriy Meshkov. According to Saburov, there is a situation developing today in the Crimea which is like the September-October 1993 Moscow situation. President Yuriy Meshkov is not as categorical as the Crimean deputy prime minister. However, after the parliament again refused to approve the composition of the Cabinet of Ministers, he also stated that the Crimea is on the verge of a third government crisis. As for the parliamentarians themselves, they explain that they are taking these actions because the people put forward for nomination are incompetent. Whatever the reasons, as a result the Crimea still does not have a government, and in consequence starting the process of bringing the Crimean economy out of the bad situation in which it is at present is being postponed indefinitely.
