And he is making his preparations for a round whose winner has virtually been declared with Clinton's assertion that "Cyprus is my personal problem." Therefore, our question to the president was related to this. First the People Must Accept [Ulku] The developments and in particular the reports and commentaries in the Greek Cypriot and U.S. press indicate that the United States will put Turkey in a highly difficult situation in the aftermath of the elections. What sort of a path do you want to follow in view of this? [Denktas] I am also in contact with the Americans and asking them: There is a fundamental principle. Any agreement will be submitted to a referendum on both sides; that is, it will be subject to the will of the people. Will you use force to make us accept an agreement rejected by the people? "Never," they reply. The Americans have the mistaken impression that the package, called the "set of ideas," placed before us is acceptable to the people, but that we have not been telling the truth to the people. I am saying that we could only go to the people if we reach the conclusion that an agreement acceptable to the people could be concluded. Internal turmoil will ensue if, without such a conviction, we affix our signature to an agreement unacceptable to the people. Hence, on the basis of this, Turkey could easily put up the following defense: "I might try to make the Turkish Cypriots endorse an agreement acceptable to them, but I cannot force them to endorse an agreement unacceptable to them. " Turkey could make this defense, and is already doing it. [Ulku] Do you see any hint of retreat or concession on Cyprus problem since the 60's and 70's on the part of Turkey? [Denktas] No, I do not. Turkey is continuing to execute the necessary maneuver to prove that it has the goodwill and favors peace, and that the Turkish people in Cyprus too have rights and a just cause. Because the TRNC [Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus] is a state officially recognized by Turkey, it [TRNC] will not be subject to the diplomatic erosion that existed before our declaration of the TRNC, and therefore Turkey will support us with greater ease. "Papandreou's New Policy Is in Our Favor" [Ulku] It appears that the Papandreou government in Greece is pursuing a "hawkish" policy on Cyprus problem. Where, in your view, will this policy end? Could the attacks of the Greek Cypriot soldiers resume after so many years? [Denktas] I think that for Papandreou to pursue this policy is to our favor. It justifies our position. This policy confirms that he does not want an agreement between us and the Greek Cypriots. I think that if they take further steps in this direction, our being on the right will be understood more easily. I consider their initiative to attack as madness, but then, these are people who have committed madness before. [Ulku] My last question will be a bit personal. To what do you link the persistence of the "Denktas equals Cyprus" formula that has been around for such long years despite every criticism against your person? Have you ever contemplated this issue? [Denktas] I think I link it to the fact that the people have seen that I have always defended what the people want, that I have not deceived the people, and that I followed a line aimed at gaining the people's trust. This is only natural. Had this not been so, we would not have been able to remain here for long. However, what saddens me most is that those who say "The Cyprus problem equals Denktash," or those who look at this issue from this angle have also concluded that "If Denktas wants to, he can make concessions and this problem will be settled." This is very wrong. This is because my very existence here is linked to the art of assessing my people's sincere desire within a reasonable framework and defend it. Even Denktas cannot do what people do not want. Even Denktas cannot make the concession unacceptable to the people. It will be beneficial if this is known to all.
