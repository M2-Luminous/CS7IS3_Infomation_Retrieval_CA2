According to its statements, the Greek Government has undertaken and may undertake further steps towards international forums such as the [UN] Security Council, European Union, CSCE and other forums, interpreting this legal action of Albania as a violation of the rights of the Greek minority in Albania. The spokesman of the Foreign Ministry of the Republic of Albania declares that the Albanian Government is ready to welcome the sending of commissions from the Security Council, CSCE, European Union and other institutions for a direct observation of the reality having in their disposal the complete file of the Albanian Attorney's Office as well as other documents which prove both the keeping of arms by these persons without permission and their relations with the Greek secret service as well as other unconstitutional and secessionist activities. However, this will not be in the interest of Greece and of the joint efforts the two countries are making to overcome the existing contradictions and problems.
