Neritan Ceka, known among the people as Neritan Alia, the bootlicker of Milosevic and the denouncer of Astrit Qorri, thinks that his declarations make him credible. Aware that he is branded for many reasons, he thinks that he might ease the burden on himself. It is no use. No water can cleanse his sins nor those who surround him. In mid-January, Shkoder was added to these sins. The Shkoder incident is a continuation of their pro-Serb policy, after the pro-Serb exposition made in the hall, and is an indictment of them in every way. It is the Serbs and their Allies who want the destabilization of Albania, an Albania exhausted by civil war, and an Albania divided on religious lines, to achieve their anti-Albanian aims, easily delivering a fatal blow to democracy in stir country in order to settle accounts in Kosova. It is the Serbs and their allies who are distressed by the trial according to democratic justice of Ramiz Alia and Fatos Nano, the spawn and successors of Enver, who served the Serbs and their allies until his end. These and other related motives also explain what happened recently in Shkoder and, in general, the whole campaign of the left-wing extremists against democracy and the democratic regime in Albania. They are attempting in this way to rescue Ramiz Alias Fates Nano, and others who collaborated in their crimes, theft, and corruption. However, these wretches have erred in their calculations. The justice which put their godfathers in their places will not find it difficult to deal with their vassals and bootlickers, with adventurers who show no sense of responsibility for the destiny of the country and the people.
