They said a 27-man "national dialogue committee" entrusted with resolving differences between the northern president and his deputy, a southerner, agreed on the measures in Aden late on Monday. The sources said the measures appeared to go some way towards appeasing the Aden-based Yemen Socialist Party (YSP) of Vice-President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, who has stayed away from the capital Sanaa since July amid fears that the 1990 merger between North and South Yemen may be threatened. The accord calls for the withdrawal of troops and military encampments from major Yemeni cities and the arrest of Yemenis suspected of involvement in a spate of political killings. The YSP, which is unified Yemen's second largest party and ruled the former Marxist South Yemen before the merger, says at least 150 of its members have been assassinated in the past few months--the latest was a pro-YSP tribal leader killed on Friday in Sanaa. The sources said the accord also meets a key YSP demand for the central bank to come under the authority of the government headed by the YSP's Haydar Abu Bakr al-Attas. It has so far been under President 'Ali Abdallah Salih, a conservative who ruled North Yemen until the merger. The YSP earlier rejected reconciliation with Mr. Salih and his General People's Congress (GPC), impoverished Yemen's largest party, unless steps were taken to implement its 18 demands. Southern sources say the YSP would not be satisfied with promises and wanted to see concrete actions before ending its boycott of Mr. Salih. It says the two sides had in the past reached several accords which were never implemented. The three parties in the ruling coalition--the YSP, GPC and the Islamist Islah--have been meeting with other Yemeni politicians in Aden for the past 10 days after holding several sessions of the commitee in the north. Each of the three parties has five members. The committee also includes five opposition representatives and seven of the country's leading figures such as former presidents. The sources said that among other points agreed were government spending cuts, anti-corruption measures and some decentralisation measures that would reduce the power of the central government in Sanaa. It was also agreed that a date be set for local elections after last year's first democratic general elections. [passage omitted]
