[passage omitted] Encouraging signs that the Skopje dispute was slowly heading toward a settlement also came from Paris, where EU Commission President Jacques Delors offered his own "gesture of goodwill." Describing Mr. Vance's mediation talks in Geneva as "very good," Mr. Delors said: "I intend to wait for a while, and delay initiating injunction proceedings against Greece for its economic measures. Athens should take this as a gesture of goodwill and understanding on my part." Mr. Delors acknowledged "the political side of the problem since Greece invokes reasons of internal security."
