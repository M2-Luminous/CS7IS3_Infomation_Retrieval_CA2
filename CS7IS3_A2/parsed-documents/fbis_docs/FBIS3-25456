On 8 December 1993, the CAR Government received a Sudanese Government delegation that had come to request the CAR's help in resolving the Sudanese problem. Sympathetic to this laudable request, the CAR Government told the Sudanese delegation that the CAR Government's priority was, first of all, to resolve the Chadian problem in the southern part of this sister country. Furthermore, the government reaffirmed its desire to make its modest contribution -- in consultation with other African countries -- to helping the brotherly Sudanese people settle their tragedy. The CAR Government, which was democratically elected at the ballot box, favors dialogue and consultation. It has refused, now refuses, and will always refuse to allow that its territory be used to destabilize any brotherly neighboring country. Therefore, faithful to its democratic tradition, the CAR Government will unreservedly help protect the Sudanese refugees currently living on its territory and also those from southern Chad. At the moment, the CAR is proud to be hosting peace negotiations between delegations from the Chadian Government and its armed opponents operating in the southern part of Chad. The CAR would also be proud to be available when the time comes to help the Sudanese brothers achieve reconciliation.

Their discussions centered on ways and means of strengthening bilateral bonds of friendship and cooperation."]
