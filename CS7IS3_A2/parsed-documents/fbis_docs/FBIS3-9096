The nine-truck convoy, escorted by UN armored vehicles, was carrying 80 tonnes of food and medical supplies and included several doctors who hoped to bring out from the enclave some 20 people in need of medical attention. Peter Kessler, spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for refugees, said the relief convoy left the town of Zenica early Saturday [19 March] and travelled the 70 kilometres (43 miles) to Maglaj without encountering any obstacles from Bosnian Serb troops besieging the Moslem enclave. He said the convoy reached Maglaj shortly after 1330 GMT only to discover a devastated city with only a few buildings left standing. "There are almost no buildings left that have not been destroyed by the Serbs," said Kessler. "It looks like Vukovar." Vukovar is the eastern Croatian city destroyed by the former Yugoslav army in 1991. [passage omitted]
