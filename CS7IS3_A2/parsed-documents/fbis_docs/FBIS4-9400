Writing in the independent Bratislava daily NARODNA OBRODA of 27 March, Jan Fuelle argues that the new government coalition's success in accomplishing its avowed mission--preparing an early election and laying the foundation for Slovakia's economic stabilization--depends, among other things, on its being able to establish a framework for the emergence of "meaningful and viable" political groupings having clearly defined programs. Such a framework, he suggests, would resemble the Western-type division of political forces into left-wing, center, and right-wing parties. Anyone looking at the composition of the new Slovak Government and at the prominent politicians whose influence made its creation possible, says Fuelle, would be struck by the fact that these men represent quite disparate, even contradictory, political views and that few apparent personal ties or, perhaps, common convictions bind them together. He writes: "Until recently, Jozef Moravcik was foreign affairs minister; his predecessor in that office was Milan Knazko [currently chairman of the Alliance of Democrats of Slovakia]. At one time, Ludovit Cernak [currently chairman of the National Democratic Party] held the post of economy minister in the same government and, half a year ago, he signed a coalition agreement in the same room in which, last Monday night, he signed another agreement, this time with different partners and for a different purpose. Roman Kovac [former deputy prime minister and a prominent Movement for a Democratic Slovakia member] who also took part in the Monday signing ceremony, witnessed, while participating in the previous government's decision making, the expulsion of Milan Knazko, only to have the same fate overtake him. Jan Carnogursky [chairman of the Christian Democratic Movement, KDH] vehemently attacked the government, which included Jozef Moravcik, Milan Knazko, and Ludovit Cernak, as well as Roman Kovac; on the KDH election posters in 1990 one could read the slogan, `Let's Contain Communism.' Now, the former communist Peter Weiss could be seen sitting side by side with Carnogursky as he signed a document which mandated that, among other things, an SDL [Party of the Democratic Left] member be in charge of the Defense Ministry while a KDH member be entrusted with the Interior Ministry." But to focus on this seemingly "absurd situation," suggests Fuelle, would be to miss the really significant point: "Politicians with such disparate views have been able to reach agreement." This, Fuelle believes, is a clear sign that by having managed to arrive at a number of compromises, they have adopted a truly democratic approach to the solution of the governmental crisis. Still, he continues, "so far all they have agreed on have been signatures" on the coalition document. The difficult moves "are yet to be made." To strengthen Slovak democracy, they must be "capable of additional compromises." Their larger mission must include the task of "regrouping" the existing Slovak political arrangements. For unlike the democratic Western countries, he argues, the Slovak political spectrum lacks a consolidated center. Missing between "a strong left" and "an emerging right" is "a viable center party." Being, by their own admission, moderate politicians of centrist orientation, the leaders of the forces behind the new coalition government--Fuelle mentions Cernak, Knazko, and Moravcik--now have a chance to create such a missing political entity, a center party that would "claim as its members many well-known and experienced politicians." Fuelle thinks that this can be accomplished by integration--primarily the integration of groups that have broken off from Meciar's HZDS--and "by finding partners abroad," i.e., association with parallel European political institutions. Should this succeed, he reasons, such a party "could play still another role--the role of a balancing factor." Peter Weiss, SDL leader and one of the architects of the anti-Meciar coalition, feels that this coalition is capable of offering to the Slovak voters a government that not only tolerates plurality of views among its members but is resolved to forge, out of this diversity, a "pragmatic" program aimed specifically at bringing the country out of its current political and economic impasse. In an interview appearing in the 30 March issue of Prague's DENNI TELEGRAF, Weiss sounds a cautiously optimistic note concerning the coalition's future. "We do not consider ourselves defeated in advance," he says, "and are not pessimists. Quite the contrary, we see a realistic chance in this lineup of being able to play at least a drawn game with the HZDS." And when he describes the strategy that the coalition is adopting as its own, Weiss echoes Fuelle's point about close relations among coalition parties that favor compromise solutions and about approximating Western models. The coalition, he stresses, is taking "the path of normal cooperation among political parties patterned after those that exist in the West. Precisely therein lies the alternative to populist and excessively nationalist policies, to confrontational and intransigent policies, to the policy of searching for an enemy," which he ascribes to the Meciar regime. In contrast to Fuelle and Weiss, Slovak journalist and political analyst Egon T. Lansky views the coalition's prospects with pessimism. In the Prague English-language weekly newspaper PROGNOSIS of 31 March, Lansky reviews the events leading to the mid-March negotiations formation of the Moravcik government and concludes that, in spite of all appearances, the opposition to Meciar remains internally divided. This, Lansky argues, is the result of instability and confusion that has plagued Slovak politics "since the Communists turned capitalists" in 1989. Ever since that time, the Slovak political scene has been characterized by "complete lack of both political vision and distinguished personalities." Consequently, attempts at presenting a realistic political program for the country have been frustrated. It is doubtful, Lansky continues, whether one can expect a turn to the better now. While the anti-Meciar forces have finally been able to form a unified front, he writes, "uniting against Meciar is not enough" and, what is worse, the old "divisions and animosities" still seem to persist. "The lines dividing communists and anticommunists, nationalists and democrats (the few there are), as well as ultranationalists, Catholic nationalists, and less nationalist nationalists, often run across rather than between political groups," even for the Hungarians, "whom everyone needs" but with whom "few want to cooperate." Considering this "irrationality of Slovak politics," Lansky holds out little hope for the success of the coalition government. He sees no real possibility of reaching what Fuelle calls "additional compromises" and thus for the emergence of a stabilizing political center. "Chances are," he writes, "that even new elections will not bring a decisive change toward a stable, more democratic, and, above all, viable government." Slovakia after the elections, he adds, is likely to have "a weak government that is incapable of tackling the serious social and economic problems "--or Meciar could possibly return to power. Faced with these alternatives, Lansky admits that he is "not sure" which of the two "is worse."
