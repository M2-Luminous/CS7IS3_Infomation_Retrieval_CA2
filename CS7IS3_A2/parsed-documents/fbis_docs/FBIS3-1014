By yesterday not all details of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola's [UNITA] response had been released to the public. Today it is said that besides the three provinces offered by the government, UNITA also wants to have full governing authority over Benguela, Huambo and Bie Provinces. This is not all, Jonas Savimbi's organization wants more than 20 districts and about 50 communes in other provinces. A source has said what UNITA wants is to create a good support base to fulfill its former aim of taking over power. On the government portfolios, yesterday it was said that UNITA had retracted its position and today the contrary has been said: Jonas Savimbi's organization wants the leadership of five or six key portfolios as ministers or deputy ministers. Analysts say this is an indirect way of demanding power-sharing. The government has assessed UNITA's stand, and today it did not even reply in writing. It only reminded the mediators and UNITA itself that its offer is not negotiable. Either UNITA accepts and the talks continue, or it refuses and everything is over. In other words, the government does not agree with UNITA's stand. Now, the mediators and observers are once again in the midst of a crossfire.
