In reaction to reports in the Algerian press that the weapons were possibly loaded in Antwerp, sources at the port confirmed yesterday evening that the 5,331-tonne El Djorf called at Antwerp on 14 January en route from Hamburg and left on 20 January. The Algerian press agency, APS, had reported -- citing newspapers in Algiers -- that automatic guns, shotguns, and ammunition were found on board and were were presumably destined for extremist Muslims in the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front]. Several crew members were detained. According to those arrested, the weapons were "accidentally" loaded in Antwerp instead of Hamburg. According to the Algerian Government, Germany has become the crossroads for arms smuggling from Iranian and Pakistani organizations to Muslim extremists. There are currently a number of FIS leaders in Germany, including spokesman Rabah Kebir, as well as Okba, Salman, and Ikbal Madan, the sons of jailed FIS leader Sheik Abassi Madani.
