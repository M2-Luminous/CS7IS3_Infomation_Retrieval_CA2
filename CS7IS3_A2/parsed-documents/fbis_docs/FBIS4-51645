FBIS4-51645 "dreas084_h_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-084 Daily Report 28 Apr 1994 Brunei, Malaysia & Singapore Malaysia UN `Double Standards' on Bosnia Condemned UN `Double Standards' on Bosnia Condemned BK2904053194 Kuala Lumpur BERNAMA in English 0817 GMT 28 Apr 94 BK2904053194 Kuala Lumpur BERNAMA English BFN [Text] Kuala Lumpur, April 28 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- Malaysia has once again voiced its concern over the increasing tendency on the part of certain influential members of the United Nations Security Council to be selective in [word indistinct] questions of international peace and security. Malaysia's permanent representative to the UN, Razali Ismail, said this was clearly demonstrated by the council's reluctance to enforce its own resolutions to the situation in Bosnia. Razali said: The procrastination and half-hearted approach to end Serbia's blatant aggression and practice of ethnic-cleansing in Bosnia-Herzegovina is a clear example of the council's selectivity and double standards. In fact, the council appeared to be locked in a political paralysis with some influential members weighing the political, financial and manpower costs to get involved in the crisis, he said when addressing the opening of the [word indistinct] working group on the question of equitable representation on and increase in the membership of the security council in New York, Wednesday. The text of his speech was faxed to BERNAMA on [word indistinct] Thursday. Razali said: Worse still, the council continues to deny the inherent right of the victims of aggression and the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina for collective or individual self-defence under Article 51 of the charter. Razali said the council must use the special power given it to display impartiality and drop its double standards and not be dictated by its domestic constituents alone. A close and careful examination of the security council's record clearly revealed that its achievements remain far from satisfactory. There are too many crisis and trouble spots in the world that demand the council's attention, he said.
