This is the trend of the times and the desire of the people. Although Sino-U.S. relations are still full of contradictions and maintaining the improving trend requires effort, this is an important step. In particular, the U.S. Government has recognized the importance of cooperating with China and has realized that linking human rights to trade will lead itself into a dead end; regarding this point, it is praiseworthy. In the international community today, some major economic powers are particularly willing to become partners in cooperation with China to develop economic and trade relations, and this has already become a world trend. Please look at the following: Japan: Entrepreneurial circles have a strong desire to strengthen Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, and a China fever is sweeping across the Japanese islands. Last year, Sino-Japanese economic and trade relations created three first's, that is, Sino- Japanese trade volume set records and Japan ranked first among China's trade partners, Japan's exports of technology to China ranked first among China's technology imports, and the realization rate of capital invested in China by Japanese entrepreneurs also ranked first. Germany: With Chancellor Kohl's China visit last October as a landmark, Sino-German relations entered a new period of thorough development, and many large enterprises marched toward the Chinese market like an army, with Germany becoming China's largest trade partner in Europe. Kohl said Germany was willing to become China's "real partner" and hoped that relations between the two countries would "resemble ever-flowing steams and rivers." France: Owing to arms sales to Taiwan by the French Government, Sino-French relations were hurt. After going through some twists and turns, the French Government changed its mind and took the initiative to mend ties with China. In April this year, Prime Minister Balladur visited China and said he wanted to "open a new chapter on Sino-French relations." After the leaders of the two governments held summits, a joint communique on the restoration of relations was issued, and, since then, relations between the two countries have entered the track of normal development. Russia: Earlier this year, Russian President Boris Yeltsin proposed building a "constructive partnership" with China. Not long ago, Prime Minister Chernomyrdin visited China, the two countries signed seven agreements involving many areas, and bilateral relations took a big step forward. Some big powers have one after another adjusted their China policies, and this can be regarded as the result of a re- interpretation of China by those governments. Whether they are willing or unwilling, politicians in Western countries, including the United States, must admit: first, China is a giant, and no pressures or sanctions of any kind can have an impact on it; second, China has the fastest economic growth in the world and has a great impact on the world's economic development; third, China is a market with great potential and is opening to every trade partner, who now find it provides the best opportunity to enter the Chinese market and develop their own economy. If a country looks down on China or even confronts China, the one which will be hurt is not China but itself. The French prime minister openly admitted that he had neglected the development of the Asia region in the past and had now discovered the consequence of such negligence, and that from now on, he must pay special attention to China's development and strengthen cooperation with China. The French foreign minister also said that France "regrets the quarrel with China caused by the matter of arms sales to Taiwan," and asked "should we bet on a region of 20 million people or a country which has 1.1 billion people and is probably the world's third largest economic power? To us, the choice is very obvious." Economic factors are the determining factors about whether a regime can be consolidated and whether society can develop. If a country's politicians do not look at the economy, do not put economic development in the first position, and do not consider their country's long-term interests, they will lead their country into decline and chaos and they will be abandoned by the people. The contemporary Western world generally faces economic depression, and it must put economic factors in pole position when handling international relations to cast off this difficult situation. This is an important reason why some of the major powers are seeking cooperation with China. There is also another point, that is, more Western countries feel that it is not feasible to deal with China by exerting pressure on it or imposing economic sanctions against it in order to achieve political aims. The United States has even failed to score results by imposing sanctions against some small countries, let alone China, which has 1.1 billion people! In the 1950's, armed intervention and economic blockade by the United States failed to bring China to its knees; after "4 June," the United States joined hands with some Western countries to impose economic sanctions against China, but failed to make China lower its head; in recent years, the United States has waved the human rights stick but has failed to scare China. Clinton linked human rights to MFN status and was strongly opposed by various circles, especially commercial circles in the United States; therefore, he could not but admit that the effect of linking the two had vanished. In handling relations with China, even France and the United States have bowed their heads to reality and to economics; they have rid themselves of erroneous ideas of their own and have made choices which conform to their long-term interests and to the world trend, and this cannot but deal a blow to the British Government, which continues to insist on confronting China. Up to now, Britain still hopes to see turmoil emerging in China, hopes to use the human rights stick to scare China, and hopes to see its allies and the United Nations exert political pressure on China so that it can achieve its goal of extending its colonial interests in Hong Kong; this is really absurd. We can certainly say that in Hong Kong, while the British side is staking its chips on a small handful of pro-British elements who are trying to cause chaos in Hong Kong, it is doomed to failure.
