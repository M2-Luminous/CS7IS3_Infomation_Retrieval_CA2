Here is our correspondent Vasyl Kukurichka with his story. [Kukurichka] At the news conference Vitaliy Radetskyy summed up the results of his official visit to the United States of America. As the defense minister pointed out, the visit was very rich in events and, in his opinion, it was fruitful for both sides. Ukrainian Radio World Service had informed its listeners in detail about the visit in progress, therefore, I will not repeat what has already been said about this. So, what was the main objective of this visit, says Ukraine's Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy. [Begin Radetskyy recording] Our delegation linked the main objective of its visit to the United States of America with the expansion and improvement of bilateral relations between the military departments, and also the fulfillment by the sides of the obligations assumed earlier. In particular, this refers to the trilateral statement by the presidents of Ukraine, the United States, and Russia; to Ukraine's nuclear disarmament and provision of relevant assistance to it. The issue on Ukraine's accession to the Partnership for Peace was considered rather extensively. During the course of the visit the delegation visited a number of important military facilities in the United States of America and took part in several military exercises. [sentence as heard] Agreements were reached between the military departments in numerous trends of military cooperation. In connection with this, a military contacts plan was specified and complemented. In particular, the sides agreed to establish a direct telephone communication line between the ministries of both countries, and to send a group of Ukrainian Armed Forces officers to undergo studies and training at the relevant educational centers in the United States. We also agreed on naval forces, on the land-based grouping, and also on the antiaircraft forces. We will send officers there for one month or three months long training. We agreed on a regular exchange of materials and information on military issues, on the preparation and holding of joint military exercises in 1995, and on other issues. The fact that already, as of 30 May, the United States of America retargeted its strategic missiles, earlier targeted at Ukraine, became an outstanding event for us. We have long been waiting for this, the more so since Ukrainian missiles underwent such a procedure in December 1993. Dr. William Perry had an opportunity to satisfy himself personally, during his latest visit to Ukraine in March this year, that the process of nuclear disarmament is going on consistently and irreversibly. In its turn, at a missile site in South Dakota, our delegation members had an opportunity to see several silos, used for intercontinental missiles of the Minuteman-2 type, that were destroyed or prepared for destruction. The fact that we had an opportunity to immediately participate in the destruction of one of such silos was an important event. Deputy to Mr. William Perry, Dr. Carter and myself pushed the launch button and the silo ceased to exist. Very useful was our meeting with the leaders and leading specialists of the Rand Corporation, which is one of the most important research centers in the United States in the sphere of national security and defense issues. In my speech there I set out the main provisions of the national security doctrine of the Ukrainian state within the context of new possibilities for international cooperation. Meetings with the Ukrainian community in Chicago made an unforgettable impression on all the members of our delegation, and me personally. I felt it my duty to deliver a speech there on the general situation in Ukraine, the general problems of building its Armed Forces, the development of military cooperation, and then answered questions. Our compatriots deserve high esteem. They gave us a very good reception. They were interested in knowing everything about the developments in Ukraine. As for nostalgia, it always remains a nostalgia. Therefore, I believe that the visit was useful for both sides. We reached such a level of understanding with the U.S. side, which gives grounds to hope for a dynamic development of mutual relations between the military departments, and for good relations between our nations in general. [Kukurichka] That was an official assessment of the visit by Ukraine's military delegation to the United States made by Ukraine's Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy at a news conference in Kiev on 23 June. The report was filed by Vasyl Kukurichka, Radio Ukraine World Service.
