Security sources say they had been monitoring this group for some time and made arrests after fixing the zero hour. Following confessions by members of the group, the security sources said the group had planned to assassinate well-known personalities and to blow up some vital installations. [passage omitted]. But there are other sides to this issue, namely the intelligence of foreign states, which wish to see the day when Sudan drowns in a sea of blood. Another aspect is the scattered remnants of the opposition abroad which are linked to these foreign intelligence organs and which are competing to carry out activities inside the country, whatever these may be, in order to justify obtaining funds from the financing quarters. According to the confessions of those caught, that is Brigadier Retired 'Abd-al-Rahman Farah, former security adviser, Hamad 'Umar Baqadi, member of the dissolved Ummah Party's Political Bureau and one called Seyf al-Din Sa'id, in charge of security and information in the dissolved party, their contacts with foreign quarters in Khartoum have not ended. Whether they are instigating these quarters to finance sabotage operations or whether those quarters are the instigators is immaterial. Ultimately the result is the same, namely to drown the country in a sea of blood and to sabotage vital installations. In any case, the only ones to benefit are those foreign quarters.
