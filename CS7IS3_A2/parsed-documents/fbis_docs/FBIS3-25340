Mr. de Klerk was speaking at a news conference in Pretoria a short while ago. Johan Claasen reports: [Begin recording] [Claasen] According to Mr. de Klerk the refusal by certain political groups to participate in the elections could theoretically lead to a postponement. He does believe, however, that support for an election on the 27 April is sufficient to assure that it will take place. He called on all parties to register for the elections as soon as possible. He said that even though time is extremely limited there is still room for negotiation. [De Klerk, in English] Practicality suggests that we are now talking merely about reaching agreements within a few days, at the most a week, and calling Parliament together rather soon. [Claasen] Referring to the demands of King Goodwill Zwelithini, Mr. de Klerk says there will be definite proposals on the table on Thursday, which hopefully, will be acceptable to the king.
