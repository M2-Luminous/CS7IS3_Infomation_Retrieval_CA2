FR940414-1-00055 FR940414-1-00010 A. Pesticide Chemicals Formulating, Packaging and Repackaging (Subcategory C) EPA is proposing to establish BAT limitations for this subcategory that are equivalent to the limitations established for BPT. Since BPT requires zero discharge of process wastewater pollutants and there can be no more stringent limitations, EPA believes an equivalent technology basis is appropriate for BAT. EPA believes that there are no additional costs associated with establishing these limits. B. Repackaging of Agricultural Pesticides Performed by Refilling Establishments (Subcategory E) EPA is proposing to establish BAT limitations for this subcategory that are equivalent to the limitation established for BPT. Since BPT requires zero discharge of process wastewater pollutants and there can be no more stringent limitations, EPA believes an equivalent technology basis is appropriate for BAT. XII. Pretreatment Standards for Existing Sources A. Pesticide Chemicals Formulating, Packaging and Repackaging (Subcategory C) 1. Options Selection The Agency is proposing to establish PSES at the zero discharge level. The best available technologies identified as a basis for these proposed standards consist of recycle and reuse of wastewater and treatment, where necessary, of wastewater by the Universal Treatment System prior to recycle/reuse. EPA's detailed evaluation of the technology-based options is described in the following paragraphs of this section of the preamble. This evaluation utilizes as a basis the results of the industry survey, which focused on facilities involved in formulating, packaging and repackaging the 272 active ingredients that were covered in the recently promulgated (September 28, 1993, 58 FR 50637) manufacturing effluent guidelines and standards. Based on sample results of the survey there are an estimated 2439 facilities involved in formulating, packaging and repackaging the 272 active ingredients. Information obtained primarily from OPP Section 7 data bases on registered products, and also from the survey and EPA facility visits and sampling episodes were used to evaluate approximately 1300 of the 2400 facilities with respect to product lines that formulate, package or repackage process both the 272 active ingredients and other active ingredients covered by this proposed rule. As a second phase of the evaluation, approximately 1500 facilities that process only the non-272 active ingredients were evaluated. These facilities were identified from the FIFRA registration data for the base year of 1988. Based on the formulating, packaging and repackaging practices and the types of products being similar or the same at these facilities as that seen and/or reported as part of the data base for the 272 active ingredients, EPA has extrapolated the detailed evaluation of the 272 active ingredients to propose coverage of all PFPR facilities and refilling establishments. EPA visited 51 PFPR facilities to conduct a technical inspection of the facilities, their production processes, wastewater generation, pollution prevention and wastewater treatment practices. Of those 51 facilities 39 also formulate, package or repackage pesticide products containing the non-272 active ingredient(s). Based on observations and discussions with facility personnel, EPA believes that the production practices, pollution prevention practices and treatment practices (where they exist) are the same for the products containing the 272 active ingredients and the products containing the non-272 active ingredients. The only FIFRA registered products that would not be covered by this PSES proposal are pesticide products containing the active ingredient sodium hypochlorite (also called bleach). EPA proposes to exclude sodium hypochlorite from the applicability of PSES because it is commonly classified as an inorganic chemical even though it has registered pesticidal uses. EPA notes that it would be inappropriate to combine wastewater generated from formulating, packaging or repackaging sodium hypochlorite with wastewater from other active ingredients due to the high probability that the sodium hypochlorite will react with organic active ingredients and inerts, generating chlorinated organics. Thus, EPA expects that wastewaters generated from the formulating, packaging and repackaging of sodium hypochlorite are kept separate from other PFPR wastewaters even in facilities where they co-exist (900 facilities formulate, package or repackage sodium hypochlorite only). Because sodium hypochlorite is commonly classified as an inorganic chemical and not as a pesticide and because sodium hypochlorite PFPR waste streams are generally expected to be segregated and treated separately from the remaining PFPR waste streams, EPA proposes not to include sodium hypochlorite PFPR waste streams within the scope of today's proposed regulations for indirect dischargers. Instead, EPA believes that sodium hypochlorite formulating, packaging and repackaging waste streams would be more appropriately included within the coverage of future effluent guidelines rulemakings in other industry categories, e.g., inorganic chemicals. EPA recognizes that the existing BPT zero discharge requirement would apply to the sodium hypochlorite PFPR direct dischargers. EPA is not proposing to amend that requirement, since it has been in place since the 1978 BPT rulemaking and there is no information that this approach should be changed. However, EPA invites comment on whether to exclude sodium hypochlorite PFPR waste streams from the regulations for both indirect and direct dischargers. EPA also invites comment on whether to expand the list of active ingredients excluded from coverage should data become available that other specific active ingredients are like sodium hypochlorite in that they act as strong oxidizing agents and process wastewaters should not be combined with other pesticide active ingredients through process wastewater treatment. Alternatively, if EPA receives information indicating that sodium hypochlorite is not as different from the other ingredients that are formulated, packaged or repackaged as EPA believes, then EPA may decide to include sodium hypochlorite discharges within the PSES coverage in the final rule, and would make no changes to the rule's coverage with respect to direct dischargers. EPA's survey of the pesticide formulating and packaging subcategory projects that out of an estimated 1300 facilities, formulating, packaging and repackaging the 272 active ingredients that were the focus of the survey, 669 are achieving zero discharge of process wastewater. Virtually all of the estimated 633 discharging facilities are indirect dischargers. Of the zero discharge facilities, half reported that they do not use water for any of the purposes identified as being process-related sources of wastewater. The estimated 342 other facilities reported generating wastewater and achieving zero discharge of that wastewater through a combination of direct recycle, treatment and recycle, or off-site disposal. EPA assumes that many of these 342 facilities would be discharging directly, if it were allowed. EPA examined the wastewater disposal practices of these facilities and made a determination of what constituted the best available technologies which serve as the basis for PSES. Indirect dischargers in the pesticide formulating, packaging and repackaging industry, use as raw materials many nonconventional pollutants (such as the active ingredients) and priority pollutants. They may be expected to discharge many of these pollutants to POTWs at significant mass or concentration levels, or both. EPA estimates that indirect dischargers of products containing one or more of the 272 organic pesticides annually discharge approximately 115,400 pounds of wastewater pollutants to POTWs. EPA determines which pollutants to regulate in PSES on the basis of whether or not they pass through, interfere with, or are incompatible with the operation of POTWs (including interference with sludge practices). A pollutant is deemed pass through when the average percentage removed nationwide by well-operated POTWs (those meeting secondary treatment requirements) is less than the percentage removed by directly discharging facilities applying BAT for that pollutant. As with the pesticide manufacturing rule (58 FR 50637, September 28, 1993), EPA has very little empirical data on the active ingredient removals actually achieved by POTWs. Therefore, the Agency is relying on lab data to estimate the active ingredient removal performance that would be achieved by biotreatment at well-operated POTWs applying secondary treatment. The results of this laboratory study are reported in the Domestic Sewage Study (DSS) (Report to Congress on the Discharge of Hazardous Waste to Publicly Owned Treatment Works, February 1986, EPA/530&hyph;SW&hyph;86&hyph;004). The DSS provides laboratory data under ideal conditions to estimate biotreatment removal efficiencies at POTWs for different organic active ingredients structural groups.
