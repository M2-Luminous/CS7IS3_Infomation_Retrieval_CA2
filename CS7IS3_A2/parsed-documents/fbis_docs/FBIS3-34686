In the past few months, the number of merchants who could deal in the Jordanian markets was specified. The list contained merchants known for their links with Saddam's intelligence organs and 'Udayy himself. The reports add that a large number of wholesalers who supply the Iraqi market with food, clothing, and other consumer goods were excluded and replaced by others who are closely linked to the ruling family. In another development, the money-changing market in Baghdad was recently the scene of a large-scale arrest campaign. The campaign was launched by the security agencies at 'Udayy's orders. A total of 15 money changers were executed. This led to an increase in the hard currency rates against the Iraqi dinar.
