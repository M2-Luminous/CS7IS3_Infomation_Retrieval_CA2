PBRS, launched on March 15, is headed by former PBS [Party Bersatu Sabah -- Sabah United Party] secretary-general Datuk Joseph Kurup while PDS is headed by former PBS deputy president and Deputy Chief Minister Datuk Bernard Dompok. The PDS has 12 Assemblymen and four MPs while Kurup is the only Assemblyman in the PBRS. With their entry, the ruling coalition has 49 State Assemblymen in the 54-seat house. Apart from the 13 from PDS and PBRS, UMNO [United Malays National Organization] has 22, Sabah Progressive Party (six), Angkatan Keadilan Rakyat [Akar] [People's Justice Organization] (six) and the Liberal Democratic Party (two). The PBS, in Opposition, has five Assemblymen. BN chairman and Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed said the council considered applications from three parties to become components of the coalition. "After discussing at length, we unanimously decided to accept the PDS and the PBRS but rejected the application of Parti Setia [Loyalty Party]," he told reporters after chairing an hour-long meeting of the BN Supreme Council at the UMNO headquarters in the Putra World Trade Center here. Parti Setia, headed by Suhaidin Langkap, was formed in October last year and it contested 15 seats in the Sabah State elections but faired miserably with nearly all the candidates losing their deposits. Asked whether any conditions were attached to the acceptance of the two parties, Dr. Mahathir said there were none and they were accepted as full members. Earlier, Dr. Mahathir said the UMNO supreme council had also made its stand on the applications by the PBRS and PDS to join the BN. On whether the council discussed the appointment of a Sabah deputy chief minister, he replied: "This is not the responsibility of the BN Supreme Council. "It is up to me to decide on the post and other vacant positions in consultation with the Sabah chief minister," he said. Asked whether the acceptance of the two parties would cause problems as there were other Sabah BN parties which had expressed reservations on the inclusion of the two, he said: "The decision was unanimous... as such we do not think there will be any problem." On the objection of Akar, he said Akar, like the other two component parties, gave their views. "After we listened to all their views we made the decision and everyone agreed." Asked whether this would further consolidate the coalition's strength in Sabah, he said it would become stronger. Questioned on whether this would encourage the call for an early general election, he laughed and quipped: "There are so many encouraging signs that even I am confused." On whether the council discussed the general election, Dr. Mahathir said, there were questions about the election. "I explained about the elections ... how to hold elections, what needs to be organised, election machinery and co-operation among the component parties." On whether there was a possibility of a general election being held this year, he replied: "Maybe. Perhaps next year." [passage omitted]
