Japanese officials said the Russians will go to Yokohama in Kanagawa Prefecture where they will visit Chinatown and other locations during their Japan stay until Wednesday. The visiting group will also exchange views with the Japanese sponsors of their trip regarding the Russo-Japanese row over the sovereignty of Kunashiri, Etorofu, Shikotan and the Habomai group of Islets, the officials said. The group is the second Russian group to come to Japan this year under the three-year-old visa-free exchange program. Two Japanese groups recently visited what the Japanese call the "northern territories." Soviet troops seized the islands at the end of World War II.
