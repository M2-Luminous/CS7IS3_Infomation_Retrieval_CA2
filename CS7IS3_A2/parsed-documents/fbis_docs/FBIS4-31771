Bishop Tokes, who -- the weekly says -- had chosen by himself the cover name of Laszlo Kolozsvari, was committing himself: "To cooperate with the state security organs of the Interior Ministry in order to provide information concerning the concepts, behaviour and actions of the persons with whom I get in contact and which (information) have specific importance. At the same time, I will supply information regarding the behaviour and actions of other countries' citizens who are visiting the country and who, under that coverage, are operating activities hostile to our country." TINERAMA journalist Ioan Itu who signs the article claims the document was made available to him a long time ago by a former securitate officer. The journalist motivates his silence until now: "We kept discretion on this issue because of a very simple reason: We were aware of the existence of a receipt signed by Laszlo Tokes in October 1989 for the sum of 20,000 lei -- which he has never denied -- receipt given to an officer of the Hungarian Intelligence Service, so that, at least for us, it is not very clear the role he played then, nor the service whose orders he was following: the Romanian or the Hungarian."
