Ross made this statement in the television program "Open Agenda" during which he announced over 3 million union members will participate in a consultation process called "the parliament of the labor centers." He recalled that union debate on the measures the country should adopt to reorganize its finances and revitalize the economy began yesterday on an experimental basis in the western Province of Pinar del Rio. Numerous meetings of companies related to the food and fishing industries took place in Pinar del Rio. Ross considered the debates held with workers from Pinar del Rio as broad, open, and fruitful. Ross said that the workers proposed such measures as increasing the price of electricity; charging a fee for sports and cultural events; and creating and selling national bonds recoverable within a period of five to 10 years. Ross added that there is a broad consensus regarding the need to seek ways to recover the money illegally obtained by Cubans who are locally called "macetas" [profiteers]. He emphasized that these "macetas" have built their fortunes by exploiting the needs of others. Ross confirmed that the consultation process will include in its first stage (until 29 January) over 400,000 union leaders, and after 29 January, meetings will be conducted in all the country's labor centers. The popular debate on the serious economic-financial situation was recommended last December by the National Assembly of the People's Government (Parliament). During the Parliament's regular session, it was learned that Cuba faces an excess of currency in circulation amounting to more than 12 billion pesos (equivalent to dollars at the official currency exchange). It was also learned in Parliament that 30 percent of state companies are unprofitable and it was estimated that the subsidies to just the sugar industry in the past three years reached 7.2 billion pesos. Ross Leal's statement was preceded by the publication yesterday in the weekly TRABAJADORES of an editorial which urged the union sectors to "take part in the kneading of the bread of decisionmaking rather than sitting back and smelling it as it is baking."
