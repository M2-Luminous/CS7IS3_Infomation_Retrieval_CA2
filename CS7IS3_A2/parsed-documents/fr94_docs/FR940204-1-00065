FR940204-1-00065 FR940204-1-00013 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Fish and Wildlife Service 50 CFR Part 17 RIN 1018&hyph;AC32 Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Proposed Endangered Status for the Callippe Silverspot Butterfly, Behren's Silverspot Butterfly, and the Alameda Whipsnake From Northern and Central California AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Service proposes to determine the callippe silverspot butterfly ( Speyeria callippe callippe ), Behren's silverspot butterfly ( Speyeria zerene behrensii ), and the Alameda whipsnake ( Masticophis lateralis euryxanthus ) as endangered pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). The three species are found in northern and central California. These animals and the foodplants of the larval butterflies occur on private, county, and State land, and are imperiled by one or more of the following: overcollecting, commercial and residential development, competition from alien plants, inappropriate levels of livestock grazing, off-road vehicle use, trampling by hikers and livestock, and perhaps stochastic (i.e., random) extinction by virtue of the small, isolated nature of the remaining populations. This proposal, if made final, would implement protection provided by the Act for these animals. Critical habitat is not being proposed. DATES: Comments from all interested parties must be received by April 5, 1994. Public hearing requests must be received by March 21, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments and materials concerning this proposal should be sent to the Field Supervisor, Sacramento Field Office, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2800 Cottage Way, room E&hyph;1823, Sacramento, California 95825. Comments and materials received will be available for inspection, by appointment, during normal business hours at the above address. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Chris Nagano at the above address or by telephone (916/978&hyph;4866).
