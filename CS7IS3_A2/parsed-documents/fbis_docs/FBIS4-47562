The environment of the Far North is extremely sensitive and is easily damaged during development. The researchers here used microbiological techniques in 1988-1991 to study the effect produced on micromycetes by industrial releases of pollutants such as SO[.sub]2[/], Ni, Cu, and Co, which accumulate in the surface layer of soil near the Severonikel Nonferrous Metallurgy Combine near Monchegorsk, on the Kola Peninsula, in the subzone of the northern taiga. Illuvial-humus podzolic soils were the targets of the study, and research plots were selected on the basis of the prevailing winds of the region. Soil samples were taken at distances of 3 km, 15 km, 30 km and 75 km from the combine. The data obtained by the researchers support the conclusions of G. A. Yevdokimova et al. (``Biological Activity of Soils Exposed to Agrotechnical Pollution in the Far North,'' Leningrad, Nauka, 1984, 120 pp.). The population of micromycetes in the soil near the combine was one-fourth that of the control region (75 km from the combine. Not surprisingly, heavy metal content in the soil grew as the researchers neared the combine. Several micromycetes -- Paecilomyces farinosus, Penicillum notatus, and Aspergillus niger -- accumulate copper and nickel, affixing them to their biomass, thereby preventing the development of soil toxicosis.
