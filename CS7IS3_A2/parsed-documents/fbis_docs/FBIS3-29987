Mexican officials voiced concern over the growing trade imbalance in Seoul's favor and requested that South Korea lift restrictions on importing Mexican liquor, poultry and fruit, ministry officials said. Seoul raised the issue of the growing number of anti-dumping investigations into Korean products in Mexico and asked for assurance that the probes be unbiased. It also brought up Mexican limits on quota imports and its customs tariffication system, naming them as trade barriers. South Korea pressed Mexico to reach early conclusion of an investment protection accord to activate bilateral investment activities but the Mexicans reacted negatively, officials said. The two countries initialed a telecommunications cooperation pact and agreed to hold talks in the near future while scheduling maritime negotiations for mid-March.
