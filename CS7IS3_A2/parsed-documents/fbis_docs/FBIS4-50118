In early April it also stressed the importance of giving top priority to putting "stability before everything else" for several years. This indicates that the authorities are more concerned about stability than reform and development. This feeling has been proved by the authorities' recent circular, which again stresses the importance of stability. An informed source in Beijing revealed that the CPC had recently issued a circular to provincial-level party and government leaders on strengthening party leadership, implementing reform measures, and consolidating stability. The circular asks localities to resolutely implement all reform measures that have been ratified by the central authorities and to promptly exchange information with the central authorities and warns them not proceed with work in their own way. The CPC Issues a Circular on Stability The circular demands that the newly introduced reform measures not be permitted to affect the four major issues of the people, specifically, their food, clothing, housing, and transportation. All reform measures which could cause a decline in the people's standard of living or affect social stability should be postponed or suspended. The circular demands that provincial-level party and government leaders should go to the enterprises, factories, mines, rural areas, schools, and other grass-roots units to propagate policies and familiarize themselves with the situation. In this way they will do their work in a down-to-earth manner. The circular urges leading cadres to practice cleanliness and self-discipline and guard against corruption. For this reason, they should consciously accept mass supervision. Some people in political circles in Beijing pointed out that, in April, the authorities stressed the importance of putting stability before everything else. They subsequently issued this circular on stabilizing the situation. More or less this indicates their concerns about the localities' insubordination and their ignorance of the importance of putting stability above everything else. In late April, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, as acting premier, held a telephone conference for provincial-level leaders. He said, "If the new reform measures which damage the masses' interests and social stability are not promptly corrected, the principal leaders in the localities will be held responsible for the consequences; they will be transferred or receive disciplinary action on the merits of each case." Thus it can be seen that the authorities are worried about social stability and the stability of the political situation. The Meaning of Deng Xiaoping's Theory on "Stability" The informed source said that the CPC's concept of "stability" stems from Deng Xiaoping's theory on "stability." In the last few years, particularly since the 4 June incident in 1989, Deng Xiaoping has paid special attention to the stability of Chinese society and its political situation. He cherishes the hope that China "will create the image of stability and unity for the country and the world." First, this has been drawn from historical experience. He has said, "Foreigners must be made to see that China is stable; if China is in a mess and divided, what hope will it have? Imperialists bullied us in the past, and wasn't this because we were not united?" Second, this has been drawn from practical lessons. He said that today some countries are suffering endless turmoil and war; this fact has provided China with negative lessons indicating that progress is impossible amid turmoil and that only stability can bring about development. Now "China is in a period which particularly necessitates the concentration of efforts on economic development." "To bring about the four modernizations and get rid of poverty and backwardness, China needs a political situation of stability and unity and must proceed with its construction in an organized and orderly manner. Disturbance makes it impossible for us to carry out our construction with peace of mind." "If there are demonstrations today and tomorrow, we cannot concentrate on construction. If disturbances, instability, and disorder occur, foreign capital will stop coming to China. We are exercising strict control in this respect, this will not affect foreign investment; on the contrary, foreign investors will feel at ease." The stability and unity stressed by Deng Xiaoping covers two aspects. Stability is stressed from the angle of the entire society and sometimes is called tranquility. In this respect, Deng Xiaoping thinks it necessary to issue the signal that "China cannot afford confusion" and the slogan that "stability must be put before everything else"; "everything which runs counter to or obstructs our socialist road must be removed, and all factors which may lead to confusion or turmoil in China must be removed." Unity refers to the unity at the policymaking and leadership strata or the core of the central leadership. It is Deng Xiaoping's opinion that the "most important thing is to have a united leadership core." "As long as there are no problems with this link, China will remain as stable as Tai Shan. No country in the world will belittle us and more and more investors will come to China." "As long as the leading group is united and persists in an open policy, decades of stable development will bring about fundamental changes in China." In accordance with Deng Xiaoping's theory on creating a stable situation to concentrate on economic development, this year--the first year for implementing the "50 provisions" decided by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee on establishing the socialist market economic structure--the CPC has stressed again the importance of putting stability before everything else. Zhu Rongji's Painstaking Efforts To Hold On-Site Meetings for Handling Official Business This informed source went on to say that, although the high-level CPC leadership has stressed time and again the importance of stability, they also understand that stability can be basically maintained only when the economy develops. For the purpose of economic development, the authorities recently made a special effort to urge leading cadres to go to the forefront to resolve problems. It is out of the same consideration that the circular asks leading cadres to go to the grass roots. In this respect, Zhu Rongji has set a good example for others to follow. After the conclusion of the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress in late March, Zhu Rongji led 10 people in charge of the relevant ministries and commissions under the State Council in going to Heilongjiang Province for on-site meetings to resolve difficulties in economic disposition and problems in large and medium state enterprises (including military industrial enterprises). After learning about some staff members' and workers' complaints and disturbances which resulted because some enterprises had suspended or stopped their production, Zhu Rongji, authorized by General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng, solemnly announced on 17 April the dismissal of Sun Weiben as Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee secretary and the transfer of Liaoning Provincial Governor Qiu Qifeng as his replacement. This shows Zhu Rongji's resoluteness in handling key issues. After holding on-site meetings to resolve problems in Heilongjiang Province, Zhu Rongji, at the above-mentioned telephone conference in late April, once again stressed the importance of leading cadres going to the grass roots. He said, "Sitting in an office reading documents and drinking tea will not help solve any problem. On the contrary, this might result in unrealistic measures or the proposition of tasks which currently cannot be performed at all and might even ruin the effort to deepen reform or affect the people's lives." If Zhu Rongji's practice of on-site meetings can be popularized, we believe this will be useful to economic development and social stability. But how many communists would be willing to do such a "foolish thing" today?!
