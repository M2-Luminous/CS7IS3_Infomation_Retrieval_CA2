However, it is heartening to know that postponed event has started this week. Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed and the foreign minister, Datuk Ahmad Badawi, are both in New Delhi. This fact does underscore Malaysia's commitment to the objectives of the Group of 15. In the context of fast-moving events in our world today, a gathering like the Group of 15 is a firm necessity. This aspect of globalism is always being stressed by Dr. Mahathir. There is no doubt whatsoever that Malaysia will continue to play a leading role in this group. Some critics were skeptical about the postponement. It had even been rumored that the New Delhi meeting might be called off. Malaysia does not subscribe to such negative attitudes. A specific idea that was conceived by the Malaysian prime minister and worked on in detail by a team of officials concerns the establishment of centers of excellence. The New Delhi gathering will deliberate on this innovative concept. The need to sustain and spread education of high quality is widely acknowledged. For the countries of the South, this is a crucial sector. Malaysia's plan to start such centers in suitable places should receive a positive response from the other states that are attending the New Delhi meeting. The past few years have witnessed the steady strengthening of the South awareness. New lines of communications have been established. They can confidently forecast that the leaders will review several issues of global concern. They will also map out strategies toward coping with numerous areas of human endeavor. A new wave of confidence in certainly in evidence as far as the South countries are concerned. Their determination to lessen dependence of the North has begun to produce concrete results. Malaysia itself is a good example of the new South. It has succeeded in becoming a highly diversified economy. By the year 2020, Malaysia will be a fully industrialized nation. Therefore, there is no longer any need for the smaller and poorer nations to run to the affluent West for guidance. It is better, in everyone's long-term interest, to interact as much as possible with other member states of the South. In this connection, the New Delhi meeting is expected to study the present UN set up. Concrete proposals will probably merge for reforming the UN system. Drafted in the aftermath of the Second World War, the UN Charter reflects the power positions and the ambitions of the victorious nations in 1945. The entire international system is in need of change to accommodate the needs of the numerous nations of the South. Whatever one chooses to call it, the New Delhi meeting will be yet another step forward for the South. Malaysia will give the South the fullest support.
