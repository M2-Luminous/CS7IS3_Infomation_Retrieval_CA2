Recently it opened its 2000 news service with the announcement -- as though it were true -- that General Kundi Paiama was dead. General Kundi Paiama is an adviser to General Joao de Matos, Angolan Armed Forces [FAA] chief of General Staff. In that broadcast, the UNITA radical wing's official radio station proceeded to make defamatory remarks about General Paiama, even blaming him for many of the reverses that the UNITA warmongering wing has suffered in its terrorist operations. All those who listened to that news item will have noticed that the announcer read it with joy in his voice, noting that General Paiama had been one of the key figures in the Ministry of State Security, Minse, and the Directorate of Intelligence and Security of Angola, DISA. That lie, along with many others we have grown used to hearing from Vorgan, clearly shows that the propaganda personnel in the UNITA militarist wing are becoming desperate. The jungle-based Vorgan radio station newsmen are so worried about projecting a negative image of the working of state organs in government-controlled areas in general and in the Angolan capital in particular, that they do not care how they fill their radio programs. The proof is that they are always lying about incidents that have never taken take place. Furthermore, they seldom quote sources, thereby providing undeniable evidence that Jamba's Vorgan radio station can only survive on lies. This, in turn, has been reducing the number of its listeners, because only the truth can ennoble a radio station and make it more widely heard. The UNITA warmongering wing's radio station would have given the public much better service if it tried to report on the real tragedy facing hundreds of Angolans being held captive in UNITA-controlled areas in general, and in the Jamba base in particular. Today, more than ever before, we are hearing those false correspondents' reports to which we grew accustomed when we were in Jamba. The so-called correspondent would be sent into a room, where he was issued with a poorly tuned recorder, and then he had to shout into it a text cooked up in a hurry by people such as [UNITA Information Secretary] Jorge Valentim and company, at the end of which he would say: this was such and such, reporting from Huambo. First, that such and such was not in Huambo and, second, that is not his right name. Those are ploys to which Vorgan resorts to give the impression that it is on top of the situation. The reality, though, is that it is not. We are only too well aware of its tricks. We were there and we even participated in some of that trickery. We will not be fooled by anybody. We saw poor Amos, who is also known as Bob, and whose duty is to listen to other radio stations, doing the job of correspondent in the room next to where he works. We saw the wretched Carlos, a white man who uses the pseudonym of (Catjabala), trying to pass as the station's correspondent in Bie. The truth is that the poor man -- who could not be treated with more contempt for the simple reason that he was white -- used to run a small storehouse with corn, grain, and dry fish and never imagined he would one day become a radio correspondent. We also met (Lolo), that unfortunate soul who comes from central Angola and reports under the name of (Cassembo). He is used to working with generators and sometimes with cameras, but there he was trying to be the Moxico Province correspondent in a cubicle in the Jamba Vorgan radio station's premises. We got to know quite well all those so-called correspondents. They are forced to read whatever is put in front of them. Woe betide if they fail to do so. What is quite certain is that the Angolan people are not very patient. Yesterday, it was Savimbi who claimed he was hitting the enemy in the face. Now it is he who is getting the blows -- and how! Yesterday, it was Savimbi who filled up his lungs to shout: [words indistinct] becoming ugly! Now, his chest quite deflated, it is he who is beginning to see things become ugly for him. The Vorgan radio station should be carrying reports from Savimbi- controlled areas where many people are held captive. Above all, they should go around interviewing the inhabitants of those areas, but without resorting to any sort of coercion. Jonas Savimbi's radio station should also be encouraging debate and it should call on the UNITA militarist wing to follow the path of democracy and to demilitarize its army. It is easy to see that there is much that the Jamba Vorgan radio station could be doing instead of spreading lies. General Kundi Paiama is alive, well, and kicking. He is healthy enough to give his contribution to peace in Angola. One cannot report on the basis of lies. One must report on the basis of concrete facts.
