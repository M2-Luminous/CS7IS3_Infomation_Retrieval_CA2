FR940512-2-00128 FR940512-2-00065 Philadelphia Electric Company, Docket Nos. 50&hyph;352 and 50&hyph;353, Limerick Generating Station, Units 1 and 2, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania Date of amendment request: March 24, 1994. Description of amendment request: The proposed modification to Technical Specification (TS) Sections 3.11.1.4, 6.9.1.8, and 6.14.1 would change the frequency for submitting the Semiannual Radioactive Effluent Release Report to the NRC from semiannually to annually. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. The proposed Technical Specifications (TS) changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed TS changes are administrative in nature. The proposed changes simply involve revising the frequency for submitting the Semiannual Radioactive Effluent Release Report to the NRC from semiannually to annually in order to implement the amended reporting requirements of 10 CFR 50.36a as promulgated in Final Rule 57 FR 39353. Since the information contained in this report is reviewed and evaluated after the effluents are released, no accidents previously evaluated are impacted by the proposed TS changes. Radiological effluent releases from the station will continue to be controlled as required by the TS, including those requirements specified in the Offsite Dose Calculation Manual (ODCM) and Process Control Program (PCP). The proposed TS changes do not involve any changes to the operation or physical configuration of any plant systems or equipment. The proposed changes do not impact any initial or final accident conditions or assumptions previously evaluated. The radiological consequences of these previously evaluated accidents are not affected by the proposed changes. Therefore, the proposed TS changes do not involve an increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 2. The proposed TS changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The proposed TS changes are administrative in nature. The proposed changes simply involve revising the frequency for submitting the Semiannual Radioactive Effluent Release Report to the NRC from semiannually to annually in order to implement the amended reporting requirements of 10 CFR 50.36a as promulgated in Final Rule 57 FR 39353. Radiological effluent releases from the station will continue to be controlled as required by the TS, including those requirements specified in the ODCM and PCP. The proposed TS changes do not involve any modifications to plant systems or equipment. Therefore, the proposed TS changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
