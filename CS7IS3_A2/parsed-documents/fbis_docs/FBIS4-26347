Guo Fengmin, senior representative of the Chinese side, said the JLG should speed up its work, however that requires efforts from both sides. "There are only three years left between now and 1997 and there are a lot of problems for the JLG to discuss." He revealed the Chinese side would bring some subjects for the discussion of JLG at this meeting. The objective is to ensure a smooth transition in Hong Kong. British senior representative H. L. Davies said, "we can use the next three days to advance things as fast as we can." He also said, "when we met in London, the weather was not very good. I am glad to say today's weather is sunshiny. The forecast for the next three days is even better so I am confident we will make progress." The Chinese senior representative said in reply, "let's join our efforts." The previous JLG meeting was held in London between December 7 and 9 last year. It was reported that the current meeting will focus such subjects as military land issue, localization of laws and passport issue.
