De Greiff added he opposes this help. De Greiff, known for his hard position against drug traffickers and the strongest persecutor of Pablo Escobar, the dead chief of the Medellin Cartel, said: "I do not believe we need the help of foreign troops to fight drug trafficking; we have done more than any other country to fight it and have never needed their help." De Greiff also said he "had absolutely no idea" the U.S. soldiers were helping the Colombian Armed Forces in the antidrug-trafficking struggle. "I do not like to be lied to," the prosecutor general added. [passage omitted]
