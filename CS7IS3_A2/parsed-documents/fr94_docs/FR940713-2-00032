FR940713-2-00032 FR940713-2-00026 Background Projects Power from 8 of the 9 projects in the Cumberland Basin Projects (Wolf Creek, Center Hill, Dale Hollow, Old Hickory, Cheatham, Barkley, J. Percy Priest, Cordell Hull and Laurel) is sold through the transmission system of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). TVA has contracted to purchase 405,000 KW to preference customers outside the service area and to firm up the 70,000 KW from the Laurel Project. The Laurel Project is located in the service area of and delivered to East Kentucky Power Cooperative. Cumberland Basin power not sold to East Kentucky Power for the use of its preference customers is sold to eight municipalities in the Mississippi Power and Light area via a contract with the Municipal Energy Agency of Mississippi; seven cooperatives in the Mississippi Power and Light area via a contract with South Mississippi Electric Power Association; Big Rivers Electric Corporation; the City of Henderson Kentucky; East Kentucky power Cooperative; Southern Illinois Power Cooperative; and one municipality and two cooperatives in the western portion of the Carolina Power and Light Company (CP&L) service area via transmission over TVA's and CP&L's transmission system. Currently 62 MW of the power to be marketed outside the TVA area is temporarily being marketed to TVA for the use of its preference customers pending completion of arrangements to market the power to preference customers in the Kentucky Utilities Company area. The projects were developed by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers for the comprehensive development of the Cumberland River Basin. Project purposes include hydroelectric power, navigation, flood control, recreation, pollution abatement, and economic development. Collectively the projects provide 5.1 million acre feet of flood control storage and 380 miles of navigation channel. Each of the 9 projects have specific recreation facilities which attract millions of visitors annually. Total installed capacity of the projects is 914 MW which generate an average of 3,271,000 MWH annually. The power generated at the projects in operation during fiscal year 1993 was sold to 293 customers. Southeastern cannot furnish the entire capacity and energy needs of any of its customers. Capacity and energy requirements in excess of that available from Southeastern's resources must be acquired from other sources. Transmission Under the Notice of Issuance Final Power Marketing Policy, Cumberland System of Projects 58 FR 41762; August 5, 1993, 475 MW of capacity is made available to SEPA's customers outside the TVA region from the Cumberland Projects. Under TVA's firm commitment of transmission service provided for in the marketing agreement, TVA makes the amounts SEPA schedules (as much of the 475 MW as Southeastern indicates) available across the TVA system to the points selected by Southeastern on the periphery of the system. Under the Power Marketing policy, 405 MW is allocated to TVA for the benefit of 160 preference customers located on the TVA system. According to the marketing policy, TVA is to receive a monthly credit for delivering Cumberland system capacity and energy to SEPA's preference customers outside the TVA region. The credit is applied each month against charges to TVA for Cumberland River system capacity and energy provided TVA under the marketing agreement. Since 1984 this monthly credit has been $500,000 for 475 MW to be delivered to the periphery of the TVA system. This monthly credit is reduced for each MW of capacity that Southeastern is unable to sell to its customers outside the TVA area. Therefore, TVA's monthly credit has been reduced in the past by $80,600 for the 62 MW of capacity that SEPA has been unable to sell due to Kentucky Utilities Company's refusal to wheel such power to preference customers located in its area. TVA has received an annual credit of approximately $5,032,800 which will increase to $6,032,800 under the negotiated settlement which is described in this document. Current Rates Power from the Cumberland Basin Projects is presently sold under Wholesale Power Rate Schedules CBR&hyph;1&hyph;B, CSI&hyph;1&hyph;B, CEK&hyph;1&hyph;B, CC&hyph;1&hyph;C, CM&hyph;1&hyph;B, CK&hyph;1&hyph;B and CTV&hyph;1&hyph;B. Wholesale Power Rate Schedules CBR&hyph;1&hyph;B, CSI&hyph;1&hyph;B, CEK&hyph;1&hyph;B, CC&hyph;1&hyph;C, CM&hyph;1&hyph;B, CK&hyph;1&hyph;B and CTV&hyph;1&hyph;B were confirmed and approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by order issued September 16, 1989, for a period beginning July 1, 1989, and ending June 30, 1994. Discussion System Repayment An examination of Southeastern's system power repayment study prepared in May 1994 for the Cumberland Basin Projects reveals that with an annual revenue increase of $2,211,000, over the current revenues shown in the previous February 1994 repayment study, all system power costs are paid within their repayment life. Wholesale Power Rate Schedules CBR&hyph;1&hyph;C, CSI&hyph;1&hyph;C, CEK&hyph;1&hyph;C, CC&hyph;1&hyph;D, CM&hyph;1&hyph;C, CK&hyph;1&hyph;C and CTV&hyph;1&hyph;C are designed to produce adequate revenue to recover all system power costs on a timely basis. The Administrator of Southeastern has certified that the rates are consistent with the applicable law and that they are the lowest possible rates to customers consistent with sound business principles. Rate Design A repayment study was prepared using present contract rates. The repayment study demonstrated that rates were not high enough to repay all investments within their repayment life. Southeastern proposed a 6 percent rate increase that would meet repayment criteria. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) responded by increasing their transmission charge from $6 to $12.1 million. Southeastern held a Public Comment forum on March 10, 1994 to give opportunity for review and comment of proposed rates. Southeastern announced a revised rate increase of 24 percent for all customers. At the Public Comment Forum TVA asserted that the rate design used to calculate the 24 percent rate increase failed to compensate TVA for the use of its transmission facilities and that TVA customers were paying for transmission service twice. The 160 preference customers inside TVA are represented by the Tennessee Valley Public Power Association (TVPPA). The TVPPA is a service organization that, among other duties, negotiates rates with TVA. Power requirements of TVPPA members are provided exclusively by TVA. The TVPPA rates committee questioned the allocation of costs between capacity and energy. Previous rate filings allocated 40 percent of the generation costs to capacity and 60 percent to energy. The 40/60 allocation was criticized by TVA for allocating too much of the generation cost to energy. TVPPA felt that more of the cost should be placed on the capacity component of the rate and that the energy component should cover O&M. Customers outside the TVA system criticized Southeastern's Cumberland marketing plan for giving too much energy to TVA. After the public comment forum Southeastern met with TVA and the outside customers in an attempt to negotiate a settlement. Southeastern agreed to change the rate design. The new rate design eliminates the capacity/energy split and allocates the TVA transmission charge to the outside customers. All customers pay a capacity charge that includes 1500 hours energy with each kilowatt of capacity. Residual energy is sold to TVA with an additional energy charge. This eliminated the disagreement regarding the 40/60 split. Initially TVA proposed a $12.1 million transmission charge. Southeastern and TVA agreed to a negotiated settlement of $7 million per year for transmission. The settlement results in a 5.1% rate increase to TVA and a 9.5% increase to outside customers. This amount is reduced further by a $967,200 credit for power that is allocated, but not delivered to customers in the Kentucky Utilities service area. While neither TVA nor outside customers are completely satisfied with this settlement, Southeastern does not believe either will intervene against this rate. A copy of the Public Comments and Responses (Exhibit A&hyph;5 of the Rate Filing) is attached to clarify any issues that may not be fully addressed in the main body of this document.
