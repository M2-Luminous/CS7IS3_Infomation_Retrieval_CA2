Members of the Croatian delegation--[Mate] Granic, deputy prime minister and foreign minister, [Defense] Minister [Gojko] Susak, Minister (Jeren), Minister Jasic, and Vice Governor Rogic--also had talks with their counterparts and, as a whole, the talks with the highest-ranking representatives of the U.S. Government were fruitful and signified the creation of a basis for lasting, friendly cooperation between Croatia and the United States and for a partnership with the United States. I believe that you must know a great deal by now about the agreements that we have signed, the agreements on a Croat-Bosnian Muslim federation and the confederation of a federal Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. This event was described not only by our hosts but also by international diplomatic circles and the United Nations as an event of historical significance, as a watershed in the efforts to resolve the crisis in the former Yugoslavia, and as a resolute step toward peace. The talks I had at the United Nations with Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and all his aides and, in particular, my speech in the Security Council--which met with Madame Albright, the U.S. permanent representative to the United Nations in the chair--were for us of great significance. During the course of these talks with both the UN secretary general and his aides and, in particular, in the Security Council, it became evident that Croatia's stands were enjoying support from almost all the Security Council members -- Argentina, Brazil, New Zealand, Great Britain, Russia, the Czech Republic, and so forth. Like U.S. statesmen and all those we talked to, they also paid tribute to Croatia and its steadfast, determined, and sensible policy and reiterated their support for Croatia's territorial integrity. Both President Clinton and the Security Council members stated emphatically that, for their part, they would do their utmost to ensure that the UN Security Council resolutions were implemented and that the Croatian territories under the control of the peace forces and under Serb occupation--and it was the first time that U.S. representatives and the Security Council spoke in those terms--were reintegrated in Croatia's constitutional and legal system as soon as possible. Understandably, during the course of this, everyone was appealing for this to be done peacefully while, on their part, they will bring pressure to bear--by way of sanctions and in other ways--on Serbia and Yugoslavia so that they renounce occupation and accept a solution. During the course of these talks on the new mandate, I presented Croatia's views that we could accept, that we accepted, the extension of the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] mandate on the condition that some guidelines for the implementation of the Vance plan and UN Security Council resolutions were laid down. In this context, I drew attention to the importance of the implementation of Resolution 769 on border controls between Croatia and Serbia and between Croatia and those areas in Bosnia that are under the control of Serb forces and to the disarmament of Serb paramilitary formations. Without this, there can be no peace. I also drew attention to the beginning of the return of refugees and, lastly, the gradual restoration of infrastructure facilities, communications, oil pipelines, and power lines. In this context, we were met with understanding, so we can expect the UN Security Council to pass resolutions to this effect. They understandably may be gradual. Perhaps they may not include everything at once. It is essential, though, that we have a political climate today in which there is full understanding for Croatia's views. All in all, this visit has consolidated and reinforced Croatia's international position--both by way of our alliance, our partnership with the United States in its capacity as the superpower that plays the main role in modern international developments, and within the framework of the United Nations. I would like to stress, in particular, another important event-- the opening of the Croatian Embassy in Washington and my meeting with Croatian emigres--those emigres who made it possible with their hands, their financial contributions, and also with their work--for us to have one of the most beautiful buildings, one of the most beautiful embassies you can find there. Many people worked there. They came from distant parts of the United States--from New York, Cleveland, from other parts. They travelled for long hours and worked all day throughout their weekends so we would get a building that can make us proud indeed--we as the Croatian state, the Croatian people in the United States. This was a touching meeting with our people, both in our embassy and particularly later on at the opening ceremony at the embassy, which was attended by about 1,000 people. Some of our ministers could not get in because they arrived late. All in all, this is yet further proof of the unity of the homeland with emigrants from Croatia. The embassy was purchased by us in the homeland, but both money and work have been contributed by our emigrants. This is evidence both of the unity of the homeland and of emigrants from Croatia and of the pride of our Croatian people in being able to do something for their free, democratic Croatia. It was really nice to be in Washington and New York and return to the homeland with the feeling that we have strengthened the international position of Croatia and that the problems facing us can now be resolved more successfully, with fewer difficulties, and in a more resolute and rapid way. That is enough by way of an introduction. [Unidentified correspondent] [words indistinct] of Deutsche Welle. Mr. President, every time the UNPROFOR mandate expires, local rebel Serbs are ready for talks and agreements. It has been demonstrated that nothing has come of these agreements so far, and this time their representatives will come to Zagreb when the UNPROFOR mandate expires. Do you bring with you--after your trip to Washington and meeting with Butrus-Ghali--any guarantees that things will be different this time? What would be the very latest deadline for refugees to return to their homes? [Tudjman] Clearly, the current talks are taking place in different circumstances, in altered conditions with regard to the efforts to resolve the crisis in former Yugoslavia as a whole, in Bosnia, and--by implication--in Croatia. The guarantees you mentioned lie in the fact that top U.S. statesmen and--as I said before--those in the United Nations, have stated emphatically that they will support efforts to reintegrate the Croatian territories now under Serb occupation into our constitutional and legal system as soon as possible. Just like us, the world also wants this problem to be resolved in a peaceful way. That it would be better to resolve it in a peaceful way was made clear to us in Washington during a meeting with a group of Croatian people. There I met a man, a young man, with no arms -- I shall do everything to make sure that there are fewer of these victims. But, understandably, the opponent will soon realize that we are prepared to use all means available if we fail [to reduce the number of victims]." As for the return of the refugees, we would like this to happen instantly. I told the Security Council that we could not accept the proposal to extend the mandate for another year, another 12 months, but that we could accept it only for another six months--provided that the refugees be allowed to start returning to their homes during that time. This, of course, is a complicated process; however, with the support that we have in the world currently, I think we will be able to initiate and finalize it in a way that suits our people. This is not just an issue of Croatia's sovereignty and its territorial integrity, but it also reflects the justified desire of our refugees. They must begin preparing for it. Although we will try and avoid unwise steps, it is justified to expect the refugees to begin preparations to return and to let the world know that this is what they insist on and that it cannot be denied them--that it is a justified demand that must be met soon. [al-Isa] Mr. President. Nada al-Isa, Bosnia-Herzegovina Radio and TV and the state agency Bosnia Press. When are you going to visit Sarajevo? Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency President Izetbegovic said at a news conference yesterday that he had invited you. I would like to know whether you intend to accept the invitation and visit Sarajevo? Has world diplomacy--or Croatian and Bosnian diplomacy--performed a miracle? Rumor has it that Parliament Speaker Mesic was advised roughly two months ago not to pay a return visit to Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly President Miro Lazovic. [Tudjman] First of all, who did advise him? One should not enshroud this question in any kind of politicking. I have accepted Mr. Alija Izetbegovic's invitation, and I would like to visit Sarajevo and Bosnia-Herzegovina very soon. [Perasovic] Zeljko Perasovic, GLAS SLAVONIJE. Mr. President, when will the normalization of relations with the so-called Federal Republic of Yugoslavia take place? Or in other words, why has Veljko Knezevic [Serbian ambassador to Zagreb] not come to Zagreb yet? Do you have any information about this? [Tudjman] Yugoslavia's representative, Knezevic, has already been in Zagreb. Whether or not he has come back, I do not know. The process of normalization was initiated by the opening of representative offices. It will probably continue despite those who would like to thwart this normalization. There are, understandably, unreasonable people everywhere. I believe that the Croatian- Bosniak-Muslim agreement on creating a Croatian-Bosniak-Muslim federation and a confederation of a federal Bosnia with Croatia must have a positive influence on the Serbs, to the effect that they accept normalization, that they realize that if they do not accept it, that would be even more detrimental to them. Consequently, despite everything that stands in the way of this normalization, I believe that normalization will nevertheless take place. There will, of course, be difficulties. [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, do you anticipate the possibility of a peace agreement in the talks today with local Serbs in the Russian Embassy? [Tudjman] I do not understand. An agreement? [Unidentified correspondent] Do you anticipate the possibility of an agreement with local Serbs in the negotiations in the Russian Embassy today? Is there the possibility of an agreement with the local Serbs in the negotiations? [Tudjman] I have already answered that question. Regardless of the fact that there will be haggling and difficulties, I believe that neither the local Serbs nor Belgrade have any option but to accept the road to normalization. [Saracevic] Saracevic, German radio. Mr. President, according to the Croatian press, you said in an interview you gave to Reuters TV that Bosnian Serbs would be given the possibility of forming a confederation with Serbia if they were to enter the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation--if they join it. Were you given any indications to make this assumption? Does this mean that the state, or rather the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation, would be part of two confederations--of the Croat-Bosnian confederation with Croatia and Bosnian-Serb confederation with Serbia--if this does happen? Is this not slightly illogical, or does this mean the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a state? I am asking if this--and this is connected with the so-called Krajinas here in Croatia--would this mean changes in the borders? If this is the case, it would, in my view, threaten Croatia's borders as well. Can you elaborate? Thank you. [Tudjman] First, the two issues--the resolution of the Bosnian issue and of the Croatian territories under the control of the peace forces and under Serb occupation--have nothing in common in that the question of whether Bosnia-Herzegovina is resolved on a confederal or federal basis has no effect on how the issue of the Croatian territories is resolved. Three constituent nations are at issue in Bosnia-Herzegovina, while the Serb ethnic community in Croatia is a minority that is not entitled to the right to self-determination under any international conventions, regulations, or common law. These areas have always been part of Croatia and never part of Yugoslavia or Serbia. In other words, there is no need to link this issue, except in that it will also be affected by the military and political resolution of the crisis in former Yugoslavia. It will not, however, be affected in the sense that any potential changes in Bosnia-Herzegovina will inevitably imply similar changes in Croatia. I do not know what it is that you read and Reuters wrote but, in any case, I did not say that the situation could develop in such a way that the Serbs would be allowed to join a Bosniak Muslim-Croat federation and to set up a confederation with Serbia--or rather Yugoslavia--at the same time. On the contrary, I said that something of that kind was inconceivable, but that at some stage it could happen that the events unfold in the future in such a way that the part of the territory declared a so-called Srpska republic in Bosnia-Herzegovina--in other words, the part of the territory under Serb control--will be allowed to set up a confederation with Serbia, or rather Yugoslavia, and the Bosniak Muslim-Croat part with Croatia. In other words, this is not the case of a double or simultaneous confederation. Then there are speculations that, in some way, all this is an attempt to restore Yugoslavia. This is out of the question. There can be no solutions that are unacceptable to either the Croatian people in Bosnia or to the Croatian state. [Unidentified correspondent] Even well-intentioned friends abroad have been harboring suspicions regarding the implementation of this agreement signed in Washington, particularly because no time frame has been laid down for this transitional period. What is your view of the possibility of problems arising during the course of implementing this agreement? Do you know, or can you tell us in more detail, how long this transitional period will be? [Tudjman] Please tell us on whose behalf you are asking. Please always say who you represent. [Unidentified correspondent] I am a representative of the KUNA news agency of Kuwait. [Tudjman] I do not know what kind of speculation you are talking about. A transitional period is inevitable at any rate. How long it will be depends, understandably, on all kinds of things, so it is hard to predict anything. By all means, both our Western allies and ourselves will strive to make this period as short as possible. [Curic] Jozo Curic, Croatian TV. Mr. President, we have started talking about what follows next in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Can you tell us now about the military agreements that have been signed and about your reports on the situation on the ground? What is your view of further developments on the ground? Are we waiting for the Serbs to decide or not, or else can the Croats and Muslims already do something by themselves? [Tudjman] As you can see, the Croats and Muslims are already working on their own. The world finds it surprising that the cease-fire between the Muslims and Croats has taken effect, that there is no longer any warfare, that they are exchanging prisoners. Even we ourselves can be satisfied in a positive sense and accept these developments. Consequently, the consolidation of Croat-Muslim relations is underway. What lies ahead for them as well as for international factors is to persuade the Serbs to accept a solution that would also bring about an end to the war and a political solution. [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, Beic, Croatian Radio. As far as your visit to the UN headquarters, and particularly your presence at the session of the UN Security Council, is concerned, you pointed out on behalf of Croatia several essential elements for the continuation of UNPROFOR's mandate. One of these essential elements is the deployment of UNPROFOR troops along Croatia's internationally recognized borders. I would like to know what the UN Security Council's answer is, particularly regarding the future mandate and the next term. How does the UN Security Council view this proposition of yours? Thank you. [Tudjman] I first made this demand in talks with the UN secretary general and his aides; they showed understanding and promised to review this demand, likewise the Security Council. Naturally, this demand includes authorizations to UNPROFOR in order for them to implement it. On my part, I voiced the opinion that there was no need to boost UNPROFOR's numerical strength but that its activities should be redirected towards controlling points that can be controlled, that is, the border between Croatia and Serbia on the Danube and in eastern Slavonia, in Srijem and along the border with Bosnia. I also pointed out that NATO's air support ought to be forthcoming if these forces are threatened or prevented from controlling these borders. This will be examined and the Security Council will decide on the new mandate. As we now have a favorable political climate, this is of great importance for resolving not only the UN-protected areas but the crisis in former Yugoslavia as a whole, and we expect the Security Council to be responsive in determining the new mandate and to take steps that would empower UNPROFOR to implement the Vance plan and all Security Council resolutions, especially resolution 769 concerning border control, and 871 which is all-encompassing. [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, Mate [name indistinct] of VECERNJI LIST. Reporting on the meeting at the Russian Embassy in Zagreb, Belgrade Radio said this morning that the Western powers have agreed in principle that Baranja should be given to Serbia in exchange for Krajina and peace. What could you tell us about this? [Tudjman, laughing] Agreement in principle, whose agreement in principle? Well, you know that people sometimes tend to make plans without consulting those concerned, in any case, even dreaming that we might agree to such negotiations is out of the question. As far as the talks at the Russian Embassy go, in addition to Russian representatives I believe that U.S. representatives will also be taking part, at my proposal. [Unidentified correspondent] [name indistinct] of VJESNIK. Mr. President, has there been any mention in the Pentagon about Croatia's joining NATO, and will Croatia be granting NATO certain locations -- Vis and Lastovo, for instance -- for use as military bases? [Tudjman] Good God, would you like to discuss military secrets here? [laughs] Understandably, the talks centered on all issues of interest to Croatia and of interest to our collocutors. Croatia will receive support for access to the Partnership for Peace, while all the rest is a question of mutual interest and, as I said -- military secrets -- but what is important is this: Croatia needs allies and we have found them, we have them. And Croatia, as it is, is of interest to the most important international factors, including the United States. This is what we are basing our policy on. This is exactly what we have achieved with our consistent policy -- we now have allies and these allies need Croatia, they count on it. They count on it not only in the quest for peace but also in the establishment of the new international order in the region of former Yugoslavia and in southeast Europe. [Ramljak] Olga Ramljak, SLOBODNA DALMACIJA. At the beginning you mentioned unity between the Croatian homeland and the diaspora. In the meantime, while the agreements were being signed in Washington, the media reported on demands from the top state and party level for the resignation of Defense Minister Gojko Susak because he allegedly disagrees with this policy, or else because there is suspicion that he will not implement it correctly. Today, we have a civil initiative, a public protest following the arrival of Serb negotiators in Zagreb, under the slogan: We do not want to negotiate with war criminals. What is your comment on these cases in view of your statement that we will now be resolving our problems quicker and more resolutely? [Tudjman] We have thus seized opportunities to resolve them quicker and more resolutely [as heard]. The demands that Minister Susak should be sacked did not come from the top state level but from individuals, from politicking schemers. These demands will be subject to political assessments and, understandably, they will not change the state policy. Being at the helm of such an important ministry, Minister Susak had my full trust. Not only did he enjoy trust in his leadership of the Defense Ministry but also amid Croatia's precarious position when we had to extend our support to the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina, first against the Serb aggressor so we could secure the survival of people there [sentence as heard]. Consequently, these demands can be raised by those who disagreed with this policy or those who are doing this for personal reasons. Not only are there always politicking schemers in politics but there are also people who have different views on some individual issues or different demands. Everything, however, eventually fits in its place. As regards the protest you mentioned, I do not know about it. I can imagine there are such people. One should not talk to war criminals provided they were not there, or if we could bring them to justice or send them to the moon, so they would not exist [as heard]. Even representatives of the European Union [EU], official representatives of the EU and official representatives of the largest European powers, and even the main superpower, the United States, negotiate with them. Mr. Redman, President Clinton's personal special envoy, visited not only Zagreb but Belgrade too. It is not only representatives of Russia who talk to them but those of the United States and Europe, too. Consequently, we too are forced to talk. Moreover, we are willing to talk so as not to suffer further casualties. It is easy to be bellicose and say -- no talks. Let those people identify themselves so they can see, even before I started my journey there were 11 fatalities and some 30 wounded in one of Croatia's battlefields. We are not going to play either with human lives or with Croatia's interests because of someone's insanity. I understand the rage of our people, as I share it too. But policies are governed by reason as well as by heart. Understandably, this is always the case, in history and at the end of all wars and during wars, one talks to one's opponents. We are in conflict with them and we should get out of this. Consequently, this is not simply some kind of will of ours or our weakness but, if you will, our strength as well, as a result or consequence of the overall international circumstances in the period from the collapse of Yugoslavia to this crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina and, understandably, the problem of Croatia's areas under Serb occupation and UNPROFOR protection [sentence as heard]. So, we will continue talking for as long as there is any chance. We have stressed and continue to stress that we have not given up the ultimate means if the talks fail. But then we have to have the support, to secure the support of the international circles and forces which are active in international organizations and have a decisive role in creating current international order. [Skugor-Hrncevic] Smiljana Skugor-Hrncevic, HINA. Mr. President, during your visit to Washington another agreement was signed which was overshadowed by the political agreements. This is an agreement between Croatia and the United States on scientific and technical cooperation. Can you tell us a bit more about this agreement? Are there any concrete indications regarding aid and cooperation? [Tudjman] The agreement on scientific and technical cooperation is one of the most important agreements. The amount available for Fulbright scholarships has already been doubled. Work is being done to extend cooperation into other fields. This is one of the agreements to be signed in various other fields [as heard]. [Unidentified correspondent] [name indistinct] DANAS. Mr. President, it is being rumored that some government ministers will be replaced. Is it only a government reshuffle or is Premier Valentic to leave? Can you say something about this? [Tudjman] There will be no government reshuffle.
