In this way Hong Kong will be able to ensure its prosperity and stability; otherwise, if Hong Kong and the mainland are against each other and confront each other, "then, I think, Hong Kong will be finished and will have no future!" he said. After saying this he disclosed: "President Jiang Zemin did mention this point when he met with the people from the (Hong Kong) Federation of Trade Unions recently." Talking about what Hong Kong should do to give full play to its own advantages, Lu Ping told a visiting group from the Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong: Now Hong Kong enjoys a very great advantage, that is, the opportunity offered by the development of the cities in mainland China and the reform and opening up of the mainland. Hong Kong's position as a city "with the mainland behind and Southeast Asia in front" is a very big advantage which the three other little dragons of Asia do not possess. In addition, as the China mainland is carrying on the economic opening up and reform, China's economy will be increasingly prosperous. This situation is very favorable to Hong Kong. He further pointed out: "In my opinion, therefore, Hong Kong should consciously make use of this favorable situation and give full play to this advantage. Only in this way can Hong Kong retain prosperity." For this reason, "Hong Kong should maintain a relationship of mutual support, mutual coordination, and mutual cooperation with the China mainland, rather than a relationship of confrontation, antagonism, and repulsion. If the latter scenario takes place, that is, the relationship between Hong Kong and the China mainland becomes a mutually repulsive and mutually confrontational one then, I think, Hong Kong will be finished and will have no future! President Jiang Zemin did mention this point when he met with the people from the Federation of Trade Unions today. We hope more Hong Kong people will be aware of this." He added that China hopes Hong Kong will be able to keep its "economic superiority" and give full play to its economic role. He said he does not want to see Hong Kong become a "political city." The so-called "political city," he said, means a Hong Kong being used to exert political influence on the mainland. He reiterated that he did not mean that Hong Kong people should be indifferent to politics but that Hong Kong should first of all give full play to its economic superiority. He warned that "Hong Kong will have no future if it is turned into a political city and is used to exert political influence on the mainland." He stressed that Hong Kong and the China mainland "should maintain a relationship of cooperation and mutual support." "Only in this way will Hong Kong be able to give full play to its role and be assured of prosperity and stability." Commenting on the relationship between Hong Kong and Shanghai in the 21st century regarding economic development, Lu Ping said: The two cities will play their own roles and each will make different contributions but they can complement and support each other. Therefore, it will not be a case of Shanghai replacing Hong Kong. He expressed his hope that Hong Kong compatriots would realize that the state is now practicing a very, very special policy toward Hong Kong, therefore Hong Kong people should give play to their role and make greater contributions in this respect. He added that Hong Kong's future role does not lie in its limited financial contributions to the state but in its status as a window and bridge linking the country with the outside world.
