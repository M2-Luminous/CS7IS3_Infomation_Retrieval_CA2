Simplified Jurisdictional Analysis The portion of the jurisdictional determination under which governments comment on tribal jurisdiction will be substantially altered under this Rule. These changes are outlined below. Comments will no longer be sought from ``appropriate governmental entities'' with regard to tribal grant applications. The Agency now has extensive experience awarding grants to tribes and is capable of evaluating tribal grant applications to ensure that a tribe has adequate jurisdiction to receive grants. A separate ``TAS'' jurisdictional review is not needed to verify that a tribe meets the statutory jurisdictional requirement. This change will have the effect only of eliminating duplicative requirements. Finally, the Agency notes that certain issues concerning tribal jurisdiction may be relevant to a tribe's authority to conduct activities. For example, if a tribe and a state or another tribe disagree as to the boundary of a particular tribe's reservation, each time the tribe seeks to assert authority over the disputed area, the dispute will recur. The Agency recognizes that its determinations regarding tribal jurisdiction apply only to activities to be carried out within the scope of the grant. However, it also believes that, once it makes a jurisdictional determination in response to a tribal application regarding any EPA program, it will ordinarily make the same determination for other programs unless a subsequent application raises different legal issues. Thus, for example, once the Agency has arrived at a position concerning a boundary dispute, it will not alter that position in the absence of significant new factual or legal information. Under the new approval process, as under the old, the Agency will continue to retain authority to limit its approval of a tribal application to those land areas where the tribe has demonstrated jurisdiction. This would allow EPA to approve the portion of a tribal application covering certain areas, while withholding approval of the portion of an application addressing those land areas where tribal authority has not been satisfactorily established. See, e.g., 53 FR 37395, 37402 (September 26, 1988) (SDWA); 54 FR 14353, 14355 (April 11, 1989) (Clean Water Act Grants); 54 FR 39097, 39102 (September 12, 1989) (Clean Water Act Water Quality Standards); 58 FR 8171, 8176 (February 11, 1993) (Clean Water Act section 404); 58 FR 67966, 67972 (Clean Water Act NPDES) (December 22, 1993). 2. Capability EPA must continue to make a separate determination of tribal capability for each program for which it approves a tribe. However, the Safe Drinking Water Act, Water Quality Standards, and section 404 regulations would be amended to conform to the CWA grant regulations, which do not specifically prescribe the material a tribe must submit to establish capability. Ordinarily, the inquiry EPA will make into the capability of any applicant, tribal or state, for a grant or program approval would be sufficient to enable the Agency to determine whether a tribe meets the statutory capability requirement. See, e.g., 40 CFR part 31 (grant regulations applicable to states and tribes); 40 CFR 142.3 (Public Water System primary enforcement responsibility requirements at parts 141, 142 apply to tribes); 145.1(h) (Underground Injection Control requirements of parts 124, 144, 145, and 146 that apply to states generally apply to tribes). Nevertheless, EPA may request that the tribe provide a narrative statement or other documents showing that the tribe is capable of administering the program for which it is seeking approval. In evaluating tribal capability, EPA will consider: (1) The tribe's previous management experience; (2) existing environmental or public health programs administered by the tribe; (3) the mechanisms in place for carrying out the executive, legislative and judicial functions of the tribal government; (4) the relationship between regulated entities and the administrative agency of the tribal government which will be the regulator; and (5) the technical and administrative capabilities of the staff to administer and manage the program. EPA recognizes that certain tribes may not have substantial experience administering environmental programs; a lack of such experience will not preclude a tribe from demonstrating capability, so long as it shows that it has the necessary management and technical and related skills or submits a plan describing how it will acquire those skills.
