In the words of Russian Defense Minister, these documents reflect the sides' intention to develop broader cooperation and determine the main events within the framework of ties between the two countries' military departments in 1994-95. Pavel Grachev told journalists after the documents were signed that he had received an invitation from his South Korean counterpart to visit the Republic of Korea in 1995. We hope, said the Russian defense minister, to sign additional documents there on closer cooperation, perhaps in the military-technical sphere. He did not rule out the possibility of an agreement on preventing various kinds of unauthorized military actions being signed in Seoul.
