It became clear that the new public administration is willing to implement a moral revolution and that crimes will not go unpunished, and thus, many people could be investigated after the current government completes its term. President Reina presented seven ministers in the company of National Congress President Carlos Flores, former President Jose Azcona, and banker Jorge Bueso Arias. The new cabinet consists of Efrain Moncada Silvia, government and justice minister; General Reynaldo Andino Flores, national defense and public security minister; Cecilio Zavala Mendez, labor and social welfare minister; Zenobia Rodas de Leon Gomez, public education minister; German Aparicio, communications and public works minister; and Rodolfo Pastor Fasquelle, culture and tourism minister. Reina announced that PNH member Carlos Medina, minister of the recently created Environment Ministry, will stay in that post. The president also announced the following will serve as ministers without portfolio: Guillermo Bueso as coordinator of the economic cabinet; Dante Ramirez as coordinator of Central American integration issues; and Jorge Bueso Arias as coordinator of advisory issues. To complete his team, Reina confirmed the following nominees: Ernesto Paz Aguilar, foreign minister; Delmer Urbizo Panting, economy and commerce minister; Juan Ferrera, finance and public credit minister; Guillermo Molina Chocano, coordination, budget, and planning (Secplan) minister; Enrique Samayoa, public health minister; and Ramon Villeda Bermudez, natural resources minister. As for the decentralized institutions, he only presented Ubodoro Arriaga Ireheta, Hugo Noe Pino, who was ratified as president of the Central Bank of Honduras (BCH), and Lucio Izaguirre, as his private secretary. [sentence as published] The Day Is Not Far Away Reina said he fulfilled his promise to establish an integration government by appointing Juan Ferrera as finance minister and Carlos Medina as environment minister. The two are PNH members. When asked about the nomination of Andino Flores as defense minister, the president said that in the future a civilian will occupy that post, "and I have already discussed this with the Army High Command, which will soon be under my leadership as commander of the Armed Forces." "The day is not far away for the appointment of a civilian in that post," Reina said. Two days before his installation, the president said other positions at decentralized institutions will be announced in due time. Reina also explained that later on he will be providing details concerning the press minister and that there will be no presidency minister. These are the only two ministries that have not been presented. He explained that his brother, Mario Reina Idiaquez, will be in the Presidency Office, but he will not bear the title of presidency minister. Reina said upon return from the United States that he has tried to spread the idea that America and the world are headed for a convergence and that the most important issue at the turn of the century will be the agenda shared throughout the continent by democrats. Reina stressed the "huge responsibility" of fulfilling the campaign promise of a moral revolution, which will be faced by himself and the people who will join him in the new government. Reina explained during a news conference that as president-elect, as the head of the Central Executive Council [Consejo Central Ejecutivo] and as a citizen, he had suggested the names of possible Supreme Court justices to the deputies, whose duty it is to elect that body. Although he made it clear that he knows the deputies alone have the final word, he said: "I urge my friends to support these candidates. I presented the names to them at a meeting, and I cannot disclose them, because I do not want any interference regarding the respect the executive branch should maintain for the legislative and judicial branches." "What I would never tolerate is a Supreme Court that does not meet the requirements for a moral revolution. I would never tolerate that," he said. Concerning economic measures, Reina said he will stick to his decision against additional taxes, which, he said, is a decision only he can make and which must not be based on suggestions or outside pressures from anyone. Thus, he expects to maintain safe and sound his desire to carry out a moral revolution. Reina confirmed that one of the problems with which his government must deal is the fact that the international organizations have declared the country ineligible for loans, but Hondurans "will face these difficulties united, with a united party and a united people." Although flattering figures have been mentioned during Rafael Leonardo Callejas' government, Reina said "surprising figures are gradually emerging, but I have entrusted the economic cabinet to the best people I could find, and it is up to them and to all of us to deal with the crisis." One of Reina's strongest campaign promises was the guarantee that he would combat corruption, which he said "would not be easy." In view of this, he has asked every Honduran to get a full understanding of the Ethics Code which will be published, "because if these challenges are not met, it will be impossible to help the people." Reina added that he invited the former presidential precandidates to yesterday's meeting so that they could express their views regarding the resolution, although that is the president's duty. Asked why he only appointed one woman to a key position, Reina said women will be appointed to other important posts and that proof of this is that there are many female mayors, although there will be no battle between the sexes. A cabinet is not for four years, Reina said, and women may be appointed if any of the current nominees fail; therefore, there is not a shred of prejudice in the appointments.
