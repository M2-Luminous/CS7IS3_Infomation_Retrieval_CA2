Therefore, the first question is quite simple: How many times have you been shot at? [Vectirans] I remember the last time quite well. It was New Year's. My brother-in-law. With a champagne cork. But, seriously, there have been critical situations, of course. I served in the militia; in the Internal Affairs Ministry my work was connected with examining criminal activity at various levels. I have been shot at, but, thank God, never been hit. [NEATKARIGA CINA] What is the feeling at that moment, when the bullet goes past? [Vectirans] It is, of course, not pleasant. I heard the most buzzing bullets in January of '91. Back then I was carrying out the duties of the deputy commander of the government guard service. In carrying out my responsibilities there occured a contact with OMON troops. When the takeover of the Internal Affairs Ministry occured I found myself at the Cabinet of Ministers building. From there I repeatedly went to ministry building to evaluate the situation and to resolve it. Bullets whined past; but I did not act like a hero, either in the classical nor in any different sense, when I did what I had to do, and that's all. [NEATKARIGA CINA] But you are not like the "Brave Soldier Shweek?" [Vectirans] Certainly not, although I like very much this Haek character. I have found that book again, so that I could read it again. It often occurs to me that a colonel in the Latvian army is injured more than in the Soviet times, being a Soviet officer. [NEATKARIGA CINA] In the days of the barricades [January 1991 and later] someone wrote on the Riga railway station platform, in Russian: Let's Hang Vectirans! [Vectirans] Ha! I guess those who wrote it didn't do as well with the rope! Of course, my connection to the events of the time of Awakening was close. Those years in my life are the brightest and remain best in my memory. Of course I am not thinking about my personal life, since the birth of my second daughter in '89 also was a huge event in my life; as a rank and file member of the Popular Front I obeyed my leader, Dainis Ivans, in his appeal to enrich Latvian families. Yes, time of Awakening was rich in events. We began to organize volunteer police formations in the self-defense units. That functioned successfully and for some time, causing alarm on the side of the imperial defenders. [NEATKARIGA CINA] The public seems to know you well, but they would certainly like to know even more. [Vectirans] I was born in '53. October. In a good time, after the death of the despot Stalin. My generation must work off the difficulties of that time, to develop Latvia into a powerful country. I was born in Zemgale, in the famous port city of Jaunjelgava, into a provincial intelligentsia family. I studied there until I turned 18, then I enrolled in the army college, but due to circumstances I ended up in active military service. I served in the USSR Internal Affairs Ministry's special motorized militia unit. I ended my service in Riga as a sergeant, group commander. Then there was work in the ranks of the Internal Affairs Ministry posts, teaching in the militia school and in the USSR Internal Affairs Ministry school in Lviv. I also finished at the Higher School of the Internal Affairs Ministry. Various promotions, courses, also highest academics in Kiev. Among other things, I arrived in Ukraine at the end of May '90, so from a country that had declared its independence from the USSR. I was accepted with understanding, well-treated, perhaps also because of my personal characteristics, as my country's representatives, as a Latvian officer. [NEATKARIGA CINA] We have it on good authority that you have in your house an historical sword and that your ancestors were policemen. [Vectirans] I have many swords, but the one to which you are referring is unique. It belonged to one of our relatives, a cavalryman who was awarded the Order of Lacplesis, third class. He managed to save himself from the repressions, perhaps because he de-mobilized from the army in '33. I have read in his documents, by the way, that Latvian officers in the Tsar's army declared their support for the establishment of the Latvian state. And these officers wore a ribbon in the colors of the flag of Latvia on their uniforms, thereby publicly displaying their stand. To join the ranks of the Latvian army, an affadavit from several colleagues in the service was required, attesting to the person's having demonstrated a nationalist orientation. (I, too, when I assumed the post of First Police Battalion commander, was strongly vetted in a meeting; they took into account sponsor affadavits, although I was the Internal Affairs Ministry's senior cadre officer with 17 years of service.) [NEATKARIGA CINA] How did your path as a Popular Fronter start? [Vectirans] I participated in meetings and the like, along with my wife and oldest daughter. I wanted to be together with my people, to feel the oneness. [NEATKARIGA CINA] Did you arrive as a private person or as an officer? [Vectirans] Back then I was an Internal Affairs service officer and the uniform was military: the uniform of a USSR army officer. It was just by accident that I did not have to stand in the human chain at the Monument of Freedom and interfere with the right of the Latvian people to honor our most sacred symbol. For that I am thankful to fate, for I cannot even imagine how much strength it would have required within me to fail to carry out the order of the commander of the day. [NEATKARIGA CINA] Yes, it was a time when many militiamen had a moment to examine their consciences. [Vectirans] Many militia workers have told me about their feelings at that time. But many carried out their duties at the Monument of Freedom back then with great joy. But we all will have our time to be sifted into history's granaries and we each will receive our judgment. My daughter was a student in the nineth grade in the First High School of Jelgava, and I joined the Popular Front group at this school, with the teachers. My comrades in the service knew little of this. But my stand was clear to them. [NEATKARIGA CINA] Have you met with your service comrades from that time? [Vectirans] My current service duties are such that I do have the opportunity to meet former, I do not want to call them all comrades, but more often colleagues. We understand one another, and we do not have many disagreements, if we are not talking about the most important things. [NEATKARIGA CINA] Perhaps you have arrested some of them, the former ones. [Vectirans] Only Parmyonov was arrested and tried. There is not a single document which at least analyzes the activities of those Internal Affairs Ministry workers who were involved in supporting the imperial system, their actions, inactions or offered assistance in the dramatic events of that time, when the existence of the Latvian state was decided. [NEATKARIGA CINA] But still, you as Security Agency leader have such a balance, of course? [Vectirans] Hmmm. Many think that the Security Agency operates like the one-time KGB, but that is not so. Our functions include protection of the highest officials, receiving foreign delegations and guaranteeing their security, guarding embassies and other nationally significant objects, and, of course, operational activities to ensure all of that. But, if you refer in your question to activities against elements, organizations hostile to the Latvian state, then I can say that there are no specific national policies on this issue. There is completely uncoordinated information collection by various state organizations. [NEATKARIGA CINA] How was it that the Internal Affairs Ministry was unable to locate Mr. Rucs, while your Security Agency men did so without a problem? [Vectirans] There was nothing illusory or abstract in that situation. Everyone acted much more simply and prosaically than perhaps might be imagined, but not simply. [NEATKARIGA CINA] Was [Internal Affairs Minister] Girts Kristovskis jealous of you for such a turn of events? [Vectirans] I think that Girts is not trampled down by this character flaw common among some men. And in this event there was no basis for jealousy. We joined the operation at the direction of the President, but the successful conclusion was determined by both the Agency's specific character and by the prevalence of good contacts with all organizations. [NEATKARIGA CINA] I once read this conclusion in the history of assassination attempts: in the de Gaulle era French security agency workers trained in America, but remained faithful to their system and boasted that they guarded de Gaulle, but not the American Kennedy. Where are your workers trained? What do your people gather from international experience? [Vectirans] We are constantly improving ourselves. I, too, even though I have a degree with the highest legal education and experience working in the Internal Affairs Ministry. I have studied in many courses which were organized at the request of our government by foreign specialists, but we must continue to improve our model. [NEATKARIGA CINA] You were also trained in America. How did the American service and police differ? [Vectirans] We acquired experience in a similar service, which makes arrangements for national leaders, the top official, organizing a representative task. These jobs, you can say, have a visible part that looks similar, two or three strapping men walking with the person being guarded, but of course there is a whole complex range of tasks being performed, which are carried out by other particular agencies. The experiences I acquired in America come in handy. [NEATKARIGA CINA] Those who have seen the famous film "Bodyguard" for the first time completely understand how complicated this profession is. [Vectirans] And they were also convinced of how unsuccessful it is, if it is not connected with the other services. The success or lack of success in guarding people is always directly dependent on the other security agencies. [NEATKARIGA CINA] Your's are strong? [Vectirans] Developed, but not to the point that we could say that in this area nothing more needs to be done. The one-time KGB carried out their job well and effectively enough. The Soviet era personal protection system was only a small part of the totalitarian regime's system, which ensured its existence. Now a few journalists wonder why nothing was seen before, but now suddenly it is seen! We must remember that that system carried out complete scrutiny and control of society, both spectators and the composition of people's groups were given out in doses. Even in May Day demonstrations marchers were specially selected from factories. My wife told me that at VEF they consciensciously selected marchers. Those who did not carry out this task were not permitted at the demonstrations the next time. Yes, the KGB, which in principle managed public opinion, actively operated in factories and the larger enterprises. [NEATKARIGA CINA] Does such a system also operate now? [Vectirans] No. But still, caution is necessary. We actively cooperate with government institutions with similar functions, with the Internal Affairs and Defense ministries, with the Home Guard. The successful conclusion to the Pope's visit was attributable to our agency, the aforementioned department, of all the country and, I will not be particularly bashful if I mention to a certain extent also my modest contribution. The stress of preparing for that was terrific, a big job was carried out, and everything, with the Lord's help, succeeded as befitting, not to mention that the level of threat was sufficient. That is proof that the country's security system is functioning. [NEATKARIGA CINA] Our photographers were not satisfied with being permitted to photograph the Pope only from a great distance. That was not just the caprice of the press this time; this visit was a distinguished event in Latvian history. [Vectirans] Mmm, yes. There will always be someone who is dissatisfied, including journalists. We tried to take into account their wishes also, of course, for the closer they got to the Pope, the closer they wanted to get. [NEATKARIGA CINA] The successful security for the Pope's visit truly was your agency's most satisfying hour. Afterwords the press reported that Vectirans was walking around with a smile on his face. But how did you yourself perceive the arrival of such a high-ranking person? [Vectirans] The groundwork was done very carefully, the stress is considerable, but there is satisfaction after successful visits. The Pope's visit was unique, leaving me with a deep personal impression. Finding myself next to the Holy Father, that was a unique event for me. [NEATKARIGA CINA] What are your contacts with those security agencies which escort high-ranking officials here? Psychological, practical? [Vectirans] In August '91, after the Putsch events, when Russian Federation leader Yeltsin found himself in Latvia, and that was kept secret, our Security Agency also participated in protecting him. The situation had not yet been completely resolved, and therefore was stressful; we were in full combat readiness. Yeltsin's bodyguards were significantly better equipped than we were. We adopted their recommendations in a business-like way. We have always had collegial relations with our brothers-in-arms, although, for instance, the Americans really have a lot to be proud of (we, too, have no shortage of pride, either), a high level of professionalism, sufficient autonomy to resolve our questions. [NEATKARIGA CINA] Did you communicate in English? [Vectirans] Yes, quite successfully, using a translator. [NEATKARIGA CINA] In Latvia arguments have flashed up over independence, subordination, and cooperation, also regarding the Security Agency. How independent are you? To whom are you subordinated? With whom do you cooperate? How much are you permitted to say about all that? Also about those altogether behind-the-scenes brawls? [Vectirans] I would say that real battles happen, not just brawls! I probably do not even know all of it, but that is a matter for the politicians who must after all heed our professional viewpoints to develop a model appropriate to Latvia. The Security Agency grew out of the First Police Battalion, which appeared as part of the Internal Affairs Ministry and was the first national armed organization. In the time of Awakening it was a strikingly national unit. During the August Putsch the battalion succeeded in escaping physical losses (but not material ones), maintained itself as an organizatio and developed; the Supreme Council's guard service was established, and autonomous, independent organization which later was transformed into the Security Agency. We are a constituent part of the National Armed Forces. [NEATKARIGA CINA] Who is your commander? [Vectirans] The Security Agency is subordinated to the President of Latvia as the Commander in Chief of the National Armed Forces. We actively cooperate with the other organizations. Yes, but rumors the reorganization of the Security Agency are not without basis. Once the Internal Affairs Ministry was viewed as stagnant and a program was worked out to reorganize it. The Security Agency needed to secure a bloc more connected to state sovereignty, but the Internal Affairs Ministry was in its direct competence, the battle against crime and so forth. Now we, who have proven by our actions that we are powers faithful to the Latvian state are being reformed. Still, reforms are necessary in all of the system. [NEATKARIGA CINA] Perhaps because you are working too well? [Vectirans] If it were only so, then I could answer the question differently. The classical variant has been established: the Internal Affairs Ministry, the Defense Ministry, the Home Guard (a new organization, which they may also grab hold of and liquidate soon?). The job is done energetically. Security Police are foreseen within the Internal Affairs Ministry. All that's left is to wish them well in actively working to protect Latvia's sovereignty! [NEATKARIGA CINA] But still, what is your view of the way in which we should move in this instance? [Vectirans] The country must have permanent service with the task of carrying out a complex variety of tasks, including special ones, to guard the independence of the state of Latvia, the people's freedom. These last words must be the guiding motto of this service. Our organization's work could be included within this complex. In no way can it be found within the Internal Affairs Ministry, at least in the near term. It [the Internal Affairs Minstry] already now carries on operations, inquiries and investigations inside and outside the country's territory; it has prisons and its own army subordinated to it. All that it is missing is its own judiciary, and then it would be a complete model of Stalin's Security Ministry. That would be dangerouis to the Republic of Latvia, to the renewal of democracy. I have already expressed my ideas to the President, the Prime Minister, and the Chairman of the Saeima. We must bring into order the penal (prisons) system and subordinate it to the Justice Ministry, investigations to the Procuracy and the financial police to the Finance Ministry, to decentralize powers of repression. The powers of repression are particularly unacceptable if the Internal Affairs Ministry is led by politicians, who, whether they want to or not, more or less, will be led by their party interests. [NEATKARIGA CINA] You were one of those who arrested [Communist Party Secretary Alfreds] Rubiks after the Putsch, placing irons on his arms... [Vectirans] No, I determined that, evaluating the situation as a professional, that it was not necessary to place this person in irons. [NEATKARIGA CINA] Among other things the Generals were complaining that the irons placed on Mr. Rucs scraped his upper arms. [Vectirans] Mr. Rucs is a leader in the civilian administrator and perhaps he has different rules and regulations than we soldiers. Yes, but regarding the arrest of Rubiks I can tell you plainly only that I cannot say much, because the legal proceedings are continuing and I have not yet given my testimony. [NEATKARIGA CINA] It is clear how you two met on that August day, but at least tell us about how you parted back then! [Vectirans] Rather lyrically. Yes, there were certain emotions and not negative ones alone. That day was very turbulent overall. While we were still in the former [Communist] party central committee building, we received information that OMON was preparing to arrive, to liberate the building and those arrested in it. We arrested Rubiks are were preparing to leave in a mostly unknown direction. Even I had in mind a certain place, but at the last moment we ended up in another. In addition, it was 23 August, a very significant day to the Latvian people [anniversary of the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact]. I also wanted to be together with everyone elst at the Monument of Freedom, and we were hurrying. There were several incidents. Yes, perhaps some day I will be able to talk about it all more deeply. [NEATKARIGA CINA] In the Ulmanis era, it turned out that Latvia was a diplomatic and spying center. Are there any espionage services operating? Is the government able to control it at all? It sometimes seems that the Russian service operates completely in the open. [Vectirans] I must be circumspect in what a I say. In general I could say this: Questions must be resolved more quickly about the withdrawal of the Russian army in planned steps, for that is connected with handing over certain positions (in a secret way) in the tossed-off territory. If we can do it that way, then why not withdraw? Some sort of planning can be seen. Would positions be sufficiently strengthened? There is food for thought here. [NEATKARIGA CINA] Could a secret police be established in Latvia? [Vectirans] In the era of Latvia there were the secret police, the political administration and the security police. Three different names, but in reality the Internal Affairs Ministry political administration. Among other things I can say that the are no [former] Chekhists working in the political administration of Latvia. [NEATKARIGA CINA] Was Fridriksons a shining personality? [Vectirans] Other countries used the fruits of his labors. His workers were in other institutions, carrying out collosal work. I think that Latvia must remember its patriots, such as these Fridriksons people. The practice of the special services of other countries is to utilize professionals for the benefit of the state. And done correctly. Latvia is not so rich to throw around professionals. Another thing, I do not think that, for instance, Dzerzhinsky's students would operate in the Latvian political adminstration. Please, God, save us from Dzerzhinsky's grandchildren working in our security police! [NEATKARIGA CINA] How is it with the selection of personnel? What are the principles for selection? How does one become persuaded that such grandchildren of Dzerzhinsky will not be able to infiltrate? Can you think about that and sleep peacefully at night? [Vectirans] I am not tormented by sleeplessness; the agency has accustomed me to sleeping in any manner. But Latvia is not to the point where Vectirans can sleep peacefully. The first and most important criterion for choosing personnel is loyalty to the Latvian state. Also professional fitness and preparation, of course, but the determining factor is whether this person is a Latvian patriot. In my opinion the approach to it is still overly superficial, formal. Although for me as a soldier, the survival of the Latvian state, speaking without particular emotion, is a matter of honor. [NEATKARIGA CINA] In selecting employees have you sometimes made mistakes? [Vectirans] Unfortunately, yes. [NEATKARIGA CINA] What do you do with them? Deport them? [Vectirans] There are various methods. Generally I am led by the interests of the agency and the demands of the situation, based on the law. [NEATKARIGA CINA] What do you do in instances of imcompatiblity? [Vectirans] That has happened and it is a specific circumstance. The mutual compatibility of people in carrying out the agency's duties is very important. If that is missing then the problem must be resolved in an ethically correct way. Everyone must understand that protection is not necessary just for its own sake, but because the bodyguard carries out duties important to the state and our duty is to secure them, correctly and inconspicuously. [NEATKARIGA CINA] There are many military units in Riga and every company has its own security service. The rackets are operating. The disorder in this area appears dangerous. Are you on top of the situation? [Vectirans] Being concerned with personal protection, companies hope that they will thereby be guaranteed security. But personal protection does not guarantee that, if there is no security and order in the country, if every citizen's security is not guaranteed. We cannot depend on the successes of individual guards until the state ensures law and order. [NEATKARIGA CINA] What are you by nature: an optimist or a pessimist? [Vectirans] It is a very hard time for Latvia right now. We are standing at the crossroads--perhaps it is out country's fate, always to be at the crossroads. But still, I as a Christian person, also know that we must do everything possible so that we again have order here. And I also know that IT WILL BE ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT WAYS, BUT IT WILL BE GOOD. One hundred percent! I will even swear to it with my signature! Ina Eglite prepared the discussion for publication.
