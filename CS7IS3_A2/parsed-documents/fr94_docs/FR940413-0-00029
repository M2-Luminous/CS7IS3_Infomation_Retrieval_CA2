Each customer will receive 50% of the $200 available, or $100. These examples illustrate the principle that pro rata distribution across both accounts is the preferable approach except when a shortfall in the XM account could harm non-XM customers. Thus, pro rata distribution occurs in Examples 1, 2, 5 and 6. Separate treatment of the XM and non-XM accounts occurs in Examples 3 and 4. Issued in Washington, DC on April 7, 1994 by the Commission.
