They are going to propose that this city in southern Bosnia-Herzegovina be included into the Bosnian Croat state, while the Moslems would get one of the Mostar municipalities, i.e. the section mostly Moslem-populated before the war. TANJUG learned that an E.U. mission, made up of high-ranking Greek, German and Belgian officials, is due to arrive in Mostar in the next few days, with a view to determining the possibilities of the establishment and implementation of the E.U. protectorate. The Serbs residing in Mostar have been excluded from the division. Before the war broke out in April 1992, 24,000 Serbs lived in Mostar, accounting for one-third of the population. 44,000 Moslems, 43,000 Croats and 12,000 residents, who declared themselves as Yugoslavs, have lived in Mostar at that time. The E.U. protectorate would ensure the return of the Serbs, who have been forced to leave the city under Moslem-Croat pressure. Over 45,000 Serbs have been expelled from Mostar and the Neretva valley and nearly all of their homes, churches, monasteries and cemeteries have been plundered, and burned and torn down. Since early 1993, fierce Moslem-Croat clashes have been taking place in central and southern Bosnia-Herzegovina, during which the city of Mostar has been completely destroyed. Under strong pressure from the United States, representatives of the Bosnian Moslems and Croats along with Croatian representatives signed in Washington on March 1 a preliminary agreement on setting up a bi-national federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which would subsequently enter into a confederation with Croatia, but the hostilities have never ceased.
