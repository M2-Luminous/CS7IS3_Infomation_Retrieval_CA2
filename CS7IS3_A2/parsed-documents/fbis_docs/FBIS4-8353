We are talking about armored personnel carriers, as the current stock of such carriers in Hungary has become obsolete. In addition, we can also count on the S-300 air defense missile system. This is a system resembling the Patriot missiles used in the Gulf War. It transpires from the study recently published in MAGYAR HONVED [HUNGARIAN SOLDIER] that the updated version of this S-300 missile is capable of intercepting targets flying at a speed of 10,000 km/hour from a distance of 90-150 km. It can be used against both aircraft and missiles. Prior to the end of the Warsaw Pact, the first and relatively cheaper version of this system was exported to the CSSR and Bulgaria. Defense Ministry leaders repeatedly expressed their view that Hungary needs this missile system.
