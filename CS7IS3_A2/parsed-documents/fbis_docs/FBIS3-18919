This morning both the Norwegian negotiators and EU diplomats were taking an optimistic view of the possibility of reaching an agreement. Trade Minister Grete Knudsen and Fisheries Minister Jan Henry T. Olsen had an hour-long meeting with EU Commissioner President Jacques Delors and Greek European Affairs Minister Theodhoros Pangalos. At the meeting Norway put forward new proposals for how the interests of Spain and Portugal can be satisfied in the negotiations. Both countries have demanded fish quotas from Norway. The outcome of the meeting was that representatives of the Commission and Norwegian officials were set to work to draft proposals for fisheries which will be put before the EU foreign ministers. Perhaps a Fish? "The position of the Norwegian side is founded on a clear principle. The EU is very well aware of this. But we are not opposed to lending a hand so that the interests of Spain, Portugal, and Ireland can be taken into account. What is clear is that there cannot be a solution for Norway alone," a Norwegian negotiator said. Norway understands that Spain and Portugal feel themselves to have been badly treated in their own accession agreements in the fisheries sector, but it has been an important point for the Norwegians to get the EU to understand that Norway cannot atone for the EU's old sins in this field. The Norwegian negotiators have also made it very clear that they will not allow themselves to be pressured into giving anything extra in the fisheries negotiations in order to make it easier for the EU countries to get Spain to agree to a solution to the internal wrangle about voting rules in the Council of Ministers. "If such pressure is put on Norway, we have made it clear that we have nothing more to talk about," a Norwegian source said. Agriculture Agreed According to NORSK TELEGRAMBYRA'S information, the agricultural agreement between Norway and the EU is complete and will be made public as soon as it has been formally approved by the EU Council of Ministers. In the last few days of negotiations, the Norwegians believe that they have succeeded in achieving a better deal for the food industry than Finland achieved last week. In concrete terms, measures will be adopted to prevent the market from disappearing while the food processing industry restructures in order to adapt itself to the new pricing situation. The measures will only apply to a limited number of sensitive products and will only apply for a transitional period.
