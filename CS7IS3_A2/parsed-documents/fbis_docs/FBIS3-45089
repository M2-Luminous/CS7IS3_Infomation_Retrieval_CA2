Those at the meeting heard briefings on construction preparations and on the resettlement of residents in the affected areas, and discussed matters concerning the project. Premier Li Peng, who had just returned to Beijing from an inspection tour of the Three Gorges project, presided over the meeting. Lu Youmei, general manager of the China Changjiang Three Gorges Project Development Corporation, briefed the attendees on the progress of preparations made for the construction of the project. According to the briefing, since the Three Gorges Project Construction Committee under the State Council approved the initial design of the project last July, preparations have been made for the construction of the project rather smoothly. Several objectives set at the beginning of the year were basically achieved. The year 1994 will be a year during which preparatory work for the construction of the projects will be done in an all-round way although the tasks will be very arduous. For this reason, all relevant departments should make concerted efforts to fulfill the annual plans in order to make full preparations for the construction of the project. With the approval of the State Council, the Three Gorges Project Construction Committee will call a meeting on the resettlement of residents in the affected areas within the next few days to solve major problems in this regard. The meeting will also be aimed at mobilizing people's governments at various levels and large numbers of cadres and people in the areas along the planned reservoir to carry forward the spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle, and at mobilizing people in various parts of the country and departments of the State Council to support the resettlement of residents in the areas affected by the Three Gorges project, and to promote economic development in the areas along the Three Gorges. Tang Zhangjin, director of the Resettlement and Development Bureau of the Three Gorges Project Construction Committee under the State Council, gave a special briefing on preparations made for the forthcoming meeting. While speaking at the meeting, leading comrades from Hubei and Sichuan provinces and from relevant departments of the State Council said that efforts should be made to do a good job in resettling residents of the affected areas and to support the construction of the Three Gorges project. After hearing speeches by attendees, Premier Li Peng said: Organized by the Changjiang Three Gorges Project Development Corporation and through the concerted efforts of workers, tremendous progress has been made over the past year in preparing for the construction of the Three Gorges project. He once again stressed: The Three Gorges project will be a trans-century project, and its construction will have great significance for our country's economy -- it will benefit people not only of the present age but of centuries from now. Relevant localities and departments must work together, support one another, and, with a strong sense of responsibility to the people, successfully carry out this great project which will benefit future generations. In his speech, Li Peng also emphasized that ministries and commissions of the State Council should set an example in supporting the project and take practical action in supporting construction in the areas along the Three Gorges. On the resettlement of residents of the affected areas, Li Peng pointed out: The success or failure of the Three Gorges project depends on the resettlement of residents of the affected areas, and the key to doing a good job in this regard lies in leaders at various levels. It is imperative to uphold the principle of resettlement and development. Residents in the affected areas should be resettled according to the "Regulations Governing the Resettlement of People Due to the Construction of the Three Gorges Projects on Chang Jiang" and the special characteristics of the resettlement areas. In the excellent situation of reform and opening up, and with the support of people across the country, we must do a good job in resettling those people. Other speakers at the meeting included Zou Jiahua, vice premier of the State Council, and Qian Zhengying, vice chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and adviser to the State Council's Three Gorges Project Construction Committee, who expressed their views on matters concerning the construction of the project.
