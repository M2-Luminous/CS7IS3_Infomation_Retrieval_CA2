In fact, the following is his message to Rwandans. Let us remind you that this message was issued yesterday. He begins with the words, 10 April. [Kanyarengwe] Today, 10 April, I want to send you this message. Rwandan men and women, we are going through grave times. Since President Habyarimana and the Burundi president died in a plane crash at Kanombe Airport on 6 April, it becomes clearer as the days go by that Habyarimana's death was planned by those in charge of his security. It is said that the plans were agreed upon. Habyarimana's guard troops, (?watchmen), and their collaborators are the ones who implemented this criminal scheme of causing bloodshed and mourning in the country. The death gave them a pretext to kill innocent people and politicians opposed to the Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development-Coalition for the Defense of the Republic [MRND-CDR]. The killers had hoped that the massacres would annihilate the Arusha peace agreement once and for all. Those who hatched the assassination plot are the very ones who killed the late prime minister, politicians including cabinet ministers, and leaders of parties opposed to the MRND-CDR. They killed the president of the Constitutional Court with the aim of restoring the former Parliament made up of MRND members and to establish a puppet government of the CDR militia, as its self-styled president said himself at the swearing-in ceremony on 9 April. Rwandan men and women, these bloodthirsty criminals are deceiving themselves. They will not win the war they have plunged themselves into. The affliction and mourning they have brought to the Rwandan children are about to backfire. Let them get ready to face the law. This government of killers which was announced to Rwandans is not legitimate in the country and has been denounced abroad. We the RPF have vowed to fight it. We call upon all Rwandans, particularly peace-loving soldiers, not to be alarmed by or to obstruct the RPF forces. Instead, they are requested to cooperate with the RPF and all the peace-loving people to fight these criminals. Rwandan men and women, we are saddened by the fact that the youth continues to be deceived into being accessories to these killings and riots. We call upon the youth to be realistic and to avoid actions that might have bad consequences for them. Let them know that those who have deceived them into such actions have started fleeing the country. Even at this very moment some of them have fled, while others boarded planes this morning for foreign countries. These are the same ones who made use of the Rwandan Armed Forces, notably the [word indistinct], the CDR militia, and the pro-MRND militia who have started retreating. We call upon the youth, whether in the National Armed Forces or in the CDR militia, and the pro-MRND militia to stop the criminal activities they have been plunged into. Rwandan men and women, many innocent people have been killed on a daily basis. These people committed no other crime than disagreeing with the MRND-CDR, or affiliation to a different tribe or region. We must all fight rid Rwanda of such shameless injustice. I am asking you from the depth of my heart to support all those who have lost family members, to assist and console them during these difficult times. We are with you all in these difficult moments. Thank you.
