Cordero emphasized the significance of faithfully complying with the accords signed in 1977 by Panama and the United States, which sought to decolonize Panama. He added that the canal "must come under absolute Panamanian domain and sovereignty." Today, Cordero addressed the 24th OAS General Assembly, which opened on 6 June at the city of Belem, Para State, in the Brazilian Amazon region. The assembly is due to close on 10 June. Cordero noted the interest of President Guillermo Endara's government in promoting a constitutional reform that would guarantee a professional administration of the Panama Canal as soon as it comes under complete Panamanian jurisdiction five years from now. Cordero added that a professional administration, through an autonomous organization, would prevent the canal from being affected by political ups and downs and will reassure its customers around the world. Cordero also outlined a number of international agreements to fight drug trafficking signed by Panama with the United States, Great Britain, Central American countries, Colombia, and the United Nations.
