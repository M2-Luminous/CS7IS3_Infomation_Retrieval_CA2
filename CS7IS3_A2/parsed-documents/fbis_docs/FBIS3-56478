The document envisages suspending Government Decree No. 1233 on the revaluation of fixed capital at national economic enterprises for three months in the printing industry sphere. As is known, the revaluation and resultant major increase in the value of printing enterprises' fixed capital will mean approximately a sixfold (according to PRESSA and IZVESTIYA publishing houses' experts) increase in the prices of printing services. It is doubtful whether even the richest and most prosperous publication would be able to stand a such a price rise. To protect their rights, the collectives of the major Moscow and a number of local newspapers were even prepared to declare a strike. Although the strike was averted when, at a meeting with the chief editors of newspapers and the leaders of journalists' organizations, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin promised to give the journalists' demands rapid consideration. The promise was carried out within the agreed period. But what position will the papers be in in three months' time? By then, Vladimir Kapelkin, general director of the Association of Publishers and Chief Editors, believes, a mechanism for compensating press organs for extra costs will be in place. It is to be devised by the Finance Ministry, the Economy Ministry, and the Committee on the Press. The new decree instructs the Committee on the Press to join interested ministries, departments, and organizations in preparing proposals on tax concessions for the printed media and also for publications printing children's, academic, and other socially significant literature. The Communications Ministry is to joint interested organizations in preparing proposals within a month on improving the system for the delivery and distribution of newspapers and journals. But perhaps the most important element in the government decree is the point which gives the Russian Federation State Property Management Committee and the Committee on the Press, in conjunction with interested ministries, departments, and organizations, two months to submit to the government proposals on the procedure for privatizing printing enterprises, including those that are members of publishing and printing complexes -- proposals connected with the participation of media and book publishers' editorial board collectives in their flotation and privatization. If these additions are adopted, the editorial boards' collectives, that is those who produce the papers, will be able to participate in the flotation and privatization of printing works and, consequently, also end up owning them. Hitherto, the journalists responsible for the end product, the news, which the printing base was created to print, have been entirely dependent on the latter. Suffice it to say that our paper in particular has had to make a difficult choice on several occasions: either pay large fines for being forced to miss the deadline for making up the pages, when an important event occurs in the country and the time when the news comes in does not fit the deadline, or report the event 24 hours late. ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI has written more than once of the need for journalists to participate in the flotation and privatization of printing works. Journalists managed to get this provision included in the privatization program for 1993. Unfortunately, it was not implemented. Is this going to happen again?
