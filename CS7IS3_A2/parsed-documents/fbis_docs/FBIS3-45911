Twenty-five other crewmen were rescued, but one was later certified dead. Senior Marine Officer Philip Weaver explained what happened: [Begin Weaver recording] Late last night, the Cosmos S actually had an explosion according to the people on board, and the ship subsequently broke in two, the fore part caught fire, and the vessel was abandoned. Shortly thereafter, some other ships came by and rescued 24 survivors and recovered one dead body. Throughout the night, the search continued for the missing nine people. Then in the morning we had a fixed-wing aircraft on scene, during the night and again in the morning. That has returned to Kai Tak [Hong Kong's airport]. We are having one more search this afternoon. The weather on scene is easterly gale force. The captain of the on- scene commander has said that he thinks there is little chance of any survivors. The nine survivors that were thought to be alive may have perished in the initial disembarkation because some eyewitnesses have reported that the life raft was seen to be consumed by flame.
