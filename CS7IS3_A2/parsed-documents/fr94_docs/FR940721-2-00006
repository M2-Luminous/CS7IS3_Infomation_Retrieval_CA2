Agency: Bureau of the Census. Title: Single Audit Questionnaires. Form Number(s): SAC&hyph;1, SAC&hyph;2. Agency Approval Number: 0607&hyph;0518. Type of Request: Revision of a currently approved collection. Burden: 28,400 hours. Number of Respondents: 100,000. Avg Hours Per Response: 17 minutes. Needs and Uses: The Single Audit Act of 1984 and OMB Circulars A&hyph;128 and A&hyph;133 require state and local governments and institutions of higher education and other non&hyph;profit institutions receiving $100,000 or more in Federal financial aid to have an annual audit of their financial operations. OMB has designated the Census Bureau as the central clearinghouse for these audits. We use the Single Audit Questionnaires to contact those entities that have not sent in their audit reports to request that they forward the report or clarify their reporting status. Information on the reporting status of non&hyph;profit institutions was collected on a one&hyph;time basis during FY 1991. This activity was not funded during Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993 but will be reinstituted for 1994. Affected Public: State or local governments and non&hyph;profit institutions. Frequency: Annually. Respondent's Obligation: Voluntary. OMB Desk Officer: Maria Gonzalez, (202) 395&hyph;7313.

Dated: July 18, 1994. Gerald Taché, Departmental Forms Clearance Officer, Office of Management and Organization.
