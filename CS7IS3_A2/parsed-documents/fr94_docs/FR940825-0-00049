FR940825-0-00049 FR940825-0-00012 This rule was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866. In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq .) which became effective January 1, 1981, the Service has determined that these proposed regulations will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities, nor will they require the preparation of a regulatory analysis. The proposed regulations would impose no significant costs on any class or group of small entities. This conclusion is based on the fact that no existing uses are being curtailed, except for the proposed prohibition on a very small percentage of vehicles which are carrying hazardous materials.
