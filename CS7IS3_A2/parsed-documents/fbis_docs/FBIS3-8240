At 1612, two Super-Galeb aircraft of the former Yugoslav People's Army appeared in the sky above central Bosnia. Choosing their targets, they obviously wanted to demonstrate the planes' capabilities and the pilots' skills. Judging by appearances, the aircraft were only a bait for NATO planes because they did not engage in combat activity. So as not to be hit by ground weapons, one aircraft released protective flares over Vitez. The exhibition by Serb pilots ended at 1635, when NATO planes appeared flying at a very high altitude. The Serb Galebs gained height and flew away toward their home base, accompanied by whistles of many people who watched the display and obviously did not understand the aim of such a show of force.
