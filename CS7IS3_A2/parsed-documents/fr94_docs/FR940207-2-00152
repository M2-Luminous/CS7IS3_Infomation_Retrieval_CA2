FR940207-2-00152 FR940207-2-00073 (2) Guarantee by OCC to Each Correspondent Clearing Corporation Each Second Restated Agreement provides that OCC will compensate the CCC for losses incurred by it in closing out the exercises and assignments of a defaulting participating member. 13 The amount of the compensation will be the smallest of the ``net options loss,'' the ``net overall loss,'' or the ``maximum guarantee amount.'' The net options loss is essentially the actual net loss incurred by the CCC in closing out exercises and assignments of options to which the CCC is unconditionally obligated at the time of the default. The net overall loss is essentially the actual net loss incurred by the CCC in closing out all transactions of the defaulting participating member to which the CCC is unconditionally obligated at the time of the default. The maximum guarantee amount is essentially the sum of the mark-to-market amounts, 14 positive and negative, for all options exercises and assignments to which the CCC is unconditionally obligated at the time of the default. 15 13 The term participating member is defined in the Second Restated Agreement as an entity that is an OCC clearing member and also is a participant in a CCC or is an entity that is a party to any of the three alternative arrangements for effecting settlement through a CCC ( i.e. , the appointing, Canadian, or nominating clearing arrangements). The alternative arrangements are discussed later in this order. 14 The term mark-to-market amount is defined to mean the difference between the exercise price of an option and the closing price of the underlying stock on the trading day immediately preceding the then most recently completed regular morning settlement of the participating member with OCC. For example, if a participating member defaults prior to the opening of business on T+4 and if the participating member has not made regular morning settlement with OCC on T+4 but had made regular morning settlement with OCC on T+3, the mark-to-market amount for the stock underlying the option will be determined as of the close of trading on T+2. 15 The effect of the maximum guarantee amount is to cap OCC's exposure at an amount that should be covered by the margin deposits collected by OCC and that should at least be equal to the net of the in-the-money amounts for all exercises and assignments being settled through a CCC as of the close of trading on the day or days on which the exercises were effected. OCC's guarantee in each Second Restated Agreement does not cover the exposure of the CCC to losses from exercise and assignment settlements that can result if a participating member transfers settlements from its account at the CCC to the account of any other member of the CCC, including another participating member or another member that is an affiliate of the participating member, and the transferee member defaults on its obligations to the CCC with respect to those settlements. This occurs for several reasons. First, OCC will not be a party to the transfer and accordingly will not have the ability to review the impact of the transfer on the financial condition of the transfree member. Second, the three prongs of the computation of OCC's guarantee obligation are all premised on the assumption that the negative values arising from short positions of a participating member may be offset against the positive values arising from the long positions of the participating member. This assumption may not hold true if, for example, a participating member transfers its short positions but not its offsetting long positions to the account of another member and that member fails to make settlement. (3) Permissible Arrangements for Effecting Settlement through a Correspondent Clearing Corporation Each Original Agreement contemplated that settlements of exercises and assignments would be effected by entities that are OCC clearing members and also are participants in a CCC. Each Second Restated Agreement retains the basic settlement concept contemplated in the Original Agreement and also contains expanded provisions addressing the alternative settlement arrangement, which are described later in this order. (i) Revised agreements for appointing clearing members and appointed clearing members. Each Second Restated Agreement contains provisions addressing the alternative settlement arrangement that is currently described in OCC's Rules in which an OCC clearing member appoints another OCC clearing member to effect settlement on its behalf at the appointed clearing member's DCC. In connection with implementing the Second Restated Agreements, OCC is revising the form of agreement that OCC requires from each OCC clearing member that appoints another OCC clearing member that is also a participant in a CCC to act for it for purposes of settling exercises and assignments of equity options. The most important purpose of the revisions is to cause the appointing clearing member to acknowledge that its obligations to OCC with respect to settlements of exercises and assignments are not satisfied until its appointed clearing member has satisfied its obligations to the DCC arising from the exercises and assignments and, accordingly, that the uses that OCC may make of the appointing clearing member's margin deposits and other assets include satisfying any obligation to the DCC incurred by OCC as a result of the DCC's settlement of the appointing clearing member's exercises and assignments.
