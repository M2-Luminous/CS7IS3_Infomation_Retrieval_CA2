Building upon a close cooperation with Japan's NEC, Cisco, the world's leading manufacturer of routers, has made a full-scale entry into ATM, and particularly with respect to switching. From this viewpoint, the company will market a stand-alone ATM switcher, manufactured by NEC, and a card for its 7000 router. The 16-port ATM switcher meets ATM Forum specifications, which include the more classic 155 Mbits/sec data transfer rate of the Sonet SDH interface. The ATM card designed for the 7000 router, and designated the AIP (ATM Interface Processor), is due to be on the market beginning in May. According to Cisco, this array will be the first such configuration able to link traditional networks with ATM networks. These two products comprise the third developmental phase of Cisco's entry into the ATM market. In October 1992, ADC Kentrox and Cisco jointly launched a router/DSU designed for the SMDS network. This was the first network in the United States to operate cells comparable to those of the ATM. Around the beginning of last year, a true ATM/DSU switcher appeared that was capable of converting frames into cells. This device was developed jointly by Cisco, Kentrox, and Digital Link. Apparently, those first two products and the cooperation agreements that preceded them have been scrapped in favor of Cisco's agreement with NEC. The planned AIP card for the 7000 is comprised of three subassemblies. The main one, which does the processing, is based on two RISC [Reduced Instruction Set Computer] processors manufactured by Mips Computers. The "dissection" of the ATM cells (segmentation and reassembly) is done inside the FRED [figure-reader electronic device] component, developed by the NET/Adaptive company. Input/output operations are controlled by an AMD Taxi processor in the 100 Mbits/sec case, and by a PMC/Sierra-manufactured processor in that of the Sonet interface. Cisco is also planning to make available for its 7000 router another so-called Ethernet switching card. An Ethernet switching unit, called Catalyst and made by Crescendo, will also be available. Cisco acquired Crescendo, known mainly for its CDDI [Cable Distributed Data Interface] (FDDI [Fiber Distributed Data Interface] on twisted pair) cards, in October 1993. The particularity of this second card is that it provides, on the one hand, a 100-Mbits/sec CDDI output, and eight 10 Mbits/sec 10 BaseT input ports. Each station connected to the switcher can therefore operate at a real-time rate of 10 Mbits/sec. Software Turnaround In addition to these product announcements, Cisco is highlighting its new architecture, Cisco Fusion, which tends to separate the software's routing function from the switching unit itself. In effect, as networks have evolved, the growing consumption of passband has driven the manufacturers of concentrators to dedicate circuits to a single station. This is the case, for example, of the new Catalyst switcher. Certain Ethernet switchers are now referred to as "single-station" switchers. As a result, the notion of routing as it was previously known (with searching a table to locate the addresses of best access) is losing its interest, since the search has been reduced to its simplest expression. In due time, therefore, software associated with switchers will be replacing top-of-the-line routers. On the occasion of its agreement with Alcatel providing for the supply of a PABX routing card, Cisco announced that it saw its future essentially in software. Its cooperation agreement with Microsoft further demonstrated this. Cisco has provided Microsoft a routing software for its Windows server, together with a customized card. The next stage, says the firm's European head, Philippe Brawermann, will consist of a number of agreements with several suppliers of hardware.
