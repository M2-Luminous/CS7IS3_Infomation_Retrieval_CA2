"Our mission is not over, any weapons found that are not under control will be subject to air strike," U.S. Admiral Jeremy Boorda, commander of NATO forces in southern Europe, told a news conference at his headquarters in Italy's Naples. NATO demanded that all the heavy weapons in and around Sarajevo had to be withdrawn 20 kilometers from the center of Sarajevo or placed under U.N. control. Boorda said that after the expiry of a NATO deadline at midnight GMT on Sunday, the threat of strikes from allied warplanes based in Italy or on aircraft carriers in the Adriatic remained in place. He said air strikes could still be called in if the Serbs attempted to move guns into the exclusion zone around Sarajevo or recapture weapons surrendered to U.N. control, or shell the capital from beyond the zone. The commander also indicated that he could be ready to extend the threat of air strikes to other areas of Bosnia if the alliance and the United Nations decided to deliver another ultimatum.
