The world once again witnessed Israeli aggression against Palestinian freedom fighters and the innocent population of Southern Lebanon. Both Zionist actions were the result of the United Nations' foot dragging on the resolution condemning Israel for the al-Khalil massacre of the Palestinians last February. Recent attacks on Lebanon and on the Palestinians once more prove that Israel, enjoying full support of the United States in the UN, will ignore any internationally accepted law it considers contrary to its own interests. This intransigent attitude towards UN resolutions should serve as a warning to those Arab states who currently entertain the idea of a real and genuine peace with the Zionist state. Armenia, another regional trouble spot, was also in the news last week. A C-130 plane belonging to the Islamic Republic carrying Iranian diplomats and students coming home for the new year crashed in Armenian territory killing all 32 people on board. This tragedy deeply saddened our people especially considering IRI's recent mediating efforts in the Azeri-Armenian territorial dispute. Iranian blood should not be spilled because of conflicts of its neighbors. Iranian-Armenian relations are based on centuries of coexistence and cultural exchanges between the two ancient peoples. It is incumbent upon the Armenian authorities to do whatever is necessary to regain the good will of the Iranian people and to continue the Iranian-initiated peace process with Azerbaijan if peace is really their ultimate objective. Kashmir and the conduct of India's Border Security Forces (BSF) were also prominent in last week's news. A report by an Indian commission accused the BSF of having fired on Kashmiri Muslims killing at least 30 unarmed protesters without any provocation. The commission recommended the court-martial of several BSF members including two of its top officers. India's swift and impartial actions regarding the renegade members of the BSF in Kashmir deserve international praise and we hope will serve as a model for other countries when faced with a similar situation. The new year message of Iran's Revolutionary leader, Ayatollah Seyyed 'Ali Khamene'i, emphasizing social discipline and work ethics in the everyday lives of the Muslim people began the year 1373 with a national spirit of hope, and motivated the Iranians to begin the new year with a resolution to work towards achieving the country's objectives of self-sufficiency and independence.
