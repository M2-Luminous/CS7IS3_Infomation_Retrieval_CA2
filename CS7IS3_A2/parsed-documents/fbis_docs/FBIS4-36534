FBIS4-36534 "drnes112_l_94004" FBIS-NES-94-112 Daily Report 9 Jun 1994 ISRAEL Alert in North; Sources Expect Resumed Shelling Alert in North; Sources Expect Resumed Shelling TA0906153994 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew 9 Jun 94 pp A1, A8 TA0906153994 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ Hebrew BFN [Report by military correspondent Eytan Rabin] [Excerpts] An alert was declared yesterday along the northern border and in south Lebanon following resumed exchanges of fire between the terrorists and the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and SLA [South Lebanese Army]. At the same time, there is no intention of reinforcing the army along the border and inside Lebanon, although the alert is being maintained. [passage omitted] Sources in the defense establishment said yesterday that mainly Hizballah is responsible for the shooting yesterday, although it may be that other organizations took part in the activity against the IDF. Army sources stressed that Hizballah has quickly recovered from the air raid on the organization's camp in Ba'labakk last week and resumed activity in the security zone. This activity is comprised of firing katyushas, as well as placing roadside bombs, remote-control explosive charges, and trip wire charges. IDF soldiers have been instructed to intensify patrols in the coming period in view of possible attempts by Hizballah terrorist squads to infiltrate into the security zone. Major General Yitzhaq Mordekhay, commander of the Northern Command, yesterday stressed that, despite the resumption of the firing of katyushas last week and yesterday, the terrorists have not violated the agreements made at the close of Operation Accountability last year. It is assumed that U.S. and Syrian pressure made Hizballah stop firing katyushas at Israel last week. At the same time, an IDF Intelligence Branch source said recently that it is not inevitable that the firing of katyushas at the northern settlements will resume.

Gur said: "The message the Syrians have received over the last two weeks is that they have no chance of closing the qualitative gap between us. If they consider going back on the peace process, they will know what they are faced with." Gur is further cited as saying that "we will not accept terror, not even if it is supported by Syria, and it is important that the Syrians know this."]
