Krajisnik said this in an interview to Radio Jagodina, commenting the announcement of Moslem Radio Sarajevo that Tuesday the airfield near Tuzla would be opened. Tuzla is a Moslem enclave in northeastern Bosnia-Herzegovina. On Tuesday a U.N. plane landed on Tuzla airfield with the U.N. Special Envoy for the Former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi on board. This was interpreted as the reopening of the airfield for humanitarian flights. The spokesman of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Silvana Foa denied this stating that the Tuzla airfield would not be opened before Bosnian Serbs and Moslems agreed on the way the incoming cargo is to be controlled. The Serb side has not reached a final agreement with the Moslems on the opening of the Tuzla airfield, there is only an agreement with the Russians on its opening under certain conditions, negotiations on the subject are not over yet, Krajisnik said. Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic and the Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev reached an agreement early this month in Moscow on the opening of the Tuzla airfield for humanitarian needs. Fearing that the Moslems could use the airfield to bring in arms the Serbs asked for the incoming cargo to be checked by Russian peacekeepers and Serb observers. The Tuzla military airfield was closed in May 1992, a month after the war between the local Serbs, Croats and Moslems in Bosnia-Herzegovina broke out. Krajisnik said that on Wednesday the RS parliament would examine how Bosnia-Herzegovina would be constituted, the future relations with the Moslem-Croat federation and the platform of the Serb side in the next round of talks. Bosnian Croats and Moslems have signed an agreement in the White House, under strong U.S. pressure, on the establishment of a Croat-Moslem federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and on general principles of its later confederation with the former Yugoslav Republic of Croatia. The question of whether the Bosnian Serbs will join the federation, insisted upon by Washington, has been left open. Stressing that the deputies cannot overlook the question of the division of the territories between the Serb side and the Moslem-Croat federation Krajisnik said that the "Serbs own 64 per cent of the territory and we shall insist on this actual ownership in all subsequent talks". He added however, that they were ready to agree to certain concessions in the percentage of the territory if it meant that compact areas would be created. "This is nevertheless far below the 50 per cent of the territory spoken about by the U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher", the RS assembly president said.
