Coordinate with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and other federal and state agencies to improve effectiveness of control program activities conducted on National Forest System and other public lands. 7. Use an integrated approach to the prevention of animal damage and management of animal damage control programs. Consider a full range of methods, including physical barriers, repellents, habitat manipulation, biological controls, silvicultural methods (for example, fertilizing to improve soil fertility), pesticides, and hunting and trapping. Use licensed hunting, fishing, and trapping as a control technique where practicable. 8. Use only pesticides that are properly registered in accordance with federal and state requirements for animal damage management and that conform to policies on pesticide-use management and coordination (FSM 2150). Follow label directions. 9. Follow direction in FSM 2670.

Establishing or amending existing Memorandums of Understanding between the Region and appropriate state and other federal agencies regarding animal damage management. 3. Reviewing all proposed Forest Service animal damage management activities within areas occupied by and habitat of federally proposed or listed threatened or endangered species and Regional Forester approved sensitive species. Regional Foresters may redelegate this authority to Forest Supervisors. 4. Meeting with state or regional representatives, such as the APHIS Regional Director, as needed to coordinate animal damage management operations. Regional Foresters may designate a representative. 5.
