Having conferred with his Macedonian counterparts Selmani and Bajaldziev on April 12, at the end of his visit Todorov was to sign a protocol on cooperation between the similar ministries of the two countries. The document, coordinated in advance with Macedonian experts in Sofia, said that the protocol was to be signed in the official languages in Bulgaria and Macedonia. Yesterday the Macedonian side demanded that this established wording in bilateral practice and documentation be substituted for [as received] "the Macedonian and Bulgarian languages." The Bulgarian side refused to sign the document which marked the end of the visit which also envisaged a meeting with Macedonian Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski.
