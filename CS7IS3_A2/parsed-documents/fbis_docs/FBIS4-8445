The LSU is convinced that not all political means have been applied, he said, adding that "we are harvesting the fruit of the disintegration of Yugoslavia, which was a bad act." At the beginning of the crisis there were several solutions such as "democratization, democratic federalization and a confederative set-up," Holub noted. He also asked why Italy will not attend the forthcoming presidential meeting in Litomysl and why Slovenia is being torn out of the Balkan area. "If the presidential meeting is attended by Germany and Slovenia, it should also be attended by Italy," he stressed. LSU Chairman Frantisek Trnka cautioned that Czech-Slovak relations were not developing favorably. He pointed to the reluctance of the Czech Republic to hand over the shares of the Czech Commercial Bank to which Slovakia has a legal right. He called the obstructions politically wrong.
