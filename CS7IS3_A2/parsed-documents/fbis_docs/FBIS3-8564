FBIS3-8564 "dreeu049__a94019" FBIS-EEU-94-049-A Document Type:Daily Report 14 March 1994 ANNEX Bulgaria National Bank Raises Interest Rates AU1003210794 Sofia BTA in English 1950 GMT 10 Mar 94 AU1003210794 Sofia BTA Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Sofia, March 10 (BTA) -- The central exchange rate as of March 14, 1994 will stand at 62 percent and capitalized interest at an annual 83 percent. Interest on overdrafts on commercial bank current accounts with the central Bulgarian National Bank [BNB] as well as overdrafts on obligatory reserves will be calculated on a daily basis. The BNB yesterday raised the latter rates more than two-fold to 150 percent and 120 percent, respectively. The BNB decisions are intended to curb inflationary expectations, which got an unjustifiably strong boost recently, more specifically as a result of a sharp plunge of the national currency, the impending electricity price hike and an upcoming levy a value added tax, said central bank sources. A BNB release sent to BTA says the Governing Board is debating and may take other steps in the same direction. "We are seeking to above all protect personal savings," said BNB Governor Todor Vulchev. The BNB is trying to protect the national currency and expects that necessary steps will be taken to boost production and the structural reform. International institutions are also expected to meet commitments to Bulgaria. The present measures are intended to prevent the soaring dollar exchange rate from reflecting on internal inflation, i.e. on the prices of goods on the home market, Vulchev said. [passage omitted] In 1993 the central exchange rate was updated five times, hitting a year high in November (52 percent) and a year low in August (44 percent). This January it climbed to an all-time record of 56 percent, with the BNB struggling to head off speculative hyperinflation and encourage endangered personal savings.
