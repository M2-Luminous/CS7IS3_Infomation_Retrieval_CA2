He said that the fighters are among the sectors that deserve the state's care, noting that these funds do not come from the state's budget but from the Armed Forces National Projects Service Department. The announcement came during President Mubarak's meeting with the officers, noncommissioned officers, and soldiers of the central military zone. President Mubarak arrived at the Military Sports Center in Manshiyat al-Bakri at 1005 today and was received by Defense Minister Marshal Muhammad Husayn Tantawi; Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Salah Halabi; the commanders of the air, sea, and air defense forces; and Staff Major General 'Uthman Shahin, commander of the central military zone. [Begin Mubarak recording] In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. Happy year to you. I am always pleased when I meet with our brothers and sons from the Armed Forces because I spent most of my life in the Armed Forces. I learned and was trained in the Armed Forces. I had not thought of delivering a speech at today's meeting but I thought I should seize this opportunity to speak about issues and problems that concern you as a group of citizens and as an important and disciplined group of the people. I asked myself: What issues do our brothers and sons want to hear? I received several questions on local and foreign issues. I will speak to you frankly on every issue except those that affect the public interest, since I try not to enter into the latter's details at such a big gathering. Speaking about local affairs, one question is: One of your excellency's instructions to the government is to pay attention to slums and to control them. Are there resources available for achieving this in the near future, especially given that it might be difficult to develop some of these areas? The slums issue began in the sixties and has continued to grow. People left the countryside for the cities, specifically Cairo and Alexandria. The problem grew and buildings were constructed without permission, without planning. Frankly, I could not pull down the slum areas under the previous conditions because, as you know, our economic situation in the early eighties was such that no funds were available. We did not even have resources. We could barely provide bread. You might remember that we held an economic conference in 1982 to see where we were going and what we were going to do about our economy, which is the people's livelihood. World prices rose sharply after the October 1973 war, including oil. Our resources from foreign currencies were meager and we could not pay the debt installments. Not only this, we could not even pay the price of wheat or for the citizens' basic requirements. I said somewhere that in September 1990 we reached the stage where our foreign currency resources--from exports, oil, and tourism--did not exceed 5 billion, 4.5 billion, sometimes 6 billion [currencies not specified] while we were spending 10 billion in foreign currency. We borrowed. We bought wheat in installments to be paid over so many years. We reached the stage where we could not pay the installments. [end recording] President Mubarak stressed that we paid major attention to the infrastructure because it was extremely necessary for agriculture, industry, and investments. He explained what has been achieved in the infrastructure field and stressed that unemployment would have doubled to 10 times what it is now had it not been for the infrastructure achievements. The president explained the situation in Egypt when the economic reforms began and how the country succeeded in reaching a unique program through its discussions with the international financial establishments and the IMF, which no other country could attain. The program, he added, took into consideration the conditions of the low-income groups. The president added that this program was the bitter medicine that had to be taken to save the Egyptian entity and economy. This was stated by Muhammad 'Abd-al-Mun'im, head of the Presidential Palace Press Office. He said that the president stressed that the economic reforms were a heavy burden and that the increase in prices was also a burden but were necessary for development. The president added: We had two choices: either to embark on the economic reform experiment or to avoid it, which would have led to a degree of deterioration that no one could predict. The president stressed that the only remaining danger now is the terrible population increase. The head of the Presidential Palace Press Office added that the president affirmed that the economic reform program is on course and that we have been exempted from 30 percent of our debts, which will drop another percentage point in July. The president stressed that this stage has (?hampered) the state's interest in the expanding slum areas. He said: After the reform we are able to look for a solution to this problem, proceed with improving living conditions, and develop the economy, especially if we manage to control the population increase. President Mubarak touched on the sales tax, saying that there will be no price increase in the second stage of this tax, which will be during 1995-96. He said taxes are the state's right from those able to pay in favor of the ones who cannot. He also explained the GATT, which allows free trade and services that reflect the interest of the higher purchasing countries and asserted that we ought to adjust ourselves and be ready to cooperate to face all possible consequences of this agreement. The president said that at a time when the world is suffering hard economic conditions and soaring prices, some countries have begun to export terrorism to us. He affirmed that the terrorists who concentrate on striking at tourism as a huge source for the Egyptian economy have nothing to do with Islam, which renounces them. He described them as a handful of criminals and mercenaries and said that their interest is money and profiteering, referring to an attack on a mosque in Sudan yesterday in which 28 people were killed and over 100 worshipers were wounded [numbers as heard]. Criminals also used machine guns and hand grenades in attacking worshipers in a Sunni mosque in Pakistan. 'Abd-al-Mun'im said that the president discussed corruption, saying that some people are exaggerating it to harm our reputation, something that happens in other countries and from which no society is free. He said that Egypt has less corruption than other countries and that the international phenomenon of corruption cannot be a justification for us. All corruption cases are investigated no matter who is involved. The president noted the numerous rumors about corruption designed to cause confusion and defame the state. He affirmed that he personally inquires about all rumors and allegations and in most cases investigations have proved that they were merely rumors. The president turned to the discussion of foreign issues, affirming their direct link with domestic affairs. He noted that we are living in a world where interests are interwoven and that Egypt's foreign relations affect its role and standing in the region. The president stressed that he is committed to a general principle that our relations should be good with all countries. The president also discussed the balance of power in the world and the new world order, referring to the major changes. He affirmed the need for us to deal with the new situation and successive changes and that we should not despair. He then referred to yesterday's heinous massacre in Sarajevo, when a mortar shell landed in the city's marketplace, killing over 60 people and wounding about 200 others. He said that the European countries have an obligation to end this tragedy from which the Bosnian people are suffering. He emphasized that it is the responsibility of the major powers and the Security Council member states to end this tragedy. President Mubarak said we have peacekeeping forces in Sarajevo and Somalia that are a symbol of the solidarity of an Islamic country with brothers in two other Islamic countries. He added that our Armed Forces are carrying out a first class humanitarian task in Somalia. In his meeting with commanders, officers, and men of the Central Military Zone, the president dealt with the Middle East issue and the peace process. He noted that Egypt was the most courageous country to achieve peace. He said that had it not been for the role of the late President Anwar al-Sadat in his historic initiative that opened the door to all the region's countries, it would not have been possible to reach the current situation in the peace process. He also discussed the Gaza-Jericho accord and Egypt's role in all phases, as well as its efforts with the United States during 1977-1993 to make it listen to the Palestinian voice. The president stressed that difficulties remain on the road to peace, primarily the Israeli settlements that have gone from 40 small settlements in 1978 to 180 large ones scattered all over the Arab territories. He said Egypt has always been forthright in all its actions and policies and that there is still a long, complex way to go on the Palestinian issue, especially when a Palestinian (?administration is set up) and in light of subsequent dealings with humanitarian issues. He affirmed that there will soon be a just solution to the Syrian issue, which we desire. Mubarak also dealt with Egypt's role in finding a solution to the Libyan-Western crisis, in which Egypt is helping as much as it can without intervening in Libya's decisionmaking.
