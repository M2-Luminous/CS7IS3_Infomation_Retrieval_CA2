As Natalya Vstovskaya, press secretary of the kray administration head, reported before the beginning of the program, Yevgeniy Nazdratenko took part in a meeting of the Federal Assembly while in Moscow and signed the Agreement on Civic Accord in Russia. I am prepared to welcome any chance aimed at stabilizing our society and establishing peace and order, he said over the telephone. However, the governor expressed deep concern over the situation in connection with the increase in prices on electricity. As you know, according to the 22 April decree, the government is rescinding preferential rates for Maritime Kray set down in decree No. 1001. This document was not coordinated with Maritime Kray, and I am categorically opposed to such measures, Yevgeniy Nazdratenko declared. The head of the administration has departed for Vladivostok to deal with urgent kray issues. Immediately on arrival he plans to visit the agricultural fair and fish market being held today. As was reported earlier, Yevgeniy Nazdratenko was invited to the United States for the presentation of the president's book. However, he declined the offer. During an audience with Yeltsin in Moscow in connection with the publication of the book, I explained the necessity for my return to the kray, and I think I was understood, the head of the kray administration said.
