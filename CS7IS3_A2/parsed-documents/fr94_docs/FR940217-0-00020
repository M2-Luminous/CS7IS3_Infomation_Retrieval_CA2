FR940217-0-00020 FR940217-0-00007 After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. The FAA estimates that 14 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD. The FAA has been advised that all 14 affected airplanes have been modified in accordance with the requirements of this AD. Therefore, currently, this AD action imposes no additional economic burden on any U.S. operator. However, should an unmodified airplane be imported and placed on the U.S. Register in the future, it will take approximately 113 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $1,800 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD is estimated to be $8,015 per airplane. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES .
