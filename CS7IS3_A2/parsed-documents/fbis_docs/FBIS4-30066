The House of Councillors gave a stamp of approval to the 73.1 trillion yen budget for the year that started April 1 at a plenary session after its budget committee cleared it earlier in the day. Only three budgets took longer to enact than the fiscal 1994 budget during the postwar period. The government's budget plan was tabled in the Diet on March 4 but had been left undebated for 80 days due to the political maelstrom over former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's personal financial affairs. The turmoil forced Hosokawa to step down in April. But once deliberations started, the budget took an unusually short 23 days to become law. The budget earmarks 40.9 trillion yen, or 2.3 percent more than the fiscal 1993 budget, for general operating expenditures, the core part of the budget that includes most outlays other than debt-servicing costs and tax allocations to local governments. It features 5.5 trillion yen in income and residential tax reductions and sets aside 8.98 trillion yen, a 4.0 percent rise, for public works spending, both designed to shore up the ailing economy. Outlays for defense are allowed to rise a scant 0.9 percent to 4.7 trillion yen while official development assistance was budgeted at 1.0 trillion yen, a 4.4 percent increase.
