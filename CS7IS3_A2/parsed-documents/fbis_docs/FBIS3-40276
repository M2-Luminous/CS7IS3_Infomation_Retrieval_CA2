Armed conflict on the Yugoslav-Bulgarian border, which both sides tried to hush up, occurred on Tuesday, 21 December. Fortunately, the fighting was not between the armed forces of the two states. The targets of the attack by Bulgarian special police were criminals from Sofia who were in the "no-man's land" between the Gradina border crossing on our side and the Kalotina border crossing on the Bulgarian side. The criminals had retreated into our territory, but the special police followed them and in so doing crossed onto our side of the border. However, since this obviously involved a chase, the only visible consequence was the posting of Yugoslav special police along the border. Or to be more precise, the only consequence as far as Yugoslav-Bulgarian relations are concerned. The second consequence will affect a significantly larger number of people. The battle on the no-man's land was at the same time a battle at the biggest gasoline market supplying the citizens of Serbia under the weight of sanctions. Market Days after the showdown, there are dozens of canisters scattered about the land between the two border crossings, while the asphalt is so oily and slick from the spilled gasoline that a great deal of caution is called for in walking across it. A market has existed at that site for the last two or three months. Seeing that the citizens of Serbia often have problems taking out large quantities of fuel, the resourceful Bulgarians began to cross their part of the border and sell gasoline on the no-man's land. People from Serbia would cross only the Yugoslav border, buy gasoline, and return home without contact with Bulgarian customs officials. It is true that the Bulgarians were selling the fuel at twice the price--1.5 to 1.6 German marks [DM] per liter--of the fuel at the pump only several kilometers away (between DM0.8 and DM0.9 per liter). To the Serbs, even this increased price was preferable to the endless waiting at crowded pumps and to the problems, often based on "material" considerations, with Bulgarian customs officials concerning "export" permits. Everyone was satisfied, and an increasing number of cars registered with our eastern neighbor were trying to quench the thirst on this side of the border. Sales were made primarily from tank to tank until some strong men realized that big money was changing hands between Gradina and Kalotina. The ordinary citizens had to go, and complete control over the "market" was assumed by people whom the local population calls the "mafia." They arrived in convoys of 10, 20, and even 30 vans full of gasoline, unloaded canisters, and started pouring. The din of voices and throng of commerce flowed among hundreds of barrels and siphon tubes for nearly 24 hours a day. All of this took place a few dozen meters away from the Yugoslav and Bulgarian customs authorities. "It's not like they did not benefit from it as well," says one of the old gasoline barons from Nis. Kolo The idyll was suddenly disrupted by the aforementioned showdown. One of the bosses of the petroleum business killed two policemen in Sofia during an attempt to arrest someone else. The Bulgarians received information indicating that the person in question could be found at the border market, and on Tuesday before last, between 1930 and 2000, special forces conducted a raid in which several persons were injured. The mafiosi retreated into FRY territory, the special police rushed in after them, and our police apprehended several of the fugitives, together with one Bulgarian colleague. The latter was released, the criminals were turned over to the Bulgarian authorities, and the market was shut down. However, that is not the end of the road for gasoline. Nor is it the beginning. Ever since it became almost impossible to import petroleum in tanker trucks, it has been brought in from Bulgaria on organized bus tours. Logically, the "safest" ones have also been the most expensive ones. For DM200 per person, the organizers guaranteed that passengers would return to Serbia with 200 liters of gasoline each in canisters. Naturally, the largest part of the money went to "unofficial duty," which ended up in the hands of Bulgarian customs agents. Still, there was always risk involved. Inspection teams occasionally managed to replace bribable officials, and to change the shifts of those simply under suspicion. In that case, a bus would park in front of the crossing while the unfortunate passengers waited for eight or even 16 hours, over night, until "their man" arrived. Fatigue, torment, and the fear of loss pushed nerves to the limit, after which incidents were not out of the question. One of our passengers poured gasoline through a window onto an industrious Bulgarian customs agent who would not let the tour pass and tried to set him on fire. Once they finally managed to cross the Bulgarian part of the border, the people got 200 liters of gasoline for which they paid around DM0.9 per liter in Bulgaria, plus DM1 per liter as the transaction cost. Just on our side of the border, they met up with the local financial police, who collected a fee of DM0.6 per liter. Thus, upon entering Serbia the gasoline already cost DM2.5. Nevertheless, the passengers were content, and despite all the difficulties they could rest easy. "When we passed Nis, the kolo dancing would begin," one of them says. Music from cassette players accompanied dancing around the tightly packed bags and canisters, while cigarettes burned in the darkness of the bus, the scent of their smoke mixing with the smell of the gasoline fumes. These traveling lakes of gasoline often comprised a whole metric ton. "Mixing" Besides the buses originating in Belgrade, the residents of towns close to the border have also been doing business through private deals, primarily with their own vehicles. This means that gasoline for them is significantly cheaper, so that the resale price in southern Serbia has been around DM2 to DM2.2. Given the various additional methods for improving profits, this has paid off. Clearly the best-known method is "mixing" the fuel with water. But there are others as well. At one of the "sales points" (cans with tubing and funnels set up beside the highway), a man sells 12 liters of gasoline, pouring it from a canister with a clearly imprinted label reading "10 liters." The stricter controls since last week's incident have drastically reduced the quantity of fuel that these "private businessmen" are able to move, to say nothing of the buses. Besides the mounds of abandoned plastic at the former market, a similar pile is building up at the Bulgarian crossing. Upon entry into Bulgaria, local customs agents now confiscate not only empty canisters, but also practically any container into which fluid can be poured, including plastic one-and-a-half-liter cola bottles. Periodically, forklifts arrive to carry all this off somewhere. Those who attempt to pass without having the trunk of their car checked are pulled from their car in the middle of the crowd by a large customs agent with a pistol in his shoulder holster, yelled at, and then thrown like a sack of flour back behind the steering wheel and told to get back in line. The procedure seems unnecessarily harsh, and the search for empty containers seems excessively stringent unless the same crossing is made in the evening in the opposite direction, toward Yugoslavia. The crowd no longer even knows how many parallel lines there are, people walk around in all directions as if taking their evening stroll, so that the customs agents have no choice but to wander among the jammed vehicles and ask individuals whether they are carrying gasoline, and possibly conduct a superficial check of every 10th car. But the reason that even the smallest containers are confiscated upon entry becomes clear only when one sees the pump in Slivnitsa, a town 15 km from the border, which the Serbian army at one time attempted unsuccessfully to occupy. War Plastic containers for cooking oil or antifreeze, the volume of which is never more than a liter, are removed from various hiding places in the cars. A tall fellow with an earring pours into a cola bottle that is so battered and twisted that it is a wonder that it does not leak. Once it is filled, he wraps it up among part of the engine and hides other containers in the gaps as well. Additional liters of gasoline are placed in the rear, in a gas tank that is no longer used for its intended purpose. While he gets into his old car, which could now be almost as dangerous as the vehicle of a Hezbollah kamikaze driver, he shrugs: "So what, I'm 23 and have no other prospects." Smuggled gasoline is often camouflaged by other goods, the "export" of which is perhaps viewed more favorably. The rear end of the car is almost dragging the asphalt under the weight of rice, salt, toilet paper, meat, oranges, and whatever else in the trunk. "You have war in your country, nothing else," says a young Gypsy Zoja with concern and understanding at an improvised booth in Slivnitsa. However, the small quantities of fuel hidden under piles of third-rate goods or in engines do not meet the demand by a long shot, which raises the prices when controls are tightened. Thus, we are learning here to what extent the market is a sensitive mechanism. A Bulgarian mafioso kills two policemen in Sofia, and the price of gasoline rises in Belgrade.
