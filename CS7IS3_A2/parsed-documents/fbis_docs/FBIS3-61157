Kononov, leading scientific staffer at the All-Russia Scientific Research Institute of Agricultural Economics, and comment by Aleksandr Gavrilyuk: "Is the Bank No Comrade for the Peasant?"] [Text] Our statistics are always late. That is why today we have not the year's balance for 1993 but only the agricultural enterprises' balance for the first half of the year. The consolidated half-year balance of Russia's agricultural enterprises is a unique document making it possible to assess objectively the financial position of the country's agriculture. Over the first six months of work this year, agricultural farms and producers (not counting private farmers) earned over 567 billion rubles [R] in profit, which is a little over eight times more than for the corresponding period last year. The profit obtained ensured a 48-percent profitability in agriculture. Is that enough? According to the criteria of the "stagnation times," the optimum level of profitability was considered to be 40-45 percent of the prime cost of the output sold. And that level was indeed close to the optimum since it ensured a quite rapid rate of expanded reproduction of the sector's material and technical base and ensured wages entirely comparable with wages in industry (on state farms it was 86-88 percent of industrial wages). When assessing the present profitability situation in agriculture we must bear in mind that it took shape largely under the influence of the extremely reduced remuneration of the labor of rural commodity producers. In the first half of this year, as last year, the monthly wage in agriculture did not exceed 56 percent of the average wage of workers and employees in the Russian national economy. If wages in agriculture were the average for the national economy, then the sector's profitability would decline many times over for this reason alone. According to the figures for last year, this decline would have been only threefold. The low return has also affected effective demand. Because of the reduction in agriculture's effective demand for 1992 alone compared with 1991, deliveries of mineral fertilizers to Russia's agro-industrial complex were nearly halved, deliveries of tractors and trucks fell by over one third, deliveries of grain combines fell 28 percent, and volumes of capital investments were cut back more in the agro-industrial complex than in other sectors. Unfortunately, agriculture remains an unattractive sphere for private investors. And that is entirely natural. After all, the general rule has it that there is some point in investing in production only if you can obtain a bigger clear profit (after the deduction of tax) than by keeping the money in the bank. But even the Savings Ban of Russia, which pays the smallest rate of interest among other banks on short-term investments, pays 120 percent a year. Many banks have paid shareholders dividends for 1993 which amount to 200-250 percent a year and even more. For that reason banks keep as far away as possible from agriculture, calling it a "black hole." Russia's commercial structures mainly finance those projects whose profitability will in any circumstances be at least 150-200 percent a year. Targets for investment as a rule are trade and large industrial enterprises which have completed privatization and possess a substantial export potential. Consequently, for agriculture to be able, under stagflation conditions, to make capital investments in more or less tolerable volumes and to offer normal wages and finally become a sector of interest to private capital, its profitability should not lag substantially behind profitability in other spheres of the economy. For instance, in the United States the average return over many years from investment in farming for 1954-1992 was considerably higher than from investment in state bonds and treasury promissory notes. The half-year figures are also alarming in connection with the intensifying differentiation of farms. According to the results of work in the first six months, over 4,000 farms, or 15.4 percent of their total number, became loss-making, and the average loss from one loss-making farm was about R10 million, while the profit from one profit-making farm was R27 million. Last year 7.6 percent of the total number of farms completed the first six months with a loss. Of course, if you assess the situation from liberal market positions, there is nothing dangerous in agriculture's financial position. After all, the well-known "500 Days" program already made full allowance for the possible bankruptcy of up to 25 percent of farms possessing one third of agricultural land. Even now representatives of this concept view the possible mass bankruptcy of producers of agricultural output as an entirely acceptable market feature. In this connection it is appropriate to recall the U.S. Administration's approach toward problems of its own agriculture. When in the mid-eighties U.S. farmers were gripped by a debts crisis and about 7 percent of farms were threatened with imminent bankruptcy, the federal government took steps to ease the farmers' debt burden. [Kononov ends] In Place of Postscript Russia's agrarian sector has been unable to "achieve a breakthrough" and overcome the production slump in the outgoing agricultural year. In addition, losses when harvesting this year's harvest were in excess of 30 percent for many agricultural crops. The reasons? Primarily "because of the clumsiness of the country's banking system" and the imperfection of the taxation of rural commodity producers, specialists believe. Debts to the peasants for the grain and oilseed delivered to state resources were R600 billion as of early December and were the same amount for stockraising output sold. In addition the agro-industrial complex has not received about R800 billion earmarked for it from the federal budget. Existing taxation, in the opinion of agricultural leaders, does not encourage their work and is often a curbing factor. Thus, processing in the agricultural production sphere is subject to a 32-percent tax. To all appearances the premise of recent years that the emergency formation of private farms would resolve all the countryside's problems, has not been justified. The 270,000 private farms have provided only 8 percent of the total volume of agricultural production. And how could it be otherwise if the private farmers have been sent only 34 percent of the funds earmarked by the state to support this form of farming.
