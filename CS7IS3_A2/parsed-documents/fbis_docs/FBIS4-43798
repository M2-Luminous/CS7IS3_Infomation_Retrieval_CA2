[Begin Dehaene recording in French with superimposed Arabic translation] Relations between Belgium and Algeria have always been good; there have been constant commercial and economic links. This meeting falls within the framework of efforts aimed at strengthening these relations. [end recording] [Hamadi] The purpose of this European tour, which comes on the eve of the European summit in Corfu and less than one month before the G-7 summit in Naples, is to bolster European-Algerian cooperation in various fields, particularly after the agreement with the IMF and the Paris Club. Observers here point out that Algeria has invigorated the political and economic reforms by establishing the Transitional National Council and the National Economic and Social Council, and has opened the first door to a market economy. They add that all these facts will give Algeria a winning card in its international economic dealings. [Begin Sifi recording] The visit has several objectives. We will be disseminating information that will enable us to explain the Algerian Government's efforts in the political and economic fields. This visit is also aimed at developing and bolstering support in the political and economic fields. [end recording] [passage omitted] The prime minister will leave Belgium tomorrow for Paris on a similar mission.
