Is it knuckling under to "Russian Hitler" Zhirinovskiy just in case? Is it permitting the Kremlin to lay claim to being a great power, which is something that it should resolutely counter? In the middle of January, the Atlantic alliance offered the Central and East European states a Partnership for Peace, which puts off full membership in NATO until some indefinite time in the future. The Partnership for Peace was also offered to Russia, so -- as President Clinton justified it -- not to create "a new border between East and West, which could prompt a confrontation in the future." Since then, the charge of "appeasement" has been appearing in the columns of the conservative press. Appeasement? Until September 1938, it was a highly respectable concept which described the goal of all diplomacy: tranquility, satisfaction, and reconciliation. However, since the Munich conference, at which Chamberlain and Daladier gave in to the brutal pressure applied by Hitler and agreed to the dismembering of Czechoslovakia, the concept has been a negative one. Since that time, it has no longer stood for sound, but for anxious reconciliation; not for the wise conclusion of compromises, but for dishonorable capitulation; not moderate compromise, but lily-livered conciliation. Historical analogies are a lottery. Every situation is different. It can be just as wrong to be blind with regard to the lessons of Munich as it is to apply them blindly to the wrong situation. The ability to recognize, compare, and distinguish remains the most difficult aspect of the art of statesmanship. A long time ago, Hans J. Morgenthau, the doyen of the subject of international relations, produced an appropriate criterion that is worth heeding. He wrote: "Appeasement is a corrupt compromise policy. What is erroneous about it is that it considers an imperialist policy to be a policy for maintaining the status quo." Morgenthau preached that that would be fatal. He also warned: "It would only be marginally less risky to react to a policy that only seeks to achieve adjustments within the existing state of affairs, as if it were an imperialist policy." Thus, the first question is: Are we going to write -- under different circumstances -- 1938 once again? The plain answer is no. Today, there is no one who resolutely wants war, who wants war in the way that Hitler did (his appetite for expansion was in no way whetted by Munich -- he wanted his war long before that). There is no one anywhere who is being ruthlessly blackmailed with territorial demands. Just as the European democracies in their weakness gave in to Europe's dictators in the 1930's, today, the situation is reversed, the point being to support the democrats in Russia in order to prevent the emergence of a new dictator. The next question is: Can a democratic Russia also pose a threat to East Europe and even West Europe? The straightforward answer is, of course, in principle it can. Russia remains a great power simply by virtue of the area it covers, its location in both Europe and Asia and its arsenal of nuclear weapons. It was always unrealistic to believe that it will withdraw from world politics as a eunuch state without interests following the collapse of communism. Democracies also have foreign policy interests, fears, and ambitions. They can become uncomfortable and go off course, especially if they owe their establishment to a total collapse, if they feel hurt, if they imagine that they are "undefeated in the field," and if, because of their amputation from the old state body, they suffer from imagined pains that can only be eased with difficulty. A new imperialism can easily develop on that kind of soil. However, distinctions have to be made: between the "internal" empire of the tsars and commissars that collapsed at the end of 1991, and Stalin's "external empire," which collapsed in 1990. More than just traces remain of the internal empire: common structures, close economic ties, monetary policy ties, and security interests. These links can only be separated from each other with difficulty. It would even make practical sense for some of those elements to be brought together again in a way that would benefit all. When Yeltsin says that the CIS states have realized that there are many problems that they cannot solve by themselves, that without cooperating, they will not survive by themselves, there is nothing threatening about that. That Russia sees itself in a protective role with regard to 25 million Russians in the "the abroad near at hand" can only with difficulty be immediately termed an expression of new expansionism. If Hitler had only insisted that the rights of the Sudeten Germans be respected, then no one could have leveled any accusations against him. Russia has legitimate interests to protect. The West can only demand that these interests be protected with peaceful means and in accordance with the principles of the CSCE charter, and that is all that it can demand. The situation with respect to the former external empire -- the former Warsaw Pact states and the Baltic republics that Stalin brought back under the Russian yoke by force with the assistance of Hitler -- is entirely different. No one can doubt that Russia has interests there, but a kind of "Monroeski Doctrine" that gives Moscow a dominant influence in that area is unacceptable. That area is also the "abroad near at hand" for the West. The West also has interests there. NATO has abandoned shifting its alliance borders from the Oder to the Bug, but the expectation underpinning that is that the great power Russia will not act in a big power way there and throw its weight about. So far, there has been no reason to consider that expectation unjustified or unrealistic, and that also applies to the latest statements made by [Russian Foreign Minister] Kozyrev, statements which require clarification. So far, the East European states have been seeking to join NATO for very different and egoistical reasons, reasons that have nothing to do with the actual degree of threat. That made it easy for NATO to offer the Partnership for Peace as an interim solution. It offers two chances. Either Russia becomes drawn into it, which makes full membership superfluous or means membership could be extended to Russia too. Or, if Russia displays a dangerous new expansionist impulse, then a new clear demarcation line will have to be drawn, NATO's border will have to be moved 800 kilometers to the east. Following the Partnership for Peace adjustment phase, this would be easier, more effective, and more reliable than today. This interim solution has nothing to do with yielding to pressure. It is far removed from all thinking in terms of "worst case" categories, the worst is not considered inevitable. However, that does not oblige the West to entertain a "best case" illusion, a boundless expectation of a condition of general bliss. It is pragmatic in the best sense. It does not maliciously provoke what we should fear, and it does not rule out any of the things that we should do if things turn out differently. Cowardice? No, wise statesmanship.
