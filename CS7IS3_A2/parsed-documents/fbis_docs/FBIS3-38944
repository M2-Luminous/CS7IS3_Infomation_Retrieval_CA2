Serb and Muslim military commanders agreed to a ceasefire and the Bosnian Serb army pledged to withdraw its artillery guns from around the city. However, NATO members remained cynical about the effectiveness of the ceasefire given the notoriously short time previous deals have lasted. The agreement came as NATO threatened air strikes if the Serbs did not withdraw from Sarajevo. Following a meeting of NATO ambassadors in Brussels, the alliance agreed to threaten air strikes unless the Serbs withdraw heavy weapons from around Sarajevo within a maximum of 10 days. Tonight, the ambassadors were still discussing whether to describe the threat publicly as an ultimatum, said one alliance source, adding: "But there is now agreement in principle that a deadline will be set, beyond which air strikes will be used. The rest of the discussion concerns details, not the principle." The agreement came only a couple of weeks after the arrival of Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose as the new UN commander in Bosnia. With the unqualified backing of the Government for tough action, the former SAS [Special Air Service] chief has had a dramatic effect on Serb intransigence. An impressive figure with piercing, cold blue eyes and an equally impressive military record, he has warned the leaders of the warring factions that he will no longer tolerate interference in UN operations. But above all, he has convinced them he is not bluffing and that he is not a man to be messed with. It was clear tonight that Sir Michael's tough new stance together with the West's determination to use the savage marketplace massacre in which 68 civilians died at the weekend to force a peace accord in Sarajevo had placed the Serbs on the back foot. The talks in Sarajevo were attended by Muslim army Gen Jovan Divjak and Bosnian Serb Gen Manojlo Milovanovic. Sir Michael reportedly shuttled back and forth between the Muslim and Serb representatives in separate rooms at Sarajevo airport. It is proposed that UN soldiers will take over sensitive positions in and around Sarajevo, he said. In Brussels, the NATO meeting opened with a general debate about delivering an ultimatum to the Serbs, giving them a timetable for withdrawing from Sarajevo or face air strikes. The most reluctant participants in such a threat remain the Canadians, Spanish, Greeks and the British, although Mr Major has made it clear the Government is ready to support a "muscular" response. He is willing to endorse an ultimatum, with the threat of air strikes to follow, "provided the commanders judge it appropriate." But Britain's NATO ambassador John Weston was at pains to emphasise that Britain remains convinced a negotiated settlement of the war in the former Yugoslavia is the only long-term solution. The political implications of any NATO action are still being analysed -- but today's talks indicate overwhelming agreement that last Saturday's [5 February] market massacre marked what Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd called "a turning point" in the 22-month war. President Clinton called Mr Major and had a 30-minute phone conversation this afternoon to discuss the Bosnia situation in detail, Downing Street said. It was learned later that Mr Clinton tried to telephone the Prime Minister last night. But Mr Major was aloft in a helicopter at the time and the call was rescheduled for this afternoon. Downing Street said of the call later: "This was a very good and productive conversation. The Prime Minister and President agreed that what was needed was a clear decision from NATO for the use of air power to support UNPROFOR's [UN Protection Force] efforts to stop the bombardment of civilians in Sarajevo. The President acknowledged that the safety of British and other UNPROFOR troops on the ground was a very important consideration." Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown, commenting on today's developments, said: "This shows that a tough attitude towards the Serbs would have yielded dividends before. It is vital that the pressure is kept up on the Serbs and that the United Nations maintains its initiative. The right next step would be to open Tuzla Airport."
