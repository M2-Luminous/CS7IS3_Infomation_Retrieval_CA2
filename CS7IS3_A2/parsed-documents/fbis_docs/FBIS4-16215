Central Electoral Commission Expects To Push it Though State Duma Before Summer Recess"] [Text] Nikolay Ryabov, chairman of the Central Electoral Commission [CEC], has said that one of these days he will submit to the president the draft law "On the Main Guarantees of the Electoral Rights of Russian Federation Citizens," drawn up by CEC experts. The document will reaffirm the "framework" provisions regulating the conduct of elections, which under the new Constitution should be "specified" in local election statutes in each Federation component. The CEC chief recalled that in the absence of "federal legal guidelines" regional elections were held from December to April only on the basis of local enforceable enactments. The draft law, its authors say, will guarantee the right to appeal in court against the violation of electoral rights, a right which was not set forth in some local "electoral codes." This version, however, also merely mentions the responsibility of violators, but lacks a specific mechanism of punishing them. What Nikolay Ryabov sees as the "key" provision of the new law is the solution to the question of the Central Electoral Commission's funding: according to the draft, a separate line in the government budget will be introduced to finance the CEC. Ryabov explained that "the government has suggested that it itself should give us money, as it gives it to any ministry, but we refused, seeing this as a matter decisive for the commission's independence." CEC members will be appointed by all branches of power: the CEC chairman, by the president; his deputy and six commission members, by the Federation Council; and the CEC secretary and the other six members, by the State Duma. Local electoral commissions will be formed under the new law "on a parity basis" by regional representative and executive branches of power. The draft stipulates "equal terms" and "equal rights" in the nomination of candidates by electoral associations. The term "electoral association" itself is defined in the draft as "a public association, the charter of which envisions participation in elections, created and registered in accordance with law not later than six months before the announced date of the respective elections." "Independent" candidates will be required under a provision of the draft law to state their party affiliation publicly. According to Mr. Ryabov, this was done taking into account the lessons of the recent local elections "so as activists of a certain hue, who have already been branded three times, will no longer be able to pass for lambs." The final draft of the law will be presented today to the roundtable at the Central Electoral Commission, to which State Duma and Federation Council deputies, leaders of political parties, and influential public figures have been invited. According to Aleksandr Ivanchenko, deputy chairman of the Central Electoral Commission, the draft was approved in general by senior officials at the presidential administration. Nikolay Ryabov hopes that the president himself will also approve the document and will sponsor it at the State Duma as his own legislative initiative. Afterward, the CEC chief thinks, the State Duma will have to pass the law "On the Main Guarantees of the Electoral Rights of Russian Federation Citizens" even before its summer recess.
