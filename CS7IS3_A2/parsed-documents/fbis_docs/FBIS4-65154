Addressing True Path Party deputies, Ciller pointed out that significant success was achieved in this respect during the past few weeks. She said: Compare the nine years from 1984 to 1994 with the period of the 50th government and you will see that the total number of terrorists caught or killed during the two periods is equal. Our government is continuing to wage a decisive and determined struggle to get this issue to the bottom of our agenda. We will fulfill our claim. We will not be embarrassed. We started off on this matter saying we will end it, and we are determined to bring it to a conclusion. The prime minister stressed that the security forces, which carried out their duties with loyalty, self-sacrifice, and in a patriotic manner, played a major role in this success. She extended her gratitude to the security forces. In her speech, Prime Minister Ciller pointed out that the talks held with the United Nations in connection with the Turkish unit that will serve in Bosnia-Herzegovina have ended. The Turkish unit will arrive there in the second half of June, she said, adding that this is the first time in the history of the republic that such a thing is happening. Ciller said: It is the first time that a Turkish unit is being sent to Europe. I cannot think of anything more natural, because the struggle in our country against terrorism and against illegal aggression is being waged everywhere without religious or racial discrimination. There were Turkish troops in Korea and in Somalia. Turkish politics opposed aggression during the last crisis in Iraq. Moreover, our country has always opposed aggression in Azerbaijan and everywhere else, without discrimination. As a result, nothing could be more natural than for a Turkish unit to take part in such a struggle in Europe. Ciller said that most of the equipment needed for reinforcement of the Turkish unit and not found in the inventory of the Turkish Armed Forces is being acquired from public organizations, institutions, and through supplementary funds. The prime minister stressed that by moving their heavy weapons to the outskirts of the city of Brcko and by effecting a military buildup to widen the (Kosovino) corridor, the Serbs are creating a new crisis in the region. She stated that the United Nations and NATO must urgently pass resolutions granting this region the status of a region purged of heavy weapons. This is essential, she said, to demonstrate once again the international community's determination against aggression and to deter the Serbs.
