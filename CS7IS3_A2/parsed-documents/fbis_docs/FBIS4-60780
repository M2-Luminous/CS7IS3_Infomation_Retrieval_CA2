The trial started last December. The eight were first charged with anti-state activities but the accusations were changed to milder ones as the trial proceeded. The court sentenced Valeri Ivanov, former leader of the pro- Soviet Yedinstvo (Unity) movement, to 3 1/2 years in jail. The court said Ivanov helped Soviet troops to guard the Lithuanian radio and TV building that was seized Jan. 13, 1991. On that day, 13 civilians were killed and hundreds more injured defending the TV tower and state institutions from Soviet tanks. The court failed to come up with evidence proving that the defendants organized assaults on radio and TV buildings. Ivanov will have to spend only 5 months in jail because the time since his arrest was included in the punishment and the amnesty law was applied. Some of his accomplices, who were sentenced to 3 1/2 years in jail, will be imprisoned for less than a month. Two out of eight former activists were fined 1,500 lits and one was sentenced to 5 1/2 years in jail. Aleksandr Smotkin, who set off two grenades near a Lithuanian border post in November 1991, was sentenced to an eight-year jail term. The state prosecutor said the explosions endangered the lives of four Lithuanian officials, who escaped death only by mere chance. The amnesty law was not applied in Smotkin's case, but the time since his arrest was included in the punishment.
