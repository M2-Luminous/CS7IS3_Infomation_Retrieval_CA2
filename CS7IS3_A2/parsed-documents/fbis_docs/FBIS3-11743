Although their spying activities were initiated on 1 January, they were reinforced as of 1 February. They have been intercepting and copying the EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Army] messages in the jungle, the mountains, and the city through short wave radio. By using laser systems in the sending and receiving of sound waves, high sensitivity microphones, and satellites they were able to detect the messages and the exact location of the Zapatist delegation and "subcommander Marcos" within the cathedral during the peace dialogue. With this same system military intelligence reportedly had knowledge of the guerrilla delegates' private conversations, their plans, and agreements. A Mexican Army officer, who requested to remain anonymous for security reasons, confirmed the spy actions. Not even Camacho knows that we know everything he said. We know everything. The only thing we do not know is what the Zapatists were thinking, he said. He explained that Military Intelligence used communications technology imported from the United States and Asia and installed a sound tracking system. With the help of a Peace Cathedral blueprint, and with the use of a laser, the dormitories of the EZLN delegates of the "subcommander Marcos" as well as the dining and meeting areas were located. The sound waves reached us through a laser that was sent to the interior of the cathedral. The laser is sent and it returns, picking up sounds, words, sentences, and whole conversations, the officer added. The espionage's objective was the cathedral where the negotiations between Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis, the 18 guerrilla delegates, and Bishop Samuel Ruiz were held. The officer explained that on military bases there are desks with communication radios, scanners, and telephones. Parabolic antennas as well as reading monitors, and microphone recording equipment -- called "little birds" ["pajaritos"] -- that read the sounds inside the cathedral are located on other bases. Four Military Intelligence members are engaged in 24-hour shifts at each base. They carry earphones and maintain constant communication with the main base. With the highly sensitive systems they collect information. Military personnel write up daily reports on the conversations. These are subsequently sent to the 7th Military Region located in Tuxtla Gutierrez. The same information is sent to National Defense Secretary Antonio Riviello Bazan. In espionage houses, not identified by the officer, monitors receive the sound waves. "The system used during the dialogue currently includes very sophisticated microphones that are placed in the exterior walls of the Peace Cathedral. These are well hidden and they are able to receive information through the walls," the informer added. Besides the espionage activity, the guerrillas' communications in the jungle and in the mountains are being monitored.
