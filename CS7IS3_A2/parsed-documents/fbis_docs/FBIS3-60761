There were no injuries. Shortly after the Tuesday blast, police found large amounts of explosives in several places at a block of flats in Algoa Park, about 15km from Swartkops. Officers said at the time police were investigating a possible link between the blast and the explosives seized. The caller said the sabotage was part of Azanla's campaign for the complete liberation of all Azanians. "The struggle will continue until we are all free." There was no way of independently confirming the caller was from Azanla, armed wing of the Black Consciousness Movement of Azania, which has rejected the constitutional deal reached in negotiations at Kempton Park.
