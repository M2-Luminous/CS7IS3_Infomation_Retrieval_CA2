Wednesday's strike of airline pilots, involving three per cent of all the crews, has been suspended. On Thursday, a delegation of the union of pilots is to meet officials from the Labour Ministry at the ministry's headquarters. The meeting is expected to consider the pilots' demands. "We have postponed the action until June 2 to make another attempt to find a common language with the ministries and departments which can solve our problems", Alfred Malinovsky, leader of the union, told ITAR-TASS. "The negotiations will focus on safety of pilots and pensions for the airline staffs. Now the pension benefit of an airline veteran comes to only 65 thousand roubles. By the way, we do not demand extra funds from the state budget - we are ready to contribute the bulk to the pension fund", Malinovsky said. The pilots believe the problems of job cuts are not of less importance. The current state of affairs does not rule out dismissal of some eight thousand best-skilled pilots aged from 27 to 37 years. This may lead to a sharp growth in crashes. The pilots propose to creat a foundation of airline personnel employment which will care for provision of jobs for the most experienced personnel. On Thursday, the Moscow municipal court is to consider the action brought by the office of the Russian prosecutor-general against the union of pilots. According to the action, the strike must be declared illegal. The case was to be heard on Wednesday, but the hearing was postponed because the union's representatives did not turn up.
