FR940602-1-00004 FR940602-1-00003 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION 10 CFR Part 72 RIN 3150&hyph;AF02 List of Approved Spent Fuel Storage Casks: Addition AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to amend its regulations to add the Standardized NUHOMS Horizontal Modular Storage System to the List of Approved Spent Fuel Storage Casks. This amendment will allow the holders of power reactor operating licenses to store spent fuel in this approved cask under a general license. DATES: Submit comments by August 16, 1994. Comments received after this date will be considered if it is practical to do so, but the Commission is able to assure consideration only for comments received on or before this date. ADDRESSES: Send comments to: The Secretary, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555. ATTN: Docketing and Service Branch. Deliver comments to: One White Flint North, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland, between 7:45 a.m. and 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of the comments received and the environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact can be examined at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC. Single copies of these documents can be obtained from Mr. G. E. Gundersen, Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, telephone (301) 492&hyph;3803. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. G. E. Gundersen, Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, telephone (301) 492&hyph;3803; or Mr K. C. Leu, Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, telephone (301) 504&hyph;2685. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Section 218(a) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (NWPA) directs that, ``[T]he Secretary [of the Department of Energy (DOE)] shall establish a demonstration program in cooperation with the private sector, for the dry storage of spent nuclear fuel at civilian power reactor sites, with the objective of establishing one or more technologies that the [Nuclear Regulatory] Commission may, by rule, approve for use at the sites of civilian nuclear power reactors without, to the maximum extent practicable, the need for additional site-specific approvals by the NRC.'' Section 133 of the NWPA states, in part, that ``the Commission shall, by rule, establish procedures for the licensing of any technology approved by the Commission under Section 218(a) for use at the site of any civilian nuclear power reactor.'' To implement this mandate, the Commission approved dry storage of spent nuclear fuel in NRC-approved casks, publishing a final rule on 10 CFR Part 72 entitled ``General License for Storage of Spent Fuel at Power Reactor Sites'' (55 FR 29181). This rule also established a new subpart L within 10 CFR part 72 entitled ``Approval of Spent Fuel Storage Casks,'' containing procedures and criteria for obtaining NRC approval of dry storage cask designs. The 1990 rulemaking listed four casks in §72.214 of subpart K as approved by the NRC for storage of spent fuel at power reactor sites under general license by persons authorized to possess or operate nuclear power reactors. Since then, two more casks have been listed in §72.214, one on April 7, 1993 (58 FR 17948) and another on October 5, 1993 (58 FR 51762). Discussion This proposed rulemaking would add the Standardized NUHOMS Horizontal Modular Storage System to the list of NRC approved casks for spent fuel storage in §72.214. Following the procedures specified in §72.230 of Subpart L, VECTRA Technologies, Inc. (formerly Pacific Nuclear Fuel Services, Inc. (PNFSI)) 1 submitted an application for NRC approval, together with a ``Safety Analysis Report for the Standardized NUHOMS Horizontal Modular Storage System for Irradiated Nuclear Fuel'' (SAR), NUH&hyph;003, Revision 2, dated November 1993. The NRC evaluated VECTRA's submittal and issued a draft Safety Evaluation Report (SER) on VECTRA'S SAR and a draft certificate of compliance for the Standardized NUHOMS Horizontal Modular Storage System. On January 24, 1994, Pacific Nuclear Systems, Inc., (parent company of PNSFI) changed its name to VECTRA Technologies, Inc., after it acquired ABB Impell Corporation. 1 On January 24, 1994, Pacific Nuclear Systems, Inc., (parent company of PNFSI) changed its name to VECTRA Technologies Inc. The NRC is proposing to approve VECTRA's Standardized NUHOMS Modular Storage System for Irradiated Nuclear Fuel, for storage of spent fuel under the conditions specified in the draft certificate of compliance. This cask, when used in accordance with the conditions specified in the certificate of compliance and NRC regulations, will meet the requirements of 10 CFR Part 72; thus, adequate protection of the public health and safety would be ensured. This cask is being proposed for listing under §72.214, ``List of Approved Spent Fuel Storage Casks'' to allow holders of power reactor operating licensees to store spent fuel in this cask under a general license. The certificate of compliance would terminate 20 years after the effective date of the final rule listing the cask in §72.214, unless the cask's certificate of compliance is renewed. The certificate contains conditions for use which are similar to those for other NRC approved casks, however, the certificate of compliance for each cask may differ in some specifics_such as, certificate number, operating procedures, training exercises, spent fuel specification. The draft certificate of compliance for the Standardized NUHOMS cask and the underlying draft SER, are available for inspection and comment at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC. Single copies of the proposed certificate of compliance may be obtained from Mr. K. C. Leu, Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, telephone (301) 504&hyph;2685.
