They are also calling for the rejection of all agreements with the FRY until the Serb occupation army withdraws from the territory of the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, until all expelled persons are allowed to return to their homes, and until the FRY explicitly recognizes the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and their internationally recognized borders. Djapic also disclosed that the merger of the three parties into the Croatian Party of Rights can be expected in the near future.
