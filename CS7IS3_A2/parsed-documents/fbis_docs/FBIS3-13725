Under the headline "The Peace Process and the New Opportunity," AL-BA'TH says in its editorial: In a new effort to activate the stalemated peace process, Syria has called on the Arab parties to the peace process to meet to discuss the resumption of the bilateral talks. AL-BA'TH stresses that many factors call for this move. First, it stresses Syria's commitment to the peace efforts and the need to advance the peace process toward its aspired objective. Second, it is completely in line with international legitimacy. This is because it immediately follows the UN Security Council resolution condemning the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and calling for the protection of our kinsfolk in the occupied territories. Third, the decision to suspend the bilateral negotiations was made after coordination among Syria and the other Arab parties to protest the Hebron massacre. Thus, Syria has reaffirmed its concern for the security of our kinfolk in the occupied territories and the need to provide all means of protection for them. This is in order to prevent the occurrence of any new crimes, which the occupation may commit at any moment if it is not deterred by the international community. The paper indicates that Syria's decision, which was made after intensive Arab and international contacts, will give the peace process a new opportunity to achieve its objectives. Concluding its editorial, AL-BA'TH says that the [UN Security Council] resolution, one way or another, reflects the responsibility of the international community, which rejects bloodshed and occupation. This responsibility must be carried out by pressuring the Rabin government into responding to the requirements of peace. TISHRIN's editorial focuses on the UN Security Council resolution, which strongly condemns the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and calls on Israel to confiscate Zionist settlers's weapons. The resolution also calls for the protection of the Palestinian people and an international presence in the occupied Arab territories, as well as stressing the need to continue efforts to boost the peace process. TISHRIN says that, belated as it is, the UN Security Council resolution is a positive step that will boost the peace process and urge Israel to respect the Geneva Conventions and comply with the UN Security Council resolutions. The resolution also reflects an explicit commitment to the need to protect the Palestinian people from the Zionist settlers' acts and practices. Referring to the contacts held among President Hafiz al-Asad, U.S. President Clinton, Lebanese President al-Hirawi, and King Husayn of Jordan, TISHRIN says: It is obvious that the U.S. Administration is interested in the resumption of the peace efforts and that it realizes the dangers of the continued Israeli prevarication. Stressing sincere Arab intentions toward a genuine just, comprehensive peace in the Middle East, Syria has announced that the parties to the Washington talks will soon consider the resumption of the talks, which were suspended in solidarity with the Palestinian people to express denunciation of Israel's appalling crime. The paper adds: The interest in continuing the peace process proceeds from the need to put Israel to the test, expose its false claims about peace, convince the international community to assume its responsibilities, and to deduce lessons from two years of futile talks in Washington. Concluding its editorial, TISHRIN urges the international community to rectify matters and to move after the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre to confront Israel's ceaseless efforts to obstruct the Washington talks. Commenting on the same subject, AL-THAWRAH says that UN Security Council Resolution No. 904 condemning the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre clearly reflects the international community's eagerness to enforce its laws and conventions and to prevent Israel from continuing its defiance and disregard for international legitimacy. AL-THAWRAH adds: Hopes are now pinned on a firm international will to find an appropriate mechanism for the enforcement of the resolution to force Israel to comply with all its paragraphs. Past experience has shown that the Israeli rulers deal with UN resolutions with disdain and derision, and that they will not abandon this provocative course unless there is effective pressure to force them to do so. The paper urges the influential UN Security Council member states to intensify their moves and efforts to ensure the credibility of the resolution and to spare it the fate of other resolutions, which remained ink on paper without any effect on the ground. AL-THAWRAH says that the circumstances that led to the Hebron massacre will continue to exist as long as the settlements remain in the occupied Arab territories, as long as armed settlers are roaming the streets, and as long as they have the authority to open fire on Arabs.
