Hosokawa made the call in a morning cabinet meeting in response to pressure from the United States and elsewhere for Japan to harmonize its economy with that of the rest of the world. In the Japan-U.S. trade framework negotiations, Washington has proposed dozens of new targets for deregulation. Hosokawa called deregulation a vital component of the government's economic reforms and said it must be actively tackled to promote harmonious economic relations with other countries.
