FBIS4-7303 "dreas083_l_94004" FBIS-EAS-94-083 Daily Report 26 Apr 1994 Philippines `People's Court' Indict Breakaway Leaders `People's Court' Indict Breakaway Leaders BK2904045694 Quezon City MALAYA in English 26 Apr 94 pp 1, 2 BK2904045694 Quezon City MALAYA English BFN [Text] Communists in the breakaway factions who are opposed to Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) founder Jose Maria Sison have been charged with kidnapping and holdups, embezzlement, corruption of comrades and gross misrepresentation and usurpation of authority. They will be tried in a "people's court," the party said yesterday. In a statement, CPP spokesman Gregorio "Comrade Roger" Rosal, also said the "court" may resort to "extraordinary measures" to get the side of Arturo Tabara, Romulo Kintanar, Ricardo Reyes and Felimon Lagman. He did not say what those measures would be. It was hinted, however, that the former rebel leaders facing charges might themselves be made to face the "people's court." "Alang-alang sa rebolusyonaryong katarungan, hindi tututulan ng Partido kung ang hukumang bayan ay gagawa ng mga ekstraordinaryong hakbang upang makuha ang panig ng mga akusado -- basta't may sapat na mga pananggalang laban sa peligro ng pagkakanulo sa kaaway [For the sake of the truth in the revolutionary movement, the Party will not object if the `people's court' will take extraordinary measures to get the side of the accused -- as long as there is sufficient basis of threat from the enemies]," Rosal said. He also said the Party was not in a hurry to proceed with the trial. "Alam namin ang maraming malalaking gawain at maraming limitasyong hinaharap ngayon ng mga kasama sa rebolusyonaryong kilusan. Ang mahalaga ay maitala nang buong linaw ang malalaking kriminal na pananagutan nina Reyes, Tabara, Kintanar at Lagman at ilantad sila upang hindi makapanlinlang [We know that there are more important things to do at this moment and the members in the movement face some limitations. But, what is important is that it will be clearly put on record the criminal offenses of Reyes, Tabara, Kintanar and Lagman, so that they can no longer beguile any one else]," Rosal said. Amid the most serious rift to hit the rebel movement in 20 years, the National Democratic Front (NDF) held a "reception" last Sunday at The Netherlands to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the New People's Army (NPA) and the 21st anniversary of the NDF. A statement from the NDF leadership in Utrecht said more than 100 took part in the celebration, along with guests from Japan, Indonesia, India, Germany, Belgium, The Netherlands , the United States as well as a "big number of Filipinos residing in The Netherlands." Despite Philippine government pronouncements that the leftist rebellion has been all but defeated, Sison declared that the Philippine revolution holds a "bright future." The ongoing "rectification movement" that involves the purging of rebels who refuse to toe the party line was deemed by Sison to be necessary in "ensuring the steady advance and victory of the revolutionary movement" The "Democratic Bloc," the group formed by former comrades of Sison who now oppose him, recently announced that members and leaders of sectoral organizations affiliated with the NDF have joined the anti-Sison faction. Yesterday, however, a statement from Reverend Wesley Fiore, national spokesperson for the Christians for National Liberation (CNL), said Father Felipe Patricio no longer speaks for the organization. The CNL, one of the organizations under the NDF, said the CPPs organizational problems are its own. The CNL represents members of the religious organizations in the underground movement. Active rebel members have no business speaking for their former comrades who want to avail themselves of the amnesty program, Senator Rodolfo Biazon (Laban -- Struggle) yesterday said. He issued the statement after conducting a series of public hearings where rebel returnees complained that the objections raised by rebel leaders to Proclamation No. 347 will deprive them of their choice to lead a peaceful life. He said the typical response of former rebels in the regions was articulated by one Manuel Raga in Tuguegarao whom he quoted as saying: "We are sick and tired of Sison, Jalandoni, Honasan and Misuari speaking for us. We have already left their movements. All we want is a peaceful life " Proclamation 347 grants amnesty to communist and Muslim rebels who may have committed crimes against public order in pursuit of their political beliefs. Biazon, who heads the committee, has conducted hearings in Tuguegarao, Cagayan; Naga City; Catbalogan, Samar; lloilo City; lligan City and Davao City.
