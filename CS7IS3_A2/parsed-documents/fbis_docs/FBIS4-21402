Can pesticide and fertilizer consulting, a water tax, or ecological cultivation methods provide lasting protection for ground water? This question was examined by the Regional Association of Osnabruck. The requirements of healthy conditions for life include clean air, unpolluted soil and pure water. In most regions, however, the environment has been disturbed by the far-reaching actions of mankind. A matter of concern for the working group on process technology of the VDI Regional Association of Osnabruck is to discuss environmental problems in their own region and to list solution approaches. The conference series of "Environmentally Friendly Agriculture" was initiated from these considerations. The VDI Regional Association, with the Center for the Environment and Technology, and the Osnabruck City Department of Works organized this series for the fourth time. The topic of protecting the ground water was the central theme of the last conference. Obtaining water in rural areas, e.g., even in the area of Osnabruck, is impaired to a great degree by agriculture. To increase yield, large quantities of nitrate and pesticides are applied to the fields. After a time delay, some of these materials appear in the ground water and must be removed by the water treatment plants at great expense to be able to supply drinking water with the prescribed quality. What can be done to reduce the introduction of nitrates and pesticides into the ground water? Horst Wieligmann, from the Osnabruck City Department of Works, presented an initiative. The Osnabruck City Department of Works has now purchased fields, stopped the intensive agriculture there and leased the land with a great amount of support for ecological cultivation. "Unfortunately, the market situation for grain, fruit and vegetables cultivated ecologically is so poor that no farmer can be advised to do this," complains Horst Wieligmann about the current situation. Ecological agriculture makes do without pesticides. However, the harvest is poorer than in conventional agriculture, and soil cultivation must be more intensive and incurs greater expense. For the use of fertilizer, balance sheets are drawn up. In these sheets, the quantity of fertilizer used, e.g., liquid manure, is correlated with the consumption of the individual types of grain or plants. "On a biofarm, nitrogen is always scarce and costs the farmer 5 to 10 Deutsche marks per kg," calculates the farmer Dipl.-Ing. agr. Rudolf Joost-Meyer zu Bakum. He was of the opinion that a reduction of nitrate could be achieved in conventional agriculture if, first, the use of fertilizer was optimized and, second, mineral nitrogen would become more expensive by 300 to 700%. "Use of nitrogen must be controlled on a market economy basis." Important prerequisites for converting conventional farms are motivation of the farm management, capital for additional technology, market desire, and comprehensive specialized advice. In Baden-Wurttemberg, a regulation applying uniformly over the entire Land was enacted for the utilization of agricultural fields to protect the ground water. In this way, a legal instrument was created that made it possible to enact regulations based on scientific knowledge as minimum requirements for agriculture and to facilitate the conversion without incurring financial penalties and by means of intensive consultation. Problems that occur can be solved in research projects, model tests and pilot projects. A series of requirements and bans is contained in the regulation. For example, these include a plowing ban for permanent meadowland, restrictions on fertilization and irrigation, and even the restriction of soil cultivation. Only pesticides specified in a positive list may be used. Conversion of cultivation methods without financial penalties Jochen Mund is the construction director in Ministry for the Environment of Baden-Wurttemberg. He placed special emphasis on the fact that converting the cultivation methods must occur without economic disadvantages. The regulation ensures a financial compensation of 310.00 Deutsche marks per hectare or a lump sum. The water intake fee (0.10 Deutsche marks/m[.sup]3[/]), that the Land demands of the water-supply and distribution system, is used for the compensation payments. Mund says that initial experience with the regulation shows that reducing nitrogen fertilization alone is not sufficient. Additional measures, e.g., reduced soil cultivation, sodding, no fallow land, restrictions in problem areas and culture, are required. Reactions in the ground water, even with this, are not to be expected in the short term. The interplay of many measures and the elimination of many traditional methods will, in the opinion of Jochen Mund, help the regulation achieve the necessary success. "If experts fertilize the corn, the drinking water will remain pure." His motto clearly shows that a great need of optimization exists. Sufficient consultation, controlled tests, optimization of the cultivation method and soil tests before fertilizer is used can lead to a minimization of the nitrate pollution in the ground water over the long term. In the area of Osnabruck, a cooperative project between agriculture and the water-supply and distribution system, supported by the Land of Lower Saxony, was started in 1991. The goal of this project was to make provisions for ground water protection by advising farmers. This project is being run by the Weser-Ems Chamber of Agriculture and it is being supported financially by the Osnabruck City Department of Works. Ulrich Wordemann is the agricultural director for the Weser-Ems Chamber of Agriculture. He presented the project. As the starting point, utilization and cultivation conditions were determined on a voluntary basis to make possible optimization of fertilizer use. At the same time, demonstration fields with fertilization appropriate for the need were cultivated so as to show the results of this cultivation to the farmers. Until now, only a few farmers who are regularly keeping field impact card files are participating in this project. These card files are evaluated on a scale greater than a single farm to be able to follow the nutrient cycle. The quick determination of the ammonia concentration in liquid manure that shows the farmer how much fertilizer he has applied has proven to be an important instrument in this project. The object of all these measures is to make the farmer an expert who views ground water protection as a matter of concern to him personally.
