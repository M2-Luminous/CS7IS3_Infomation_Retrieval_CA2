"N'Zi 94" will therefore be the first major military maneuver undertaken by the Ivorian Army in 10 years. Franco-Ivorian maneuvers were suspended for essentially economic reasons. This year, the Ministry of Defense and the military general staff have decided to organize, in conjunction with the French, a joint exercise which will mobilize over 1,200 men, 250 light vehicles and tanks, 10 combat planes, and three naval ships. Because of the economic crisis, France will make a substantial contribution to the success of the operation. It will bear the cost of fuel, ammunition, and food rations. [passage omitted]
