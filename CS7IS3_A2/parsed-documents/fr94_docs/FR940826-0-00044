FR940826-0-00044 FR940826-0-00014 (3) The absence for more than three months, or a 25 percent reduction in time devoted to the project, by the approved project director or principal investigator. (4) The need for additional Federal funding. (5) The transfer of amounts budgeted for indirect costs to absorb increases in direct costs, or vice versa, if approval is required by the Federal awarding agency. (6) The inclusion, unless waived by the Federal awarding agency, of costs that require prior approval in accordance with OMB Circular A&hyph;21, ``Cost Principles for Institutions of Higher Education,'' OMB Circular A&hyph;122, ``Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations,'' or 45 CFR part 74 Appendix E, ``Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Research and Development under Grants and Contracts with Hospitals,'' or 48 CFR part 31, ``Contract Cost Principles and Procedures,'' as applicable. (7) The transfer of funds allotted for training allowances (direct payment to trainees) to other categories of expense. (8) Unless described in the application and funded in the approved award, the subaward, transfer or contracting out of any work under an award. This provision does not apply to the purchase of supplies, material, equipment, or general support services. (d) No other prior approval requirements for specific items may be imposed unless a deviation has been approved by OMB. (e) Except for requirements listed in paragraph (c)(1) and (c)(4) of this section, Federal Awarding agencies are authorized, at their option to waive cost-related and administrative prior written approvals required by this subpart and OMB Circulars A&hyph;21 and A&hyph;122. Such waivers may include authorizing recipients to do any one or more of the following: (1) Incur pre-award costs 90 calendar days prior to award or more than 90 calendar days with the prior approval of the Federal awarding agency. All pre-award costs are incurred at the recipient's risk (i.e., the Federal awarding agency is under no obligation to reimburse such costs if for any reason the recipient does not receive an award or if the award is less than anticipated and inadequate to cover such costs). (2) Initiate a one-time extension of the expiration date of the award of up to 12 months unless one or more of the conditions listed below apply. For one-time extensions, the recipient must notify the Federal awarding agency in writing, with the supporting reasons and revised expiration date, at least 10 days before the expiration date specified in the award. This one-time extension may not be exercised merely for the purpose of using unobligated balances. The conditions that prevent issuance of a one-time extension are: (i) the terms and conditions of award prohibit the extension; (ii) the extension requires additional Federal funds; or (iii) the extension involves any change in the approved objectives or scope of the project. (3) Carry forward unobligated balances to subsequent funding periods. (4) For awards the support research, unless the Federal awarding agency provides otherwise in the award or in the agency's regulations, the prior approval requirements described in paragraph (e)(1) through (3) of this section are automatically waived (i.e., recipients need not obtain such prior approvals) unless one of the conditions included in paragraph (e)(2) applies. (f) The Federal awarding agency may, at its option, restrict the transfer of funds among direct cost categories or programs, functions, and activities for awards in which the Federal share of the project exceeds $100,000 and the cumulative amount of the transfer exceeds or is expected to exceed 10 percent of the total budget as last approved by the Federal awarding agency. No Federal awarding agency shall permit a transfer that would cause any Federal appropriation or part thereof to be used for purposes other than those consistent with the original intent of the appropriation. (g) No other changes to nonconstruction budgets, except for the changes described in paragraph (j) of this section require prior approval. (h) For construction awards, recipients shall request prior written approval promptly from Federal awarding agencies for budget revisions whenever paragraph (h)(1), (2) or (3) of this section apply: (1) the revision results from changes in the scope or the objective of the project or program;
