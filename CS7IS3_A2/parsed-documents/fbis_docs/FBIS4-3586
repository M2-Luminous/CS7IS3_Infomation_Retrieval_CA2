The provincial committee of the CPPCC has become an important source for the government of Anhui in east China to make decisions. By the end of last month, 645 of the 653 proposals made by members of the first session of the seventh congress of the provincial committee of the CPPCC have been dealt with by the local government. Some 426 of the proposals were adopted. The CPPCC, which consists of personnel from all walks of life, is a major advisory body to the Communist Party of China and plays an indispensable role in the country's political life. Wang Rongkang, a member of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, put forward three proposals about the stable and sustained development of agriculture which were adopted by the provincial commission for agriculture and the department of agriculture. According to the proposals, an agricultural information service center and 280,000 agricultural technology models have been set up in the province. The provincial commission for agriculture also suggested that the provincial government invest a part of its annual increased revenue in agriculture. As to the proposals that cannot be put into practice within a short period, the government will give members clear explanations. About 93 percent of the members of the CPPCC in Anhui are satisfied or basically satisfied with the handling of their proposals, a recent poll conducted by the CPPCC provincial committee showed.
