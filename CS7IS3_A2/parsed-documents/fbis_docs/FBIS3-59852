During the past two weeks, the mullahs have contacted three major European countries. In that respect, one of the mullahs, a brother of President Rafsanjani, visited Germany where he held three meetings with government officials. His message there was that the Islamic Republic was a responsible member of the international community and that it was ready to open a "new chapter" with the West. Also, as part of that offensive, the secretary-general of the French Foreign Ministry, paid a 48-hour visit to Tehran where his Iranian hosts assured him that the Islamic Republic opposed terrorism and that it would not do anything to stir trouble in the region. Finally, Iran welcomed Michael Berton, a senior official in the British Foreign Ministry, who, according to the official version, had come to discuss the death warrant issued by Khomeyni against the British writer, Salman Rushdie. Such visits are in themselves quite positive, and every move concerning the normalization of Iran's foreign policy, should be welcomed. However, what in fact is needed is a real change in Tehran's thinking. But so far, there is no indication that this is going to happen any time soon. The crux of the matter concerning the mullahs can be explained by an Iranian folk story about an aristocrat who had set on a difficult journey in winter time during the Middle Ages. One night, the aristocrat and his servant stopped to rest in a little house along the road. The weather was very cold. The aristocrat was shivering like a tree shaken by an autumn wind. The servant did his best to cover him with all the blankets he could find. But the aristocrat was still cold; he screamed at the servant with arrogance and despair saying: "Can't you look for few additional things to cover me with?" The servant was embarrassed because the only thing left was the saddle of the donkey. He wondered how could an aristocrat sleep covered by a saddle. Nevertheless, the servant gathered his courage and told his master about what was available. The master yelled: "Stupid...bring the damned thing, but do not mention its name, and do not tell anybody about it!" The moral of this story is obvious, namely, that one has sometimes to sacrifice appearances out of necessity. The aristocrat was not ready to freeze and die of cold because sleeping under a donkey's saddle might hurt his dignity. The revolutionary mullahs in Iran are in a similar position. They need to abandon their slogans so as to remain in power as a class of their own, in a world which is changing in a fascinating way. And a number of them are ready to change. President Rafsanjani once even said that he was ready to exchange his mullah's clothes for those worn by ordinary Iranians so as to remain in politics. He was, in fact, realistic enough to make secret deals with the United States and to organize the freeing of the Western hostages who were held captive on Khomeyni's orders. Also, it was Rafsanjani who pressed the old angry man "to swallow the poison" [bite the bullet] and sign the cease-fire with Saddam Husayn. It was also partly thanks to Rafsanjani that Iran refused to conclude a foolish alliance with Iraq following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. However, other mullahs believe that giving up their slogans would mean a dangerous loss of face to a regime with such a narrow basis of power, especially at a time when the social and economic crises are so acute. Still, another group of mullahs have suggested using the peace agreement between Israel amd the PLO as an excuse to launch a "third wave" of Revolution. At the center, between those two groups, there are a few mullahs, together with their technocrat aides, and who most of the time are related to them by marriage, who advocate a compromise solution. Such a solution is derived from the claim that "the State," which is represented by Rajsanjani, is officially separated from the "revolution," which is led by Khamene'i. That was exactly the old deceit that had been used by the Soviet Union, and later, China for many years. At certain occasions, the late Alexis Kossygine used to speak as prime minister, while Leonid Brezhnev used to express opposing views as chairman of the Communist Party. Foreign Governments used to read the editorials of PRAVDA on the ground that they expressed the views of the Communist Party, at the same time those same governments were led to believe that it would be better to read IZVESTIA in order to understand the position of the Soviet Government. That game became a farce to such an extent that Brezhnev decided to put an end to it by appointing himself both president and chairman of the party. The Iranian version of that same game is as ridiculous. During his visit to Tehran last week, Boidevau, raised the problem of the threats directed at the former Iranian officials living in France. He was told that: "The Government of the Islamic Republic has nothing to do with this at all. And that if there was any threat, it must have originated with some revolutionary institutions that had no relations with the government." There is no way to know whether the French diplomat believed that excuse, but if he did, then his brain must be examined. The Islamic Republic should end this dualist talk and adopt clear positions which would leave no doubt on the important issues and the policies vital to Iran's interests in the region and beyond. The use of "Taqiyah"--i.e., to hide one's beliefs when one is in a minority among other ideologies--cannot serve as a sound basis for an earnest foreign policy. Nor could Iran adopt two policies at the same time: one for the government and another for the revolutionary institutions. Such duality involves a great danger to the people as a whole. It is currently playing that game concerning the Israeli-Palestinian Agreement. The mullahs are entitled to oppose the agreement, but their position should be stated clearly because it is not possible to tell foreign visitors one thing while "the leaders of the revolution" of the Revolution Guards present an opposing view. The Iranian people should be informed through rational arguments, and in a precise language, not in slogans, as to why the peace agreement between Israel and the PLO would be a bad thing to Iran's rights and its national interests; and in what way would it hurt Iran if Israel and the PLO decide to put an end to their struggle and live in peace. Last week, I asked a number of West European and Asian foreign ministers about their opinion concerning the Iranian reaction to the Israeli-Palestinian agreement. Their response was unanimous, namely, that Iran had acknowledged in private that the Agreement was an issue that concerned the two parties, and that Iran would not encourage terrorism or violence in the Middle East. This is an acceptable position. Iran could say: We are not happy with the agreement, and we do not see that it could help the Palestinians, yet we would not hinder that process through violence. That position would be similar to that adopted by Syria, which is favorable to the peace process. Moreover, Syria seeks to establish good relations with the United States. Yet, we hear Khamene'i the High Murshed [counselor] repeat over and over to the Republican Guards that Israel should be wiped out of the map and that Yasir 'Arafat should be extracted as "bad grass in the garden"; but he did not care to say what are the interests of Iran in all that. There are many people in Iran, among them certain ruling mullahs, who are aware that it is dangerous for Iran to be singled out as a troublemaker in the region; especially that Iran, as any other country, has its own problems which it ought to solve before trying to solve the problems of others. The most stupid thing is to instigate unnecessary disturbances with the intent to mislead. Iran cannot hinder the peace agreement, especially if this latter is accepted by the majority of the Palestinians and Israelis. So there is absolutely no rational to wish to appear doing something when one does not in fact want to do it, nor can he do it, even if he wanted to.
