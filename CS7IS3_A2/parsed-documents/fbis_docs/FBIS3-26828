Hu and Kang explained: In a modern country, the armed forces should be kept with government appropriations and must not be allowed to engage in business activities. This is beyond question. "We hold that the armed forces can be maintained only with government appropriations, and must not engage in business activities, so the armed forces should be supported with tax revenues. At present, only in a very small number of countries, such as Indonesia and Thailand, are the armed forces engaged in business activities. In such countries, the degree of corruption in the armed forces is very serious. There, the armed forces have become a special interest group, independent from state interests, a group that seeks its own political, economic, and military interests. International experience shows that allowing the armed forces to do business is equivalent to giving a green light to corruption in the armed forces." Hu Angang and Kang Xiaoguang then changed their talk from international practice to China's reality: Since the 1980's, the Chinese armed forces have been deeply involved in large-scale business activities, which have spread to all three services and the three general departments of the headquarters. All military regions, provincial military districts, and field armies have set up their own business companies to pursue profits and increase their own financial incomes in order to make up for the serious insufficiencies in military expenses. As a result, this has quickened the pace of commercialization, localization, and corruption in the armed forces. The military officers have always been discontented with such developments. However, the financial capacity of the central government has remained at a very low level. Although China's gross national product increased by more than 100 percent after 1978, the government still could not support the 3 million troops and repeatedly required the troops to "endure" difficulties. It allowed the troops to engage in business so that they might increase their income. This was a major failure of the central government in performing its functions, and was also a shortsighted practice that would result only in ruining national defense and sowing the seeds of future turmoil and unrest in China. Therefore, they put forward following proposals: -- Strictly prohibiting the armed forces from engaging in business. Business companies of all types established and run by the armed forces should be closed down. This should include the farms run by all military units. The assets may be transferred or auctioned off. The military units cannot take part in any profit-making economic activities, and should not be allowed to receive any gifts or allowances from local governments and civilian institutions. -- The military budget should be increased substantially, and the armed forces should be maintained with state tax revenues. Military expenses should come entirely from the government's financial appropriations, which should be sufficient for maintaining the normal operations of the armed forces in peacetime. That is, it is necessary to ensure that the armed forces' income in real terms will increase at a rate slightly higher than the growth rate of the average income of the civilian people throughout the country. Special appropriations should be made in wartime to make up for the insufficiency in military expenses. The scheme of "supporting the armed forces with tax revenues" may be put into practice in two steps. First, supporting the regular units with tax revenue, and strictly prohibiting the field armies, the navy, and the air force from engaging in business activities. Second, strictly prohibiting all troops from engaging in business activities. -- Part of the public property for national defense may be produced through the market. For example, military provisions, medicine, clothing, and other supplies, as well as airports, roads, equipment, and instruments can be produced by manufacturers that bid for orders placed by the military. Thus, the armed forces do not need to strive for "self-sufficiency" by arranging the production of everything they need. The General Logistics Department will be just a "big buyer," and it will decide what to buy from the market and will not be responsible for what to produce. Most military enterprises should be separated from the regular establishment of the armed forces so that the size of the armed forces can be streamlined as well, with noncombat units being reduced. -- Redefining the armed forces' tasks and reducing excessive nonmilitary expenditures. In modern society, the armed forces should not perform too many functions and shoulder responsibilities and burdens that are too heavy. Their major function is to defend the country, and they should mainly be a fighting force rather than a productive force. The armed forces should not be turned into a major force in industrial production or an entity in economic activities. They should not get involved in the market economy or participate in any profit-seeking or illicit business activities; still less should they participate in local economic construction and be turned into an unpaid or low-paid labor force. Of course, resisting disasters and rescuing disaster-stricken people will remain one of the functions the armed forces should perform. The armed forces in all countries perform such functions.
