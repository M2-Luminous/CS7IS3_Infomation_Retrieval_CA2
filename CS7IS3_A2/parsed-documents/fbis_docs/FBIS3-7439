The people and NADK launched the attack in four prongs: the first coming from Dangkao Ta Mang to Bavel; the second from Samlor Khlanh to Bavel; the third from Ta Em to Bavel; and the fourth from Kbal Thnal to Prey Totoeng and Bavel. After three hours of combat, we smashed and seized full control of the 6th Division's command post and Bavel District seat. We killed 22 enemy soldiers and wounded over 30 others. We destroyed a T54 tank; 85-mm, 122-mm, and 76.2-mm cannons; two 37-mm anti-aircraft guns; an 80-mm mortar; a DK-85; a 12.7-mm gun; an RPK gun; an RPD gun; and 35 military barracks. We also set ablaze three depots storing various ammunition and mines for use in the Pailin offensive. The fire burned for six hours from 0500 at dawn to 1100. We also seized four B-40's, a 12.7-mm gun, 39 AK's, three crates of AK ammunition, 60 B-40 rockets, two field radios, and a large antenna. At the same time, we attacked the invading forces at Thmar Kol which is the supply route for serving the Pailin battlefield. The invading forces were routed and forced to flee to Battambang which was then in chaos. The puppets in Battambang were in a panic and immediately declared a dawn to dusk curfew which is still being imposed.
