FR940728-2-00038 FR940728-2-00031 [Docket No. TX94&hyph;7&hyph;000] AES Power, Inc.; Filing July 22, 1994. Take notice that on July 15, 1994, AES Power, Inc., 3340 Peachtree St. N.E., Atlanta, Georgia 30326, filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission an application requesting that the Commission order the Tennessee Valley Authority to provide transmission services pursuant to ยง211 of the Federal Power Act. AES Power, Inc. requests a standing transmission arrangement to begin as soon as possible, for as available, point(s)-to-point(s) non-firm transmission service to be called upon by AES Power, Inc. from time to time and on terms and conditions comparable to those TVA provides for itself and other parties in similar circumstances. As the need for specific transactions arises, they will be scheduled, provided and paid for in accordance with TVA's current scheduling procedures, to or from any point of interconnection between TVA and its neighboring electric utilities. AES anticipates requesting transmission capacity in the range of 100&hyph;500 MW. However, any amount of transmission capacity up to the amount available on TVA's system at the time a specific request is scheduled may be requested. Service would be for an initial term of five years, with automatic renewal for additional one year terms unless terminated by either party thirty days prior to the end of the then current term. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 18 CFR 385.214). All such motions or protests should be filed on or before August 5, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Linwood A. Watson, Jr., Acting Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;18435 Filed 7&hyph;27&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6717&hyph;01&hyph;M
