Therefore the town must be declared a disaster area. That demand comes from Liina Maaste, mayor of Sindi, the smallest municipality in Estonia. The old textile factory, where all work has stopped, has been declared bankrupt. The people have no jobs, no money, no aid. Families in Sindi have only meager children's benefits to live on. Even retirees, with their miserably small pensions, are better off. So far people are getting by. They have gathered mushrooms in the woods and tried to raise a few potatoes and other vegetables in small garden patches outside their houses. "But without outside aid we will be unable to manage in the winter," Maaste told DAGENS NYHETER. Thanks to a little aid from Sweden last winter they can still provide soup for retirees in Sindi's municipal soup kitchen. Here for one Estonian kroon (worth about 60 Swedish ore) old people get a bowl of soup, a little bread, and, on the day of our visit, two small pancakes. One Employer The tragedy in Sindi is that the town of just 4,200 inhabitants had only one employer, Kalevs textile factory with approximately 1,000 employees. The factory is 150 years old and has survived many difficult periods. But when the Soviet empire collapsed it was definitely all over for the Sindi factory too. Before, during the wild days of planned economy, textiles from Sindi were sent to other Soviet republics. But now Russia is no longer paying for goods and no one in the West wants the inferior textiles from Sindi. Of course company fatalities have also hit the Swedish mill community. But in Sweden there is a social safety net. That is not the case in the poor Baltic states. To get a monthly unemployment benefit of 180 Estonian kroon (a little over 100 Swedish kronor), strict requirements must be met. In addition companies avoid paying this by sending employees home on "indefinite leaves" that can last several years. Six Children Liina Maaste accompanied us on a visit to one of the typical unemployed families in Sindi. The Peas, Arvo, 40, and Eve, 38, both worked at Sindi's textile plant. They have six children. A seventh is on the way. Four of the children live at home. The oldest son, 21 years old, is married and lives with his own family in his mother-in-law's house. An 18-year-old son lives in the country. The couple's only income is the children's benefit for four minor children, a total of 600 Estonian kroon a month. This corresponds to around 375 Swedish kronor. The money has to cover food, rent, electricity, fuel, clothes for the children. It doesn't. Therefore most people do not bother to pay the rent, mayor Liina explained. "If we hadn't got secondhand clothes, the children would have had to go naked," said Eve. Eve and Arvo have helped farmers in the neighborhood harvest their potatoes. They were paid in the form of several sacks of potatoes. "All our cupboards are full of pickled and dried mushrooms that we gathered," Eve told us. "We will probably have a seventh son," said Arvo, but added: "But now we must have no more children, we can't afford it." What was the best time for the Pea family of Sindi financially? "It was probably the last year of the Russian ruble when we both still had our jobs at the textile plant," Arvo said. What will happen to Sindi? "The Estonian Government in Tallinn must first declare us a disaster area and also provide financial assistance. We also need international aid," Maaste said. She is worried that "the wolves will plunder" what is left of the old textile plant in Sindi, that the machinery will simply be sold and some of the old bosses will stuff the money into their own pockets. That is the way things often go in connection with "privatization" in postsocialist Estonia. The old red directors of the state companies and kolkhoz and sovkhoz chairmen often finagle the biggest share into their own pockets. There are many scandals. Rumors circulate, newspapers write about them without properly investigating what really happens later. The authorities intervene far too seldom or far too late. Just now, for example, a big furniture factory in Tallinn is in trouble. Person With the Most Power Maaste herself is a child of the communist party apparatus. She does not deny it. Liina was the person with the most power in Sindi before, but then her title, translated into English, was chairman of the executive committee. She worked for some years at the communist party headquarters in the neighboring town of Parnu and after independence she was appointed mayor of Sindi. In order to get anybody to run for office in Sindi in the local elections that were recently held in Estonia Liina had to persuade the chief doctor, some self-employed businessmen, an electrician, and some business people to run with her on a 15-person ticket. Just enough for a new assembly of delegates. They were elected, there was no alternative, and Liina kept her job as mayor. She does not exactly get a fat paycheck as mayor: 1,340 Estonian kroon or 837 Swedish kronor, only slightly more than the statistical average wage in Estonia. What does she want? She wants the municipality to be able to take over part of the bankrupt factory so it can make its own effort to find someone who will lease the premises. Then money will be needed to repair and enlarge the sewage system. Otherwise everything will end up in Parnu Bay and further out in the Baltic Sea. The heating systems in houses with central heating have also broken down. The main street is in very poor shape and the children need money for school. We inspected the small clinic, Sindi's few private businesses, and the town's pride, the old station building that has been converted into a library. The only relatively new building in all of Sindi.
