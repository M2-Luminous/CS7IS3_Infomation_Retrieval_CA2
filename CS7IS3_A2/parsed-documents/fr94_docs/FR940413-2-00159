FR940413-2-00159 FR940413-2-00071 [Release No. 34&hyph;33869; File No. SR&hyph;MSRB&hyph;94&hyph;01] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board Relating to Suitability of Recommendations April 7, 1994. On January 7, 1994, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (``Board'' or ``MSRB'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 1 a proposed rule change consisting of amendments to rule G&hyph;19, concerning suitability of recommendations, and rule G&hyph;8 concerning recordkeeping. The proposed rule change was published for comment in the Federal Register . 2 No comments were received. For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is approving the proposed rule change. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 Exchange Act Release No. 33498 (January 21, 1994), 59 FR 3891 (January 27, 1994). I. Background In a letter dated May 8, 1992, the Commission's Division of Market Regulation asked the MSRB to review the requirements of rule G&hyph;19 on suitability of recommendations and to consider strengthening the requirements for transactions in certain types of municipal securities. 3 In September 1992, the Board published a request for comments on a number of customer protection issues, including the application of rule G&hyph;19 to customer transactions. 4 After reviewing these matters, the MSRB decided that rule G&hyph;19 embodies the appropriate general standard for dealers in making recommendations to customers, but recognized that there was a perception that certain provisions of the rule could be viewed as permitting recommendations to go forward without proper regard to the nature of the security being recommended and the customer to whom it is recommended. Accordingly, at its May 1993 meeting, the Board approved a Request for Comments on draft amendments to clarify and strengthen the suitability requirements of rule G&hyph;19. The MSRB requested public comment on the proposal, 5 and draft amendments were approved at the November 1993 Board meeting and form the basis of the rule change proposed herein. Shortly thereafter, 12 groups and associations representing a broad range of market participants submitted to the Commission a Joint Statement on Improvements in Municipal Securities Market Disclosure. 6 The Joint Statement called on the MSRB to monitor the effectiveness of its suitability rules and to strengthen those rules if appropriate. 7 The Joint Statement specifically called for suitability rules to require disclosure of ratings and whether the issuer has committed to provide annual financial reports. 8 In September, 1993, the MSRB indicated it was considering requiring municipal securities dealers to disclose to their customers the importance of secondary market information and whether the issuer has agreed to voluntarily provide such disclosures. 9 3 See Letter from William H.
