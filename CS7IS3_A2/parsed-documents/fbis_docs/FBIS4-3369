The aggregate gross output value of industrial enterprises at and above the township level amounted to 12.65 billion yuan, an increase of 7 percent over the same period last year, indicating a marked slowdown in the growth rate. Of this gross output value, state-owned enterprises contributed more than 9.8 billion yuan, a mere increase of 3 percent. Township-run industrial enterprises had the highest growth of 39 percent; collective-run enterprises had the second highest growth of 17.7 percent; and the growth of heavy industry was still higher than that of light industry. Of principal industrial products, the output of color television sets, color television kinescopes, radio sets, washing machines, and refrigerators increased rapidly. The output of the following products decreased: cigarettes, white wine, beer, iron ore, steel products, crude oil, coal, timber, cement, and heavy-duty trucks. Electric energy production increased by 6.6 percent. The most prominent problem in industrial production in the first quarter was that the economic returns of industrial enterprises declined, more enterprises were suffering losses, and their profit margin decreased remarkably, with 53.3 percent of large and medium-sized enterprises, 37.4 percent of state-owned enterprises, 14.2 percent of collective-run enterprises, and 50.7 percent of province-run enterprises suffering losses. The amount of profits of industrial enterprises decreased by 87.2 percent as compared with the same period last year. Some longstanding problems in economic operation have landed the province's industrial sector in a very grim situation. Now and in the future, Shaanxi Province needs to vigorously adjust its production structure and product mix and strive to increase profits and reduce losses by deepening reform and improving management.
