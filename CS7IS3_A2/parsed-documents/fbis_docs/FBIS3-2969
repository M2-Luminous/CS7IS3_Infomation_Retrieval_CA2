"The linkage was first proposed by Australia as part of its effort to promote trade cooperation among members of the Asia- Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum," said DGC Deputy Director-General Hou Teh-chi. If the Taiwan-Singapore linkage succeeds, Hou said, other APEC member states will follow suit. Among the 17 APEC members, only the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Singapore and Taiwan have established automatic customs clearance systems. As the Japanese system does not meet the United Nations standards, Australia suggested earlier this year that Taiwan and Singapore link their systems first on a trial basis. Hou said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has agreed to provide funds needed for the computer uplink. After the project is completed, Hou said, Taiwan and Singapore will be able to call up each other's export/import product lists and other related information on their own computer screens. Hou said APEC members will also establish computerized trade databanks to boost multinational economic cooperation. Apec groups the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, Brunei, Malaysia, South Korea, Mexico and Papua New Guinea.
