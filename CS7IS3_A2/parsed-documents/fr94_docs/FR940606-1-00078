The inner hull or independent tank structure functions as the secondary barrier when required. 3Type 2 tanks are tanks in which the insulation or a combination of the insulation and one or more liners* function as both the primary and secondary barrier, and where these barriers are clearly distinguishable. *A liner, as used in footnotes 2 and 3, means a thin, non-self supporting metallic, nonmetallic or composite material which forms part of an internal insulation tank in order to enhance its fracture resistance or other mechanical properties. A liner differs from a membrane in that a liner is not intended by itself to function as a liquid barrier. 29. Before the undesignated heading ``SUPPORT SYSTEM'', add §154.464 to read as follows: §154.468 Submission of insulation information for internal insulation tanks. (a) In addition to the information required in §154.467, information on the following properties of the insulation materials which contribute to cargo containment in internal insulation tanks must be submitted to the Commandant (G&hyph;MTH) for special approval: (1) Bonding (adhesive and cohesive strength). (2) Resistance to cargo pressure. (3) Fatigue and crack propagation. (4) Compatibility with cargo constituencies and with any other agency normally expected to come in contact with the insulation. (5) Gas desorbing. (b) The influence of the presence of water and water pressure on the insulation properties must be taken into account. (c) The properties listed in paragraph (a) of this section must be_ (1) Obtained after simulation of aging and thermal cycling; and (2) Tested for in the temperature range between the expected maximum temperature in service and 5 ○C (8 ○F) below the minimum design temperature, but no lower than ^196 ○C (^321 ○F). 30. Section 154.471(a)(3) is revised to read as follows: §154.471 Design criteria. (a) *␣*␣* (3) To withstand a collision force, in the forward direction, equal to at least one-half of the weight of the cargo tank and cargo and, in the aft direction, equal to at least one-quarter of the weight of the cargo tank and cargo; and * * * * * 31. In §154.519, paragraph (c) is added to read as follows: §154.519 Piping relief valves. * * * * * (c) All pipelines or components which may be isolated in a liquid full condition must have a relief valve. 32. In §154.522(a), revise the introductory test to read as follows: §154.522 Materials for piping. (a) The materials for piping systems must meet §154.625 for the minimum design temperature of the piping; except that, the material for open-ended vent piping, open-ended piping inside the cargo tanks (excluding discharge piping), and all piping inside membrane and semimembrane tanks may be specially approved by the Commandant (G&hyph;MTH) if_ * * * * * 33. In §154.610, in paragraph (c), remove ``ASTM A&hyph;20&hyph;75'' and add, in its place, ``ASTM A 20/A 20 M&hyph;83'' and, in paragraph (i), revise the table to read as follows:
