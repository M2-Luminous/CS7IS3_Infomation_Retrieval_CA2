FR940325-0-00112 FR940325-0-00017 Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification The Secretary certifies that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The small entities that would be affected by these final regulations are small public and private agencies receiving Federal funds under these programs. However, the regulations will not have significant economic impact on the small entities affected because the regulations will not impose excessive regulatory burdens or require unnecessary Federal supervision. The regulations make only procedural changes that grant greater flexibility in establishing application deadlines. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 These regulations have been examined under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 and have been found to contain no information collection requirements. Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking In accordance with section 431(b)(2)(A) of the General Education Provisions Act (20 U.S.C. 1232(b)(2)(A)) and the Administrative Procedure Act, it is the practice of the Secretary to offer interested parties the opportunity to comment on proposed regulations. However, these amendments make procedural changes only and do not establish new substantive policy. Therefore, under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A), proposed rulemaking is not required. Moreover, the Secretary has determined under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) that proposed rulemaking on these amended regulations is unnecessary and contrary to the public interest. Assessment of Educational Impact The Secretary has determined that the regulations in this document would not require transmission of information that is being gathered by or is available from any other agency or authority of the United States.
