Speaking ahead of a meeting here with Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres Thursday, he urged Israeli leaders "not to delay what have been agreed, not to delay the implementation of what have been agreed before." The chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization was referring to the April 13 deadline for the accord granting limited autonomy in Jericho and the Gaza Strip. "Unfortunately our efforts and our negotiations with Israel still face great difficulties, so the date of April 13, when the Israeli occupation was supposed to end, has passed," he said. 'Arafat said he would meet Peres overnight Wednesday or Thursday morning. Peres arrived here late Wednesday. 'Arafat, originally scheduled to leave here Friday, will instead leave Thursday evening because of "an urgent meeting of the executive committee" of the PLO, he said. A meeting to be chaired by the two men has been brought forward to Thursday for the same reason, he said. The meeting is to discuss Middle East economy and development issues, and will be followed by a press conference. 'Arafat was speaking to journalists after a meeting with Romanian President Ion Iliescu. [passage omitted]
