Robaina, who met with Sanin for 30 minutes tonight, is making an official visit to Ecuador, Peru, and Argentina. He will also make an unofficial visit to Paraguay, a country with which Cuba has yet to establish diplomatic relations. In statements made to PRENSA LATINA and a Radio Rebelde journalist accompanying the Cuban delegation, the Colombian foreign minister reiterated that she will visit Havana on a date that will be set soon. She added that both she and Robaina are satisfied with the Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO newspaper, which publicly acknowledged it published unfounded information on an alleged meeting between Colombian guerrillas in Havana. As for the unfounded report, Sanin pointed out that she will meet with Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff soon because his office apparently provided reports that said an alleged former guerrilla and an aide to the late drug trafficker chief Pablo Escobar attended a meeting in Havana.
