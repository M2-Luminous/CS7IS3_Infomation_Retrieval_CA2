They are among ministers and officials from more than 120 countries here to sign the landmark Uruguay Round accord giving birth to the World Trade Organization [WTO], a more powerful multilateral trade system than the current General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Kim explained Seoul's position on opening its motor vehicle market and the two men agreed to discuss the matter further at the working level. Kantor cited examples of Korea's unfair trade practices, taken from the USTR's National Trade Estimate (NTE) released last month, and called for elimination of tax discrimination against foreign cars and psychological prejudice created by labeling them an extravagance. Kim admitted Kantor had a point, considering that foreign cars account for a meager 0.2 percent of the domestic market, but said more time and intra-governmental coordination are needed to resolve the problem. Noting that discussions were under way on acquisition and special excise tax cuts, he said nothing has been decided yet. He pointed out that reauthorization of Super 301 ran counter to multilateral rules with the WTO's birth and advised prudence on its application. The trade minister also detailed Seoul's efforts on intellectual property rights and asked Washington to move Korea to the watch list from its current spot on the priority watch list at this month's screening. Kantor went further to ask that the tax on dyes and petroleum resin be cut to 6.5 percent from the current 13 percent, while Kim sought a correction in random anti-dumping action on Korean color televisions and oil pipelines. Earlier in the day, Kim had a breakfast meeting with his Asia- Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) counterparts and discussed the date, place and agenda of a trade ministers' meeting slated for this fall. Kantor proposed that the meeting take place in Los Angeles.
