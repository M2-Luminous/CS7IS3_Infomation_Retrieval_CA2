FR940527-2-00183 FR940527-2-00140 Ortho-dichlorobenzene HTS number: 2903.61.20.00 CAS number: 95&hyph;50&hyph;1 Ortho-dichlorobenzene is derived from the taxable chemicals benzene and chlorine. Ortho-dichlorobenzene is a liquid produced predominantly by the reaction of chlorine with benzene. The stoichiometric material consumption formula ortho-dichlorobenzene is: C 6 H 6 (benzene) + 2 C1 2 (chlorine) c C 6 H 4 C1 2 (o-dichlorobenzene) + 2 HCl (hydrogen chloride) Ortho-dichlorobenzene has been determined to be a taxable substance because a review of its stoichiometric material consumption formula shows that, based on the predominant method of production, taxable chemicals constitute 100 percent by weight of the materials used in its production. Para-dichlorobenzene HTS number: 2903.61.30.00 CAS number: 106&hyph;46&hyph;7 Para-dichlorobenzene is derived from the taxable chemicals benzene and chlorine. Para-dichlorobenzene is a solid produced predominantly by the reaction of chlorine with benzene. The stoichiometric material consumption formula for para-dichlorobenzene is: C 6 H 6 (benzene) + 2 C1 2 (chlorine) c C 6 H 4 C1 2 (p-dichlorobenzene) + 2 HCl (hydrogen chloride) Para-dichlorobenzene has been determined to be a taxable substance because a review of its stoichiometric material consumption formula shows that, based on the predominant method of production, taxable chemicals constitute 100 percent by weight of the materials used in its production.
