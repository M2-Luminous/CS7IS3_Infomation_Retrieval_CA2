The president said this in reference to the existence in Honduras of the U.S. military base at Palmerola in the central Department of Comayagua, approximately 80 km from Tegucigalpa. The air force base was installed at the beginning of the eighties and was used by the United States to support the Nicaraguan contras who were fighting against the Sandinist government and the Salvadoran Government which was fighting against the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front. At present the U.S. Government is still conducting operations at the base with 1,200 troops, and the base also houses the Honduran Military Aviation Academy. Reina Idiaquez said he is examining the existence of the Palmerola base from "another context" and hinted that he would like the antinarcotics forces to be more active. Honduras has proposed to Washington that it convert Palmerola into the Central American headquarters of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). The United States already has two radars with which it monitors the flights and boats of South American drug traffickers who take advantage of the extensive aerial and maritime space of the Honduran Atlantic. The Honduran president made the comment after a meeting today at the Government House with activists from the ruling Liberal Party when one of the participants asked him why he does not charge for the presence of foreign troops and use the money to amortize Honduras' foreign debt.
