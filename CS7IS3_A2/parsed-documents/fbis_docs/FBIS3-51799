The management of each work center must prepare a detailed economic analysis including specific proposals to improve operations. This analysis must be exact rather than saturated with unintelligible lingo masking the essential points. It is possible that not all centers have an accounting system that makes an in- depth economic analysis possible. The first measure to take in these centers is precisely the creation of such a tool listing the main expenses incurred per peso of goods produced. Apart from the current difficulties, untracked expenses are due to disorder in place of order, confusion in place of discipline, indolence in place of rigor. Thence, the prime importance of discussing in the Parliament in the Workplace meetings the center's own operations and specific, feasible measures to increase efficiency. If a step forward is taken in every workplace, much can be gained by simply adding the effect of many positive steps. The TRABAJADORES editorial adds that we will see then the results of the general measures being taken nationwide, which can be truly effective only through the efforts of the individual workplaces.
