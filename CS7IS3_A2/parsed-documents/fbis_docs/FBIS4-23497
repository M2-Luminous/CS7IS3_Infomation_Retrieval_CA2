The counteroffensive launched on Monday [6 June] by the regular army is reported to have failed. Valerie Hirsch reports: [Hirsch] Violent fighting is taking place on three fronts: north of Kigali, where the army has launched an attack from the town of Ruhengeri, in the capital itself, and 20 km from Gitarama, the town where the interim government has taken refuge. According to the United Nations, the army has not regained any ground from the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF], which is still holding the initiative in the fighting. However, the Front does not want a military victory. This is what the RPF president said in an interview published this morning by LE SOIR. Besides, according to the Ugandan president, the Front is not in a position to get the upper hand militarily. President Museveni, who is considered an ally of the RPF, has criticized the Front: they have to accept a cease-fire, the Ugandan president said, because the international community has promised to try those behind the slaughter. Negotiations on a truce in the fighting will resume on Thursday, 9 June or Friday in Kigali. [passage omitted]
