He claimed that nearly 15 thousand Armenians became the victims of Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. " Only during the last three or four months more than one thousand Armenian youths were killed", announced the deputy. Bleyan's indignant colleagues did not let him finish the appearance, blaming him of lie, so that the speaker had to interrupt the session. Ashot Bleyan, known for his pacifist position, has abandoned two years ago the ruling party -- the Armenian National Movement -- and founded a new social-policy organization " New Way", whose non-numerous followers appear for the immediate compromise solution of Nagorno-Karabakh problem. Nearly a year and a half ago, this deputy visited Baku, which caused a non-unanimous reaction in Armenia. Being a professional teacher, Bleyan is known also as a director of advanced educational center in Yerevan, "Mekhitar Sebastatsi."
