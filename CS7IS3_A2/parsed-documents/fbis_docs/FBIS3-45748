He left Shenzhen yesterday, 22 January, after a half-month inspection tour here. Two years ago, from 20 to 22 January, Yang Shangkun, then state president, made an inspection tour in the same city. During that visit, he toured Xianhu Botanical Garden on the western slope of the Wutong Shan in the northeastern outskirts of Shenzhen on 22 January with Deng Xiaoping, who at that time happened to be in Shenzhen on his south China tour. The two visitors planted two banyans at the botanical garden before they left. At that time, many Hong Kong reporters came to Shenzhen from the other side of the border to cover their inspection tour here. Deng Xiaoping made some remarks in Shenzhen during that visit. He said that "it is necessary to blaze new trails" and "to speed up the pace a little bit," and that "China will have no way out but to carry on with reform." Later on, these remarks initiated a great tide of deepening reform and expanding opening-up nationwide. The two banyans that Deng Xiaoping and Yang Shangkun planted at the Xianhu Botanical Garden have attracted more than 1.3 million visitors over the past two years, many of whom have pictures taken beside the trees. The timing of Yang Shangkun's revisit to Shenzhen has aroused much speculation that Deng Xiaoping may do the same. Furthermore, at this moment the mass media in Shenzhen by and large are publishing pictures and reminiscences of Deng Xiaoping's last visit to Shenzhen. The huge painting of Deng Xiaoping erected at Lizhi Park is now being repainted, and this has drawn even more concern from the public. Yang Shangkun's arrival in Shenzhen on 8 January was not covered by the local press. The mass media have not reported on Yang Shangkun's activities in the city until today: On the morning of 12 January, he toured the Shenzhen Wildlife Zoo in the company of Wang Zhongfu and then met with Guangdong Provincial Party Committee Secretary Xie Fei that afternoon. On the morning of 16 January, he had an inspection tour of Shekou in the company of Yuan Geng, and on the morning of 17 January, he visited the Shenzhen Golf Club in the company of Li Youwei and Li Hao. On the morning of 19 January, he visited two high-tech companies -- Anke and Huawei -- in the company of Huang Liman and, on the morning of 20 January, he visited the Kaifa Science and Technology Company accompanied by Yang Guanghui. On the afternoon of 20 January, he joined the officials in charge of Shenzhen city in a forum held at the Shenzhen City Government Complex. On the morning of 21 January, he heard another briefing on government work by Wang Zhongfu, the principal official in charge of Shenzhen city, and then wound up his inspection tour and left Shenzhen on 22 January. This time, Yang Shangkun had a fairly long stay in Shenzhen and visited quite a few places. He told Shenzhen's leading officials that he had special feelings for the city. At the time when the central authorities decided to introduce a special policy into Guangdong, he was working with the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee. From that time on, he visited the special economic zone [SEZ] from time to time. His general impression is that Shenzhen has changed every year, and the city has undergone still greater changes this year. He hoped that Shenzhen will make more progress. This year, the state has introduced many major reform measures which call for rapid progress to be achieved within a short time and which cover a wide range of fields. One will need to study new issues, overcome new difficulties, sum up new experiences, and actively and prudently push ahead reform, opening up, and economic construction in the SEZ. Shenzhen City Mayor Li Youwei thanked Yang Shangkun for his concern and support for the Shenzhen SEZ. Li said that the Shenzhen people will live up to the high hopes of the revolutionaries of the older generation and build the Shenzhen SEZ into a still better city.
