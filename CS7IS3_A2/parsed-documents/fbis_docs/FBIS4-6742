"I have nothing further to say," he said. A stir had developed in the officialdom on Thursday when Yi told his senior officials to see to it that all policy items referred to the Unification and National Security Policy Coordination Council be implemented with advance approval by the prime minister. Yi said it was unreasonable that a policy decision on North Korean loggers, for instance, was released to the press even before it was formally adopted at the cabinet level.
