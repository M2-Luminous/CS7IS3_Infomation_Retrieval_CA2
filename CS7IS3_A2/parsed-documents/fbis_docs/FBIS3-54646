The interview raised issues of dual citizenship and the language policy of our republic, prospects for integration processes in the CIS, the forthcoming elections to the parliament of Kazakhstan, and the personnel policy at the highest echelons of power. [Words indistinct] all Kazakhstanis are interested in the president's position on these issues. KAZTAG, having received this information through its own channels, presents it to the wide circle of readers. If the Russian-speaking community in Kazakhstan does not have any problems, then why does the republic refuse to adopt a law on dual citizenship -- especially as Russia does not want to abandon its intention? Our Constitution does not allow dual citizenship, said the president. But this is not what concerns people. In 10 months, 154,000 Russians arrived in Kazakhstan, including 54,000 from Central Asia. There are those who are leaving the country. At present, migration has increased by [words indistinct] of Kazakhstan. This year, 300,000 of them left the country. The balance is not in our favor. But if we take the embassies of the United States, Israel, and other Western countries -- citizens of Russia queue there for exit visas and leave the country forever. Why don't we talk about this? To use emigration as an argument is political populism. People are worried about a different thing. I have been told the following -- during the time of the present policy, which is pursued by Nazarbayev -- there is no reason for us [Russians] to worry. But we [Russians] should think about the future of our children. I do understand these people and therefore, by my statute, several amendments to the Constitution have been made. In particular, the original version says that the closest relations of Kazakhstanis wishing to move [word indistinct] have to wait from five to 10 years for citizenship. At present, the documents for getting citizenship should not be examined for more than six months. Apart from this the term during which Kazakhstanis should make up their mind with regard to citizenship, is extended until 1 March. By the way, said Nazarbayev, I have sent to Boris Yeltsin and Viktor Chernomyrdin a draft agreement on the main principles for obtaining citizenship in Kazakhstan and Russia. I think we will sign it. In accordance with this document, the negotiating sides pledge to urgently adopt relevant legislature that will simplify the procedure for obtaining citizenship both by Kazakhs and Russians. Their applications should be examined for no longer than six months from the day of submission [words indistinct]. I believe that this agreement will eliminate all problems. There is nothing there to divide Russians and Kazakhs. Journalists displayed interest in the issue of the second language. [passage omitted] Our Constitution enshrines that Russian is the language for interethnic communication, noted Nazarbayev. The main law clearly stipulates that the language for interethnic comminication is used along with the state language. [passage omitted] Kazakh, the language of 8 million people, is on the brink of extinction. Due to this we have been forced to elevate it to the status of the state language. Russians themselves spoke about the need for that. [passage omitted] POSTFACTUM asked President Nazarbayev to touch on the issue of international integration. You know, I believe in prosperity through unification and not disintegration, said the president. Well I have not succeeded in maintaining the ruble zone. There is nothing we can do about it. We are not to be blamed for this. As an economist, I understand the Russian side but as a politician, I do not. The strategic loss of the ruble zone is Russia's loss. [passage omitted] By the way, said Nazarbayev, a draft of an economic union agreement belongs to Kazakhstan, a draft of the defense union has been submitted by Kazakhstan. A proposal to eliminate inter-state barriers has been put forward by Kazakhstan. You cannot lay any claims. This is my position -- useful contacts should not be disrupted. Have you ever been reprimanded for a pro-Russian policy? Yes, he admits. We do have our own nationalists. Fortunately there are not many of them. [passage omitted] We are wrongly accused for pumping resources out of Russia. We have been told that in the old days, without Russia we would not survive. Now we neither depend on Russia for power supplies or for food. On the contrary, Russia owes more to Kazakhstan than Kazakhstan to Russia. [passage omitted] Does Kazakhstan intend to take into consideration the Russian experience in elections? Naturally we are going to take into consideration the experience of Russia, said the president. But we have a slightly different situation from Russia. [passage omitted] During the news conference, journalists asked him about a rumor that is circulating in Kazakh political circles: That Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko is going to resign. I do not have any intention to replace the prime minister, said the head of state. I do not think that any government has gained anything from replacing their prime ministers three or four times. The frequent change of prime ministers led to the situation that there is nobody in these republics with whom you can have business. In addition, Tereshchnko is an experienced leader.
