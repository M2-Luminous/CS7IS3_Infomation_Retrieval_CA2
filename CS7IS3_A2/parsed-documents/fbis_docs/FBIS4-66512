Abdelhak Bouhafs, director general of Sonatrach [National Company for the Transport and Marketing of Hydrocarbons], announced on National Radio's Network 3 the day before yesterday that revenues from hydrocarbon exports this year were expected to be on the order of $8 billion, based on an average price of $15 per barrel of Algerian crude. That forecast is down sharply from the definitely more optimistic figures set by the government in drawing up the 1994 budget, when it was expecting an average price of $18 per barrel and, therefore, export revenues on the order of $9.5 billion. That revision of revenue forecasts for 1994 will drastically alter the government's calculations and make it necessary to draft a supplementary budget to put the state's accounts back in balance and hold the budget deficit at the 125 billion dinars originally established. Above all, such a level of revenues is going to complicate Algeria's financial situation with respect to the rest of the world. It had been expected that export revenues would at least cover reimbursement of the debts falling due this year ($9.5 billion). Now that revenues of $8 billion are being expected, Algeria finds itself in a very tight spot as far as its foreign partners are concerned, especially since the government is engaged in tough negotiations with the IMF to obtain new payment facilities in exchange for adopting a program to adjust its economy. But at the end of last December, during a lecture before an audience of diplomats and journalists at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Bouhafs had professed optimism regarding an improvement in crude oil prices on world markets. At the moment, however, the fact remains that while the prospect of a standby credit agreement with the IMF for a few hundred million dollars to be used during a transitional period--the figure of $800 million is being mentioned--represents only a relative injection of fresh money, it gives reason to hope for gestures of good will from Algeria's creditors. Algeria will then have to negotiate with its "bankers." The fact is that the European capitals have stated, and are continuing to state, that they are willing to help Algeria provided that it reaches an agreement with the IMF. But that should in no way keep us from taking advantage of this breathing spell granted by the IMF to put in place a number of mechanisms of a social nature--an unemployment fund and unemployment insurance, among other things--since doing so would make the effects of the structural adjustment more bearable for the most underprivileged.
