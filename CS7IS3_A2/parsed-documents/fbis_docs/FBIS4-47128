This news provoked hostile responses in Moscow's political and parapolitical circles. The market liberals were startled: All the same, the government intends to carry out its long-standing threats to "freeze wages," ignoring the natural right of the workers to "earn according to their abilities." The opponents of the ultra-liberals, the proponents of state "regulation of consumption," on the other hand, consider the measures promised by the edict to be cunning, the latest proof of the fact that the state is persistently deviating from its sacred duty to regulate social relations. According to the official version, the future edict realizes one of the points of the president's message to the parliament, as well as the state program approved at the end of April in the area of social policy. This does not preclude the fact, however, that this document has been called upon to play another role: to postpone a long-overdue decision. The technology of this matter is simple: A deliberately unacceptable circular is prepared, its content becomes public property, and a negative "public reaction" follows, after which the unapproved circular is filed away in the folder for the unpublished and the forgotten, while the authorities find the moral right to "postpone the matter" until better times. This version has already been partially confirmed: On Monday, the edict "On the Regulation..." was, among others, submitted for approval to Yeltsin and, in contrast to the other six edicts, was not signed. As to why the authorities have been compelled periodically to turn to the problem of control over incomes and why this always comes to naught, the reader can judge, based on the conversation between OBSHCHAYA GAZETA commentator Aleksandr Protsenko and Russian Federation Minister of Labor Gennadiy Melikyan. [Protsenko] Gennadiy Georgiyevich, the most graphic result of the state's noninterference in social processes is the staggering and simply insane differentiation of the incomes of the populace. As far as I know, the difference in the earnings of the most highly paid 10 percent of the Russian citizens and the lowest-paid 10 percent has reached a factor of 27. [Melikyan] It has already passed 30. According to this indicator, we have "surpassed" the civilized countries and have come much closer to the Third World. But after all, we are a country of extremes! It is true that it is not necessary to think that the situation differs greatly from the period of the "heyday of stagnation." Although then the difference in the wages of a party oblast committee secretary or the manager of a large plant and those of, for example, a cleaning lady was only a factor of four or five, the difference in incomes was not less than currently. It is just that all this was due to things other than wages. Today there are more rich people, and this is noticeable. But we cannot get away from an increase in the differentiation of incomes--especially during the period of the initial accumulation of capital. This is an inevitable and objective process, although I agree that it is proceeding too rapidly, which is intensifying social tension. Our country is accustomed to life under wage leveling, but here we have this colossal difference. And it frequently bears no relationship to the amount and quality of the labor expended. Currently in Russia, 40 percent of the children are living in families with incomes below the subsistence minimum. As a rule, these are young families--the backbone of the state. They are supposed to support themselves and their children, yet it is through their labor that the country is supporting the pensioners. [Protsenko] Add the fact that these people are supposed to be the basic customers in our stores, and their rubles are supposed to stimulate the production of domestic goods. But in our country, to put it crudely, the populace is dividing into two classes: the poor, who buy nothing, and the rich, who buy only imported goods. As a result, domestic production is losing sales, while its workers continue to live in poverty. Is this a closed circle? [Melikyan] This is all true. This also testifies to the fact that the state is not performing its regulatory function--it is supposed to limit the excessive incomes of a monopolist producer and to support the workers of enterprises of promising sectors and the budget-controlled sphere. But to support them not by handing out subsidies, but rather by establishing a normal wage. Indeed, currently in a number of sectors, and first and foremost in the budget-controlled ones, wages have been artificially understated. If a family consisting of two workers and two children cannot support itself and turns out to be below the poverty line, this is proof of an absolutely incorrect wage system. [Protsenko] Which is supposed to change now that the prime minister has finally signed the decree on the governmental program in the area of social policy. Incidentally, at the presidium's meeting on this matter, you were the main speaker. What can we expect? [Melikyan] In the area of the regulation of incomes, there are a few changes--if you talk about the number of items introduced into the program. There is the indexing of the guaranteed minimum incomes in connection with an increase in prices and, first and foremost, an increase in the minimum wage. There is the change in the system for figuring the wages for the managers of state enterprises (and enterprises where the state has the controlling block of shares). And finally, there is the improvement of the system for taxing individual incomes. There are several more items, but these are the main ones. [Protsenko] Fine, let us talk about the main ones--for example, about the minimum wage. Your predecessor in the labor minister's post and now your curator with the rank of deputy prime minister, Aleksandr Nikolayevich Shokhin, moaned back in November of 1990 that the minimum wage was less than the subsistence minimum by at least a third. Today it amounts to approximately 20 percent of the subsistence minimum. How is it possible to pay a person, quite legally, an amount on which it is impossible to exist? [Melikyan] Well, actually, no one is being paid this minimum, and it is more for calculation purposes--proceeding based on it, wages are calculated according to a wage scale in the budget-controlled sphere. It is true that, according to the statistical data, in public education 1.2 percent are being paid according to the second category, but this is only 30 percent more than the minimum. But for this money, people are working a partial work day and holding down jobs, as a rule, in several places. Usually they are pensioners. There is, unfortunately, one more use of the minimum wage--it is paid to people who are sent on forced leaves if an enterprise is on the brink of bankruptcy. [Protsenko] This seems familiar to us: "They pretend to pay us, and we pretend to work." Payment of the minimum wage to people on forced leaves helps the managers, under whose leadership the enterprises were brought to the point of bankruptcy, to survive, does it not? [Melikyan] Theoretically, this is all true, but in practice.... In our country, we are used to the fact that wages perform not so much a stimulating role as the function of social security. Do you want to break down this system? Fine, let us raise the minimum wage, for example, sixfold and let the plant manager decide if he can pay these wages to the people or if he needs to fire a third of the workers. Is there any guarantee that a social explosion will not occur at the enterprise and in the city where a mass of unemployed people appears? Of course, the minimum wage should be as close as possible to the subsistence minimum and, in the program adopted by the government, provision has been made for raising it, but--gradually. Remember: In order to give to one, it is necessary to take from another! [Protsenko] But is it not impossible to take from those managers who have no money for workers' wages, but whose own salaries are figured in "lemons" [millions]? Incidentally, such information appeared in the press about the general manager of the ZIL plant [motor vehicle plant imeni Lenin], is this true? [Melikyan] I do not know how it was with Brakov, but there have actually been and still are instances when the workers are paid R80,000-R100,000, while the manager and his closest circle are paid millions. At the end of last year, many executives awarded themselves and their retinues completely outrageous bonuses! Proceeding on the basis of this "experience," we prepared proposals for regulating the executives' wages--they also went into the governmental program. Now, based on a contract with the state, a firm salary will be set for a manager in relation to the type of production and the type of collective he manages. And an executive can receive a salary supplement only in an instance when the enterprise has derived a substantial profit. The higher the profit, the higher the supplement. At the same time, an item has been inserted into the governmental program about strengthening control over the distribution of funds for consumption--so that capital stock will not be eaten up. At the same time, we proposed one more measure--a temporary one which would permit restraining an increase in the wage fund at enterprises where the wages already exceed significantly the average for the sector. We also proposed imposing certain restrictions for such enterprises: If, for example, the price index rises over a quarter by 30 percent, then the wage fund will increase by only 21 percent. At first, some trade unions came out sharply against this idea: We are, so they say, against any regulation of incomes! We asked the dissenters: Do you realize that an enormous and unfounded difference in incomes exists? "We do!" Do you understand that the taxation mechanism, through which it would be possible to solve these problems, will not begin working either today or tomorrow? "We do!" Well then, shall we let this madhouse be for the time being? "Let it be!" So it is necessary to fight for social justice. As a result, we then persuaded the trade unionists with the condition that prices for a number of necessities will be regulated. Of course, we had in mind not a direct restriction of prices, but rather economic regulation, having proposed reducing the tax rate for those commercial enterprises that increase the sale of goods. And it can be increased by reducing (or at least not increasing) retail prices. The budget would also gain--as sales increase, the amount of tax receipts increase--and the consumer would gain as well. And we would at least partially have solved the problem of excessive differentiation of incomes. Unfortunately, for the time being, this idea of ours has not been supported. It is true that the presidential edict "On the Regulation of Assets Directed Toward Consumption" has now been prepared: Enterprises that have an average wage higher than 20 times the minimum wage will have an additional tax imposed, which will go into the local budget for rendering assistance to poor. The edict also stipulates other measures for limiting excessive incomes. [Protsenko] But does it not seem to you that you are looking for a solution where there is none? The entire world is combating the abnormal differentiation of incomes using an income tax. There exist, as you know, taxes on wealth and real estate taxes. "Poor Russia" is currently buying more Mercedes than the entire civilized world--where is this purchasing power coming from? Note: our entrepreneurs love very much to complain about the "production" taxes: They say they are too high and they make business expansion impossible. But complaints about high taxes on personal incomes is something I have not heard. I also do not know of an instance when a citizen who decides one fine day to buy himself, let us say, an establishment for a couple of hundred million has been asked by someone--no, not about the source of his revenues--but rather, about whether or not he had paid taxes on them. [Melikyan] The root of this evil lies in the absence in our country of normal taxation of natural persons. It is precisely by these taxes that excessive incomes are regulated and low-income people are supported. In the West, taxes from natural persons amount to more than half of all budget receipts, while they amount to only 8-10 percent in Russia. I will not even mention the fact that the taxes are being collected very poorly even from the enterprises. It is commonly believed that only 70 percent of taxes are currently being collected throughout the country. Unfortunately, I fear it is just the opposite: 70 percent are remaining uncollected. We do not know how. Russian citizens are not accustomed to paying taxes or even to figuring out their incomes. By the way, the tax on wealth is also a form of tax from natural persons. We have inserted into the governmental program an item on improvement of the system for taxing individual incomes--we are hoping to prepare in the third quarter of this year changes in the Law on the Income Tax from Natural Persons. But we are not entertaining any particular illusions--both time and our own standard of culture are needed for a radical change in the tax system. Yet in our country even the tax service is not ready, from a purely technical standpoint. Although, of course, it is necessary to begin at some point....
