Oleg Soskovets Has Boosted His Standing in Government"] [Text] The spectacular increase in Oleg Soskovets' clout in the structures of authority has been confirmed not only by the fact that so far he has remained the only first deputy prime minister of the reorganized government, but also by giving his Commission for Day-to-Day Matters [CDM] unprecedented powers. The statute on the commission, which was released yesterday for official distribution, contains so extensive a list of powers that it lends credibility to talk about an effectively monopolistic center of economic power in the government in the making. Last summer, when the CDM was set up especially for Oleg Soskovets, it was assumed that it would deal with matters of more of less secondary importance, for which the Council of Ministers Presidium would have no time. In the extreme case, the commission was intended to be a filter of sorts to sift out materials not properly prepared for government meetings. The commission's 28 meetings since 15 June 1993, however, have caused a qualitative change in the situation -- the CDM has evolved from a marginal body into an "acting" Council of Ministers Presidium. The government document released yesterday only formalized de jure what had already been accomplished. Now, Oleg Soskovets will directly control matters related to changing fuel, electric power, and railway tariffs. Another noteworthy provision gives the commission the right to consider matters related to granting financial and credit resources to industry. Thus Oleg Soskovets has continued the "expansion" of CDM's powers that had started with the Economy Ministry's handing the right to allocate export quotas over to it -- hitherto all credits had been allocated by a special government body headed by the finance minister. The commission was just as decisive in "crossing the path" of the federal administration for enterprises' bankruptcies -- judging from the document, the structure subordinate to the State Property Committee will keep responsibility only for technical procedures, whereas the CDM will determine their "ideology." It is plainly evident that this allocation of powers suits Viktor Chernomyrdin, who has entrusted his deputy with all economic matters (including strategic ones) in order to gain greater freedom on the political scene.
