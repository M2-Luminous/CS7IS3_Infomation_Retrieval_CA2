They made a statement to this effect after Zyuganov's meeting with Richard Nixon, former U.S. president. "We do not know what Messrs. Nixon and Zyuganov talked about, but judging by the fact that Mr. Nixon was pleased with the meeting, Mr. Zyuganov misrepresented the outlook for revival of communism in the USSR. There is, however, a Bolshevik, Leninite-Stalinite wing as well as Zyuganov's opportunistic neo-Gorbachev wing in today's Soviet communist movement. The former is discriminated against by opportunists of the Zyuganov's and Shenin's kind from inside the communist camp more than by the authorities," said the statement made public Wednesday. The authors of the statement believed that today a true communist was a Stalinite and revival of the Stalin-founded economic system was the only way to extract the country from the plight into which the anti-Stalinists dragged it during the 40 years since Stalin's death.
