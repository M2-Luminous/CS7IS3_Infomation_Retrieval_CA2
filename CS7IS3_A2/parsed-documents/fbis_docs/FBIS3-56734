In his interview with INTERFAX, Fedorov reaffirmed that the day before, on Tuesday, he forwarded a letter to President Boris Yeltsin in which he called the proposal to head the Finance Ministry as "unacceptable." He also reported that he disagrees with the turn in economic policy which has become quite obvious. Fedorov is against Aleksandr Zaveryukha occupying the post of vice premier and Viktor Gerashchenko the post of the Central Bank of Russia's chairman. The letter also contains several other explanations regarding his refusal about which Fedorov decided not to inform "for the time being." On Tuesday neither the prime minister nor the president gave their answers to this letter. At the same time, Fedorov underlined that he had not presented any letter regarding his resignation. Sources close to Fedorov believe that the final issue on his participation or non-participation in the government has not been solved yet. Nevertheless, a well-informed source in the Russian Government reported to INTERFAX on Tuesday that Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin made a decision not to include Fedorov in the composition of Russia's re-organized government as Finance Minister "according to Fedorov's provisions." This source asserts that President Yeltsin shares this opinion. On Tuesday during their working meeting in the Kremlin, Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin did not sign any decree on the composition of the reorganized government.
