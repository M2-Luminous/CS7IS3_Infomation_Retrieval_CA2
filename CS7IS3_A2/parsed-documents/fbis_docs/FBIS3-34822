Nine members of the groups were charged with the attempt and have been referred to the military court in criminal case no. 2 of 1994 in Sidi Barrani, Marsa Matruh, where the attempt was to have taken place when President Mubarak intended to visit Libya. The defendants managed to plant explosive charges in two important places: the airport and the VIP lounge where President Mubarak is used to staying. One of the casualties in the raid on al-Ma'sarah-Hulwan made detailed confessions under the influence of drugs while he was in surgery. Hamadah Muhammad Lutfi Abd-al-Baqi, one of the defendants in the attempt, was killed when the security forces raided the al- Zawiyah al-Hamra' hideout last week. It is worth noting that the Sidi Barrani court held its first hearing on this case on 30 January. It will hold another hearing next week. A retired judge has been summoned to chair the trial. He previously passed a verdict in a military case.
