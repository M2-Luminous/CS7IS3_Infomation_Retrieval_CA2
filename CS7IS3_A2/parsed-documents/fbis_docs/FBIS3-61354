The monopoly won out in this instance, too: The price of subscription and delivery of the press exceeds all outlays on publishing it--the cost of newsprint (at present, one tonne already costs as much as 15 million karbovantsy), printing, wages, internal outlays of editorial offices, and so on. This is happening while the quality of postal services is deteriorating markedly: More and more complaints are being heard about a failure to deliver periodicals on time. The only comforting point is that, apparently, the first blow has been dealt to the monopoly of the postal department, certainly not a lethal blow but a perceptible one: Alternative structures have come along that undertook to take subscriptions. These are the newsstands of the former Soyuzdruk [Main Administration for the Distribution of the Press of the USSR Ministry of Communications], which have broken away into the freedom of leasing from the powerful clutches of the Central Postal Office of Kiev, various small enterprises, and the editorial offices themselves. Difficult trials still lie ahead for them; it is not easy to stand against a monopoly. However, already the first holes are in the once unsinkable vessel of the Ministry of Communications. What did the results of the subscription campaign indicate? First, they testify to the fact that the impoverished population, stripped by our dear government, is no longer able to afford the spiritual nourishment--periodicals. As recently as a few years ago, the average resident of Kiev subscribed to three or four publications; last year, many people switched to one, whereas in the current year, even one newspaper has become unaffordable to many. Second, this subscription campaign indicated that everything in the domain of the press is upside down. Previously, the struggle for a large circulation was considered a matter of prestige in our country; it still is abroad. During the last subscription campaign, many editorial offices abandoned the chase after circulation: After all, the greater the circulation of a newspaper, the more difficult the life of the editorial office is and the greater the losses that await it in the near future. At present, there are virtually no profitable newspapers. I see nothing strange about the circulation of newspapers dropping yet again. Even the state press, which exists mainly thanks to the state budget, cannot withstand the current price gouging. Newspapers of the type of FINANSOVYY KIYEV and RYNOCHNAYA PLOSHCHAD, which at one time lured citizens by supposedly being free, have announced subscriptions and put themselves on the same footing as others. Third, despite the high prices for periodicals and everything else, the impoverishment of the people, and competition from free television and radio, citizens of Ukraine have displayed their high intellectual standards, considerable spiritual needs, and, in addition, their civic awareness: The results of the subscription campaign were more favorable then could be expected. SILSKI VISTI has secured a large circulation by the standards of this time, 312,000 copies, thus demonstrating yet again the stability of the only nationwide newspaper for rural areas. HOLOS UKRAYINY got 205,000 copies, URYADOVYY KURYER--182,000 copies, MOLOD UKRAYINY--70,000 copies, NEZAVISIMOST--55,000 copies, UKRAYINA MOLODA--81,000 copies, PRAVDA UKRAYINY--79,000 copies, and LITERATURNA UKRAYINA--27,000 copies. An insanely impudent and expensive advertising campaign notwithstanding, KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI failed to retain its circulation generated by scandal features, but nonetheless got subscriptions for 150,000 copies, which proves yet again that there is a social need for such a newspaper, too. Just as the editorial office had planned, VECHIRNIY KYYIV reached the intended circulation, between 40,000 and 45,000 copies, together with some retail sales. We are not able to "hack" a greater circulation in the environment of an economic crisis. For this reason, we were forced to give up the Russian-language edition; we are grateful that the majority of readers perceive this step with understanding. However, our subscribers had an opportunity to ascertain one thing: The editorial office has done everything possible to meet its obligations to the readers. As had been promised, we did not charge additional subscription fees in the middle of the year and did not reduce the size or frequency of publication of the newspaper. We published five times per week at a time when some five-day newspapers became weeklies. Our readers are receiving all the 250 issues of VECHIRNIY KYYIV due to them annually. We are also planning to publish the newspaper five times a week in the coming year. We have helped our low-income subscribers as best we could by establishing a charitable foundation and helping them to obtain subscriptions for the next year. What does the next year, the Year of the Dog, hold in store for the press? Figuratively, ours will be the life of dogs. The state publishing house--for the nth time!--has increased prices for printing services, and the Central Post Office of Kiev is counting on tripling (!?) the fees for delivering the press in the second quarter. Prices for newsprint (which is delivered exclusively from Russia) will hardly stabilize; even now, these prices reach world levels. How will the press survive under such conditions? The state press will be sustained from the state budget, that is, at our expense, regardless of whether we want this or not. The press of commercial structures will depend on how thick the wallets of their masters are: There is nothing to be done--such is the law of the market. The independent press, i.e., such that does not serve the power structure, does not have owners and does not want to have them, and that in which labor or journalist collectives act as founders--such a press has nobody to attach its hopes to, except the likewise impoverished readers. The authorities will hardly help this press, because it sticks in its craw. However, one thing is clear: The day on which the last independent newspaper goes down in Ukraine will be the beginning of the end for democracy. Actually, the offensive of the current power structure against openness and democracy and their embodiment, the mass media, has already begun. Live broadcasting of the meetings of the Supreme Council sessions has been suspended on the ridiculous pretext of ensuring an equal footing for candidates for deputy; TV commentators now assure us through the lips of their masters that the session is proceeding in a clear-cut and fine manner. The minister of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has forbidden officers to write in the civilian press if the topics of these presentations transcend the confines of the military statute. Strange things are happening at our degenerating television: Reassignments in the top leadership echelon are not aimed at a fundamental improvement in programming, but rather at the reliability of the censorship screen--God forbid that some unsanctioned thought should get through. So a television person is assigned to manage radio broadcasting, and a radio person is transplanted to television; neither one knows the new business perfectly. Ideas are hatched instead about suspending the relay of radio broadcasts to the Kiev area on the city network, thus driving a wedge into the relationship between urban and rural, areas which is not ideal to begin with. The youth studio Hart is instead being hampered, and episodes that criticize the policy of the current authorities are not being allowed on the air. A familiar situation, is it not? Add to this the fact that, contrary to the law that bans the censorship of the mass media, structures of the former censorship department that was invented by the Communist Party in its time still survive in our country; of course, they are being sustained from the budget. Who needs this? Does someone believe that a time will come when this organ for smothering free thought will be needed? This is a purely rhetorical question. Nonetheless, let us be optimistic. Our society has already matured to such a stage as to not allow the winding-down of democracy. We have entered the wide world, and there no longer is at present--nor, one hopes, will there ever be--an iron curtain separating us from the world and the world from us. Let us in unison oppose the offensive against glasnost in every way we can. We will not let them tighten the noose around the neck of the independent press. Support the press morally, organizationally, and, those of you who can do it, also financially, and the press will become a mighty weapon of the society in the struggle for the assertion of democracy.
