Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today says Japan's bid to get the trust of the Asian nations is as ridiculous as a wolf imitating the voice of the sheep. The analyst says: Asian nations heavily suffered from the Japanese imperialists' aggression and occupation in the past, which left deep scars on the hearts of their peoples. This is the cause of their distrust in and caution against Japan. Their distrust and caution are growing with the revival of militarism in Japan and its moves to become a military power. The Asian peoples have been told by top Japanese authorities more than once that Japan would not be a military power. Japan, however, has escalated arms buildup for the purpose of becoming a military power. Japan's moves to become a military power is chiefly aimed at realising with strength the design of "the greater east Asia coprosperity sphere" it failed to fulfil in the past. Japan's promise not to be a military power is a crafty ruse to launch a military aggression by blunting the vigilance of the Asian peoples. If Japan truly wants to get their trust, it must actually demonstrate its will of peace. It must, first of all, slash military expenditures, cut back armament, cancel overseas dispatch of troops and give up the nuclear armament program. It must also fully liquidate its past crimes and honestly discharge its obligation to make an apology and compensation. If Japan's promise to refrain from becoming a military power is true, it must show it in practice.
