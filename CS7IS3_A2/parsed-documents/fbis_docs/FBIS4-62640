I think there should also be a `Russian year' and a `Russian decade'," visiting Russian Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin said here today. "We can and must cooperate. Friendship with great neighbour China was created by many generations and it would be sinful to break it," Rybkin told ITAR-TASS after meeting Secretary of the Shanghai City Council of the Chinese Communist Party Wu Bangguo. In the words of the Duma speaker, the official Chinese visit of Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to begin next week will result in signing of several agreements, which are essentially important for the Russian economy. The current visit of the Duma delegation aims to search for ways of bilateral cooperation. Despite the lack of time, the Russian parliament deputies have met Chinese Chairman and General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee Jiang Zemin, Parliament Head Qiao Shi, Deputy State Council Premier Li Lanqing and Deputy Foreign Minister Tian Jiangpei. The delegation is interested in the Chinese experience of economic reforms, stressed the Duma speaker. "When in Shanghai, a major industrial center of China, we saw that the most vulnerable layers are protected in the course of market reforms. People are sure of their future", he added. In the opinion of Rybkin, the Chinese market can become a most promising for Russian businessmen. From 1.5 to two billion U.S. dollars are transferred from Russia abroad each month, much of this money is invested in inefficient real estate. This money could be better used in creation of Russian-Chinese ventures, he said. "Thousands of Shanghai joint ventures include only four with participation of Russian capital. It is too small. I am convinced that Russian-Chinese ventures are promising," said the speaker. "Being the law-makers, we will support all decisions aiming to develop Russian-Chinese cooperation," he said. On the same day, Ivan Rybkin visited a Chinese major metallurgical plant of Baoshan and the vegetable-growing farm of Luodian. After meeting the Chinese communist leader, the Duma speaker left for the Shenzhen economic zone in the Chinese south, which is considered to be a model of the Chinese economic reforms.
