He added, however, that his government would pursue contacts with the Israeli Government to discuss the terms of the deal that would be implemented after peace is established. He asserted that his country would continue welcoming Israeli delegates attending peace process conferences that may be held in Qatar in the future. In reply to a question on whether the Qatari Government would send military representatives to a joint naval rescue exercise with Israel and take part in a joint regional communications center on military issues, the Qatari foreign minister said his government would soon decide whether to participate in these projects and on what conditions. He said time was not ripe for Qatar to send representatives to visit IDF [Israel Defense Forces] training installations, and he refused to say whether this may happen in the future.
