SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of January 20, 1994 (59 FR 3166), the DOI and DHHS proposed regulations to implement Public Law 100&hyph;472, the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act Amendments of 1988. Comments received and requests for an extension of the comment period made at regional and national public meetings from American Indian and Alaska Natives indicate that 120 days was not sufficient time to review and submit comments on the proposed rule. The requests ranged from 90 days to 7 months. At the national meeting held in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the Tribal Leaders Caucus considered the requests and determined that an additional 90 days would provide adequate time for a review of the proposed regulations. All comments received during the public comment period will be given full consideration in the development of the final regulations. Dated: May 18, 1994. Ada E.
