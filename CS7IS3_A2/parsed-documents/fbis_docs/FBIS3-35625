It says, in particular: The stability of a state is guaranteed by adherence to the fundamental law, both by its citizens and by all branches of power. Unfortunately, Ukraine is one of those states where the Constitution is ignored by many political forces and power structures. The guarantor of the Constitution, the president of Ukraine, resorts to defensive statements as he watches it happen. The presidential elections in the Crimean autonomy were a gross violation of Ukrainian laws, including the Constitution. They were held in an atmosphere of blatant Ukrainophobia, with the overt financial support of benefactors from the ruble zone. The Ukrainian state leadership remained, by tradition, on the sidelines, maintaining a so-called balanced stand. These circumstances, as well as the socioeconomic situation in the state, brought RDK leader Meshkov and the Russia political bloc to executive power. The Russian Federation has acquired another lever to exert pressure on Ukraine. This particularly concerns the Black Sea Fleet and the deployment of Russian armed forces on the territory of the Ukrainian state. The Russian media, particularly Ostankino and Vesti [television channels] competed with one another in asserting that Crimea was choosing a new political course. The RDK leader won the votes of almost half of the adult population in the peninsula. Thus, the results of the voting proved that the Crimean population indeed chose a new course, looking to Russia for the economic transformations and financial injections it promises. Therefore, the results of the Crimean presidential elections give good reason for radical reconsideration of Ukraine's economic policy. Separatist Meshkov's success is also a result of the absence of a clear information policy in Ukraine aimed at strengthening its statehood. The developments of the past few months showed that Ukraine's leadership fails to command proper weight in the regions. Will officials from the RDK abide by Kiev's laws, while putting forward the declaration of the peninsula's full independence as one of their main objectives?
