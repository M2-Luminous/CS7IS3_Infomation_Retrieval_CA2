Saying he was happy to receive a personal letter from Korean President Kim Yong-sam, Clinton stressed the importance of inter-Korean dialogue and cooperation between Seoul and Washington in resolving the North Korean nuclear problem, according to Korean envoy on nuclear affairs Kim Sam-hun. The U.S. President said he looked forward to meeting President Kim at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit slated for Jakarta, Indonesia, in November. Han, delivering a verbal message from Kim, said Seoul welcomed Pyongyang's acceptance of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections, but noted it was just the first step toward a resolution and Seoul thus wished to continue close cooperation with Washington. Kim was quoted as saying that because of Pyongyang's unpredictability given past experience with the communist regime, South Korea and the United States should tread cautiously in dealing with North Korea. Kim also stressed that Seoul and Washington will abide by the principles -- implementation of IAEA inspections and exchange of presidential envoys between South and North Korea -- that are prerequisites to a third round of North Korea-U.S. high-level talks as agreed at a summit last November in Washington. Clinton reportedly responded to Kim's personal letter delivered last week by reaffirming the initial Seoul-Washington agreement on thorough and broad settlement of the North Korean nuclear problem. Han tried to schedule a meeting with Clinton during his Feb. 10- 11 stay in Washington before visiting Canada to personally deliver Kim's letter, but failed due to the Washington-Tokyo summit. The foreign minister made a second stop in Washington to coordinate further efforts on the nuclear problem following North Korea's acceptance of IAEA inspections. He headed for Seoul after his meeting with Clinton.
