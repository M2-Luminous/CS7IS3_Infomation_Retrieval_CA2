Around the same time three Serb shells fell in a non-residential area of central Sarajevo, another spokesman said. The Serbs approached the collection point at Poljine, near Vogosca, six kilometres (four miles) north of Sarajevo, at 8:00 p.m. (1800 GMT) Sunday, and demanded that they be allowed to move a 122mm gun stored in the depot with several other large-calibre guns, UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] spokesman Eric Chaperon said. French UN peacekeepers at the site rejected the demand, and the Serbs left around midnight after NATO planes were called in to overfly the region. Meanwhile three Serb shells exploded near the Grbavica area of Sarajevo, Sarajevo sector spokesman Guy Vinet said. Two fell 300 metres (yards) from the Brotherhood and Unity bridge, the main crossing point between central Sarajevo and the Serb-controlled Grbavica suburb. No casualties were reported. The incidents were the latest in a series in which Serb forces have violated or attempted to violate ceasefire agreements and exclusion zones ordered by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation around Sarajevo and Gorazde in eastern Bosnia. An UNPROFOR convoy bringing a British battalion of peacekeepers to Gorazde was still held up early Monday at Rogatica where local officials were demanding to inspect the personal possessions of the troops, Chaperon said. The convoy set out for Gorazde at 8:00 a.m. on Saturday and was held up at the first Serb checkpoint between Sarajevo and Kiseljak, west of the capital, for most of the day. An UNPROFOR spokesman said Sunday he believed the convoy had been allowed through Rogatica, located midway along the 70-killometre (40-mile) route between Sarajevo and Gorazde. The troops are badly needed to reinforce the 500 peacekeepers currently policing the exclusion zone imposed on the UN-designated safe area. Chaperon said the delay was a violation of NATO's April 22 ultimatum ordering free and unimpeded movement for UNPROFOR and humanitarian relief convoys. An attack on Danish Leopard tanks near the safe area of Tuzla, in northeastern Bosnia, late Friday left nine dead and four wounded on the Serb side when the UN peacekeepers riposted, Chaperon said, citing figures issued by the Serbs. The tanks fired 72 rounds during the exchange near a UN observation post. "Shooting at a Leopard is a very bad idea," Chaperon added. The sector further north near Brcko, where UNFPROFOR has detected a build-up of Serb heavy weapons and Bosnian army infantry in recent days, was reported quiet. A group of around 100 Serb militiamen had grouped on the east bank of the Drina river within the three-kilometre (two-mile) exclusion zone in Gorazde, Chaperon said. Most of the men were currently unarmed, though they had been armed earlier, he added said. The Serbs claimed to be policemen, ensuring the protection of Serb civilians in that part of the town, he noted.
