Its participants adopted a statement, which notes in particular: "The People's Movement of Ukraine appealed to all of Ukraine's political forces back in the autumn with a request to avoid discussing the issue of electing a president of Ukraine and possible candidates for this post during the Supreme Council election campaign. "With his latest statements about the untimeliness of presidential elections and his possible non-participation in them, President Kravchuk has caused political tension in society, which could be negatively reflected in the Supreme Council elections. "Under such conditions the Lesser Council of the People's Movement of Ukraine considers holding presidential elections before either the existing or the newly-elected Supreme Council decides on the status and powers of Ukraine's president to be illogical (?and) differing from the practice of civilized countries. The people of Ukraine should know whom they will be electing: Only the head of state or the head of executive power. "We are calling on all political parties, public organizations and groupings to refrain from discussing candidacies for the post of president of Ukraine in the mass media. All forces should be concentrated on the Supreme Council elections not being disrupted, because this would lead Ukraine to anarchy or dictatorship by the nomenklatura elite. "We believe that following Ukraine's Supreme Council elections, parties and public organizations of a national-democratic tendency should hold consultations with the aim of agreeing on a single candidacy for the post of president from all of the national-democratic forces."
