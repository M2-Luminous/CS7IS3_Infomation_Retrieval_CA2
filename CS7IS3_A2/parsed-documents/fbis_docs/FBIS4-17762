"Russia is going to hold the negotiations without any ultimatums or preliminary conditions but with a precise political position," he emphasized. In his opinion, a single position with respect to Chechnya among Russia's supreme echelons of power is an important premise for a success. As Shakhray underlined, "Moscow intends to hold consultations with all real political forces and power bodies in Chechnya and then to precisely fix a draft agreement on the division of authorities and the subject of these consultations, then it intends to start negotiations and preparation of a draft agreement just after the State Duma adopts a corresponding decision." Shakhray said that it will be necessary to sign the agreement only after democratic free elections in Chechnya. Russia will use a similar mechanism as that used with Tatarstan to achieve agreement at the negotiations. To quote Shakhray that mechanism was "when we first of all searched for concrete authorities in various spheres, in transport, oil processing, agrarian sector, border defense, etc., and then included the reached agreements into a political formula on relations."
