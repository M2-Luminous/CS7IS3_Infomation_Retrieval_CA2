An increase in the authority of this public association -- which was created at the initiative of the Belarusian Association of Servicemen with the United Democratic Party of Belarus, the Belarusian Popular front, the Belarusian Social Democratic Assembly, the Belarusian Peasant Party, the Belarusian Christian Democratic Union, the National Democratic Party of Belarus, the Party of People's Accord, and the Association of Belarusian Language -- was evidenced by the fact that it was joined by the United Agrarian Democratic Party, the Union of Entrepreneurs, the Belarusian Association of Invalids, and the Belarusian Environmental Party. Participants in the session discussed the issues of expanding HKK structures throughout the Republic and concentrated their attention on fraud committed by certain individuals seeking nominations for president. With regard to these facts, the following press statement was released: "Mr. Kebich's initiative group was being formed through state power structures. Indicative of this is an example in the city of Zhlobin, where a local school teacher, at his own request, was included in Shushkevich's initiative group. Later, it turned out that the same teacher, without being asked for his consent, was included in Kebich's support group as well. In this man's opinion, initiative groups in support of Kebich were created according to the so-called telephone rule [not further identified]. "During the recent session of the Defense Ministry Collegium, the defense minister of the Republic of Belarus was openly campaigning in support of Kebich as well as against Shushkevich and Lukashenka, regardless of the fact that our Army is to remain outside of politics. "At the Academy of Physical Training, the signature campaign in support of Kebich is being conducted under an order from the dean. "Commanders of the Interior Troops have given orders to their subordinates to ensure that Interior Troop personnel vote for Kebich. "Managers of the enterprises, which are members of the Belarusian Scientific and Industrial Association and support Mr. Kebich, are trying to put under their control the creation of district electoral commissions." By the way, the HKK may be contacted by telephone at 36-09-09.
