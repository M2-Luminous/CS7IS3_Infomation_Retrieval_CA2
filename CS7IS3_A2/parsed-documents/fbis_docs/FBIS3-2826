Speaking at a press conference held by the current session of the National People's Congress, Zhu said that the government has basically solved the problem of wage payment delays for teachers in most areas of the country. But some localities are still owing teachers bonuses and subsidies, he said. Zhu said that the government's budgeted spending on education undertakings will reach 81.5 billion yuan this year, including investment in infrastructures. Zhu said that though the government education budget is much higher than that for 1993, it is still "a far cry from the actual need." He said that the government needs the money to support the nine-year compulsory education system, which is aimed at enabling 85 percent of school-age children to complete nine-year education by the end of the century. After quoting the part of Premier Li Peng's report to the National People's Congress (NPC), or Chinese parliament, that urges local governments to slash expenditures on other aspects and take every means to increase fund input in education undertakings, Zhu said that more channels of fund raising should be opened. "The government has decreed that localities which owe teachers their salaries are not allowed to buy expensive cars and build nonproductive buildings," he said. "Government-allocated fund accounts for two-thirds of expenditures on education, but it should not be the only source of funding," he said. He said that, besides government allocation, China's education system also relies on school-run enterprises, tuition, donations and foundations to support its 200 million students and 10 million teachers. The sources provide over 16.1 billion yuan for the education system in 1992. Asked whether an increase in tuitions will affect college enrollment, he said that China will keep fees for college students at an acceptable level. Universities are now charging every student 1,000 to 1,500 yuan as tuition and miscellaneous fees annually. The charges will go up in coming years. The government is offering scholarships, living stipends, student loans and tuition waivers for students. "Under the socialist education system, we shall not let a single student drop out of school because of economic reasons," he said. As for Chinese students studying abroad, he said that the government has adopted a policy of permitting people study abroad, allowing them to come and go freely and encouraging Chinese living abroad to serve the motherland in various ways. "We can understand that some people want to stay in foreign countries for a time or apply for the status of permanent residents in these countries," he said. He said that Chinese students studying abroad have always maintained close contacts with the motherland. "They can make contributions to their motherland's modernization drive from abroad," he said. China has sent 210,000 students abroad for study in the past 15 years. One-third of them, or 70,000, have returned to the country.
