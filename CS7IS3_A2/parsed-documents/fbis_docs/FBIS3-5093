Hosokawa told reporters the United States expects a more favorable response from Japan over trade disputes, particularly those over cellular phones, insurance and government procurement markets. The prime minister said he will take the lead in improving ties between Japan and the United States. Hosokawa said he was informed of the U.S. decision in an early morning telephone call on Friday by president Bill Clinton. Hosokawa quoted Clinton as saying that the U.S. Congress is preparing more rigid trade action and that the reinstatement of the Super 301 legislation is considerably more moderate. The premier said, however, it would take a long time for the U.S. to actually apply the Super 301 provision. Earlier in the day, Hosokawa said he is not considering any immediate steps to counter the fresh U.S. move. "No, none at this moment," Hosokawa said. "We agreed to deal with the matter coolly," he said. Hosokawa later ordered cabinet ministers to give priority to opening the telecommunications market and the distribution system in working out economic deregulation to provide foreign firms wider access to the Japanese market, government officials said. The officials said Hosokawa issued the order at a meeting held after a regular cabinet session.
