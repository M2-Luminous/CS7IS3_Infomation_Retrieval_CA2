He made this remark while speaking about China at a forum on Portugal's foreign policy at the Foreign Ministry.

Last year, Portugal welcomed the visits of PRC President Jiang Zemin and Vice President Rong Yiren. There were also frequent exchanges of visits by high-ranking officials of the two countries. Barroso also pointed out: On the question of Macao, the Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group has carried out its work in a way both sides consider very positive. He said that his visit to China last year enabled him to develop closer contacts with Chinese leaders and enhanced his understanding of the current extremely dynamic period in China's development.
