Scharping espoused President Vaclav Havel's statement that these states should not be considered post-communist states any longer and spoke in favor of their fastest possible joining the European Union [EU]. It is important for Germany to establish a dense network of contacts with the Eastern states and not to be confined only to official political contacts, Scharping stressed. In connection with this he criticized Helmut Kohl's cabinet and other Western countries for their reluctant assistance to Central and East European countries. Scharping also criticized Kohl's cabinet for the way in which it was coming to terms with the compensation to the Nazi victims in the Czech Republic and Germans expelled from Czechoslovakia after World War Two. Havel's proposal to settle these issues was "very generous," while Bonn "set it aside," Scharping said. Scharping did not mention what proposal he had in mind. He was probably referring to Havel's 1991 initiative which wanted to grant Czechoslovak citizenship to Sudeten Germans, provided they drop their property claims in their former homeland and that Bonn acknowledges that the 1938 Munich accord was not valid since the very beginning, and to Havel's later proposals to compensate the Czech victims persecuted by the Nazi regime. The Federal Government has never responded to the proposal, Scharping stated. The unresolved problems in bilateral relations are "the hotbed of new nationalism." "Nationalism is something we need the least in Europe," he added. SPD deputy Gernot Erler stressed that Germany had to strive to eliminate the West's protectionist trade measures towards the reform-minded countries. He rejected the claim that given the present economic slump, East European exports would threaten Western economic development. The 1992 East European exports to the EU countries made up only 4 percent of the total volume, which was about the same as Norway's share, Erler reported.
