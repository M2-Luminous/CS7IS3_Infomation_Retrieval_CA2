FR941021-1-00010 FR941021-1-00003 FMS invites comments regarding the possibility of referencing within either this regulation or the Treasury Financial Manual a standard dollar limit of $10,000, with $25,000 exceptions by permission of FMS, above which a FedSelect check could not be issued by an agency. This limit is being considered to be consistent with FMS's electronic payment policies as contained within 31 CFR Part 206 and to minimize losses to agencies arising from negligence, forgeries, counterfeiting, and alterations. FMS requests that comments on this matter include any foreseen (positive or negative) effects of limiting the dollar amount of FedSelect checks, including whether a dollar limit would encourage an agency to participate in the FedSelect check program. Rulemaking Analysis It has been determined that this regulation is not a significant regulatory action as defined in E.O. 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It is hereby certified that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A regulatory flexibility analysis is not required. It is anticipated that FedSelect checks will not negatively affect a substantial number of small entities because of the relatively low volume of checks to be issued in comparison to the use of other payment mechanisms by Federal agencies. Notice and Comment Public comment is solicited on all aspects of this proposed rule. The FMS will consider all comments made on the substance of this proposed rule, but does not intend to hold hearings on it. List of Subjects in 31 CFR Part 247 Banks, Banking, Checks, Federal Reserve System. Issuance For the reasons set forth in the preamble, it is proposed to add 31 CFR part 247 to read as follows: PART 247_REGULATIONS GOVERNING FEDSELECT CHECKS Sec. 247.1␣Applicability. 247.2␣Governing law. 247.3␣Definitions. 247.4␣Federal Reserve Banks. 247.5␣Federal agencies and termination of services. 247.6␣Depositary institutions and presenting banks. 247.7␣Certification and internal agency control. 247.8␣Presentment. 247.9␣Presentment warranties. 247.10␣Notice and replacement_non-receipt, theft, loss or destruction; late presentment. 247.11␣Losses and accountability. 247.12␣Debt collection. 247.13␣Funds for losses. 247.14␣Additional requirements. 247.15␣Waiver of regulations. 247.16␣Supplements, amendments or revisions. Authority: 12 U.S.C. 391; 31 U.S.C. Chapter 33. §247.1 Applicability. The regulations in this Part prescribe the rights and liabilities of the United States, the Federal Reserve Banks, depositary institutions, and others on FedSelect checks. These regulations apply to FedSelect checks issued on behalf of the United States for payments in connection with United States obligations. FedSelect checks are issued by Federal agencies on Federal Reserve Bank check stock. FedSelect checks are drawn on the payor Federal Reserve Bank in its banking capacity. The drawer of a FedSelect check is the United States; the drawee is a Federal Reserve Bank. Therefore, a FedSelect check shall not be deemed to be drawn on the United States nor shall the Federal Reserve Bank be deemed its drawer.
