Britain's ICI, U.S.-based Glaxo and DHL, and even Taiwan's Acer will cut the size of their business in Taiwan, according to an investment willingness survey comissioned by the CEPD. Hsiao said the survey showed that some 30 percent of all foreign business groups lacked confidence in Taiwan's investment climate and are making plans to gradually withdraw capital from Taiwan in the next few years and shift their Asian business centers to Singapore or Mainland China. Most manufacturers surveyed said Taiwan's investment climate had become worse over the past five years, creating problems in their investment and production plans, Hsiao noted. Hsiao explained that the survey listed Taiwan's labor shortage, rising labor costs, skyrocketing land prices, low administrative efficiency and deteriorating quality of life as most affecting manufacturers' investment willingness. If there is no significant improvement in the domestic investment climate, some international enterprises will consider narrowing their business scale here and may even leave the island, Hsiao warned. Hsiao added that the survey results have stunned the government, which planned for increased investment after the completion of the six-year national development plan in 1996. The results also run counter to the government's plans to develop Taiwan into an Asia- Pacific business operations center, Hsiao said. Some of the multinational enterprises already have concrete plans to cancel new investment in Taiwan, which may have a negative impact on the island's economy, Hsiao said. Improving the domestic investment climate and keeping foreign manufacturers are the government two most urgent tasks, Hsiao said. The survey polled 103 manufacturers in the service, finance, and manufacturing fields, including President Foods, Jardine Fleming, Nestle, Bayer, 3M, American Express, Texas Instruments, Westinghouse, IBM, AT&T, Citibank, United Airlines, Lockheed, BBC, Canon, Philips, NEC, Ford Motor Co., General Electric, General Motors, Microsoft Corp., and Acer.
