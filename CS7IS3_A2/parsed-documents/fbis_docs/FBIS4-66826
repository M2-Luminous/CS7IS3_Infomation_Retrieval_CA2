Malda, with a 170-km-long border with Bangladesh, is no exception. The villages here, dotted along the border--from Kaliachawk to Bamangola--survive on smuggling. Some BSF personnel serve as catalysts. Local smugglers reportedly thrive under the patronage of the panchayats and violence, mostly in connection with smuggling-related incidents, erupts at regular intervals. In Malda town itself, out of the estimated 20,000 rickshaw drivers, 7,000 are suspected to be Bangladeshis, who cross the border each day to make a living. Intelligence officers here said that a Bangladeshi has to pay Rs 20 [rupees] to the BSF to cross over. Most of them return home but some stay back. The district administration says it is worried at the spate of criminal activities along vulnerable points along the border. Kumbhira, Mojonpur, Kumarpur, Atradanga, Modipur and Muchia-Adampur have been identified as some of the hot-spots. At a BSF border camp near Adampur this morning, a youth was seen having a conversation with security personnel. Inquiries revealed that he was caught by the police only a week ago with smuggled goods. However, he was back in business. Incidentally, he was the brother of the panchayat pradhan, a CPI(M) [Communist Party of India-Marxist] leader. This isn't a singular case. Today the BSF watch-tower was vacant and people freely roamed in the "No Man's Land." Just across the Mahananda River, residents of Bholahat of Bangladesh were seen bathing. A man crossed the river and proceeded towards Bangladesh, wading in the waist-deep water. An elderly resident, apparently scared to identify himself, said: "We are used to seeing trucks being parked on the riverbank while smuggled goods are being loaded and unloaded." Mr Krishnendu Chowdhury, district Youth Congress(I) president, said that there was a system of "Border Dak" in the BSF outposts. Under this, the big-league smugglers are allegedly required to pay hefty sums to the BSF outposts, which, in turn, allow them to operate freely. Cattle smuggling and theft of cattle have posed serious threats to the villagers. They allege that the personnel of the Bangladesh Rifles, the BSF and smugglers--from both sides of the border--have forged alliances of convenience at several points along the border. And cattle continues to disappear from Indian villages. Besides cattle, rice, sugar, atta and kerosene continue to be ferried across the border with impunity. They fetch prices double those in Indian markets. And in return, arms, gold and electronic goods are despatched to different parts of India through various points in Malda. Seen in this context, last Sunday's firing has put the role of a section BSF personnel in question. Villagers say that the BSF personnel's free mixing with known smugglers, harassing village women and extortion from villagers, have brought the entire force under a cloud. Local residents say they are too apprehensive to talk to the BSF and this has severely affected the organization's Intelligence network. Also, the committed personnel are incurring the wrath of the villagers.
