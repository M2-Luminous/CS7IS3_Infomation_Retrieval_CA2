The Thai military emerged during the reign of King Rama V. At the time, both the military and civilians were duty-bound to fight against any foreign military invader. At first, King Rama V only wanted the military to suppress internal rebels, but things changed after Thailand lost a war to France and had to give up part of its territory. During the reign of King Rama VI, a force of defence scouts was set up to balance the power of the military. In 1932, King Rama VII was arrested by the military, an incident that led to the changing of Thailand's political system from absolute monarchy to constitutional monarchy. So the military has played the dominant role in the country since the reign of King Rama V? Of course. And since 1952, the Thai military has virtually had its own state in Thailand. What are the military's good points at present? The military should only have one duty -- to protect the country. Its budget and personnel should be reduced. The Army preparatory school should only produce military personnel who want to be professional soldiers, not prime ministers. Many army generals forced out of command by the people are still alive. They're still playing golf and having a good time in Thailand. The military is now very angry with political activist Chalat Worachat, who's on a death fast. It was the military that told Prime Minister Chuan Likphai not to yield to Chalat's demands. Do you think the military still wants to get involved In politics to solve any national crisis that arise? Yes it does. This has been going on in Thai society since the time of ACM [Air Chief Marshal) P. Phibunsongkhram. The Thai school system was used to teach people to respect the military. Male students were told to cut their hair short like soldiers. Students are still required to stand in front of the flag polo at eight o'clock every morning. No other schools in the world make their students stand before the flag pole every morning. The practice is the military's idea. How do the military and politics balance each other? People must first realize that the military is a separate state in Thailand. It can do things normal people can't do. It's alleged that its members can do business with the Khmer Rouge and Burma. If you look around Bangkok, you'll see that many areas belong to the military. The military has its own "secret" budget and nobody knows how they spend the money. Thai military representatives overseas have a lot of money to spend. It's not fair for the citizens. I don't see why they should receive such a huge budget. What in your opinion would constitute a "good" military? One whose only duty was to protect the country. If Chalat's hunger strike spins out of control, is it appropriate fro the military to be called out to solve the problem? That would be very dangerous. It's already old fashioned to use force to quell a public uprising. In fact, this country has no need to maintain a large military. The military budget should be cut. A former deputy finance minister once told me he was very worried about the military budget because it was nearly impossible to examine military spending. Does the present role and status of the military satisfy the people? Not yet. The military doesn't like Chalat because it fears losing power if his demand for a new charter is honoured. The military is involved in many different kinds of trade. They have their own schools, hospitals, banks and overseas representatives. Most of the people don't know that the present charter was written by pro-military academics . Will the Army ever become democratic? No, not ever. Soldiers are soldiers and they have to listen to many levels of commanders. In a democracy, people have equal right to express their opinions in public. Soldiers in the lower ranks don't have the right to voice their opinions. They have to listen to their commanders. What's your view on the military's role in Chalat's protest? Army commander in chief Gen Wimon Wongwanit called Chalat a "madman". Chuan is not brave enough to implement Chalat's demands because the prime minister is afraid of the military. However, the military shouldn't become involved in the current political situation. Is there still a chance the military could stage a coup? As long as people are still not aware of their rights in a democracy, there is the chance the military could stage a coup at any time. At present, the military doesn't want to be too visible because the people lost faith in the Army during the 1992 bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators. Aren't you afraid of being hurt by the military because of your comment? Everybody has a sense of fear, but I have to speak out against things that are incorrect because it's my duty to protect democracy in our country. How do you feel when the military issues statements hitting back at your comments? It's good for the military to retaliate with words. It's much better than ordering their men to beat me up. I don't believe this is a barbaric era. If they were to use barbaric methods against me, I could end up dying like a dog along the roadside.
