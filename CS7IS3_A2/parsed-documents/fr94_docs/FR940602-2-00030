ZEV Component of OTC LEV •Is the ZEV sales mandate required to be part of the OTC LEV program? •Status of Electric Vehicle technology •Permutations on the ZEV Sales Mandate •Possible conditions or incentives for ZEVs (such as sales tax rebate or income tax credit). •Emissions impact of conditions or incentives for ZEVs in the absence of a sales mandate. •Consistency of conditions or incentives for ZEVs with Sections 177 and 209. B. Second Meeting; Durham, NH on June 23, 1994 EPA intends the morning session to focus on the magnitude of reductions needed in assessing the OTC LEV program or alternatives. The Agency believes the amount of reductions that additional control measures must achieve for attainment is a threshold criterion for discussion. As noted in EPA's proposal, studies have consistently concluded that substantial reductions in NO x and VOC emissions are likely to be necessary to reduce ozone to the 0.12 ppm NAAQS or below throughout the OTR during periods of adverse meteorological conditions. The best available information about the amount, location, timing, and type of these reductions may be important in assessing the need for the OTC's recommended LEV program. EPA recognizes the discussions regarding the magnitude of reductions needed involves legal, policy and technical aspects that are in many ways interrelated. EPA expects that all of these aspects will be addressed in the discussion of these issues. Background information for the legal and policy aspects of this topic can be found in EPA's proposal, 59 FR at 21727&hyph;30. Background information for the technical aspects of this topic can be found in EPA's proposal, 59 FR at 21730&hyph;31. Also in the morning session, the Agency intends to provide an opportunity for discussion of whether alternative control measures are available to obtain sufficient emissions reductions so that more stringent emissions standards for new cars would not be necessary. This information could be relevant to the need for the OTC LEV program or a program to obtain similar reductions from new cars. As discussed in EPA's proposal, other measures may qualify as ``alternatives'' to LEV only if the other measures, singly or in combination, generate enough reductions to fill the entire shortfall needed without LEV. Background information for the alternatives topic can be found in EPA's proposal, 59 FR at 21733&hyph;34. The agenda for the morning session is as follows: Magnitude of Reductions 1.␣Location of needed reductions; relevance of contribution to downwind nonattainment, including discussion of requirements for attainment demonstration and relevance of boundary conditions. 2.␣Best current information regarding the OTR's needs for attainment, including timing of reductions for moderate, serious, and severe areas. 3.␣Need for reductions for maintenance. 4.␣Magnitude of motor vehicle emissions in the overall inventory. 5.␣Confidence in current technical tools and information. Sufficiency of Alternatives that Might Render OTC LEV Unnecessary, Including Magnitude of Reductions Available, Cost, Practicability, and Reasonableness In the afternoon session, EPA intends to begin discussion of alternative programs designed to reduce emissions from new motor vehicles. EPA recognizes that such alternatives designed to reduce emissions from new motor vehicles could conceivably constitute an ``alternative'' to OTC LEV. Such alternatives that obtain reductions from the same sources as the OTC LEV program would thus be, at least in part, redundant of the reductions that the OTC LEV program would generate. (If entirely redundant of OTC LEV reductions, the sufficiency of such an alternative to fill the entire shortfall might arguably not be important.) EPA intends to begin discussion of such motor vehicle alternatives in the afternoon session.
