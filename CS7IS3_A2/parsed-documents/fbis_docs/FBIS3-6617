The expression was one going a step forward from the earlier government view expressed in the statement of July last year and elsewhere, but Prime Minister Hosokawa told reporters, "I have heard nothing about it." A senior official of Komeito, which is one of the coalition parties, spoke on the speech, saying, "It should have been consulted with appropriate offices of the ruling parties; this was too sudden." It can be said that the charge that government "policy is absent" in important issues that have to do with Japan's future has once again been proven correct. Ambassador Hatano's speech is different from government's past expressions on the issue. The government issued a statement [last July] stating Japan is "willing to do what it can to fulfill its responsibilities in the UN Security Council." In a speech to the United Nations in last September, the prime minister said Japan is "willing to do what it can to fulfill its responsibilities in the reformed United Nations." In testimonies before the Diet the prime minister has used such expressions as "we will go a natural way" and "our position is that we will become one if recommended [by other countries]." Hatano's speech was different from all this, and expressed Japan's desire to become a permanent member of the council in a direct manner. A top official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA], explaining this, said, "Many nations have pointed out that the expressions of the past made `it impossible to tell whether Japan wanted to become one or not.'" Another MOFA official explained to reporters, "An expression like `will become one if recommended' is not passable in the international community, and the ambassador's expression did not go beyond what was said in the statement [of last July]." MOFA officials are said to have visited the prime minister's office to explain the speech as well. But the prime minister's office was confused. The prime minister initially said he has "heard nothing about it," but then changed his position to saying "it is the same as the statement of last year." Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura in a news conference did not try to hide his embarrassment, admitting: "I have not heard the explanation on the speech. What I heard was an explanation about the general things about the United Nations and the Security Council. I have not seen the full text of the speech yet." The fact of the matter is that the coalition government does not want to tackle the matter squarely from the front. Since the matter concerns the basic policies of the coalition parties, and thus can become an issue that causes adverse effects on the unity of the coalition, the government appears to be facing the problem of having to be very, very careful in dealing with this question.
