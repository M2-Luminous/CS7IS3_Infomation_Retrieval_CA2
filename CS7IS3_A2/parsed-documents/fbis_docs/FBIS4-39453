It has sufficient resources at its disposal to move swiftly out of economic crisis, and this is the aim of its parliamentarians' daily work. State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin said this during a meeting with Ne'matollah Izadi, ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary of the Islamic Republic of Iran in the Russian Federation. New legislation is being drawn up in the Duma which will guarantee foreign investment in the Russian economy. In Ivan Rybkin's opinion, this will permit the scope of traditional Russo- Iranian cooperation to be extended. The Iranian ambassador agreed with the State Duma chairman about the need to extend bilateral contact in various spheres. He noted that the Iranian leadership attaches great significance to interaction between the two parliaments in inter-state relations. The State Duma press office reports that also today, the State Duma chairman met Rogelio Montenegro, ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary of the Republic of Cuba in Russia. The two men held detailed discussions about the problem of the U.S. trade embargo on Cuba. Among other things, Ivan Rybkin said that he considers as unnatural any sanctions implemented by force or embargos in inter-state relations. "Such measures can only be justified if there are extraordinary reasons for them," he stressed.
