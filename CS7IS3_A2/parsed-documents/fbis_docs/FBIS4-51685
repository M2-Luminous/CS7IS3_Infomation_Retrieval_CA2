Reflecting the continued recession, private-sector orders declined 22.7 percent to 11.2 trillion yen -- also the third straight yearly fall. Public-sector orders also went down 10.7 percent to 6.41 trillion yen -- the first year-on-year fall in eight years. Ministry officials said public-sector orders fell because central and local governments barred the major construction companies involved in bribery scandals from making bids for some months by way of penalty. Orders obtained in March, the last month of the fiscal year, by the 50 companies declined by 15 percent from the year before to 3.05 trillion yen -- the 14th monthly year-on-year fall in a row. Private-sector orders plummeted 26.8 percent to 1.75 trillion yen, while public-sector orders increased 10.2 percent to a record 1.11 trillion yen.
