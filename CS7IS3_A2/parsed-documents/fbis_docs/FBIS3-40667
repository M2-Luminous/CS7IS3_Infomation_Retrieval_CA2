In an interview to PTI [Press Trust of India] here on the eve of relinquishing his tenure as AEPC chairman, Chugh said though a definite time-frame of ten years has been hammered out for the abolition of import-quota regime embodied by the Multi Fibre Arrangement (MFA), the process of integration of textiles into GATT would be abysmally slow and in the case of EU and the US this would be insubstantial till the end of the tenth year. Elaborating on this point, Chugh said the EU has agreed only for 1.4 per cent integration for the first three years, 6.9 per cent in the next four years and 15.4 per cent in the last three years. Thus, as far as EU is concerned, in seven years' time the textile regime under the MFA would be freed only to the extent of 8.3 per cent while the remainder 15 per cent in the last three years. He said with the EU only 23.7 per cent of the total textile trade would be freed of the MFA and "virtually no growth has been given to us and we could only hope that by the end of the decade, the balance 76 per cent is freed at one go, which is a fond hope." Referring to India's textile exports to the United States, Chugh said the integration phase ranges from three per cent in the first three years, 10 per cent in the next four years and 32 per cent in the last three years. This meant, he said, 13 per cent integration in seven years and at the end of the ten year it would be 45 per cent and the remainder 55 per cent would be `at one go after ten years, which is again a fond hope.' Chugh charged the developed countries with using the ten year phase-out time to solve their recession faced by their textile industry by offloading their obsolete machinery to third world textile exporters who were in any case liberalising their imports of capital goods for purchase provided to garment exporters. He said if only the government could release the Rs 1.5 crore due to the council, it would apportion the sum for footing expenses incurred by exporters in garment fair exhibition abroad or for promotional work. He said in the past AEPC used to foot 40 per cent of expenses borne by exporters in trade fair participation abroad. Referring to developments at home, the outgoing AEPC chairman said the government's recent move insisting on garment quota-brokers to deposit one lakh nonrefundable sum with Rs 5,000 annual charges was challenged in the court. He said the move designed to defeat quota frauds, only helped the quota-brokers as they seemed to be dictating exporter/manufacturer. Chugh suggested the garment exporters must have a choice and quota brokers should only be optional and wherever self-certification as in the case of customs would do it should be permitted. Expressing concern over the sudden decline in non-quota exports recently, the AEPC said this was due to abolition of market development assistance (MDA). Chugh also pleaded for providing ten categories of items for export under non-quota entitlement (NQE) which was slashed to five under the 1994-96 three-year garment policy. He said non-quota exports had declined from 18 per cent last year to 10 per cent now. Chugh wanted a separate joint secretary in charge of garment exports so that exporters facing problems could have an audience with the official to sort out issues. This is necessary, he said, because garments exports alone account for 15 per cent of the country's aggregate exports. He was optimistic that the current year's target of garment exports of Rs 10,500 crore would `surely be achieved,' provided the government came forward to address the basic problems plaguing exporters including changes in the AEPC set-up where an IAS [Indian Administrative Service] officer with limited tenure functions as director-general.
