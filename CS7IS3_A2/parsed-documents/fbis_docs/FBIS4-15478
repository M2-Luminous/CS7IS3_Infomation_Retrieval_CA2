The Pskov region attracted the attention of Swedish businessmen by its rich natural resources and developed industry. They also hope to benefit considerably by taking part in rehabilitation of the region's ailing agrarian sector. After discussing ways of improving the Pskov region's economy by joint efforts and seeing the sights of the old Russian town, Mrs. af Ugglas left for Sweden. Meanwhile, her Russian counterpart visited the Pechora segment of the Russian-Estonian border, where he was informed about the construction of border facilities and about the current situation on the border which has been deteriorating with every passing day. Senior officials of the regional administration told the Russian foreign minister that they would like to improve ties with the Baltic republics rather than to tighten a border regime. Nevertheless, Kozyrev said, it would be better to reinforce the border with technical means than with bodies of Russian soldiers. On Thursday night, the Russian foreign minister flew off back to Moscow.
