In addition, Qinghai, Yunnan and Guizhou provinces are also inhabited by a large number of ethnic groups. Following on the heels of a sustained growth in agricultural production since 1992, the eight provinces and autonomous regions reaped another good harvest in 1993. Achievements The Tibet Autonomous Region, located on the "Roof of the World", registered a bumper harvest for the sixth successive year. The region's total grain output last year hit a historic high of 620,000 tons, quadrupling the figure for 1952 following the peaceful liberation of Tibet. In 1993, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region recorded its 15th successive bumper harvest. The region's total grain output equalled the 1992 level of 7.02 million tons, even though the acreage planted to grain was reduced by more than 60,000 hectares. The output of cotton reached 750,000 tons, up 7 percent over 1992, while grape output rose to 270,000 tons, up 20 percent. In the not too distant past, the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region needed to ship in 1 million tons of grain from other parts of the country annually. However, over the past five years, strengthened capital construction enabled local agricultural production to experience an average annual growth of 12 percent, thus ensuring self-sufficiency for the region's grain consumption. In 1993, the region reaped a total grain output of 11 million tons, a record high. The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region's grain output reached 2.03 million tons in 1993, an increase of 9.3 percent over 1992. Guizhou Province notched an all-round increase in agricultural production in 1993, with total grain output hitting 8.65 million tons, up 11.89 percent over 1992. The province also achieved great progress in the production of cured tobacco, sugarcane, tea, meat, eggs and milk. Qinghai, which is located on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, is home to a large number of ethnic groups, including Mongolian, Tibetan, Hui and Kazakh nationalities. The province is also one of China's major animal husbandry bases. In 1993, despite heavy snowstorms which killed 13.4 million head of livestock, the province, thanks to the timely action of the local-government and masses, still set new records in the rate of slaughtered domestic animals, the rate of domestic animals sold as commodities and the output of meat, milk and hides. This indicates that the province has already extricated itself from the plight of relying on the heavens for animal husbandry production. Summer grain output in Guangxi jumped by 6.1 percent and the region's total agricultural output value for last year rose by 9.4 percent, mirroring simultaneous increases in the production of grain and cash crops. The development of agriculture and animal husbandry in ethnic regions has resulted in remarkable increases in the incomes of local farmers and herdsmen. The 1993 per-capita income for rural and pastoral residents in Xinjiang averaged 780 yuan, up 5.4 percent over 1992; per-capita income for rural residents in Guangxi reached 860 yuan, showing a growth rate equaling the nation's average; per- capita income for rural and pastoral residents in Tibet averaged 515 yuan, up 5.1 percent over 1992; and the 1992 per-capita income for poverty-stricken mountainous areas in south Ningxia registered a 200 percent increase over 1982. Reasons for Development The successive years of bumper harvests in China's ethnic areas should be attributed to local government concerted efforts to place priority on agriculture and animal husbandry and their introduction of a series of effective measures. Increased capital input. Yunnan Province, where a large number of China's minority nationalities live in compact communities, has for many years led the country in agricultural capital inputs. In 1992, funds invested in agriculture reached 2.64 billion yuan, or 21.7 percent of the province's total annual expenditures. In 1993, the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region allocated 21 million yuan to the project to realign the Yellow River irrigation network. Over the past five years, the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region has invested 2.04 billion yuan in capital construction for agriculture and animal husbandry, an increase of 81.4 percent over the previous five-year period. Expanding capital construction. Over the past three years, Guizhou as transformed 80,000 hectares of low and medium-yield land, and set up a group of forestry centers and animal husbandry bases which have provided strong support for the all-round development of agriculture. Last year, completion of the first phase of the comprehensive development project on the Great Bend of the Yellow River helped to increase local irrigated areas in Ningxia by 5,000 hectares and improved over 70,000 hectares of irrigated land. Inner Mongolia has achieved remarkable progress in establishing grazing lands and commodity grain bases. And, by the end of 1993, the region had completed the construction of 247 agricultural development projects and commodity grain bases. Over the past two years, the Tibet Autonomous Region has transformed 3,200 hectares of low and medium-yield land, afforested 1,000 hectares, and expanded and improved more than 4,000 hectares of irrigated land in the Painbo and Namling agricultural development areas. Popularizing science and technology. As part of an effort to transform traditional farming into a modern agriculture, local governments in minority regions have offered practical technical education to local farmers and herdsmen. The effort has helped train a large number of qualified agrotechnicians and establish a widespread science and technology promotion network in each locality. Beginning in 1992, some 500,000 farmers in Guangxi studied from one to two applied technologies each year, with 5,000 being selected for further education. While establishing a four- layer technology promotion network covering the region and all counties, townships and villages, Ningxia provided 650,000 farmers with training, helping them master two to three applied technologies. Xinjiang has also recorded remarkable progress in training agrotechnicians and, by the end of 1992, some 14,000 farmers and herdsmen had been awarded certificates as agrotechnicians. They have played an important role in the application and popularization of advanced techniques. Since 1988, in accordance with conditions, Tibet, a vast sparsely populated and undeveloped area, has devoted great effort to promote the Harvest Program which stresses the use of various agricultural technologies for yielding bumper harvests. By the end of 1993, some 682 projects covering 4.8 million hectares had been established according to plan. In addition, scientific and technological demonstration and popularization plans had been implemented in over half of the region's counties. These counties, which embrace all the ecological areas in the region, make up two-thirds of the region's agricultural and combined agricultural and pastoral counties and cover more than 80 percent of the region's total cultivated land. They have experienced the most rapid agricultural development and the largest percentage increase in grain production.
