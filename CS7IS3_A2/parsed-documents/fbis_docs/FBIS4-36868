Now al-Hindi is the strongest man in the Palestinian secret intelligence services. Al-Hindi, one of the returned deportees, was born in Gaza 45 years ago. His job as the head of the PLO's intelligence apparatus in Tunis has provided him with considerable power and exposed him to very sensitive information. He was in charge of the interrogation of 'Adnan Yasin, the Mosad agent uncovered less than a year ago in Abu-Mazin's [Mahmud 'Abbas] office, and was involved in dozens of discrete investigations and the gathering of intelligence material on personages and institutions in the Arab world and Europe. Al-Hindi crossed at the Rafah border terminal three weeks ago accompanied by a large number of Palestinian bodyguards who prevented all attempts to photograph the man put in charge of the overt and covert Palestinian intelligence services in the territories. After rumors spread that al-Hindi was involved in interrogations, pursuits, and initiating intelligence activity in the Gaza Strip, he was very quickly dubbed "the bad man." Indeed, he has full authority to detain, interrogate, incarcerate, and make use of all the means he deems necessary to achieve calm in the Gaza Strip. For the time being he is not dealing with Jericho, where the routine security problems are much simpler. Immediately upon his arrival in Gaza, the Israeli media reported that al-Hindi wasted no time in entering office. He summoned to his office a group of senior Palestinian police officers and asked them to update him on the situation. The first conclusion that can be drawn from that meeting is that we are not dealing here with a Palestinian police force, but rather with units of military soldiers and officers. 'Arafat himself proved this point when he surprisingly replaced Ziyad al-Atrash, the Palestinian liaison officer, with 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Yahya, head of the Palestine Liberation Army. 'Arafat did not offer any explanation for this move. One can hazard the assessment, however, that 'Arafat did not approve of the close cooperation between al- Atrash and Brigadier General Yom-Tov Sami', the Israeli officer who worked opposite him. Perhaps al-Atrash was bad mouthed in Tunis, and venomous comments were directed to the all too receptive 'Arafat. Like all Middle East leaders, 'Arafat is crazy about classified documents, is in love of briefings, enthralled by intelligence information -- even if it amounts to nothing more than morsels. He is especially enamored by information provided by the uniformed men who were brought to Gaza and Jericho from Arab countries, where they have resided in the shadow of local armies: Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Iraq, Libya, and Sudan. There are new faces in the area who obey their commanders and wear ironed uniforms. None of them have read the Gaza-Jericho agreement, and they have not received a precise description of what they are supposed to do. The mission given by 'Arafat to al-Hindi -- his intelligence affairs confidant -- is not simple. First, he must prepare the ground for the chairman's arrival in the territories and make sure there will be no "bad surprises" such as an attempt to harm 'Arafat and his entourage during his visit in Gaza and Jericho. Beyond this, 'Arafat has put al-Hindi at the head of a pyramid of five overt and covert intelligence networks. Al-Hindi pulls all the strings. He has to maneuver between intelligence services incited against each other by 'Arafat through devious means and by remote control from Tunis. Al-Hindi, who compares his status to that of the Israeli Mosad chief, has arrived from Tunis with a well-oiled and organized intelligence apparatus. He is surrounded by some 200 to 300 agents, among them field agents, intelligence-gathering personnel, researchers, analysts, and intelligence implementation experts. This group, which is very close to al-Hindi, is keeping a low profile. In addition to these associates and his bodyguards, al-Hindi has transferred to his Gaza Strip offices an incalculable treasure: computers and boxes of disks including the PLO's intelligence archives, which includes thousands of names and tens of thousands of details. Only a handful of people know where to locate this rare archive which took years of hard labor to amass. Under the umbrella organization of the Muhabarat 'Amma (general intelligence) we can find Muhammad Dahlan in the Gaza Strip and Jibril al-Rujub in the Jericho area. Al-Rujub, who is in love with the media, initially refused to limit his efforts to Jericho, until Israel limited his freedom of movement in order to curtail his operations over the entire West Bank. Al-Rujub brought with him from Tunis a dozen of well-trained intelligence officers, and until his movements were limited he managed to recruit local intelligence- gathering officers. Dahlan, who is in charge of the Gaza Strip intelligence services, prefers to maintain a much lower profile than al-Rujub. Two local clans hold a grudge against him for the murder of Shaykh As'ad al-Saftawi and another figure suspected of cooperation with Israel. Dahlan, who since his deportation from the Gaza Strip has led the al-Shabibah -- Fatah's youth movement -- via facsimile machines, is a much less frightening figure than he was in the past. Dahlan's main rival is Muhammad Sakir, whose life over the last three decades has already become something of a legend. Sakir, who surfaced in Gaza only 10 days ago, holds the title of "head of the general security service," a title that al-Rujub and Dahlan begrudge him. Before his arrival the journalists were told that during the 27 years in which he was a fugitive he has managed to move from one hiding place to another while carrying out terrorist activities, and that he has never left the Gaza Strip. Not everybody is convinced by this story. There are those who are willing to swear that a completely different version regarding his real whereabouts during this period will be uncovered soon. Using his "divide and rule" tactics not only on the political level, but also on his newly formed intelligence community, 'Arafat has explained to Sakir that he is putting him in charge of al-Rujub and Dahlan. These two, who are much younger than Sakir, are making no bones about their opposition to the appointment of Sakir over them. The third body among the general Palestinian security and intelligence services is the Amn al-Ri'asah, or president's security. Nobody has yet been put in charge of the elite force -- which will include Force-17 members -- which will be in charge of 'Arafat's life. The name most frequently mentioned is that of Abu-al-Za'im ['Atallah 'Atallah], who after a quarrel with 'Arafat defected to Jordan and who has been residing in Cairo over the last few years. Abu-al-Za'im has made no secrets about his desire to head the Amn al-Ri'asah again, and 'Arafat has summoned him at least twice to Tunis to check the extent of his support for the agreement and his determination to exert firm control over the force. 'Arafat, however, does not regard Abu-al-Za'im as the only candidate for this sensitive post. The fourth body among the Palestinian services is the police force under Nasir Yusuf's command. Like the Israel Police, this force deals with criminal offenses, violence, theft, drug abuse, and preventive action against undesirable developments. The police intelligence must report to al-Hindi, who in turn reports to Tunis. The fifth, and for the time the last body is "special intelligence." 'Arafat gave this elite unit the job of snooping around the other intelligence networks in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. The members of this unit have to report to al-Hindi, but are also permitted to phone directly to the PLO chief in Tunis. It is interesting to note that the PLO's intelligence and secret service community in the territories has been copied from the Arab multifaceted model. This is how this community operates in Beirut, in Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and even Tehran: A combination of compartmentalization and secrecy, with each network invading the jurisdiction of the other, all this with the knowledge and supervision of the chief. At least three of the Palestinian intelligence bodies have recently entered a wild internal competition for solving two murder cases: The murder of two IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers at the Erez checkpoint two weeks ago, and the murder of two Palestinian civilians suspected of having been Israeli collaborators. For Amin al-Hindi this is a matter of professional pride and prestige; he has to prove to himself, to 'Arafat, and to Israel that he can control the area and conduct things in a professional manner. He has to prove that he is no less proficient than his Israeli counterpart. So far al-Hindi's performance appears to be very impressive and he is receiving good grades. Those who follow his performance are also taking into account the time factor: Only three weeks have passed since he entered his complicated office, which is only made more complicated by the clause named 'Arafat, who is not making al- Hindi's life any easier. How is Palestinian intelligence operating? What is on the agenda of the secret intelligence services? It transpires that half of the very busy daily agendas of the three top men -- al-Hindi, Dahlan, and al-Rujub -- is occupied with dialogues with Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and Islamic Jihad members, as well as with members of Ahmad Jibril's and Nayif Hawatimah's rejectionist organizations. The rest of their time is occupied with guarding potential trouble spots: The Gaza Strip refugee camps, mosques, the central areas of the Jericho enclave, and the passages between Jericho and the Gaza Strip. They also make certain that no harm comes to the settlers, for example, in the Jewish synagogue in Jericho. So far, they have scored quite a success on the ground. Spokesmen for Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], for example, announced their divorce from violent activity and their intention to become an opposition party. In a determinant and unequivocal campaign, al-Hindi has managed to stop calls of instigation by Hamas and Islamic Jihad preachers at the Friday prayers at the mosques. The presence of the new forces in the Gaza Strip has already created an additional change. The Palestinian policemen who arrived from Tunis behave in Gaza as they had in their previous place of residence: They drink alcohol, woo women, and look for fun. Changes on the ground have become visible: Local women allow themselves to walk down the streets without a veil and are no longer afraid to cruise the beaches. "We are on hold for now," the Hamas spokesmen admit, "studying the situation." One of them, Mahmud al-Zahhar, a spokesman for the returned deportees, last week revealed that his men have decided to declare a temporary timeout in inter-Palestinian terror. They are also waiting to see how many prisoners Israel will release and who they will be. The current tension between Hamas and the Palestinian police is referred to as a dormant volcano. If this continues, they say with satisfaction, there is room for optimism. Yet, if the shortage of money and medication continues, if no real changes take place in living conditions in the refugee camps, and if foreign investors call off their plans to turn the Gaza Strip into the Singapore of the Middle East everything will collapse. Hamas will gain power, the refugee camps will become sources of unrest, and the big frustration will burst out in violence against Israelis. Two weeks ago, Nabil Sha'th and Dr. Zuhdi al-Nashashibi came to Gaza with $5,000 -- a first U.S. grant to pay the policemen's wages. Initial reports indicate there is a deliberate class distinction: A Palestinian policeman/soldier will be paid $400 a month; a senior Palestinian police officer receives between $1,000 and $1,200 a month. According to 'Arafat's explicit guidance, the wages will only be paid to the "men from abroad." After he threatened not to come to the territories before the donor countries act on their promises, allowing him to pay all the policemen, 'Arafat is creating a total disassociation between "local" and "foreign PLO" in the territories. Senior posts will be given to only returning Palestinians. Is this logical? It certainly is. 'Arafat learned from Saddam Husayn. Paying a salary and taking care of your subordinate's needs ensures loyalty to the employer. The locals, whose intentions 'Arafat doubts, will have to make do on their own until the big money comes from abroad. 'Arafat wants to see his intelligence men well fed and free of material problems. In the Gaza Strip last week they suspected that, though he is not in perfect health, 'Arafat in his twisted ways decided to act ill and spread rumors about a graver illness than the one he actually suffers from in order to once again postpone his arrival in Gaza and Jericho. And, if the Palestinian Shin Bet believes that 'Arafat is really afraid of coming to the territories, our intelligence community believes that before his arrival, al-Hindi will take steps in advance to garner the most support possible from his own camp, as well as from us, to protect himself against surprises.
