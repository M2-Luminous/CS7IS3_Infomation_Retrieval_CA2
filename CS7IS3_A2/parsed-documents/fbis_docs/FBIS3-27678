She said this at the joint press conference held here at noon today by her and Sir Leon Brittan, commissioner of the European Commission in charge of external economic relations and trade policy, upon the conclusion of the 13th meeting of the China-EC joint committee this morning. The two sides conducted a broad discussion on China-EC relations at the meeting. "Brittan and I briefed each other on the economic situations in the European Community and China, and exchanged views on China-EC cooperation frankly," Wu said. "Talks have been held on the problems existing in bilateral trade and economic relations and the ways to solve them, and consensus has been reached in many aspects concerned." It is said that the two parties agreed that all efforts should be made to promote a more balanced development of bilateral trade. They decided that the working group on economic and trade matters, after the first meeting last year, will hold its second meeting in Brussels in June 1994, with specific sectoral discussions on agriculture, intellectual property and financial services. The two sides also decided to hold an industrial cooperation meeting in the non-ferrous metal sector, to launch technical discussions on the alcoholic beverage sector and to organize an information seminar on anti-dumping in China. The EC side welcomed continuation in China's reform of its economic and trade system and expansion of opening-up. The joint committee reaffirmed that both parties will continue to apply the principle of non-discrimination. The committee was satisfied with bilateral cooperation in such areas as the environment, industry and training of Chinese experts concerning trade policy, economics, law, management and telecommunications. Besides, a working group on environmental cooperation is to be set up to analyze Chinese environmental problems and needs as well as to propose and coordinate concrete China-EC cooperative activities in this field. Both parties underlined their wish to step up business cooperation to increase direct contacts between enterprises leading to more investment and other forms of industrial and trade cooperation. A memorandum between China and the European Commission was signed on the establishment of the China-Europe international business school. This afternoon, Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing met with Sir Leon Brittan and his party, and they exchanged views on issues of common concern.
