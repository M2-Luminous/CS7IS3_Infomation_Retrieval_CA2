The following is the outcome of the fighting: 1. We have completely liberated the area from the west of Pailin to the border. 2. We have captured 350 invading troops of the communist Vietnamese puppets and the two-headed government. Some of them have fled for their lives through the bamboo-covered jungle. 3. We completely control Sala Krau village. 4. We also completely control (?Phnum Spin). 5. We are continuing to block the stretch of road between Sala Krau and O Ro-el completely. 6. We are continuing to block the stretch of road between O Tavai and Suosdei completely. 7. The invading troops of the communist Vietnamese puppets and the two-headed government are being encircled and smashed to bits from all directions. They have been routed and forced to flee through the thick bamboo-covered jungle, where strings of mines previously laid by the communist Vietnamese are everywhere. They have run out of water and food. They have come down with malaria and typhoid and are dying one after another -- two or three here; four or five there. Their supplies have been completely cut off.
