FBIS4-48916 "drchi084_k_94012" FBIS-CHI-94-084 Daily Report 16 Apr 1994 NATIONAL AFFAIRS Political & Social Journal Views Top Leadership Orientation Journal Views Top Leadership Orientation HK2704065894 Hong Kong KUANG CHIAO CHING in Chinese No 259, 16 Apr 94 pp 6-9 HK2704065894 Hong Kong KUANG CHIAO CHING Chinese BFN [By Chou Jung (0719 2837): "Jiang Zemin Organizes Leading Body for Next Century; Top Leadership Fixes Orientation To Guarantee Stability"] [Text] Jiang Zemin Stresses Need To Maintain Stability and Not To Lower Guard At the National People's Congress [NPC] and Chinese People's Political Consustative Conference [CPPCC] sessions in Beijing, obvious hot topics were such questions as the readjustment and distribution of interests (including investment projects, development rates, preferential policies, and the ratio between profits and taxes), the anticorruption drive, the public order situation, and commodity prices. These are major questions which have a direct bearing on the success or failure of reform and on whether or not the overall situation is stable. CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin stressed that maintaining a stable situation across the country is a big question which is bound up with whether or not the party and the leadership survive and that we must not lower our guard in this regard. Local Party and Government Officials Hold Radical Views One of the main characteristics of the above sessions was that CPPCC delegates, who had previously held radical views, mostly supported the CPC's reform proposals. Although they might not have agreed with the timing or the methods as to how the reform proposals are to be implemented, they could not put forward better counterproposals. This was not the case with NPC deputies from all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, however. Local party and government officials, especially, held very radical views. The CPC top leadership is worried that once the investment front becomes too long and development is too speedy, China may once again revert to price raises and inflation which will, in turn, introduce new instability factors into society. This was the real focus of concern for officials and the general public and is also crucial to the success or failure of this year's reform. The policy decisions were accepted by the overwhelming majority of NPC deputies and CPPCC delegates. In view of this, political reform will continue to be postponed, and maintaining a stable overall situation takes precedence, and has become a common consensus. Judging from the current construction plan and the situation of reform and opening, the CPC is most concerned about guaranteeing the overall stability of agriculture, commodity prices, and society. Planning To Form a Leading Group Straddling the Next Century As regular meetings of the NPC and CPPCC, the sessions, given no outstanding big issues, made comparatively few personnel changes. Two vice chairmen, Wan Guoquan and Zhu Guangya and a new secretary general Zhu Xun, were added at the CPPCC session. Wan is the leader of a democratic party, Zhu is an authority in science and technology circles, and Zhu Xun is the minister of geology and mineral resources. The personnel changes appear to give a clear picture of the pattern. On the other hand, the NPC Standing Committee elected two members, Zeng Xianzi and Nie Li, in a by-election and the CPPCC Standing Committee elected Zhang Yongzhen from Hong Kong in a by-election so that their compositions are more representative. These were all normal personnel arrangements. The top CPC leadership attaches great importance to the stability of the leading groups of the party, the government, and the armed forces. At the last NPC session, Jiang Zemin stressed that the central leading groups are united and harmonious and so can cope with foreign interference and various kinds of tests at home. Judging from the trends and signs, after functioning and working for more than four years, the CPC leadership, with Jiang Zemin at the core, has already established a firm position in China. What they are now mainly planning is to supplement and form a group of young people to straddle the next century. Many experts maintain that the 9 percent economic growth and the 10 percent price increases in Li Peng's Government Work Report are comparatively appropriate indexes of development and stability. Economist Liu Guoguang said: For three consecutive years, China has grown at a rate of 10 percent or more and this is unprecedented in the world. We should not only see whether or not China can endure it this year but also consider the economic efficiency next year and the year after next. This year's macroregulation and control should control economic growth slightly so that what should be controlled is controlled and what should have controls relaxed has them relaxed appropriately. Not long ago, Deng Xiaoping said: "China is already a political power. It will also become an economic power in the future." The CPC expects to maintain healthy and sustained growth rates through a careful and mature layout of economic reform and construction, to succeed in building new market economic mechanisms and join the ranks of world economic powers. It Is Vital To Guarantee the Stability of Agriculture Without grain, there is no stability. This is a saying by CPC elders, and above all Deng Xiaoping, who have always used it to remind the leading group. Since the series of reform plans were introduced earlier in the year, all localities have vied with each other to initiate development projects which "require less input, yield greater economic results, and promise quick returns." This, coupled with the continually increasing cost of agriculture, results in farmland being laid waste. The continuously mounting pressure of "migrant workers" coming into the cities has led, in some places, to the panic purchase of grain, edible oils, and foodstuffs and also to prices being driven up. This has highly alarmed the top CPC leadership. No sooner had the NPC session finished than the CPC called the Central Work Conference on Agriculture. There, Jiang Zemin stressed the need to consolidate the fundamental role of agriculture and guarantee the steady development of agriculture and the entire rural economy. Zhu Rongji's Worries In order to support agricultural production, the State Council initiated reform of the grain purchase and marketing system, whereby the purchasing and sales prices of grain and edible oils were increased and all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions canceled city and town supply rations and opened up the grain and edible oils markets. Zhu Rongji said: Here there is a rational factor, that is, grain prices must be increased because they are so low that peasants do not find it pays to grow grain crops. However, he also admitted that it is both pleasing and worrying to increase grain prices. What is pleasing is that peasants will have their incomes increased and what is worrying is that the grain prices in some places are driven up artificially so that there is the worry that the price increases do not really go into the hands of the peasants but to the intermediary links or to those who change hands. Zhu Rongji said: It is necessary to continue to stick to the orientation of reform and continue to proceed with the reform of the purchasing and marketing systems. There is no turning back and we are unable to turn back. He maintained that it is necessary to resolve the current problems. He also said that the rise in grain prices will push up other prices and will lead to panic among the residents which will, in turn, affect the process of reform and therefore must be seriously dealt with. The reform aim is to promote a steady growth in grain production, promote a brisk and stable market, and protect the interests of peasants. If the existing salient problems are not properly resolved, it will be difficult to achieve the goal of grain reform. For this reason, it is necessary to strengthen macroregulation and control, establish a grain storage system and a risk fund, and stick to the protective- price purchasing system. CPC Plans for Future Agricultural Development It is learned that the main goals set by the CPC for agricultural development in the 1990's are: To develop the rural economy in a comprehensive way, stabilize the output increases of major farm products, and meet the needs of achieving comparatively comfortable living standards for the people throughout the country and of the national economy in terms of quantity, variety, and quality. For this reason, China will continue to stabilize contract responsibility systems, chiefly the contract responsibility system on a household basis with renumeration linked to output; perfect the system of unified management combined with independent management; vigorously develop the collectivized agricultural services; and gradually enhance the collective economic strength. It will continuously consolidate the agricultural foundation, increase agricultural inputs, improve basic agricultural facilities, and ensure that agriculture is further upgraded to meet the needs of the development of the national economy. It will deepen rural reform and strengthen the development of such basic facilities as the rural markets, communications, transportation, storage, information, and consultancy services as well as the development of various socialized service systems. It will strengthen the promotion of agricultural scientific research and technology; continue to arrange for comprehensive agricultural development and utilization of standby resources; optimize the rural industrial and economic structures; vigorously develop foreign-exchange-earning agriculture; integrate crop growing, livestock breeding, and processing and combine trade, industry, and agriculture; develop new industries and new fields of employment in rural areas; and enhance comprehensive productive capability. It will encourage peasants to increase incomes and achieve a comparatively comfortable life. The Success or Failure of Reforms in China Today Depends on Commodity Prices Commodity prices are a very sensitive nerve in the market and society. In the first two months of this year, commodity price indexes across the country had a startling rise of almost 20 percent. Both Li Peng and Zhu Rongji criticized raising the prices of such foodstuffs as milk before the opening of the Beijing Municipal People's Congress session. Zhu Rongji said: Many large and medium cities around the world grant some public subsidies in order to stabilize social life. We must never pass the burden on to the public or concentrate their money on expanding the infrastructural scale. Guangdong's economy has been developing speedily in recent years but its farmland has been seriously laid waste. Some cadres claim they have money to buy grain even if it is much more expensive, so they raise grain prices and engage in panic purchases everywhere, affecting the normal market economy. Zhu Rongji criticized Guangdong for shirking its responsibilities to others now that it has so big a population and so much good farmland. He stressed that stabilizing commodity prices is vital to the success or failure of reforms. Zhu Rongji Criticizes Guangdong [as published] In view of this, the State Council published a special document appealing for measures to limit commodity prices and an inspection team, headed by State Planning Commission Minister Chen Jinhua and two vice ministers, visited various localities around the country to inquire into the question of commodity prices. In response to the repeated appeals from various localities to quicken development, during the NPC session, the top CPC leadership gave explanations to various deputations and repeatedly stressed that they had to be realistic, acting in keeping with their capabilities, and that they should curb the trend of being enthusiastic about initiating new projects without considering their conditions. For this reason, they have to strengthen and improve macroregulation and control and prevent the recurrence of inflation. Key CPC figures stressed that macroregulation and control should control economic growth slightly in light of the actual situation so that what should be controlled is controlled and what should have its controls relaxed have them relaxed appropriately. This is a crucial year for reform say the CPC authorities. China not only needs to establish market economic mechanisms but also needs to link the home market with the international market gradually and strive to rejoin GATT as soon as possible. Therefore, all reforms, such as the reform of finance, tariffs, banking, foreign trade, commodity prices, investment, tax revenue, business administration, and the enterprise systems embody these two objectives. Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin Guard Against U.S. Strategy of "Westernization and Division" At the NPC session in March, most of the NPC deputies and CPPCC delegates from all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions supported the various reform proposals. On his visit to Beijing, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher did not get what he had anticipated. Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin will not give way in guarding against the U.S. strategy of "Westernization and division." On the question of restoring China's GATT membership, U.S. representative Dorros Dewerszhin [duo luo xi de wo er si jin 1122 5700 6007 1795 3087 1422 2448 6855] declined to give China a definite date when it can rejoin GATT although representatives of Japan, the European Union, Canada, Uruguay, and the Scandinavian countries all hoped that China, the most populated country in the world, be allowed to rejoin GATT. At the session, Gu Yongjiang, Chinese representative and vice minister at the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation [MOFTEC] deeply regretted that the question of rejoining GATT remained unresolved, despite talks for the past seven years. On 18 April, MOFTEC Minister Wu Yi headed a large delegation for a new round of relevant talks in the United States. It is now impossible to predict what the future results will be but, recently, Clinton and some U.S. Congressmen and prominent political figures have repeatedly given speeches stressing the need to focus on long-term U.S.-Chinese relations. Many people favor separating human rights, economic relations, and most-favored-nation status. Out of consideration for Sino-U.S. bilateral interests and development, most observers are still optimistic about the prospect of the development of relations between China and the United States, the two big powers. However, it is very difficult to judge whether or not it is good for China to rejoin GATT. Mainland China's reform is at a stage where key problems are being tackled and many economic relations have yet to be straightened out. Many experts conclude the fact that if China hastily rejoins GATT this will have serious consequences and will obviously increase by more than one-third the losses in its state-owned enterprises. They hold that the influx of large quantities of foreign products and their impact will even lead to the bankruptcy of a considerable number of enterprises, to an increase in the number unemployed, and to a considerable increase in the instability factors in society. Therefore, they argue that it is much more conducive for China to rejoin GATT at a later date. Other experts maintain that China's rejoining GATT presents a great opportunity to change itself into a market economy and that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. One thing we can be certain of is that the prospect of rejoining GATT, as the CPC announced earlier, has not been decided to date. Protracted War Against Corruption The problem of power corruption is worrying the key CPC figures. Jiang Zemin criticized it saying: Corruption has developed to the point whereby people will not do anything unless they are given money or presents. Some county-level cities cannot even pay wages to their staff and teachers while their party and government departments have money to purchase deluxe sedans. We must not underestimate the seriousness and harm of the problem and must adopt resolute measures to resolve it. We must handle corruption cases strictly in accordance with the law, thoroughly investigate violations of discipline and law, dismiss those who should be dismissed, sentence those who should be sentenced, and sternly punish those who should be sternly punished. Those who seriously interfere with or obstruct the investigation of cases should be resolutely punished. In this year's anticorruption work, we should concentrate our energies on investigating and dealing with big and serious cases; resolutely emphasize the investigation of lawbreaking cases by party and government leading organs, leading cadres, and judicial departments, administrative and law-enforcement departments, economic administration departments, and their work personnel; make it a point to investigate and deal with the bribery and corruption cases featuring leading cadres and the malpractices of judicial and administrative personnel, such as practicing favoritism, perverting justice for bribes, harboring lawbreakers, as well as crimes crimes committed by legal persons. Obstacles to the Anti-Corruption Drive Since the CPC put forward the five rules regarding how cadres should keep their hands clean and exercise self-discipline, cadres at all levels have launched self-investigations and have obtained some practical results. However, the top CPC leadership maintains that the anticorruption work is not proceeding in a balanced way and that many problems exist in it. In the self-investigations, some cadres have dealt with insignificant and overt matters rather than big and covert ones. They have not even talked about the obvious problems before them or dealt with the many problems already discovered. Influenced by the "idea that corruption is inevitable," some leading cadres argue that "economic development should take the lead and adherence to the four cardinal principles should give way" because it will "be smooth sailing to do only one type of work and attach importance to it" and it will be "difficult at both ends to do two types of work and attach simultaneous importance to them." Moreover, they argue that one "is liable to make an error if one braves it out" and that one "should be allowed to pay tuition fees [jiao xue fei 0074 1331 6316]." The cadres in some localities and departments fear they will register a loss if they do too much anticorruption work while others are worried that continuing the anticorruption work will affect reform and opening up and economic development. Being unclear themselves, some officials fear they will get into trouble if they continue the work. It has become very popular that they do not report corruption, do not handle corruption cases, or do not strictly enforce the law. It still prevails that their words speak louder than the law and their power outweighs the law. Resist the "Tendency To Beg For Leniency" and Break the "Network of Connections" and "Protective Layer" The top CPC leadership maintains that, as the economy is growing and reform is deepening, some new circumstances and contradictions will appear in the readjustment of interests of all parties and in the change of concepts. People will take advantage of the loopholes afforded by the unsound legal system and supervisory mechanisms and continue with their corrupt practices, seeking private gain by violating the law and discipline. Therefore, it is necessary to continue with the anticorruption work in a thorough, protracted, and more effective way and to concentrate energies on the investigation and handling of big and serious cases. It is necessary to resist the "tendency to beg for leniency" and break the "network of connections" and the "protective layer," and further consolidate the coordination of the discipline inspection supervisory organs and the supervisory organs for judicial, personnel, administrative, and law-enforcement organs, enhancing their overall capability in dealing with corruption cases. In order to match the need of thoroughly pursuing reform this year, it is necessary to promptly remove those corrupt elements who symbolize state power and who are in the legal machinery. Only by doing this can political power and social stability be consolidated. The top CPC leadership emphasizes that this year's anticorruption work will begin with three areas: First, disclose, investigate, and deal with such malpractices as not carrying out decrees, resorting to uncurbed malpractices, having one's own way, and seriously violating the law and breaking discipline in the course of implementing the measures for the reform of the tax, banking, foreign trade, investment, and planning systems and for enterprise reform. Second, disclose, investigate, and deal with such malpractices as fraud, deceiving the higher authorities and hiding facts from the lower authorities, and interfering with reform and development. Third, seriously investigate cases of dereliction of duty and serious bureaucracy which have resulted in great losses or deaths and casualties, foster a clean and hard-working government, and promote the establishment and improvement of the regulations and systems for the new structure.
