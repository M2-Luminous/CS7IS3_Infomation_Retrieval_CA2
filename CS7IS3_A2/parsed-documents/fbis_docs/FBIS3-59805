The kidnapping of three Foreign Affairs officials was a carefully planned political and military operation. A turning point in the Islamic armed struggle. Paris is on the front line. [passage omitted] In fact, there is every indication that the kidnapping of the three French officials was a large-scale, carefully planned political and military operation. The banning of the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] eighteen months ago, and the ruthless repression of its militants disoriented the "bearded brothers." Although dissensions are far from being overcome, the era of armed-struggle "professionals" and political strategists is approaching. The kidnappers, who claim to belong to the GIA [Armed Islamic Group], operated in closely watched areas dotted with military roadblocks, areas that had been under tight police control for months. They kept their victims in the Oued Koreiche district of Algiers, close by the Ministry of Defense and not far from the government palace. For four days, from 26 to 29 October, the masterminds of the operation led secret negotiations with French emissaries, including one Foreign Affairs diplomat. Then, in a communique sent to Western press agencies, they announced the impending release of the hostages. Scapegoat The Islamist operation was spectacular, all the more so because it crowned a series of attacks against foreigners, carried out within one month, in every corner of Algeria, by the GIA or the related GUD (Jihad United Group). What is the reason for this general anti-European, and above all anti-French offensive? Paris is not just the traditional scapegoat of Algerians of all persuasions, or the natural target of the "bearded brothers" who claim to be the heirs of the anti-French mujahidins of the fifties. The xenophobic outburst is not just an easy answer to the extreme violence used by Algerian authorities: widespread use of torture, summary executions, over 100 death sentences. As in Egypt, the hunt for foreigners is also the result of an Islamist strategy of economic war, which attempts to deprive the Algerian State of most of its revenues. Islamists know that foreigners who work in Algeria play a key part in the economy. But French-Islamist disagreements are also political. Even the most moderate Islamists, such as the former chairman of the FIS foreign relations commission, Rabah Kebir, blame French officials for their "aggressiveness and provocative talk," which contrast with their formerly more balanced behavior. This political protest of the "bearded brothers" does not explain everything. The kidnappings and negotiations of October 1993 were overseen by the two most extremist trends in the Islamist nebula. These trends have special reasons for attacking Frenchmen and foreigners. To begin with, the GIA was born of the al-Takfir Oua El-Hidjra (Repudiation and Renunciation) organization created in 1971 on the banks of the Nile by engineer Choukri Mustapha. Before his execution, the latter had already specialized in the kidnapping and assassination of personalities such as the former Egyptian minister of religious affairs, Shaykh Dahab. Back in 1974, the very clandestine al-Takfir Algerian branch already disseminated tracts denouncing "the impiety of society" and advocating the use of armed force to institute an Islamic State. Ten years later, the movement was one of the first in the Arab world to systematically send its militants to Afghanistan, to be trained in armed struggle. After that, al-Takfir took part in the October 1988 and summer 1991 riots before joining the FIS. Until January 1992, al-Takfir supporters controlled the En-Nour mosque in Algiers and recruited adherents in two working-class suburbs east of Algiers, Beni Merad and Ben Zerga. Then, under the name of GIA, al-Takfir organized underground groups in Batna, Sidi Bel-Abbes, and Qoleiya. According to the authorities, it is responsible for most of the assassinations and holdups perpetrated in Algiers and Blida. Before being killed in an ambush, Omar el-Eulmi, founder of the Islamic Labor Union, who had become the GIA's "spiritual leader," issued a fatwa (religious opinion) authorizing the assassination of intellectuals, journalists, police officers, and State employees, including women and older people. It was this fatwa that cost the lives, among others, of writer Tahar Djaout and psychiatrist Mahfoud Boucebsi. In addition, the GIA's second-in-command, Abdelkader Hattab, wrote a brochure whose title says it all: "Slaughter and Murder, Until Power Belongs to God." Based on this reasoning, foreigners were doomed to become targets in their turn, sooner or later. For instance, the seven-member GIA commando armed with Kalashnikov machine guns, who attacked the home of the German Junger family on the night of 13-14 October, had for mission to warn all Western communities to leave Algeria within eight days, under penalty of death. An Outstanding Strategist There is a striking similarity between certain methods of al-Takfir-GIA and those used in Lebanon by the Khomeynist Islamic Hezbollah-Jihad during the eighties. Both handle hostages as bargaining counters. Both kidnap and/or assassinate foreigners not just to punish and deter Western States believed to be hostile to the Islamist cause, but also to discredit the local government, to assert that they cannot be ignored, and to negotiate the release of imprisoned militants. Also to extract material benefits. Affinities between the Lebanese Hezbollah and the Algerian al-Takfir do not stop there. The militants of both organizations have close links with Iran, which is said to finance them generously and to train some of their commandos in southern Lebanon. Was it out of consideration for Tehran that the GIA Islamists did not manhandle the Junger family--one week after the Iranian minister of intelligence, Ali Fallahian's official visit to Germany? On the other hand, do you know that several Iranians, including one relative of President Hashemi-Rafsanjani, are still held in French prisons because they were involved in the assassination of antikhomeinist personalities, in Paris and in Switzerland? Other Algerian Islamist leaders asserted themselves on the occasion of the kidnapping. They included, in particular, Said Mekhloufi who, in April 1992, was appointed "military affairs coordinator" by several separate armed groups. A former lieutenant and chief editor of the FIS daily EL-MOUNQUID, who organized the departure of Algerian volunteers to Iraq in 1990, Mekhloufi is an outstanding military strategist. God's Sword His supporters, al-Baqun 'ala al-'Ahd (Those Faithful to the Oath), often disguise themselves as police commandos, wearing bullet-proof vests and masks to hide their faces. Said Mekhloufi is the only war lord to maintain cordial relations with all Islamist leaders: former FIS president Abassi Madani and his children Salmane, Ikbal, and Okba; "General" Abdelkader Chebouti and Imam Ali Benhadj; the "moderate" tandem consisting of Rabah Kebir and Mohamed Said, who control Islamist information; and finally the GIA "emir," Mourad Si Ahmed, also known as Djaafar Seifallah (God's Sword). Whereas Mekhloufi is in a good position to direct the course of the armed struggle in the field, his alter ego, Kamreddine Kherbane, another former officer, deploys the external network of the movement. Pack Up and Leave, or Die Helped by his brother in arms from the Afghanistan guerrilla, Hadj Boudjemaa Bounoua, by the venerable Shaykh Abdel Baki Sahraoui, and by Djaafar el-Houari, president of the Algerian Brotherhood in France [FAF], Kherbane already succeeded in supplanting the FIS "moderates" in France. He got in touch again with the French authorities, who had expelled him in August 1992, and he actively contributed to the release of the French hostages. Without a doubt, the Mekhloufi-Kherbane tandem, which has connections with a powerful international Islamist network, will carry much weight in determining the future of Algeria and its relations with France. How far can the power struggle between GIA extremists and Paris go? A process of deterioration, similar to what happened in Lebanon, cannot be ruled out. The message that the GIA left next to Michele Thevenot was clear: "Pack up and leave, or die. Foreigners have one month to get out." Eventually, unless Algiers and the "bearded brothers" miraculously reach an agreement and unless the imprisoned Islamist leaders are released, the departure of the 10,000 or so French expatriates appears unavoidable. Just like in Beirut not so long ago. They could be followed by tens of thousands of Algerians belonging to the intelligentsia, who feel threatened. The wealthiest have already bought apartments or restaurants on the banks of the Seine or on the shores of Lake Geneva. Worse still: like the Lebanese war in the past, the Algerian armed conflict may move to the other side of the Mediterranean. Djaafar el-Houari himself acknowledged that much in an interview published in LE FIGARO of 29 October: "Uncontrolled elements show increasing exasperation. They may want to strike at targets in France."
