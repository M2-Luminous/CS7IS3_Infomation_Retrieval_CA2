Dymov; date and place not given: "Sergey Dovgan: 'We Will Assume the Responsibility'"] [Text] [Dymov] Sergey Vasilyevich, it probably would be best to begin by presenting your "calling card".... [Dovgan] It is the same as for any country boy. I have had blisters on my hands since I was small. I went to school and then to the VUZ, and then I came back to the country, back to the land. Anyone who wants to know the details of my biography, or simply wants to talk, can contact me any time at the Kosmos Sovkhoz in Berislavskiy Rayon. The telephone number is 2-28-93. That is where I am on display, so to speak. Besides this, I feel that each of us should be judged by his actions, and not by academic degrees and professional titles. That is the only way to climb out of the present crisis. [Dymov] All right. The farm you head is quite strong, in spite of the present economic devastation. You deserve your good reputation. What made you want to climb to the heights of government? [Dovgan] Everyone defends the peasants during a campaign, displaying great pity for them, and then all of this concern disappears without a trace when the campaign is over. That is why we know this to be true: Anyone who works on the land is our candidate. All the rest, the ones who make such lavish promises, are just trying to "garner votes," occupy a comfortable position, torment us for 2-5 years, and ultimately evade responsibility. This was impossible in the past. At that time the Supreme Soviet was controlled by the Communist Party, which sent the candidates there and then kept them in line. Today, on the other hand, if we have independent deputies, policy will be made in this way: Whoever pays the piper will call the tune. The Peasant Party promises that if our representative becomes a deputy, we will be able to put him on the spot, so to speak, at any time. We will summon him to the district, where he will have to answer to the people for all of his actions. Furthermore, we will see to it that other members of the Supreme Council do not change their minds as easily as a fancy gentleman changes his gloves. The Peasant Party will assume the responsibility for this. It will block the efforts of the shape-shifters, the poor excuses for politicians whose bid for power is motivated by greed. These convictions are the reason I decided to run for office. [Dymov] What is the difference, in your opinion, between the administrator of a farm and a politician? Have you decided on the main issues you would put on the new parliamentary agenda? [Dovgan] We agree with the forces for only one kind of independence, the kind in which people will live well, the forces capable of establishing beneficial economic relations with the rest of the world. I see no difference between "secluded" autonomy and self-isolation. That is why we have to begin by establishing friendly and mutually beneficial contacts with all willing parties. Our foreign policy is a good example. We have no foreign policy per se. It has led to one failure after another. We saw the treatment we got from the American President. He came to Kiev and summoned our president...as if he were issuing an order.... This is how we can expect to be treated until we have strong partners and friends. I think that Russia and Belarus should be the main ones. We have to form military and political blocs. After all, the Warsaw bloc broke up, but NATO still exists, is dictating its own terms, and feels superior to everyone else. In our solitary state, they will drive us to our knees. This is my opinion, and I am certain that it is the opinion of the majority of our people. At this time, however, I am only the administrator of a farm and cannot expect anyone to consider my point of view. From the deputy's rostrum, however, I will have an opportunity to state my views in the most emphatic terms. [Dymov] Sergey Vasilyevich, do you want our state to be a presidency or a parliamentary state? [Dovgan] A parliamentary state is the only correct choice. There would be less confusion. We elected a president, and he does not know what to do.... He let the whole economy collapse. Furthermore, there is always the danger of dictatorship. [Dymov] What about the Navy? [Dovgan] Keeping a navy is as inconvenient from the economic standpoint as keeping missiles. We have to find a common language with the Russians right away. Uniting with them in a single state will not work anymore. Today Russia has as many problems as we do. The economy there is even more distressed, and the crisis is even more severe.... There is not even enough money to pay wages. Nevertheless, we have to work together to forge a new type of relationship. We have to recover the sales markets we lost as soon as possible. Furthermore, we lost huge markets "without a battle"--the Russian, Caucasian, Central Asian, and Baltic markets. What was the result? All production stopped. [Dymov] Sergey Vasilyevich, major policy objectives are important over the long term. Today people are worried about vital aspects of life. The main one is land reform. What kind of advantages will it produce? What kind of adjustments does it need to work? [Dovgan] The reform the present members of parliament dreamed up will not make the state rich. On the contrary, it will hurt agriculture. It was forced on us by outside influences. I am basing this conclusion partly on data cited by the Belarusian Academy of Sciences back in the beginning of the 1990s. According to these data, the normal operation of a farm required 50 million karbovantsy for every 50 hectares. This was a considerable sum of money at that time. It was equivalent to the gross profits of a farm for five years. In other words, if this amount had been issued to each kolkhoz--but where would this money have come from even then?--it would have been possible to build communism in a single year even without the family farm movement. For this reason, what they are doing with the land today is a shaky endeavor. What kind of solution does our party propose? We feel that the land being worked by kolkhozes and sovkhozes, along with the 10 percent allocated for family farms, should be divided equally among all of the inhabitants of each rural community. Title to this land should be transferred to the people by government decree. As a rule, the land should be worked collectively. After all, the tendency toward consolidation even exists abroad. Leasing or selling the land makes no sense, because 20 percent of it would have to be used just for boundaries. If our plan is carried out, each person will be a property owner--not in the abstract or hypothetical sense, but in the real sense of the term. In other words, I will earn dividends on my land. If I should have to move, I will receive proper compensation for my share of the land and then use it to acquire new land when I move to another oblast. If there is no available share, I can get a job and wait for my turn. In any case, a person should have the right to this kind of "exchange." It should be secured and protected by law. A parcel would be allocated to each person only once, to prevent attempts to corner the market and other abuses. Incidents of this kind have already been reported. For example, one zealous farmer acquired land simultaneously in three neighboring oblasts.... [Dymov] Will this violate the principle of private ownership? [Dovgan] That is the least of my worries. I am in favor of collective ownership, which is the basis of private ownership. This engenders a kind of hybrid of "mine" and "ours," and this is normal. After all, neither capitalism nor socialism exists in its pure form. [Dymov] Each administrator in our country has rights and obligations, but is it not time to institute personal responsibility as well? [Dovgan] Yes, a great deal depends on the personality of the individual. There is an art to the hiring and placement of personnel, but now everything is left to run its own course. I recent visited a farm where the administrator--who is even younger than I am--had already managed to build a road, processing shops, and a school. The local malcontents, however, had made life so miserable for this man that he resigned. We have to learn to take good care of our personnel. Furthermore, we have to draft a set of criteria and precise standards of professional advancement. There is good reason that a person who wants to run a farm abroad has to have the necessary skills and a college degree. As far as responsibility is concerned, I think it should be required at every level. Today, in my opinion, top-level officials are the most likely to abuse their power. As long as they are "inviolable," it will be impossible to restore order. [Dymov] How do you feel, Sergey Vasilyevich, about the refusal to let party leaders participate in televised campaign debates? [Dovgan] We have no problem with this. I am even happy that the young men who were monopolizing the screen have now been pushed out of the way. That is their problem. They are afraid to talk to the people directly. No one in the labor collectives hears them or sees them. Incidentally, when I address the peasants of our district and tell them about our party platform, they applaud and say they will not vote for the gentlemen who come here from Kiev. We will give them our bread, meat, and milk--just let them mind their own business and not keep us, the people of the land, from being our own masters. Our party was founded expressly to defend the peasants. The country is our way of life and our cradle. [Dymov] Excuse me, Sergey Vasilyevich, but if you become a deputy, you will have to leave your home and move to the "asphalt jungle," to an apartment in the capital, and say goodbye to your collective. [Dovgan] That does not scare me. After all, I will not be leaving forever. If everyone stayed home, who would defend our interests on the highest level? As for the apartment, a law should be passed right away to give deputies the use of only official housing. At the end of the deputy's term, he should return the key, get on the train, and go back home. [Dymov] What are the immediate concerns of your constituents? [Dovgan] The state has not paid the peasants for delivered products, there is no money in the state accounts, and there is no money to pay wages. The local buses are not running because there is no fuel. There is no fuel for the sowing season either. The whole social sphere in the countryside has been "stifled." People cannot ride to the hospital, and even if they can get there, there is no medicine. You can see big problems wherever you look. Nevertheless, I am certain that the people will come out to vote, to support us, the representatives of the Peasant Party, because they believe that we will not lead them astray, that we are the only ones who can make changes for the better.
