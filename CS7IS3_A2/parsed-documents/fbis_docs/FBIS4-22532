As an AzerTadzh correspondent was told by the chief of the consolidated department of general economic and structural policy of the Ministry of Economics, Oktay Akhverdiyev, the overall volume of foreign trade turnover this year, according to the prognosis, should be $727 million, which is $297 million more than last year. Revenues from exporting goods and services, whose volume will reach $395 million, will increase by $160 million mainly because of the elimination of barter transactions. As before, the greatest share of it will be made up of petroleum products (almost 40 percent) and cotton (28 percent). Iran and Turkey are still the largest exporters of Azerbaijan's products. It is from these countries that most of the goods that can safely be called "food" are exported. Practically all the funds allotted for it, and they amount to approximately $300 million, will go to purchase food products: 55 percent of the imports will be grain, flour, and raw material for manufactured concentrated feeds, 33 percent--meat and butter, and the rest--children's food, dairy products, and other products. At the same time it should be noted that it was possible to plan on this volume of imports as a result of special-purpose credit from the European Council, Turkey, and China, the overall sum of which will be $161 million. The volume of foreign trade turnover is taken into account in the draft of the foreign exchange balance sheet. The revenue part of it, according to the draft, will be $700 million and will be formed from foreign exchange revenues from export operations ($301 million), foreign credit ($161 million), and also conversion of currencies of CIS countries, customs duties and fees, and other sources. The republic will spend less foreign exchange--about $670 million, $410 million of which will be used for the needs of the national economy, including the aforementioned food imports, and also the purchase of medications, wheelchairs for disabled persons, and Ikarus passenger buses for Baku, and for solving problems of the railroad and the food and other branches of industry. Some of the foreign exchange funds are to be used for servicing Azerbaijan's foreign debt. But still, in the words of O. Akhverdiyev, the foreign exchange balance sheet was drawn up taking into account the economic situation in the republic and its maximum capabilities, but not the real needs of the national economy, which amount to approximately $1 billion.
