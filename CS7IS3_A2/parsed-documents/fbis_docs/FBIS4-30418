FBIS4-30418 "dreas123_d_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-123 Daily Report 27 Jun 1994 South Korea Background of Delegates Viewed Background of Delegates Viewed SK2706003994 Seoul THE KOREA TIMES in English 27 Jun 94 p 2 SK2706003994 Seoul THE KOREA TIMES English BFN [Text] Kim Yong-sun, a top strategist on South Korean affairs and a member of North Korean President Kim Il-song's trusted inner circle, will represent Pyongyang's delegation to Tuesday's preliminary contact for an inter-Korean summit. The choice of Kim, concurrently chairman of the Reunification Policy Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly, shows how much importance the North Korean leader places in the forthcoming summit, South Korean officials said. North Korean Prime Minister Kang Song-san notified his South Korean counterpart Yi Yong-tok through a telephone message Saturday that the influential official will lead a three-member delegation at the Panmunjom meeting designed to set the date and venue for the summit. The other delegates are An Pyong-su, vice chairman of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, and Paek Nam-chun, councilor of the Administration Council, it said. Kim who will take part in his first inter-Korean contact, is known as an advocate of reform and openness. Moreover, Kim was the North Korean representative to the first vice ministerial dialogue with the United States in January 1992, when he met with then U.S. Under Secretary of State Arnold Kanter. The meeting, though not substantial, marked the first major sign of the possibility of normalizing relations between the two countries. He stepped into the spotlight in September 1990 when he met with Japanese political patriarch Shin Kanemaru and produced a joint statement on an early normalization of the relations between North Korea and Japan. Kim, who is also secretary for South Korean affairs in the North Korean Nodong (Workers) Party enjoys strong backing from President Kim Il-song and his son Chong-il. Kim's closeness to President Kim has caused the spread of rumors that they are related by blood. He showed how close his ties are with the North Korean leader by accompanying Kim on his visit to China and on other travels from the late 1980s. Kim is said to have advised Kim Il-song and his heir-apparent Chong-il to introduce more openness after a tour of Europe in March 1990. Kim survived factional infighting within the communist party last year when he was stripped of his post as a candidate for the Politburo after conservatives criticized liberals' unfruitful economic reforms. The two other delegates, in contrast, are seasoned officials of inter-Korean dialogue who served as delegates to the prime ministers' talks. An Pyong-su has a single-track career in dealing with South Koran affairs. He has worked for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland since he graduated from Kim Il-song University. He serves as vice chairman of the committee along with chief delegate Kim Yong-sun. He captivated the South Korean media as North Korean spokesman for the inter-Korean prime ministers' talks with his glib tongue. Meanwhile, Paek Nam-chun also graduated from Kim Il-song University. He became involved in South Korean affairs as an advisor to the North Korea Red Cross Society during inter-Korean dialogue back in 1972. Except for a brief stint as ambassador to Poland, Paek has served as a point man in North Korea's contacts with South Korea.
