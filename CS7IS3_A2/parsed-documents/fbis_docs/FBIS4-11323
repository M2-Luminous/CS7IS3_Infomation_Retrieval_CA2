Garcia] [Text] Havana, 25 Apr (PL) -- When many countries of the world are coming apart like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, the language spoken in Cuba is one of family reunification and normalization of ties between this country and its emigrants. "The Nation and the Emigrants Conference" concluded Sunday afternoon with the participation of 215 emigrants from 30 countries. Most of the participants described the conference as a first step toward the opening of channels of communication between the two sides. Although measures were announced to expedite those relations, some participants, like businessman and newsman Lazaro Farinas, felt that the main achievement of this meeting was that it was held. Farinas, who always expressed his ideological differences with the Cuban Government, told PRENSA LATINA he felt very satisfied with the results of the meeting, "because it allowed former adversaries to come to talk with the government of their fatherland without foreign interference." Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina announced yesterday the adoption of several measures to expedite the communication of the emigrants with their country, including the removal of the requirement for those who leave the country legally to wait five years before being able to return. It was also decided to create a department to handle emigrants, edit a magazine related to the topic of immigration, and allow residents [as received] to stay at the home of relatives instead of being forced to book hotel rooms to study in their country of origin. In Farinas' opinion, the normalization of ties will permit the "thwarting of Miami's belligerent and violent emigrants, who are just one part of the community, as well as contributing to the health of the nation. [no closing quotation marks as received] For years, we walked on a path that divided us and we got nowhere; now we want to explore how to be united in favor of the Cuban nation, Farinas noted in judging that the conference shows the viability of normalizing relations despite ideological differences. Raul Varandela, a former member of the rebel army's ninth column who later adopted a counterrevolutionary stance, told PRENSA LATINA that "Jorge Mas Canosa (head of the ultrarightist Cuban American Foundation) is now suffering, but we are not, because this meeting opened up the path we were seeking." In the opinion of John Cabanas, a businessman who runs a charter airline, the meeting constitutes a starting point that will make room for communication and dialogue among relatives and will identify the problems of the community and their solutions. Like other participants and observers, Cabanas termed as very democratic the fact that the authorities allowed all views and concerns of the overseas community to be expressed. The fact that those from over there and those here -- government officials included -- talked amiably, even those who had never been friends, also caught the attention of the participants, newsmen, and guests. Orlando Lastre, of the Promankind [Prohombre] organization, stated, in turn, that those who allowed themselves to be intimidated by the fear campaign launched by Miami's right-wing and failed to attend will regret not having participated in this event in which the groundwork was laid for greater communication between the two parts of the same nation. The first decisions adopted at the conference will begin to take shape tomorrow, as joint commissions will be set up to discuss topics of common interest, such as immigration and other concerns of young people, women, artists, and professionals, without needing to wait for the next conference.
