The installation of a computation section in each voting place, where all the tallies of the sections are gathered and an additional tally is prepared with the total number of votes at that location, complicates the counting, makes it more troublesome, and slows the process unnecessarily. The simplest and fastest way is precisely what is not done: send in each section's results as these partial results are obtained. In this way, unnecessary problems are avoided, such as those caused by a situation where, in a voting station where there are 30-40 sections, the transmission of results can be delayed for many hours because of the need to compile a new tally, and because one or two of those sections will probably lag behind the others. In the recent election in Panama, where I was an observer, the sections--each one had up to 350 voters--closed at 1600. At 2000, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal announced the partial results and continued to broadcast the results as the counting proceeded. At 0800 on the following day, the president of the Tribunal appeared on television and announced the vote count, which was almost 90 percent complete. In other words, an almost definitive result. A little later, the president of the republic received in the palace the winning candidate, who had won by a narrow margin of 4 percent of the vote. In Peru, for simple balloting such as the plebiscite of 31 October 1993 in which there were only yes and no votes, the National Electoral Board took two months to announce the results. There was never any reasonable explanation for that monumental delay, which contributed to the plebiscite--justifiably--being called into question. In Panama, the Electoral Tribunal used a system called TER, Unofficial Transmission of Results. (In reality, it is provisional or partial, but not unofficial, because it is carried out by an official organization.) The TER was based on a very simple form that the secretary of each section filled out as soon as the tallying was completed, and which was then turned over to an employee of the Tribunal, who was responsible for a certain number of sections. This employee then turned over the form to a supervisor, who sent it to a collection center where it was fed into a computer. The system worked uninterruptedly. If one or two sections were delayed in closing, they did not slow the process. There were 25 tallying centers in the country that were connected to a central computer, on the screens of which the results automatically appeared as soon as they were entered. All the news media--and therefore the public--had immediate access to the results. These results were provisional, because they were announced before any decisions were made over possible challenges. But unless there are many such challenges, the final result would not change significantly. In its turn, the Commission for Justice and Peace, affiliated with the Catholic Church, established a system of "parallel tallying" of votes, which is a form of surveillance of the state by society. This system was what permitted the Church to denounce the fraud perpetrated in 1989, when General Manuel Noriega tried to manipulate the electoral process and deny the victory of the civilian opposition, which had won with 70 percent of the vote. Although the situation had changed in 1994 and the Commission for Justice and Peace had complete confidence in the Electoral Tribunal, it conducted--for the last time--the parallel tally. To do this, they organized some 1600 volunteers, one for approximately four electoral sections. These volunteers took note of each section's results and turned them over to one of the 150 supervisors who visited the voting places. The results were transmitted by telephone, fax, or radio to one of the Commission's three tallying centers in the country--the center in Panama City had 40 computers and as many telephone lines--which in turn sent the results by telephone line (modem) to a central computer. Thus, in the space of a few hours, this parallel system tallied approximately 80 percent of the votes cast, obtaining a result with a margin of error of less than one percent. These systems, the official one as well as the parallel tally, are used with minor variations in almost all the countries of Latin America. Only in Peru are obsolete systems maintained and attempts made to prevent a parallel tally. The reasons are not technical, as no great sophistication nor mysterious technology is required. With a few computers, telephone lines--and radios--and reasonable organization, reliable results are obtainable in a few hours. The problems are political, and they relate to attempts by a civilian--military clique to perpetuate itself in power, and which will not hesitate to thwart the people's mandate, if it can. This is why the next weeks and months in determining the electoral system and mechanisms will be decisive.
