The mouthpiece of the Cuban Workers Federation (CTC) carried an article signed by writer and journalist Nicanor Lomplcotayt, an expert on U.S. issues, stating that the end of the siege of the island is neither in sight nor as distant as the most pessimists predicted. Since Washington lifted the blockade against Vietnam, a country in which it lost over 60,000 soldiers during the imposed war in the 1960's, many ask if now the White House will end the blockade it has implemented against Cuba for over 30 years, the article comments. It added that, when resuming the increasingly longer list of those who oppose the blockade, the Miami newspaper EL NUEVO HERALD said in its 7 March edition: "From religious and humanitarian organizations to conservative editorialists, and from civil rights groups to business managers, the different critics of the trade embargo assert it is a Cold War relic which affects U.S. businesses or contributes to the island's poverty." The situation is compounded by the start of the House of Representatives debates on the issue. Regardless of the results, it proves the extent of the internal criticism that this behavior has earned. In addition to other signs of international rejection, the UN Assembly General has issued two resolutions expressing its disapproval, TRABAJADORES emphasized. If the decision to lift the embargo against Vietnam proves the U.S. businessmen's realism managed to displace the dogmatism and mental anachronism of a group of officials and congressmen, in Cuba's case I believe they could very well play a crucial role, Leon Cotayo said.
