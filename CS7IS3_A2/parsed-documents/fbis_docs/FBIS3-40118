Foreign Exchange Market Is Not Unified, Local Divisions Are Serious Since reform and opening up, the traditional system of highly centralized foreign exchange control has been broken up and a crisscross foreign exchange distribution system has been established. Vertical distribution is restricted mainly by the ratio of foreign exchange withholding and the state foreign exchange utilization plan. Horizontal flow is restricted mainly by the economic returns of foreign exchange utilization of local departments. The former is less flexible as compared to the latter. Enterprises and local departments receive foreign exchange supply through vertical distribution and rely on the regulatory foreign exchange market for regulating their foreign exchange surplus and shortage. The vertical foreign exchange distribution plan is linked to the national plan, stressing the consideration of national interests, whereas local and departmental foreign exchange utilization considers mainly local and departmental interests. As a result, there are conflicts between vertical foreign exchange supply and horizontal flow. For instance, the special economic zones (SEZ) of China have a greater demand for foreign exchange due to their rapid development. This has caused a large amount of foreign exchange to flow into the SEZs. In the meantime, areas losing foreign exchange do not get timely compensation for such spontaneous outflow of foreign exchange. As a result, out of the consideration of regional and local interests, local governments often adopt means of administrative intervention to control the outflow of foreign exchange, creating man-made obstacles to horizontal flow of foreign exchange. 2. The Existence of Three Foreign Exchange Rates Affects Investment Environment Currently there are mainly three foreign exchange rates: 1) Official exchange rate; 2) market exchange rate, referring mainly to exchange rate on the regulatory market which is determined by the supply and demand situation of foreign exchange market and the goal of government intervention; 3) black market exchange rate, referring to non-public transactions outside the foreign exchange market. The existence of three exchange rates has distorted the price of foreign exchange market, adversely affected the optimum distribution of foreign exchange resources, influenced the environment of foreign investment, and hindered to a certain extent the development of foreign contacts. 3. Foreign Exchange Shortage Makes Reluctance To Sell a Common Phenomenon Foreign exchange shortage can be divided into two types: actual and psychological. Actual shortage is caused by either insufficient supply or excessive demand of foreign exchange or a combination of the two. In recent years, China's import and export trade has developed rapidly, causing demand for use of foreign exchange to skyrocket. Especially since 1991, along with the high speed growth of the economy, the growth of import has far exceeded the growth of export, creating a shortage of supply on the foreign exchange market. A direct consequence of the shortage is increasingly tightened control of foreign exchange and the prevailing mentality of reluctance to sell. The appearance of psychological shortage is caused by strict foreign exchange control, complicated screening and approval procedures, and anticipation for the depreciation of renminbi. Since 1992, the mentality of reluctance to sell has been very common on the foreign exchange market. This has caused a very unfavorable effect on the regulatory functions of the foreign exchange market. 4. Foreign Exchange Withholding Quota Creates More Harm Than Good and Is Unfavorable to the Formation of Foreign Exchange Market Beginning 1979, the traditional unified foreign exchange collection and distribution system was replaced with the foreign exchange withholding quota system. We should say that this special system has played a positive role in increasing the efficiency of production and management of export enterprises and raising the enthusiasm of enterprises. However, as the reform and opening up further deepened and objective economic conditions changed, some problems have been exposed in the foreign exchange withholding quota system. Their main expressions are as follows: 1) Foreign exchange quota is separated from the actual amount of foreign exchange, causing over-distribution of foreign exchange resources, which tend to result in the phenomenon of "marrying one girl to two men." 2) The existence of both quota price and current exchange price has distorted market exchange rate. 3) Withholding quota cannot accurately reflect the actual income and expenditure of foreign exchange, causing confusion in management. 4) Quota withholding is not an international practice. Abolishing the quota withholding system and permitting cash foreign exchange withholding is an inevitable demand for deepening the reform of foreign exchange management system. 5. Many Problems Still Exist in the Current Structure and Management Method of National Foreign Exchange Reserves First of all, national foreign exchange reserve that the state can actually draw on is fairly limited. This is because the state cannot transfer or use for free the portion of the balance of foreign exchange operational funds of the National Bank of China, which constitutes the difference between the bank's own foreign exchange funds and routine foreign exchange lending. And, localities and enterprises have the actual right to use and control their share of the withholdings from national foreign exchange balance. Local and enterprise withholdings account for a fairly large portion of national foreign exchange balance. Secondly, the Central Bank of China cannot function effectively to manage foreign exchange reserves, adversely affecting the enforcement of the monetary policy. Under the current foreign exchange settlement system, the Central Bank of China is responsible for supplying renminbi needed for all foreign exchange settlements. As a passive supplier of renminbi, it is difficult for the Central Bank to take the initiative in regulating and controlling the supply according to different monetary policies in different periods. More often than not, the supply of renminbi by the Central Bank conflicts with the bank's monetary policy, reducing the effect of the monetary policy. Third, the readjustment of the scale of foreign exchange reserve is inflexible and is carried out at a fairly great price. When foreign exchange reserve declines and in serious shortage, the state often puts various restrictions on the use of foreign exchange. When foreign exchange reserve becomes excessive, the state often relaxes control in various manners regarding the use of foreign exchange and indiscriminately expands the use of foreign exchange, eventually resulting in the abrupt and excessive reduction of foreign exchange scale. Proposals for Reform of Foreign Exchange System in the Near Future The basic solution for the abovementioned problems in the current foreign exchange control system is to deepen and speed up the reform of the foreign exchange control system. Through the reform, we should establish an overall regulation and control mechanism for the Central Bank, speed up the formation of a unified national foreign exchange market, strengthen the control of foreign exchange reserve by the Central Bank, and gradually promote free conversion of renminbi. In the near future, we should adopt the following measures: 1. Strengthen the control of foreign exchange reserve and increase the ability of the Central Bank to regulate and control foreign exchange market. The key is to establish a foreign exchange reserve control system centered around the Central Bank, maintain a rational scale of foreign exchange reserve, and change the past situation where the foreign exchange funds of the bank were not separated from the foreign exchange balance of the state and where central foreign exchange was confused with foreign exchange withholdings. At the same time, we should establish the foreign exchange leverage fund for the Central Bank to ensure its ability to adjust to market changes. As China opens its door wider and wider to the outside and as the domestic economy of China develops, the overall balance of the national economy depends on internal and foreign exchange balance to maintain, and doing a good job in coordinating the relations between domestic monetary and foreign exchange policies is extremely important. Judging from the experience of various nations, foreign exchange policy is an important component of the monetary policy of the Central Bank. When the economy of a nation is affected by external factors, causing serious fluctuation of foreign exchange market, the central bank will openly buy and sell foreign exchange on foreign exchange market to suppress exchange prices. This important task cannot be accomplished if the central bank does not have enough foreign exchange on hand. Because of this, China should speed up the reform of foreign exchange transfer and deposit system, change the current situation of decentralized foreign exchange control, and establish as soon as possible a powerful reserve control system. 2. Establish a foreign exchange market of effective operation. First, we should create a "market starter" to facilitate the circulation of foreign exchange funds between financial organizations, especially between banks and other financial organizations. At the same time, we should expand the right and ability of all financial organizations to manage foreign exchange and enable them to actively participate in the market and create a market amidst fair competition. Second, we should further expand the scale of foreign exchange regulation to increase the coverage of market. Third, we should accelerate the reform of the current foreign exchange withholding system, abolish as soon as possible withholding quotas, and smooth out foriegn exchang price. Fourth, we should improve the administrative divisions of current foreign exchange market, establish unified tangible foreign exchange markets based in large open cities, and gradually transfer to an invisible unified national market. Fifth, we should abolish the multi-track foreign exchange rate systems and merge them into one. Sixth, we should experiment with free conversion of renminbi in nontrade and border-trade areas and gradually make it possible to convert renminbi without any restrictions. Through the above reforms, we should establish an open, unified, and highly effective foreign exchange market. 3. Establish an effective foreign exchange statistics monitoring system to provide a basis for strengthening the overall regulation and control of the Central Bank. Judged from the current situation, international payments have a growing impact on the credit income and expenditure of the state. Inaccurate statistics of international payments will affect the accuracy of policies. Because of this, we should seize the golden opportunity created by the International Currency Foundation helping us strengthen our foreign exchange statistics and build a complete foreign exchange statistics system to create conditions for timely understanding, mastering, and study of foreign economic activities and for making correct policy decisions.
