He said, "in the wake of the 15th anniversary of the Islamic revolution, Iran is faced with the task of revitalizing its economy. The ROK is a very suitable economic partner that Iran presently needs." The Islamic government was established in Iran after the Islamic revolutionary forces led by late Ayatollah Khomeini overthrew the Pahlavi Dynasty in 1979. Iran has been suffering economic difficulties that increased with the aftermath of the eight-year-long war with Iraq and last year's drop in oil prices. [Pak Kyong-a] Relations between the ROK and Iran were estranged for a short time after the Islamic revolution.... [Zabihollah Now-Forsati] Iran and the ROK established diplomatic relations in 1962. Their relations became estranged to such an extent that the ambassadorship was downgraded to the level of charge d'affairs in 1981 when the war was going on between Iran and Iraq. Their relations, however, have been normalized since 1989. At present, Iran's trust in the ROK people is so high that the Iranian Embassy here issues visas to ROK people within only 24 hours. [Pak] What is the reason for the increased trust in the ROK people? [Now-Forsati] A number of foreign enterprises left Iran in succession during its past war with Iraq. However, ROK enterprises remained in Iran and kept their working sites even at the risk of death and wounds. The Iranian people never forget the favor they receive from others. [Pak] What do you think is the reason that the ROK should attach importance to expanding economic cooperation with Iran? [Now-Forsati] First, Iran, with a population of 60 million, is an excellent market for various kinds of consumer goods. Moreover, Iran founded an organization for economic cooperation with central Asian countries that separated from the former Soviet Union and became independent states. Iran is leading this organization. Therefore, the ROK can have easy access to the central Asian markets with Iran as a stepping-stone. Second, the ROK can secure the source of stable oil supply based on amicable relations with Iran. Third, only Iran has become the nation where rich experiences of the ROK enterprises can be put to practical use in the Middle East. [Pak] What is the degree of Iran's present economic exchange with the ROK? [Now-Forsati] The volume of annual trade between Iran and the ROK reaches $2 billion. ROK enterprises, including Daewoo, Daelim, Samsung, Ssangyong, Sinhwa, and Hyundai, are engaged in the construction of roads, an oil pipeline, power stations, and chemical and textile plants, throughout Iran. [Pak] What is the position of Iran on the peace negotiations between Israel and Palestine? [Now-Forsati] We are opposed to such changes as seen today. The PLO does not reflect the will of all the Palestinian people. [end Now-Forsati] Ambassador Now-Forsati said that it is curious that just as the price of land in Seoul's Tehran Street has increased exorbitantly, that of Tehran's Seoul Street has also drastically increased.
