In an interview on the National Television Network Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK) news program, Hata said the current tax system is "totally out of balance" with 70 percent of revenue coming from direct taxes and the remaining 30 percent coming from indirect ones. "This is a ratio that must be corrected," Hata said. "We have to have measures to meet the aging society. How are we going to get the necessary funds? Are we going to be relying on the younger workers to support the aged people in the society? "This is a basic contradiction in the society. This will be the core of the debate. "The tax system is totally out of balance and we will decide on a direction by June of this year. We will try to achieve a consensus and we will try to pass this bill by the end of the year. We have reached a certain level of agreement and I am sure that this will be realized," he said. The Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ], the coalition's largest party, had insisted during debate over a new coalition policy platform, that any attempt to implement an indirect tax increase should be done after "gaining a national consensus." But in further negotiations, the coalition members later agreed to a proposal that an indirect tax increase be implemented "while trying to gain public support." SDP intransigence over the indirect tax issue was one of the main reasons for the delay in final agreement among the parties over their platform. On Friday, the coalition formally chose Hata as its candidate for prime minister. The Diet will elect Hata as Japan's 51st prime minister Monday afternoon, with the coalition parties occupying a majority of seats in both chambers of the legislature. In the interview, Hata downplayed the central role in the coalition of two key strategists, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito [Clean Government Party] Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa. "People talk about control by these two people, but if we look back over the past eight months of the coalition government and take a historical perspective I do not think you can say it has been controlled by these two people," said Hata, who is head of Shinseito. "When you have a coalition like that you really need someone like that who can pull the parties together, somebody has to take the lead. "Mr. Ozawa has been at the core of politics and he knows more about politics than anybody else. "He has always been in situations of power and of course it was natural for him to assume a powerful position. "And I feel sorry for him because he has always been in a position of being the person everybody loves to hate." Hata refused to divulge his thoughts on the makeup of the new cabinet. "We really have to give this a little more thought," he said.
