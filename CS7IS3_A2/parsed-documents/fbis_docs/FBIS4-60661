For example, they informed them in Bab al-Mandeb-Kharaz axis that their forces had reached Salah al-Din camp, while those soldiers and officers at al- Rahidah front and Karish that their forces had reached Dar Sa'd on the outskirts of Aden. [sentence as heard] This was not only a deceit and misleading to these soldiers and officers in order to plunge them in fierce battles, but was against all reason. The military source added that scientific military calculations do not accept this. There was also another fact which was ignored by the military command in Sanaa. It was that they were waging an aggressive war, which should be firmly countered by well-trained forces and by people who do not submit to any injustice and tyrant. The aggressors were faced with a brave resistance and incredible steadfastness on the part of the DRY's forces, which enjoy high morale and rare heroism. The military source added that the democratic Yemen's Armed Forces Command in defense of the national and human responsibility towards the misled elements who were plunged by the al-Ahmar gang, calls on all these soldiers and officers to take a brave and reasonable stand and refuse to continue in this failed war into which they were launched by the family, which is concerned only to maintain the throne of authority of 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his adventurous gang. The source expressed confidence of the Armed Forces of the DRY that these (?mischievous) elements will take any opportunity to get rid of the certain death and rid our people and their families of sadness and concern over their lives to which Sanaa's rulers give no consideration. The Armed Forces Command of the DRY affirm that those who will surrender spontaneously will receive all appreciation and respect from their brothers in blood and faith and affiliation to the sons of the DRY.
