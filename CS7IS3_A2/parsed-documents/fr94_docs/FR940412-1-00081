If heated strongly will decompose, giving off toxic gases which support combustion. 6These mixtures may be subject to self-sustaining decomposition if heated. Decomposition, once initiated, may spread throughout the remainder, producing gases which are toxic. 7Toxic if swallowed and by dust inhalation. 8Harmful and irritating by dust inhalation. 9Highly corrosive to steel. 10Powerful allergen. Toxic by ingestion. Skin contact or inhalation of dust may cause severe irritation of skin, eyes, and mucous membranes in some people. 11May be susceptible to spontaneous heating and ignition. 12Liable to cause oxygen depletion in the cargo space. 13Liable to emit methane gas which can form explosive mixtures with air. 14Dust forms explosive mixtures with air. 15May present substantial danger to the public health or welfare or the environment when released into the environment. Skin contact and dust inhalation should be avoided. 16Combustible. Burns with dense black smoke. Dust may cause skin and eye irritation. 17Radiation hazard from dust inhalation and contact with mucous membranes. 18Susceptible to fire from sparks and open flames. 19May self-heat slowly and, if wet or containing an excessive proportion of unoxidized oil, ignite spontaneously. 20Fire may produce irritating or poisonous gases. 21Dust may contain toxic constituents. 22Lead nitrate and lead sulfide are hazardous substances, see footnote 15 and sec. 148.270. 23Hazardous substance when consisting of pieces having a diameter less than 10 micrometers (0.004 in.), see footnote 15 and sec. 148.270. 24Cargo subject to liquefaction.
