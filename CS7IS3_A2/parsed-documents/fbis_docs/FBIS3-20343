Economy Minister Edmond Alphandery said after a cabinet meeting that he had asked that Haberer be removed from his post at the head of the state-controlled Credit National and that the cabinet had agreed. On Tuesday Haberer had called for a commission of enquiry into the way the Credit Lyonnais, which has reported a loss of 6.9 billion francs (1.23 billion dollars), had been managed. Alphandery, in response to a question about this, replied: "This enquiry will be held." The conservative neo-Gaullist RPR [Rally for the Republic] political group tabled a proposal on Wednesday calling for a parliamentary investigation to "throw light on the real causes" of the losses. The leader of the RPR group, Bernard Pons, said that "officially" the net consolidated loss for 1993 is 6.9 billion francs but that the real sum, on the basis of press reports of the latest study by the treasury, "might be more than 20 billion francs." He said: "This exceptional situation, without precedent in French banking history, requires that the state intervene in line with the scale of the announced loss and once again it is the taxpayer who, in the end, will be asked to foot the deficit of a state company." Pons said: "The real question is to know how the Credit Lyonnais came to make so many commitments to clients whose insolvency was notorious or whose reputation was at the least equivocal." Questions should be asked about some investments made between 1988 and 1993 and on the role played by the government of the day, he said. This was seen as a reference to the previous socialist administration which was voted out of office a year ago. Government spokesman and Budget Minister Nicolas Sarkozy said that "errors of management were committed" at Credit Lyonnais during the period when Haberer was president. Haberer, who ran the Credit Lyonnais until November, in a statement on Tuesday, attacked what he described as a "media lynching" of him over the losses. Referring to the responsibility of the state, he said: "Account is not taken of the recommendations which I received at least until March 1993 from the majority shareholder" to "support influential sectors of the economy and thereby contribute to growth and employment, particularly during the years of crisis which our country is experiencing." He said that he was being blamed for risks to which the bank had become committed before he was appointed on September 15 1988. Acknowledging that errors had been made, and that internal controls needed to be tightened, he said that an enquiry should establish who had been responsible for what. Observers noted that of problem loans, commitments to the cinema through Credit Lyonnais Nederland Bank (CLNB) originated under the presidency of Jean Deflassieux and were continued by Haberer's predecessor Jean Maxime Leveque. Another problem linked to controversial politician and business tycoon Bernard Tapie, through the Credit Lyonnais subsisiary SDBO, goes back many years, and problems connected with the late British press magnate Robert Maxwell began under Leveque. The current president of the bank, Jean Peyrelevade, said on Tuesday that management mistakes had been made, mainly through subsidiaries "under several governments of different colours."
