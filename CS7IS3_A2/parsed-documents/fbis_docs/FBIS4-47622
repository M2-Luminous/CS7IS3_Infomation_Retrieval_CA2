IT IS BASED ON FOREIGN MEDIA CONTENT AND BEHAVIOR AND IS ISSUED WITHOUT COORDINATION WITH OTHER U.S. GOVERNMENT COMPONENTS) FOREIGN MEDIA NOTE--FB PN 94-066 MIDDLE EAST: CONTROLS FOR SATELLITE TELEVISION MIDDLE EAST: CONTROLS FOR SATELLITE TELEVISION Summary: Amidst the growing controversy over the influence of satellite television on Middle Eastern opinion and public morality, a Saudi-owned weekly magazine has suggested a technological means for Saudi Arabia and other regional nations to regain control over the television media. Quoting American and British experts in cable and microwave technology, AL-MAJALLAH suggests that the current system of direct satellite reception by consumers should be replaced by national cable television grids that will ensure quality program content and reduce the cost of reception equipment for the consumer. The hard copy version of this Foreign Media Note contains 2 cartoons with captions. The Arab world has witnessed a rapid rise in the use and popularity of satellite television since the end of the Gulf War. The MIDDLE EAST BUSINESS WEEKLY (25 Mar 94) reported that "CNN woke up millions of people in the Middle East to the fact that there was a satellite alternative to the worthy but dull outpourings of state television." The growth in Middle Eastern demand has been matched by rapid expansion in the supply of Arabic-language satellite programming to the region. The Saudi-owned Arabic weekly AL-MAJALLAH of 16 April 1994 provided a brief summary of the major Arabic-language stations: Middle East Broadcasting Center (MBC): A London-based, Saudi- owned, single-channel service established in 1991 that is planning to expand to four channels in 1994. Arab Radio & Television (ART): Saudi-owned and based in Italy. Currently broadcasting on 4 channels. Egyptian Space Channel (ESC): Egyptian-government owned station that benefits from an extensive archive of Egyptian movies. Orbit Satellite Television & Radio: Saudi owned, Rome-based multi-channel television service which is due to begin operations in 1994. Plans call for 20 channels. Dubai Satellite: Single-channel, state-owned service that provides news and entertainment on a 24-hour basis. This is currently the only Arab station that is available worldwide. Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia have also opened satellite services. Debate on the Merits of Satellites The growth in satellite broadcasting has touched off a discussion of its merits and dangers in the Middle East press over the past few months. Articles and cartoons in the government-owned Egyptian press, for example, have described the cultural impact and commercial opportunities afforded by satellite programs, while the opposition press is warning that satellite broadcasting will bring either increased political control over viewers or, if left uncontrolled, corrupt viewers' morals. Egyptian journalist Muhammad 'Abu-al-Futuh expressed the fears of many concerning the impact of satellite television when he argued (AL-SHA'B 22 Feb 94) that the satellite dishes bring more "poison, immorality, and decadence" than benefits, which makes them a "ferocious threat that must be resisted." He observed that the "obscene and homosexual programs that the dish will bring us are more dangerous than cancer and AIDS. It is the intellectual and cultural (equivalent of) AIDS." Exploring other negative aspects of satellite TV, the 1 April issue of AL-SHA'B warns that the new Arabic-speaking stations will simply become further instruments of political control designed to limit society's access to a variety of political opinion. Another perspective is provided in the 23 March issue of Egypt's semi-official AL-AHRAM, which boasts that the Egyptian satellite channel, Egyptian Space Channel (ESC), has become an effective culture voice for Egypt among Arabic-speaking viewers abroad. Under the headline "Egyptian Space Channel Wins First Prize During (the holy month of) Ramadan," AL-AHRAM reported that according to its survey, ESC's programming attracted more viewers in Paris than any other Arab station. Respondents to the AL-AHRAM survey expressed strong appreciation for the station and requested an expansion of its cultural programming. The commercial promise of satellite broadcasting for Arab business and advertisers has also attracted the attention of the regional press. AL-MAJALLAH and the MIDDLE EAST BUSINESS WEEKLY, for example, follow media trends and report market penetration figures for satellite stations drawing on sources such as the influential media index published in February 1994 by the Dubai- based Pan-Arab Research Center. Publications such as Egypt's AL- MUSAWWAR (1 Apr 94) have described an intense struggle among satellite stations for market share. AL-MUSAWWAR's 1 April article introduced the topic of commercial satellite competition under the headline of "Satellite Channel War in the Arab Skies." Despite the intensity of the competition, AL-MUSAWWAR also indicated a degree of common ground among Arab broadcasters. In its interview with 'Amar al-Laythi, the director of the Middle East Broadcasting Center, AL- MUSAWWAR quoted him as saying: "All things considered we can assume that we (Arab broadcasters) have a common goal which is to fight against the foreign satellite channels and to pull Arab viewers away from them." Controversy over the impact of satellite television is directly related to the vast success of satellite programming in the Middle East over the past two years. The TEHRAN TIMES (FBIS NC1404125094) of 10 April, for example, cites another Iranian daily as estimating that some 400 new dishes are being installed on Tehran rooftops daily. The MIDDLE EAST BUSINESS WEEKLY (25 Mar 94) referred to a "dish craze" in Saudi Arabia where "it is estimated that there are more than 150,000 dishes (installed) and that at least 1 million people have access to satellite television services." Although specific statistics are not available, the satellite phenomenon is widespread throughout the Middle East, especially in circles that can afford the relatively expensive reception equipment. Governments' Response In response to the perceived threats of foreign influence and corruption of domestic viewers, authorities in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Iran have begun imposing varying levels of control on satellite viewing. AL-HAYAH of 27 March reports that two Egyptian provinces, Daqahliyah and Dumyat, have ordered that satellite dishes be removed from the roofs of coffee shops, clubs and other public places. Meanwhile, the 25 March THE MIDDLE EAST BUSINESS WEEKLY reports a total ban on private ownership of satellite dishes in Saudi Arabia, and in Iran the 10 April TEHRAN TIMES announced that "the use of satellite dishes is not illegal, but will need to be authorized." Proposal to Counter Satellites Against this backdrop of fear and controversy, the Saudi-owned AL-MAJALLAH devoted its 16 April cover story to discussing cable technology as a possible solution to the perceived threat of satellite broadcasting: "Many specialists in worldwide satellite communications believe that cable systems for capturing satellite broadcast will be the path of the future for many Arab states. With the increasing number of satellite broadcasting facilities outside the geographic confines of the countries, the only means to guide and control this sector is through national cable systems, which may later evolve into regional systems and nets." The AL-MAJALLAH article focused specifically on a microwave technology known as MMDS (microwave multi-directional system), a point-to-multipoint broadcast system compatible with cable technology. Citing American and British experts in the field, AL- MAJALLAH explained that MMDS can support the rebroadcast of 24 to 56 ground and satellite channels. Local microwave/cable operators retransmit the programming to subscribers who pay an annual subscription fee and receive the signal via a small, inexpensive antenna. From AL-MAJALLAH' point of view, the MMDS approach has advantages for national authorities, advertisers, and viewers. Its first advantage is the ability "to monitor the broadcast content to be sure it is consistent with general good taste." The presence of national cable grids will also enable advertisers to better measure the market and adjust their programming and advertising accordingly. The consumers too will profit because the MMDS antennas are far cheaper than conventional satellite dishes, and the MMDS approach enables the subscriber to select and be billed for only those channels actually wanted. Return on business investment may also represent a reason for introducing MMDS technology into the Middle East. The MIDDLE EAST BUSINESS WEEKLY article 94) suggested that at least in Saudi Arabia the elimination of direct consumer access to satellite transmissions could create a lucrative market in retransmitting satellite programming for some Saudi investors: "The Saudi decision (of 10 March 1994 to ban private dish ownership) means death to the market in satellite dishes, but not to satellite television. Earlier this year, it emerged that ARA International Products Company of Riyadh, an affiliate of (the Saudi-owned) MBC, had been authorized to set up a microwave multi- directional system (MMDS) television service from Riyadh. It is understood plans call for the new service to provide up to 15 channels, including the two Saudi state television channels and MBC."
