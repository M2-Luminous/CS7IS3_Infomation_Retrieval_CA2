FR940728-2-00047 FR940728-2-00039 EPA published final regulations for the reformulated gasoline program on February 16, 1994 (59 FR 7716). II. The Governor's Request EPA received an application from the Hon. Brereton C. Jones, Governor of the State of Kentucky, for the Kentucky portions of the Louisville and the Cincinnati-Hamilton ozone non-attainment areas to be included in the reformulated gasoline program. His application is set out in full below. [State of Kentucky letterhead] September 19, 1993. Ms. Carol Browner, Administrator, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460 Dear Ms. Browner: In accordance with Section 211(k), (6)(A) of the Federal Clean Air Act, I request that, beginning January 1, 1995, the prohibition applying to the sale of conventional gasoline be extended to the Kentucky portion of the Louisville ozone non-attainment area and the Kentucky portion of the Cincinnati-Hamilton ozone non-attainment area. The Kentucky portion of the Louisville non-attainment area consists of Jefferson County and a portion of Bullitt and Oldham Counties. The Kentucky portion of the Cincinnati ozone non-attainment area consists of Boone, Campbell and Kenton Counties. The Kentucky Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Cabinet recommended that I apply to you to require the use of reformulated gasoline in these counties in order to help achieve the reduction of volatile organic compounds mandated in Section 182(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act. The revision to Kentucky's State Implementation Plan for achieving a 15% reduction of volatile organic compounds due by November 15, 1993 will include emission reductions gained by the use of reformulated gasoline. ␣␣␣Sincerely, Brereton C. Jones. III. Action Pursuant to the governor's letter and the provisions of section 211(k)(6), the prohibitions of subsection 211(k)(5) will be applied to the Kentucky portions of the Louisville and Cincinnati-Hamilton ozone non-attainment areas beginning January 1, 1995 (unless delayed, as provided above). The Kentucky portion of the Louisville non-attainment area consists of Jefferson County and a portion of Bullitt and Oldham Counties. The Kentucky portion of the Cincinnati ozone non-attainment area consists of Boone, Campbell and Kenton Counties. These ozone nonattainment areas are classified as moderate. 2 2 See 56 FR 56764, 54765 (November 6, 1991). Based on the governor's application, EPA's final rule for reformulated gasoline included these areas as covered area (40 CFR 80.70(j)). 3 3 59 FR 7852 (February 16, 1994). The application of the prohibitions to the Kentucky portions of the Louisville and Cincinnati-Hamilton areas cannot take effect any earlier than January 1, 1995 under section 211(k)(5) and cannot take effect any later than January 1, 1995, under section 211(k)(6)(A), unless the Administrator extends the effective date by rule under section 211(k)(6)(B). Dated: July 15, 1994. Carol M. Browner, Administrator. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;18388 Filed 7&hyph;27&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P
