This was announced to journalists in Geneva on Saturday night by Andrey Kozyrev, Russian Federation foreign minister. "I must say that the reaction was not bad from both the Serb and the Muslim leadership," he noted. "We had contacts with Haris Silajdzic, Bosnian prime minister, during which it became clear that there is a considerable opportunity to work towards a settlement on the basis of the adopted document. I think that the Serbian side is also sending out signals that it is willing to begin negotiations without any preconditions, which is very important." Nevertheless, the minister believes that considerable effort will be needed to bring the two sides closer. [passage omitted]
