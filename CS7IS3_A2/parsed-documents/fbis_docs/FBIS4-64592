Carlos Solchaga, Jose Luis Corcuera, and Jose Barrionuevo -- implicated in the Mariano Rubio and Luis Roldan cases -- will relinquish their parliamentary responsibilities before the 12 June elections, according to Socialist sources. CiU [Convergence and Union], which has demanded that he "take the bull by the horns," yesterday forced him to appear before a plenary session of the Congress of Deputies next Wednesday [11 May]. CiU, within which Jordi Pujol and Jose Antonio Duran Lleida seem to have again shared between them the roles of conciliator and hard- liner -- though their basic stance is similar -- and the PNV [Basque Nationalist Party], to which the Socialists and the Catalan nationalists are again paying attention in order not to appear isolated, have decided to grant Felipe Gonzalez temporary support conditional on the implementation of a strategy that was largely formulated jointly. During the 2 May holiday Felipe Gonzalez, helped by Narcis Serra, Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, and Javier Solana, obtained an extension of support to deal with the harassment by the PP [People's Party] and the IU [United Left], granted to him by the CiU and PNV. Furthermore, Gonzalez presented his strategy for resolving the crisis to the narrow circle of his closest aides. According to Socialist sources, this strategy includes Carlos Solchaga's resignation as parliamentary spokesman and Jose Luis Corcuera's and Jose Barrionuevo's resignation of their parliamentary seats, as demanded by CiU, even though the government says that "there is no pressure" from Jordi Pujol. Gonzalez wants to play these cards very cautiously and gradually, realizing that he must not leave himself without "trumps" in the event of a process whose duration cannot be estimated. However, the deadline for playing these cards has been set -- a month at the most, that is, by the European and Andalusian elections on 12 June. According to opposition sources, Minister of the Prime Minister's Office Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba has in practice taken over Solchaga's responsibilities. Indeed, it was Rubalcaba who spoke with CiU spokesman Miguel Roca and PNV spokesman Inaki Anasagasti in order to secure those groups' support for the government's refusal to accept the PP's demand for Gonzalez to make a special appearance before the Congress of Deputies.
