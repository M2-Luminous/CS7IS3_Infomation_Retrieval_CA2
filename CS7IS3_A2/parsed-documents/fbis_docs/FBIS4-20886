Last week the Duma held special hearings devoted to the problem of chemical weapons destruction. In Paris on 13 January 1993 Russia signed a convention banning the development, production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons, and requiring their destruction. Now our legislators must approve a program in keeping with these aims and ratify the convention. According to the document, we (along with everyone else) must destroy our chemical weapons stockpiles by the year 2005. By Russian presidential decree the Russian Federation Presidential Committee on Convention-Related Chemical and Biological Weapons Issues was established in 1992 to oversee all efforts on these issues. It is headed by an academician, Lt. Gen. A. Kuntsevich, who has spent his whole professional life forging our Motherland's "chemical shield." The committee prepared a program and submitted it for consideration by the prematurely dissolved Supreme Soviet. The parliament cut the program to shreds. The negative aspects of that program have been carried over virtually unchanged to the "revised" program. Just two examples. Firstly, no provision is made for environmental impact assessment by the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources (even though the most horrible toxins are involved). Secondly, there is clear testimony to the motives and priorities of those who designed the program: 90 percent of all hard currency funding ($494 million) are requested for "measures to provide national and international monitoring," i.e. they will be used for trips by official experts, including honoraria, per diems and other customary expenses. The level of compensation is the same as in the U.N.: $400 per person per day. There are a million problems involved in the laudable goal of bidding farewell to our chemical military past. What quantity of chemical weapons have we actually accumulated, if we count not just those that are stockpiled, but also those that have been dumped at sea or buried? Where are they located? How much concealed contamination threatens the health of human beings and the environment in those places? Is the technology for destroying these weapons safe enough? Every general question raises tens and hundreds of more specific ones. Convention committee chairman A. Kuntsevich and the deputy chief of chemical weapons forces, Maj. Gen. Yu. Tarasevich, familiarized the deputies with the official program for chemical weapons destruction. The generals reported that we have stockpiles of 40,000 metric tons (net weight) of chemical agents safely stored at seven sites. The destruction technology is wonderful and safe. The program is fine in every way and should be approved with only one amendment -- making its funding a separate budget item. All apparently outstanding, but what is one to make of published reports that our "wealth" in this area is many times larger than the official figures? What about chemical weapons that were dumped at sea? According to doctor of chemical sciences L. Fedorov (see the aforementioned article) large-scale dumping was carried out in at least 12 major areas of the Baltic Sea, White Sea, Barents Sea and Sea of Okhotsk. The generals claim not to be aware of any such thing, and even if they had heard something no documents pertaining to the matter have been found. A. Kuntsevich went so far as to report: "The Baltic states are not interested in the issue of chemical weapons dumped in the Baltic Sea." The general/academician termed other similar issues "soap bubbles." Much was said about public monitoring. Yet the Ministry of Environmental Protection's representative, a doctor of sciences with highest-level access, was not admitted to a theoretical and applied conference on chemical agent destruction held in long-suffering Chapayevsk. On two occasions the ministry proposed that the committee add a section on environmental safety to the conference, but all in vain. Generally speaking, hearings were held, and they went quite smoothly. Except for the speech by Vil Mirzayanov. That scientist's questions went unanswered. According to his data, we have manufactured approximately 400,000 metric tons of chemical weapons. What happened to the rest? How much will it actually cost to destroy even 40,000 metric tons? For example, the Americans' "known" stockpile is 35,000 tons (a credible figure). Getting rid of these weapons will cost approximately $15 billion. Our picture of military chemical "socialist realism" is far from complete. We do not even have a technical or financial assessment of chemical agent destruction yet. The chemical branch of the military-industrial complex clearly should cease to exist due to the fact that it is no longer necessary. But no one wants to give up their positions, titles or easy living, and therefore they must now replace chemical agent production with chemical agent destruction, thereby safeguarding their own interests. That is why the adoption of an unfinished program is being promoted so actively. The pressure is tremendous. Parliament is one of the last obstacles between the military chemical lobby and its access to a bright future of U.N. comfort standards. But what about the safety of our fellow citizens and the fouled forests and rivers? These have never been taken into consideration. Judging by the hearings, parliament is not a very difficult obstacle, and it will soon be overcome. But I would very much like to be proved wrong.
