Noting that Japan has stepped up its conversion into a military power and its nuclear armament and opened a road of troop dispatch overseas for aggression and war, the paper brands this as a violation of the constitution. The author of the article says: The current constitution of Japan declares that Japan shall renounce threat with and use of arms and shall not possess war potentials of the ground, naval and air forces. The successive governments of Japan, in violation of the constitution, organised ground, naval and air forces, the fire-power of which is now scores of times that of the "imperial army" before World War II, and have stepped up arms buildup and war preparations, increasing military spendings extensively. Opening a road for Japanese troop dispatch overseas means that the Japanese ruling quarters took the first step toward overseas aggression. The Japanese ruling quarters have so far put up the constitution in order to use it in making Japan appear a "peaceful state" abroad and giving the Japanese people a psychological assurance that Japan would not pursue war. Calling for constitutional revision as an immediate task, they argue that the constitution should allow the use of arms overseas by the "self-defence forces" because if Japan does not participate in military operations of the United Nations, it may invite world criticism. They also argue that constitutional revision is necessary for Japan to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council. As seen above, the main purpose of their frenzied move to malrevise the constitution is to remove all elements obstructive to war, win freedom of military action and create conditions for their military intervention and war of aggression in any part of the world. Malrevision of the constitution will only bring disaster to the Japanese people. To check Japan's conversion into a military power and overseas aggression is an important task for peace in Asia and the world.
