This is the first tour of its kind that he has conducted this year. A large number of units withdrawn from Eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics are being resettled in this district. During his three-day visit, the Minister checked on the combat readiness of the forces and on the progress in building military compounds. He visited a number of defense plants and met administration heads from the region's towns and oblasts. Over 270,000 servicemen have been brought back to Russia since 1992. A large number of them are being resettled in the Volga region. There were about 14,000 homeless officers and warrant officers in the district at the beginning of February. Two German-Turkish firms, Tekfen and Enka, are building military compounds in Chernorechye, Samara Oblast, and Chaykovskiy, Penza Oblast for units of the 2d Guards Tank Army, which is being withdrawn from Germany. Construction work is behind schedule, however. The contract, worth 200 million German marks, stipulates that 1,910 apartments, complete with infrastructure, must be completed in Chernorechye by 1 July 1994. However, the firm will not meet this deadline. It blames inflation, the unreliability of its Russian subcontractors, and difficult weather conditions in Russia. Grachev was not convinced by these arguments. After talking to the firm's manager, he received a promise that schools and most of the officers' housing would be fully commissioned by 1 September, and the rest of the compound would be completed by the end of the year. Construction of housing near the town of Chaykovskiy in Perm Oblast is also behind schedule. Enka has failed to meet the original deadline for commissioning of the compound--1 January 1994. The revised deadline of 1 September 1994 is also in jeopardy. Not even half the apartments are ready yet. Basically, the foreign firms proved to be not fully prepared for construction work under Russian conditions. During his visit to the Aviastar Joint-Stock Company at Ulyanovsk, the minister noted that development of military transport aviation is a task that must be tackled in the near future because a large proportion of these planes remained outside Russia after the USSR collapsed. Military experts believe that the Russian Army needs about 100 transport planes of the Tu-124 ("Ruslan") type-- manufactured by Aviastar--as well as the Il-86, for rapid deployment of mobile forces in any region.
