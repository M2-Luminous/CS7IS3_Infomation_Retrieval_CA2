FR941026-0-00004 FR941026-0-00001 The commenter wanted the COLA model to take into account the ``objectively determinable'' costs of remoteness, isolation, and special needs. He cited increased home maintenance, out-of-area college and university costs, and medical expenses as examples of these extra costs. In comments on previous Federal Register notices, many employees identified special ``needs'' they believed were unique to their area. OPM has and is continuing to research many of these issues, including home maintenance, college and university costs, and medical expenses. We plan to include the results of this research in our report to Congress. At present, however, OPM believes the COLA model reasonably and adequately measures cost differences for the vast majority of expenses that Federal employees typically incur. Noting the difficulty of comparing colleges and universities of equal quality, the commenter further proposed that OPM measure the cost of higher education solely in the DC area. He said allowance area costs could be computed by adding to the DC costs the extra expense of out-of-state tuition, room and board, and round-trip air travel between the allowance areas and Washington, DC. Although this approach would address the problem of comparing the cost of an education of like quality, we believe measuring costs in this manner would vastly overstate the costs incurred by most Federal employees in the allowance areas. Measuring costs in this manner could also significantly understate the average cost of college and university education incurred by Federal employees in the DC area. The commenter said items needed only in allowance areas should be priced in the allowance area, but not in DC. OPM is researching the issue of special needs. While there may be consumer requirements unique to living in the allowance areas, there also are consumer requirements unique to living in the Washington, DC, area. For the summer surveys, the model does not address these issues because they are highly subjective, difficult to measure, and vary widely among areas. Instead, the model compares the cost of an item in an allowance area with the cost for the same item in the DC area. OPM believes this is consistent with the settlement of Hector Arana, et al. v. United States, in which the plaintiffs asked OPM to adopt a methodology that compared specified brands, models, and sizes whenever possible. We note, however, that the Senate Appropriations Committee asked OPM to research the issue of items required in the allowance area but not in the Washington, DC, area and include this research in its report to Congress. This OPM is doing. The commenter recommended that OPM add 5 percentage points to all COLA rates to take into account costs that exist but are not objectively determinable. OPM believes intangible factors, such as difficult living conditions, should not be part of the COLA program. There are other programs, such as the post differential program, that compensate Federal employees in such circumstances. OPM believes COLA should compensate employees for measurable differences in living costs. Even if we agreed conceptually with such changes, significant changes in the law, Executive Order, and regulations would be required to allow the adjustment of COLA for these intangible factors. The Senate Appropriations Committee specifically asked OPM to study factors relating to remoteness and isolation and to report to Congress on legislative recommendations on how to calculate COLA's. Therefore, final resolution of these issues must await OPM's report to Congress and subsequent congressional action. The commenter believed employees in the allowance areas saved at a higher rate to afford the down payment for a house or a car or to pay for college/university education. He said OPM should take this into consideration and adjust savings and investments by the overall index for the area. The COLA model uses the same approach to savings and investments as the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses in the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES). That approach accounts for savings and investments made for the purpose of future purchases in the category or component associated with the item to be purchased. For example, savings made for the down payment or purchase of an automobile are accounted for in the private transportation category. Therefore, if automobiles cost more in an allowance area and the purchaser must save more to afford the car, the COLA model already takes this additional savings requirement into account. No additional adjustments are required. On the other hand, the savings and investment category in the Miscellaneous Component covers long-term savings and investments, such as those made for retirement purposes. The category also includes life insurance. For Federal employees, the cost of life insurance and required contributions to a Federal retirement system do not vary by geographic area. Any additional insurance or contributions to the retirement systems are a matter of personal preference. Therefore, it is appropriate to hold the index constant for these items. The commenter objected to trimming high and low values in the housing component and use of trend analyses. The commenter believed housing market price anomalies should be tolerated or that only ``obvious errors or anomalies'' should be eliminated. The purpose of trimming and trend analyses is to stabilize the housing price data from one year to the next. As OPM stated in its response to comments received on an earlier proposed rule (at 59 FR 13846), trimming is essentially a nonparametric technique similar to using the median rather than the average. OPM and Runzheimer considered using the median but rejected it because the limited number of observations obtained in some smaller allowance areas could cause the median to be erratic from one year to the next. Trimming provides stability; and because equal numbers of high and low values are trimmed, no bias is introduced. Eliminating ``obvious anomalies'' would be a more subjective process with a potential for bias.
