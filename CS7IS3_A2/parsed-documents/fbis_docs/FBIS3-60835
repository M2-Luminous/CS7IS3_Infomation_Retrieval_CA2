The source confirmed that these reports were [word indistinct] untrue, and (?consequently) the mass media reports circulated about the issues discussed within this sphere were baseless. As for the Lockerbie issue, the source said that Libya has nothing to say about this issue, particularly [words indistinct] Libya's innocence in it. In connection with the so-called al-Kikhya [Libyan opposition leader who disappeared in Egypt], the source added that Libya has nothing to do with him, and it looks as if he were a victim of accounts settled with (?quarters) of the stray dogs he dealt with. He held foreign nationality, and his connection with Libya was severed years ago. He was not of Libyan origin but from a Turkish family which settled in Libya, and we thought that he had gone back to his country after the establishment of (?people's) power in Libya and after the people started to govern themselves, especially since he was from a family [word indistinct] which controlled the Libyan people [word indistinct].
