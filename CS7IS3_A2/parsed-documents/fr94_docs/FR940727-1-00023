Background EPA issued a proposed rule in the Federal Register of February 3, 1989 (54 FR 5502), in which it announced that the Y-Tex Corp., P.O. Box 1450, 1825 Big Horn Ave., Cody, WY 82414, had requested that the Administrator amend 40 CFR 180.1001(e) by establishing an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance under section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) (21 U.S.C. 346a(e)) for acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer, FD & C Yellow No. 6 aluminum lake, 2-(2'-hydroxy-5'-methylphenyl)benzotriazole and octadecyl 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamate when used as components of ear tags and similar slow-release devices in pesticide formulations applied to animals. One comment was received in response to the proposed rule. The commenter claimed that among the bases for approval of the acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer is an erroneous interpretation of the results of a risk assessment conducted by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). One of the bases for approval listed in the proposed rule under the subheading ``acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer'' references an FDA risk assessment for acrylonitrile monomer and states, ``.␣.␣.␣the worst case exposure to this monomer would result in an upper daily lifetime oncogenic risk of less than 1.2 X 10 &hyph;7 , based upon a daily lifetime consumption of 1,060 grams of soft drinks contained in acrylonitrile/styrene plastic beverage bottles (from which the monomer might be expected to migrate) with acrylonitrile monomer concentration not exceeding 80 ppm.'' The quoted language (49 FR 36635; September 19, 1984) was part of the preamble of a Federal Register document that amended the food additive regulations at 21 CFR 177.1040(c) to add a description of an acrylonitrile/styrene copolymer suitable for use in packaging soft drinks. The commenter noted that the maximum residual acrylonitrile monomer content of a finished article intended for such use is specified in the regulation as 0.10 ppm rather than 80 ppm. The FDA assessment of risk used as a basis of approval was based upon the 0.10-ppm value. In addition, the commenter asserted that the barrier properties of the acrylonitrile/styrene copolymer that is the subject of 21 CFR 177.1040 are such that the migration of the residual acrylonitrile monomer would occur more slowly and to a lesser extent than would be the case for the acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer for which the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance was proposed. For the reasons cited above, the commenter claimed that EPA's citation of the FDA calculation of the lifetime risk from exposure to monomeric acrylonitrile does not support the action proposed. EPA agrees with the comment and in response EPA has decided to reissue a proposal to establish an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for the acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer that includes a revised calculation of lifetime risk from exposure to monomeric acrylonitrile. II. Application of Assessment in Proposed Rulemaking A. Exposure to Acrylonitrile Monomer Data provided by the petitioner regarding the levels of acrylonitrile monomer typically expected to be present in the subject acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer indicate that the concentration does not exceed 1 part per million (ppm). Using this concentration of acrylonitrile monomer and the conditions of use of the acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer in animal ear tags, an estimation of exposure to acrylonitrile monomer resulting from the use of acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer as a component of an animal tag or similar devices was conducted. The following assumptions were incorporated into a ``worst-case'' exposure assessment: 1. The subject acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer contains a residual acrylonitrile monomer concentration of 1 ppm. 2. The copolymer comprises 50% of the weight of the tag. 3. The tag weight does not exceed 15 grams. 4. Each animal wears two tags. 5. The animal weighs 800 pounds (363.2 kilograms). This would correspond to the lower range of weight for beef cattle, the predominant wearers of insecticidal animal tags. 6. All acrylonitrile monomer present in the tags migrates into the animal and is not metabolized and/or excreted. 7. A human diet of 3,000 grams per day consists solely of meat emanating from cattle wearing tags containing acrylonitrile monomer. These ``worst-case'' assumptions produce an estimate of human acrylonitrile monomer dietary consumption of 0.12 microgram per day. B. Toxicity of Acrylonitrile Monomer As described in the previously cited Federal Register document establishing a food-additive regulation for acrylonitrile-styrene copolymer, the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition Cancer Assessment Committee concluded from its quantitative risk assessment that acrylonitrile monomer exposure corresponding to an upper-limit lifetime risk of 10 &hyph;6 , i.e., 1 in 1 million, is about 0.5 to 1.0 microgram per day. C. Extrapolation of Risk for Acrylonitrile Monomer Using the above FDA quantitative risk assessment and the ``worst-case'' exposure estimate, EPA concludes that the upper-limit individual lifetime risk for acrylonitrile monomer resulting from the use of acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer as a component of an animal ear tag is about 1.2 X 10 &hyph;7 to 2.4 X 10 &hyph;7 , or slightly more than 1 in 7 million. Because of the numerous conservative assumptions included in the worst-case exposure estimate, lifetime-averaged individual exposure to acrylonitrile monomer is expected to be significantly less than the estimated exposure and, therefore, the calculated upper-bound risk would be significantly less. III. Additional Bases of Approval In the case of certain chemical substances which are defined as ``polymers,'' the Agency has established a set of criteria which identify categories of polymers that present low risk. These criteria (described in 40 CFR 723.250) identify polymers that are relatively unreactive and stable compared to other chemical substances as well as polymers that typically are not readily absorbed. These properties generally limit a polymer's ability to cause adverse effects. In addition, these criteria exlcude polymers about which little is known. The Agency believes that polymers meeting the criteria noted above will present minimal or no risk. Acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer conforms to the definition of a polymer given in 40 CFR 723.250(b)(11) and meets the following criteria which are used to identify low-risk polymers. 1. The minimum number average molecular weight of acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer is greater than 1,000. Substances with molecular weights greater than 400 are generally not readily absorbed through the intact skin, and substances with molecular weights greater than 1,000 are generally not absorbed through the intact gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Chemicals not absorbed through the skin or GI tract are generally incapable of eliciting a toxic response. 2. Acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer is not a cationic polymer nor is it reasonably expected to become a cationic polymer in a natural aquatic environment. 3. Acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer does not contain less than 32.0 percent by weight of the atomic element carbon. 4. Acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer contains as an integral part of its composition the atomic elements carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen. 5. Acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer does not contain as an integral part of its composition, except as impurities, any elements other than those listed in 40 CFR 723.250(d)(3)(ii). 6. Acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer is not a biopolymer, a synthetic equivalent of a biopolymer, or a derivative or modification of a biopolymer that is substantially intact. 7. Acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer is not manufactured from reactants containing, other than as impurities, halogen atoms or cyano groups. 8. Acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer does not contain reactive functional groups that are intended or reasonably anticipated to undergo further reaction. 9. Acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer is not designed or reasonably anticipated to substantially degrade, decompose, or depolymerize. Based upon the information above and review of its use, EPA has found that, when used in accordance with good agricultural practice, this ingredient is useful and that the establishment of a tolerance is not necessary to protect the public health. Therefore, EPA proposes that the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance be established as set forth below. Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide, under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended, which contains the ingredient listed herein, may request, within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal Register , that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of FFDCA. Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear a notation indicating the document control number, [OPP&hyph;300296]. All written comments filed in response to this petition will be available in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, at the address given above from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 2 of Executive Order 12866. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the Federal Register of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).
