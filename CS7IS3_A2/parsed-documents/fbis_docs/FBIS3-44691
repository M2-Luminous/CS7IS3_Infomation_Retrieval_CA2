Meeting with two visiting U.S. senators, Grachev said that in its security concept of partnership for peace, NATO should take into account the interests of all countries instead of its member states only, the INTERFAX News Agency reported. Russia, which used to lead the Warsaw Pact nations against NATO during the Cold War, has become deeply concerned over the attempts of some of its former partners to join NATO. Russia insisted that NATO should first weaken its role as a political-military bloc. To ease Russia's anxiety, the United States has said that it opposes NATO's immediate acceptance of any East European nation. In his meeting with the U.S. senators, Grachev also said Russia has given up its former promise of not using nuclear weapons first because other nuclear powers have not done so.
