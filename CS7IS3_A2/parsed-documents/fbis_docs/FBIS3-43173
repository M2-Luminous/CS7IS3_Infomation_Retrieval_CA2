Sonmez, who is known for his pipeline research, said that Russia's preference for Novorossiysk Port for both oil and natural gas would put control of the spigots in Russia's hands and cautioned operators and financing institutions to concentrate lobbying activities on avoiding such a possibility. Upon his return from a three-day international conference at Tampa, Florida at which the pipelines were a major topic of debate, Sonmez answered questions about how the Central Asia pipelines will affect regional economic and diplomatic balances and whether Turkey will be able to take advantage of the "golden opportunity" they represent. Sonmez said that Turkmenistan natural gas will help Turkey develop gas-fueled power plants and chemical facilities to meet the increased fertilizer requirement resulting from the irrigation side of the giant Southeast Anatolia (dam and irrigation) Project. Sonmez stated that the gas pipeline will create jobs, bring in $250 to $400 million annually in foreign exchange through transshipment, and produce up to $600 million annually in the export of goods and services, as well as the opportunity to "offset" the cost of gas used. According to Sonmez, four routes have been proposed: (1) Turkmenistan prefers a route to Eastern Anatolia via Iran, to avoid riling that neighbor; (2) Turkey prefers a pipeline under the Caspian Sea to Azerbaijan-Nakhichevan and on to Anatolia, (3) while the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), which will finance the project, has tried to balance Muslim and Christian interests by supporting; a route passing through Armenia from Azerbaijan-Nakhichevan, or; (4) Azerbaijan-Georgia-Anatolia. Sonmez estimated that an oil pipeline from the Caspian to the Mediterranean would carry 40 million tons of crude oil per year, 25 million tons of which would be Azerbaijan oil. The 1,040-km line would intersect the existing Kirkuk-Ceyhan pipeline at Viransehir in Turkey and would cost $1.5 billion. He added that the Caspian- Mediterranean route would benefit Turkey by providing constant foreign exchange from offset and transit earnings and could be built with $400 million in capital and $800 million in credit (numbers as reported). (Istanbul NOKTA 3-9 Oct 93) Sonmez noted, however, that Russia does not favor this route and was denied its preferred route through the Turkish Straits because Turkey would not accept the environmental pollution risk. In addition, Russia wanted Azerbaijan and Central Asian oil piped to Novorossiysk and then shipped to the Turkish port of Samsun. A pipeline would be built from Samsun to join the existing Kirikkale- Ceyhan line, perhaps including Sile and Kiyikoy which flank the Straits.

The republic's prime minister, Muhammad Sabirof, said that Tatarstan wants to develop economic relations with Turkey and that it will sell war industry products on a commodity exchange basis. The helicopters sale represents the first realization of this policy, according to a report datelined Kazan. However, Sabirof said that the Turks are not making the necessary effort for trade, that they had sent poor quality goods to Kazan, and that "we had to cancel a recent exhibition." On a different note, Sabirof also said that Tatar geological experts believe that rich oil deposits exist in Anatolia and are doing oil exploration in Turkey.

(Istanbul DUNYA 6 Oct 93) Last Word on "Turkish"-"Turkic" Quandary A column in Turkish daily MILLIYET cites comments by professor Nadir Devlet on the ongoing debate over whether to use "Turkish" or Turkic" in reference to the CIS Muslim states. In Devlet's view, with the republics now tending to pull away from Turkey, perhaps the Turks have been "presumptuous" and "patronizing" in reducing the republics' languages to the status of Turkish dialects and that, to preserve the bridge between them, they should use the term used by the CIS Muslim states themselves-- "Turkic." Hasan Pulur published Dr. Devlet's comments in his regular column in an attempt to "lay the question to rest."
