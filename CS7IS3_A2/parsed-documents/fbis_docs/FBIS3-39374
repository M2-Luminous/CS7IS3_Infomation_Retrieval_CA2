He was awarded his daily round of applause, this time in Perugia. He discussed programs and alliances, and made no secret of his optimism, pointing to the results of opinion polls. "Forza Italia's success," Urbani enthused, "proves in my mind that there was a huge gap in the center of the Italian political landscape." [Preziosi] What about Martinazzoli [Italian Popular Party, PPI, secretary]? [Urbani] I hope he finds the role he seems to be looking for . Of course electoral trends are little puzzling at the moment. [Preziosi] Your decision to form an alliance with [League Secretary Bossi] and [National Alliance coordinator] Fini was also a little puzzling. How do you answer such criticism? [Urbani] This is a delicate moment in our country's history. I think that in the past few years important changes have taken place in the Northern League and the MSI [Italian Social Movement -- now National Alliance], as well as in other parties and movements. I prefer to encourage these changes rather than highlight past mistakes. [Preziosi] The League in the North, the former MSI in the South: It looks rather like a pincer. Could this embrace not prove lethal for Forza Italia? [Urbani] I would not say so because, judging by the electoral trends expressed by the Italian people, we are stronger than both of them. I am afraid of other things. [Preziosi] Such as? [Urbani] The immense problems Italy has right now. Of course we cannot kid ourselves, after what we have gone through in the past two years, that our country will become like Britain's Westminster in a matter of a fortnight. I think we are all called upon to make our contribution. [Preziosi] At the forthcoming elections for example. [Urbani] This election is an important test, because if we end up in the hands of the wrong surgeons, we will draw further away from rather than closer to good government. [Preziosi] You are already tipped as one of the future Berlusconi government's key ministers. [Urbani] Those are merely journalistic predictions. The formation of governments will be decided by votes and majorities.
