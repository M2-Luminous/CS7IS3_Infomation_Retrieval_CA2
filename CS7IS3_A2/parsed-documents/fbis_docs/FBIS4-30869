He gave his assurance that our country intends to persist in its views regarding its heritage from World War II and expressed belief that the European Union will support us in this. He warned that, if Italy continues to exert pressure upon our country in the future, Slovenia will demand compensation for the time of occupation by Fascist Italy and protection for approximately 100,000 Slovenes in Italy. He did not ascribe any major significance to a recent Italian move, when at the Conference on Stability in Europe Slovenia was cut from the list of countries that are potential EU members at the insistence of the Rome authorities.
