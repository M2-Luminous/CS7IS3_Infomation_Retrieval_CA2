FR940505-2-00139 FR940505-2-00099 It is a basic principle of fire protection that the ability of a person to evacuate and survive a fire is strictly dependent upon two conditions: (1) The severity or magnitude of the fire, and (2) The time of exposure to the fire. In a motor vehicle fire situation, the threat to life is the inhalation of smoke and hot gases (asphyxiation) and exposure to the heat of the fire (burns). The design of most motor vehicles ensures that unimpaired occupants can evacuate quickly. Therefore, the goal of fire protection efforts must focus on reducing the severity of the fire. The severity of a fire is determined by its physical size, the quantity of available fuel, the total quantity of heat released, and the rate at which that heat is released. A complete assessment of the fire threat must include an assessment of all of these factors. Limiting the flame spread rate of a motor vehicle's combustible interior materials, as measured and specified by FMVSS 302, does not suffice for a complete fire hazard assessment. The 0.06 lbs (sic) (30.2 grams) of webbing material used in Fisher-Price car seats is an insufficient quantity of material to produce a potentially lethal fire threat to the occupants of a motor vehicle. Therefore, the time available for an occupant to safely evacuate and survive a motor vehicle fire is not influenced to any degree by a material, such as the molded webbing, which comprises a mere 0.019% of the total combustible material in a motor vehicle's interior (emphasis original). Fisher-Price argued that: A remedial action campaign would not further the purposes of the Traffic and Vehicle Safety Act (the ``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 1391 et seq. (1982), in promoting the marketing of safe motor vehicles and their accessories, such as child car seats. The dominant theme of the regulations propounded in furtherance of the Act is that accessories such as car seats be safe; indeed, the stated basis in the Act for the granting of an exemption from the remedial action requirements of the Act is that the noncompliance would have only an inconsequential impact on the safety of motor vehicles. 15 U.S.C. 1417; 49 CFR 556.1, 556.2. Child safety advocates, automobile safety advocates and the NHTSA all acknowledge the negative impact of a remedial action campaign based on a technical noncompliance with a particular regulation that does not, as a practical matter, have any effect on the safety of the occupants of a motor vehicle. The NHTSA itself has reported that many child car seat owners ignore car seat recalls that they do not view as posing a serious problem or threat. See Transcript, ``The 1993 Child Passenger Safety Symposium Public Comment Session On Child Safety Seat Recalls,'' March 14, 1993. Fisher-Price also argued that a negative consequence of a remedial action campaign resulting from what it feels is a technical noncompliance, would be a general lack of confidence in child car seats. It feels that there is a danger that parents of young children might discontinue the use of child car seats out of concern that child car seats are not safe, in spite of the fact that all states currently have laws on their books mandating the use of such seats for specified child groups. Fisher-Price concluded that: The tests performed by Messrs. Kennedy and Shanley clearly demonstrate that a noncompliance with the requirements of FMVSS 302 as it applies to the molded webbing used in the Fisher-Price car seats is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety. The empirical data gathered from these tests establish that, to the extent a child occupant of a car seat faces a risk of injury from fire, that risk arises as a result of the clothing the child wears, not from the flammability of the molded webbing material. In addition, the webbing constitutes only an inconsequential percentage (0.019%) of the total combustible material located in the interior of the average motor vehicle and therefore has no impact on the fire safety of a motor vehicle or on the ability of an individual to safely evacuate a burning motor vehicle. Of equal import, research has revealed no reported instance in which the shoulder belt webbing of a child car seat has been the material first ignited in a motor vehicle fire or in which a single child was burned as a result of a fire originating in the shoulder belt webbing of a child car seat. No comments were received on the petition. NHTSA has given careful consideration to the petitioner's arguments. There is no disagreement that a noncompliance has occurred. Molded webbing as used in completed child restraint systems has burned at a rate that significantly exceeds the maximum limit imposed by the standard. The average burn rate in the two initial tests and one retest conducted by NHTSA is 4.67 inches. In the twelve tests on molded webbing conducted by AlliedSignal, there were only four tests in which the burn rate was less than 4 inches. The average burn rate for the eight failing tests was 4.71 inches (and for all twelve tests, 4.21 inches). NHTSA believes that flammability requirements for child restraints should be stringently adhered to for the following reasons. The test requirement of not more than 4 inches a minute is justified by the need ``to prevent injury to occupants from rapidly spreading interior fires, to allow sufficient time for the driver to stop the vehicle, and, if necessary, for occupants to leave it before injury occurs'' (36 FR 10817). This is even more critical in the case of child restraints as a typical small child is not capable of exiting a vehicle without help. Therefore, some additional time is required for another person to remove the child. Moreover, the child most often is in the rear seat and the adult is in front, adding to the time factor. Finally, because the webbing rests against the child's body, noncompliant webbing has great potential for injuring the child if ignited. In issuing FMVSS No. 302 in 1971 (36 FR 289), the agency cited matches, cigarettes or short circuits in interior wiring as examples of sources for fires occurring in the interior of vehicles. The agency believes that there are situations where the straps could become ignited. One example is children in the back seat of a car, playing with matches, a cigarette lighter, or other ignition source near a child restrained in a Fisher-Price seat. In point of fact, had the tests been conducted under real life circumstances, the results could have been worse. Webbing samples are tested horizontally, but webbing is worn vertically. If a fire begins at the bottom of webbing, it will travel upward at a faster rate than it would in a horizontal placement. The petitioner attaches importance to its arguments that there is a higher risk of injury to a child through ignition of its clothing rather than from the webbing material, that the webbing constitutes only a very small percentage of the total combustible material located in the interior compartment, and that there is no reported instance in which injuries are attributable to ignition of shoulder belt webbing. NHTSA does not consider these arguments well taken. In any motor vehicle fire, whether or not involving children, there is likely to be higher risk to an occupant from ignition of clothing than from ignition of interior components. That is because Standard No. 302 (and Standard No. 213) does not set fire retardant standards for clothing. The aim of NHTSA's standards is to reduce the likelihood of ignition of interior components, or to limit their burn rate if they ignite, and this is to be accomplished within the parameters of NHTSA's jurisdiction over motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment. With respect to child restraints, it is important to inhibit or delay combustion so that, as NHTSA has noted above, the driver can pull to the side of the road, stop, exit the vehicle, and remove the child from it. Although the chance of ignition of shoulder webbing may not be as great as other components of child seating systems that present a broader fabric face for flame to travel across, all components must comply with the standard, and it is not impracticable for manufacturers to assure that they do so. The statement that consumers ignore recalls because of their number and frequency is unsubstantiated. Further, NHTSA views it equally unlikely that, because of campaigns, consumers would conclude that child restraints are unsafe and decline to use them. Indeed, the opposite is more likely the case. Responses to safety notifications depends on factors including the type of noncompliance or defect, the type and extent of the notification campaign, media coverage, and the efforts of manufacturers. Future campaigns are more likely to be effective than past ones. FMVSS No. 213 has been amended to provide for the registration of child restraints. The purpose of the program is to increase the effectiveness of campaigns to recall child seats. It requires manufacturers to take steps that will increase their ability to inform owners of particular child restrains about problems in these restraints and by encouraging owners to register their child seats. For the foregoing reasons, the petitioner has failed to meet its burden of persuasion that the noncompliance herein described is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety, and its petition is denied.
