FR940831-1-00014 FR940831-1-00004 OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the August 12, 1993, Federal Register (58 FR 42903) and invited public comment on its adequacy. The public comment period closed on September 7, 1993. By letter dated April 1, 1994, OSM informed the WVDEP of more than 100 probable deficiencies in the proposed amendment (Administrative Record No. WV&hyph;916). The WVDEP and OSM held meetings on April 25, May 5, June 20, and August 5, 1994, in an effort to resolve these issues. During this time, WVDEP submitted to OSM technical studies, policy statements, legal opinions and explanations in support of the amendment. OSM provided WVDEP technical evaluations of the proposed amendment completed by OSM's Eastern Support Center. These documents and a summary of the meetings, including proposed resolutions of the issues, have been added to the Administrative Record (see Record Nos. WV&hyph;916 through 933) and are available for review at the addresses listed above. In order to resolve several issues, the WVDEP submitted as a revision to the June 28, 1993, amendment, portions of House Bill 4065 which was passed by the West Virginia legislature on March 12, 1994 (Administrative Record No. WV 933). House Bill 4065 concerns the establishment of the Division of Environmental Protection and the Surface Mine Board, and revisions to the Abandoned Mine Lands Act and Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Act. It includes the following articles in chapters 22 and 22B: ยง22&hyph;1&hyph;4 through 8 . These proposed revisions create the Office of Mining and Reclamation within the Department of Environmental Protection. ยง22&hyph;2 . These proposed revisions provide for the collection of abandoned mine land reclamation fees until September 30, 2004. They also represent WVDEP's response to required amendments at 30 CFR 948.26. ยง22&hyph;3 . These proposed revisions revise the funding criteria under the Small Operator Assistance Program, clarify that surface mining bonds are penal in nature and that, upon forfeiture, the entire bond is forfeited, and clarify that no mining permits may be issued when the applicant or the operator has a demonstrated pattern of willful violations in West Virginia or of other State or Federal programs implementing SMCRA. ยง22B&hyph;1&hyph;4 through 12 . These proposed revisions create the Surface Mine Board and establish provisions under which it operates. III. Public Comment Procedures OSM is reopening the comment period on the West Virginia program amendment to provide the public an opportunity to reconsider the adequacy of the proposed amendment in light of the revisions in statutory language and documents that have been added to the Administrative Record. In accordance with 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed amendment satisfies the applicable program criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the amendment is deemed adequate, it will become part of the West Virginia program. Written Comments Written comments should be specific, pertain only to the issues proposed in this rulemaking, and include explanations in support of the commenter's recommendations. Comments received after the time indicated under `` DATES '' or at locations other than the Charleston Field Office will not necessarily be considered in the final rulemaking or included in the Administrative Record. IV. Procedural Determinations Executive Order 12866 This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review). Executive Order 12778 The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice Reform) and has determined that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15 and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met. National Environmental Policy Act No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA [30 U.S.C. 1292(d)] provides that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)). Paperwork Reduction Act This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 et seq .). Regulatory Flexibility Act The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq .). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon corresponding Federal regulations for which an economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the corresponding Federal regulations.
