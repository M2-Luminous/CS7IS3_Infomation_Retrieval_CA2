Not many other trips will ever be so multi-faceted and multi-purpose as this one, which took Han to the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia, although overall themes were evident--mustering support for Seoul's bid to grab a non-permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council and explaining the South's position on the North Korean nuclear situation, for instance. Another Asian country, Sri Lanka, is a competitor for the UNSC seat for 1996-97. Bearing that in mind, Han tried to build a consensus during his visit to put up a single candidate from the region for the seat. On the North Korean nuclear issue, Han tried to create a balanced view by emphasizing that the matter concerns the international community and thus should be dealt with from a global perspective. Indonesia is the land where these objectives were most highlighted. Jakarta, current chairman of the Non-aligned Movement (NAM), serves as North Korea's diplomatic base for Southeast Asia. Han's talks with President Suharto and Foreign Minister Ali Alatas were crucial not only in forging close ties with NAM but in getting the movement to note the global impact of the North Korean nuclear row. On Seoul's bid for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council, Alatas said his country "had sympathy" for South Korean efforts. Jakarta, most likely to assume the non-permanent seat for 1995-96, could assist Seoul's bid the following year by building an Asian consensus on competition between South Korea and Sri Lanka. During other parts of his visit, Han mostly filled in the blanks of bilateral relations while noting the roles each country would play in furthering South Korea's relations with the region. On a bilateral level, Han proposed to the Philippines that they establish a "special partnership" covering economic, cultural and social sectors and received a favorable response. At the regional level, Manila will be the coordinator for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) from July 1994 for two years, acting as a go-between in Korea-ASEAN relations during the period. South Korean officials say Han's visit will work positively in enhancing such coordination. In Bangkok, the bilateral focus was on rectifying the trade imbalance in Seoul's favor and activating South Korean investment in Thailand. The two countries are expected to open trade ministers' talks later this year. Ties with Bangkok are already secured at the regional level, with Thailand hosting an ASEAN meeting July 25. The regional importance of South Korea-Thailand relations will grow as Bangkok attempts to expand ASEAN by including the three Indochinese countries and Myanmar. In Vietnam, South Korea sought to establish a foothold in the last remaining Asian economic frontier. Han confirmed Seoul's pledge of 50 million dollars from its Economic Development and Cooperation fund (EDCF) and 10 million dollars more in aid. He took it into his own hands to resolve the bitter past with Vietnam, recalling how more than 320,000 Korean soldiers fought on Saigon's side during the Vietnam war. "There was damage in our past relations," he told Vietnamese President Le Duc An in what were the most conciliatory words yet uttered by a South Korean foreign minister. "We must overcome it by establishing forward-looking ties." Han called his Asian trip an example of "quiet diplomacy" -- the kind that doesn't require immediate results but long-term efforts to look anew at Asia. His aides intentionally avoided setting a prior agenda and format for Han's talks with the leaders of the Philippines, Thailand and Indonesia to allow for free discussion on whatever they saw fit. Han's 10-day journey to Asia is expected to paint a new image of South Korea as it searches for a more visible role in the international community.
