The government and Bundestag will follow suit sometime in the future. Do you think Germany will change once it is governed from Berlin? [Weizsaecker] No, there is no Berlin policy. There is only a German policy, which the move might only change insofar as the German unification process is deepened and completed more quickly. [DIE WOCHE] The Americans are already talking about the end of the Bonn Republic and the beginning of the Berlin Republic. They obviously want to point out a difference. Do you not see this difference? [Weizsaecker] No. The great achievements of the Bonn Republic will be kept entirely. The name Bonn is associated with our development to become a reliable, democratic society internally and a predictable partner situated in the center of the continent for the outside world. When the Americans talk about a "Berlin Republic" they are thinking of their own way, going from a victorious world power fighting against the Germans to cooperation and friendship with this former adversary. It was the attitude of the Berlin population during the 1947/48 blockade that made them first feel respect for the Germans. Berlin has not lost its good reputation in the United States. It does not make any difference for our future policy. If we stayed in Bonn we would have to have an equally active policy in the east. And, just as we have learned to do in Bonn, we will keep realizing in Berlin that this eastern policy will only be successful if it is conducted in close cooperation with our Western neighbors, especially France. Cooperation with our neighbors in the East will be all the more successful if it is done with, or via, Paris. [DIE WOCHE] Are Poland and other Eastern countries to be included in the European Union [EU]? [Weizsaecker] As a first stage, the European Union has concluded association agreements with these states, opening up a clear perspective for later membership. Germany has been a driving force in this process, and quite rightly. But this does not mean that Germany is returning to a see-saw policy between West and East or that it is even trying to secure spheres of influence and economic monopolies in the East and southeast. After the end of the Cold War, we are living in a new era of European policy. When Jean Monnet spoke of Europe, he was not thinking of a rift going right through the continent. He did not want to allocate the name "Europe" to the Western Europeans alone. Rather, he meant a complete and joint Europe, such as the one that we solemnly included as objective and task in the preamble of the 1957 Treaties of Rome. The Baltic states, Poland, the Czech and Slovak Republics, Hungary, and other nations are part of Europe just as the existing members of the European Union are. We all have to get used to this new situation. It is in our German interest to get this across to our partners in the European Union. [DIE WOCHE] But right now there are tensions with the French. Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel seems to have made himself unpopular by being a bit too outspoken in the latest membership negotiations. These things irritate our neighbors. Problems like this occur as regularly as the tides. [Weizsaecker] Of course, there are differences of opinion sometimes. This happened when the Gulf war broke out and at the beginning of the civil war in the former Yugoslavia. In the GATT negotiations we held different opinions at first as well. But the important thing is the quality of the complete historic change that took place in French-German relations. Discussions now end with friendly agreements on a common policy. This was the case in the final stages of the GATT round, as well as in the preparations for a new policy on Bosnia. But it is the same as with all friendships: Tact, consideration, and understanding for the other's worries are absolutely necessary. In the end, these qualities best serve one's own interests. [DIE WOCHE] The tensions between Bonn and Paris are partly due to a conflict we already had 10 years ago. June sees the 50th anniversary of the allied forces' landing in Normandy. The Americans, British, and French will go to the Channel coast for this. The Germans have not been invited. How are you going to explain this to a young person in Europe? After half a century we are not even able to celebrate the victory over tyranny together. [Weizsaecker] Back on 8 May 1985, I said that we have to respect the completely different fate each nation associates with the end of the war. Symbolic gestures of a grown friendship between nations are helpful, and they are all the more convincing the more spontaneously and naturally they come and the less they are the result of a well-considered calculation. [DIE WOCHE] The past keeps catching up with us. Reaction to the film "Schindler's List" speaks for itself. Do we still need these impulses from outside to discuss the difficult German history? [Weizsaecker] The holocaust is beyond any comprehensible description. I have great respect for efforts trying to document it. Spielberg has tried to describe individual fates. The director does not shy away from using the means of art, acting. This does not make the film a historic document, but it makes individual fates more tangible and comprehensible. I think that we should be grateful for the film. It can teach us something that at least gets us near understanding the incomprehensible. It will always remain difficult. If we do not want others to keep reminding us of the past we would be well-advised not to suppress the past. [DIE WOCHE] This is why we want to come back to the move from Bonn to Berlin. What is the starting point of a Berlin Republic? Shall it be based on traditions? Prussia perhaps? [Weizsaecker] There is no Prussian political tradition that is relevant to the present. As you will know, Prussia came to an end in three different ways: formally, by the Allies at the end of World War II; before that, by the Papen government in 1932; and in the view of most of the real Prussians, in Versailles in 1871 when the Prussian king was proclaimed German emperor. [DIE WOCHE] Which of these opinions do you share? [Weizsaecker] My family comes from Wurttemberg, not from Prussia. But I grew up in Berlin, and I think that the 1871 theory makes the most sense in historic, cultural, and human terms. Today, we can discuss Prussia quite unemotionally. I am pleased to hear the French president speak with interest and respect of the historic achievements of the great Prussian reformers in the early 19th century. He is not thinking of militarism, but of the reforms by Stein and Humboldt in the fields of democracy and education. He considers it a mistake of 19th century France not to have recognized the Prussian qualities and learned from them at the time. When we had a great Prussia exhibition in Berlin 12 years ago, the contributions by historians from France, Britain, the United States, and even Poland were more positive, open-minded, and unbiased than the German contributions. [DIE WOCHE] This is the fifth year after reunification. The image the Germans have abroad has not necessarily improved. There is increasing concern over a new German self-confidence. What is the reason for this? [Weizsaecker] Considering our population figures, our comparative economic strength, and our geographical position, this is quite understandable. This makes it all the more important to clearly recognize the interests of unified Germany and voice them without fear. [DIE WOCHE] Yet, our neighbors can easily mistake this for a new German nationalism. [Weizsaecker] It is our task to deal with this misunderstanding. I remember the debate on the West's assistance to the eastern reform states. We Germans treated this with more urgency than the other Western states. Then the Americans, French, and English said: "If this is so important to you, why don't you help these states?" When we started doing that we were blamed for seeking monopolies for our economic interests in the East. In fact, the eastern reform states need much more assistance than Germany can give. [DIE WOCHE] If a German mentions German interests, he is often given funny looks. The French and British talk about their countries' interests much more freely. We do not really dare do so. I suppose this has something to do with our past. [Weizsaecker] As always, honesty is the best policy. The English especially quite often say: "If you Germans do not talk of your interests, this makes us all the more suspicious. Every country has its interests, including Germany. So, please tell us what your interests are." [DIE WOCHE] What are the German interests? [Weizsaecker] Every country is formed by its geographical position. Our position is: central, surrounded by new neighbors. An island nation starts out from a completely different position. German interests want to overcome the employment crisis, conduct a long-term energy supply policy, provide open borders for trade, and keep the environment fit to live in. Our interests are stability in our country and around us, open borders, and contributions toward the survival of our planet. We cannot solve any of these problems on our own. It is our national interest to promote European cooperation with all possible means. [DIE WOCHE] Unfortunately, the Germans are wary of Europe at the moment. [Weizsaecker] I do not think so. [DIE WOCHE] All opinion polls indicate that. [Weizsaecker] What are the questions they put? A more detailed analysis shows that the Germans do not have a basic dislike of the European process. There is, however, opposition against the strict regulations of European authorities and councils that involve many problems for local politicians and some professions in agriculture, in the villages, towns, and laender. Also, Germany lacks a large-scale open debate on Europe. We are controlled by a Weimar nightmare that makes us still think that elements of plebiscite would harm our democracy. I consider this to be unfounded faintheartedness. Of course, referendums are often exciting processes. We were quite excited ourselves when a referendum on Europe was held in France and two in Denmark. But today, people there are generally better informed about Europe than we Germans. Why? Because they had a serious and big debate about the subject before us. [DIE WOCHE] They talked about Maastricht when we were discussing reunification. [Weizsaecker] That is right. But unification of our own country is inseparably linked with European developments. And to understand what Europe is all about, many citizens are not content with having their say reduced to putting crosses on lists of parties standing for a European Parliament that still has very little power. I certainly do not advocate replacing our representative democracy by a direct one. But there are sensible middle courses that can strengthen people's need for information and codetermination in the interest of the entire state. [DIE WOCHE] Can Europe help us with the complicated questions we are facing, such as growing unemployment? [Weizsaecker] By all means. We cannot do without that. At the moment, the unemployment rate is 12 percent in France and 10 percent in Germany. In the OECD countries, 36 million people are out of work. It is no coincidence that the recent meeting of the seven major industrial countries in Detroit did for the first time not discuss foreign and security policy, nor fiscal or monetary problems, but unemployment. We have to get used to a different agenda on a national, continental, and global level. It is no longer strategic questions of the Cold War that have priority, but economic and social developments, migration, and the environment. The United Nations, too, must pay more attention to these issues. The 1945 founding fathers of the Security Council had an almost exclusively military definition of security. Today, security is jeopardized by economic weaknesses, hunger, social unrest, human rights violations, and ecological imbalances. These problems facing the coexistence of nations and the survival of our planet earth need to be put on the Security Council's agenda and must not be left to comparatively powerless special organizations. [DIE WOCHE] Should we increase our commitment in the Security Council for this reason? [Weizsaecker] Yes. [DIE WOCHE] Is it wise, though, to take on new commitments? [Weizsaecker] Yes. Anybody who wants to have more influence, has to take on more responsibility. We do not qualify for a permanent seat in the Security Council by thinking in terms of prestige, but by presenting constructive suggestions. This is not idealistic noble-mindedness, but realizing our interests.
