It is estimated that the province has coal deposits of 22.9 billion tons and hydropower resources of 71.16 million kw, ranking second in the country, and only five percent of these resources have been explored. At present, the province is building hydropower stations along the Lancang and Jinsha Rivers. By now, two generating units of 500,000 kw have been put into operation along the Lancang River. Eight other stations with a total generating capacity of 15.2 million kw are now under construction. According to Yao Qunqin, an engineer at the Kunming Hydropower Surveying and Design Institute, all eight power stations along the Lancang River will be finished by 2020. Along the Jinsha River, 19 cascade hydropower stations with a total generating capacity of 75 million kw are also planned to be built in the next century. The province also plans to build several new thermal power plants and enlarge existing ones. Some German and Australian investors have shown interest in cooperating with the province. Yao said that the province will become the country's largest electricity producer by 2020, supplying more than 80 billion kwh of electricity every year to southern and eastern Chinese provinces and cities.
