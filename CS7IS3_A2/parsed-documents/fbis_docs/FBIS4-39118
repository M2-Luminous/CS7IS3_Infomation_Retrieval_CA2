At the same time the situation of the withdrawal of the troops has become very complicated and contradictory. On one hand the Russian authorities are trying to do everything to maintain their military presence in Estonia while on the other hand a very slow withdrawal process is still going on simultaneously. In order to maintain its military presence, the Russian side has further strengthened its attempts to relate the withdrawal of the troops with other issues, for example the granting of special rights to military pensioners and enhancing the accusations against Estonia of the alleged violence of human rights. While still avoiding the announcement of the deadline and timetable of the withdrawal of its troops, the Russian side is trying to accuse Estonia of the failure in Estonian-Russian negotiations so far. Russia is still presenting claims which can only be interpreted as interference into the internal affairs of the Republic of Estonia (the Law on Citizenship, the Language Law etc.). All this prevents the establishment of the good-neighbourly relations between the two states and confirms that in the political life of Russia, imperial ambitions to restore the sphere of influence of the former Soviet Union still play a very important role. During May the Estonian side was able to take over only 3 objects: the depots in Arukuela in Harju county which formerly belonged to the navy, the depot of the boatswain's equipment at 6 Lootsi Street and the supply depot at 14 Lootsi Street in Tallinn. According to available information, preparations for transfer are going on at 13 objects in all, the transfer of which is planned for June. Among these, Naissaar where all the sea mines are either destroyed or withdrawn, and the former garrison of the radio intelligence station of the National Security Committee in Harju county in Vana-Aaviku should be noted. In the navy ammunition and explosives depot located next to residential area of Rhoismaee in Tallinn, which was visited by Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs representatives and the special commission of the Tallinn Rescue Service, only 1,000 tons out of the former 5,500 tons of ammunition is left. 20-25 wagons would suffice for removing the remainder. The Russian Army still holds 114 sites and single objects in the territory of Estonia. 86 of these are in Tallinn and 28 in Harju County. The largest of these are described below. In land forces: The 144th motorized rifle division. Personnel estimated at about 1,000 men of whom about 700 are officers and ensigns. Besides that, the officers who have remained behind from the troops already withdrawn as well as the re-enlisted military men are also accounted to the personnel of this division. The regular soldiers leaving the division are being replaced by Russian citizens living in Estonia. In addition, Russian citizens from both Estonia and Russia who have already finished their service, as well as unemployed officers and re-enlisted military men are serving in the division as sergeants and soldiers on a contractual basis. The wives of officers have been employed in offices and logistical jobs. The main duty of the motorized rifle regiment of Klooga is the defence of Aemari airport. Because of that, the armament -- the armoured personnel carriers -- has not yet been taken away. The regiment may leave after the transfer of the airport to Estonia. In naval forces: In the Russian naval units in Tallinn, Paldiski, Aemari and elsewhere in Harju county there are about 1,400 - 1,500 military men in all. At Tallinn naval base there still remain the headquarters, the headquarters of the 94th mine sweepers' brigade in the Mine Harbour, the 55th mine sweepers' unit (2 mine sweepers) and logistical units. On the whole, there are still about 400 seamen in Tallinn. As most of the officers and other military men are not in uniform while on the territory of Russian military objects, it has become difficult to determine their exact number. At the 93rd naval training centre of Paldiski there are currently about 890 and at Aemari airport 100 - 150 Russian military men. About 100 men serve in several smaller service and logistical units and depots. On the whole, about 2,400-2,500 military men are serving in the military units of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation located on the territory of Estonia. In addition, it is estimated that about 500-1,000 have been demobilized or left behind in Estonia. Work on the dismantlement of the Paldiski nuclear reactors, which, during the negotiations was planned for the beginning of April, has been practically stopped by the Russian side. Apparently experts and medical workers have been given leave until July. If this is true, the withdrawal of the fuel rods will not be carried out before July. There are only 92 days left before the final deadline of the withdrawal of the Russian troops proposed by Russia -- August 31 this year. Considering the number of the remaining troops and the lack of technical obstacles, complete withdrawal by this date is still possible. In the present situation where the ships, technology and equipment of the naval forces are being withdrawn more or less constantly, but the withdrawal of the 144th motorized rifle division is being delayed, one could suppose that the intent is to delay the withdrawal of these units with their armament and equipment up to the last moment in order to get more concessions from Estonia. It is also possible that some military objects might not be transferred to Estonian control by August 31 although the armament will be removed. A positive conclusion still depends greatly on active support for Estonia from other nations and international organizations.
