FR940817-0-00041 FR940817-0-00016 Because this rule only corrects omissions and other errors or makes clarifications of intent to an existing set of regulations for which full prior notice and opportunity for comment have been given, no useful purpose would be served by providing prior notice and opportunity for comment for this rule. Accordingly, under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) it is unnecessary to provide such notice and opportunity for comment. All but one provision of this rule impose no new requirements on anyone subject to these regulations and many provisions remove or relieve restrictions. Accordingly, under 5 U.S.C. 553(d), they may be made immediately effective. Section 651.9(a)(14) adds a new prohibition which is effective 30 days from the date of filing with the Office of the Federal Register. This rule is exempt from OMB review under E.O. 12866.
