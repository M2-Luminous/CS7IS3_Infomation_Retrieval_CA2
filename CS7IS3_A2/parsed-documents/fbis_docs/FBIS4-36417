Some families and innocent children were victims of this shelling. Dr. Sayf Sayil praised the high morale of the citizens and their persistence and readiness to resist in the face of the conspirators on the security, stability, and welfare of the people. In this connection he called for the necessity of organizing the popular resistance to protect our beautiful city against the conspiracies of the enemies. He said: We will not allow Aden to be occupied, no matter what. He emphasized that the citizens of the capital, Aden, are considered to come from all the villages and regions of Yemen and that going to the resistance fronts reflects the real pattern of unity of the sons of the Yemeni people. In the context of his talk with the citizens of the sons of Dar Sa'd, Dr. Sayf Sayil indicated that the inhabitants, men and women, all of them joined the Armed Forces to defend Aden. He said that this mad war had targeted the Yemeni people, whether on a human, economic or military scale. The instigators and causers of this war will be cursed by history, he said, adding that the will of the people is stronger than the will of the crazy adventurous rulers. Victory will be only with the people, he said.
