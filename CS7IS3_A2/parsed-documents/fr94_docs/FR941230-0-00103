FR941230-0-00103 FR941230-0-00019 • Rules 901(d) and 902(g) of Regulation S&hyph;T. Since mandated electronic filing began in April 1993, filers have been required to furnish to the Commission a paper copy of each electronic filing made during the first year following phase-in. This rule was adopted to implement Section 35A(d)(3) of the Exchange Act. 74 Since its proposal in 1992, filers have characterized the requirement as burdensome. In response, the Commission proposed reducing the paper submission requirement so that filers could satisfy their paper copy obligations by furnishing a paper copy of their first electronic filing only. Four commenters addressed the issue. Three supported the reduction, characterizing the paper submission requirement as ``wasteful'' and ``unnecessary.'' One commenter argued that the format of electronic filings is not as desirable to read as copies of paper documents, implying that electronic filings are not suitable alternatives to paper filings. While it is true that electronic filings often are not as aesthetically pleasing as typeset paper versions, the content of the filing, not its typeface, is what is of interest to investors. Furthermore, this argument carries little weight against reducing the paper copy requirement, since filers may satisfy such requirement by furnishing a paper printout of the electronic filing. 74 15 U.S.C. 78 ll (d)(3). In light of the comments to the proposal, and in connection with the six-month evaluation of the EDGAR system, the Commission has reviewed the paper copy requirement and procedures. As stated in the report, the EDGAR system is reliable, provides a suitable alternative to written and printed filings, and provides information as effectively and efficiently for filers, users and disseminators as the written or printed counterpart. 75 Consequently, the requirement has been modified, as proposed, to require new electronic filers to furnish to the Commission one paper copy of their first electronic filing only. 76 Pursuant to a commenter's suggestion, the paper copy rule also is being clarified to state that persons making third party filings, such as proxy materials or beneficial ownership reports, with respect to an electronic registrant also are required to submit a paper copy with their first electronic filing only. 75 See Exchange Act Section 35A(d)(3)(B) [15 U.S.C. 78 ll (d)(3)(B)], which permits a reduction of the paper copy requirement if these elements are established. 76 The requirement to place a legend on the top of the paper copy has been modified and retained; the rules also have been modified to require the copy to be sent to the Commission's Operations Center in Alexandria, Virginia, as is currently the practice. All filers that have submitted a paper copy of at least one electronic filing before the effective date of this amendment may cease furnishing paper copies of electronic filings made on or after the effective date. The Commission solicited comment about whether the six business day period for submission of the paper copy should be shortened or lengthened. Commenters did not feel strongly about this issue; consequently, no time period changes have been adopted. • Rule 902(e) of Regulation S&hyph;T. The amendments clarify the limited exception contained in Rule 902(e) of Regulation S&hyph;T 77 for definitive filings by investment companies under Rule 497 of the Securities Act, to mandated electronic filing. 77 17 CFR 232.902(e).
