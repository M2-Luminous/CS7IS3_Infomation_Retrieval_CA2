For the first time, the U.S. President has publicly come out against the view held by Congress, the media, and the American people. Just like the French and British authorities, on Wednesday, 25 May, he stood up to this "very simplistic idea." At the same time, in Paris, Francois Mitterrand was once again explaining to the government the reasons why he is opposed to any lifting of the embargo -- in substance, because he does not want to exacerbate the war. At the same time, too, on the banks of Lake Annecy, new negotiations started to try and persuade Muslims, Serbs, and Croats to accept a territorial compromise and put an end to the conflict. In reality, leaving aside the media-oriented or political ambitions of the various participants in the debate in France, a real race is under way in which morality is taking something of a back seat. This is a race between obtaining a political settlement, by its nature unfair, for the partitioning of Bosnia, or aggravating the conflict. If the negotiators, currently in Talloires and due to move to Geneva on 13 June, do manage to impose a settlement on the three parties, then the issue of the embargo will naturally no longer arise. If, on the other hand, the major powers again fail, then it is well-known that Paris and London will start to pull out their blue helmets and thus trigger an acceleration of violence on the ground. In this event, political leaders could no longer continue to avoid the issue: Can we prevent an victimized party whom we no longer protect from defending itself against an overarmed aggressor? Nevertheless, this question must be framed correctly. A UN Security Council decision (which at the moment looks unlikely) to lift the arms embargo would apply to the whole of Bosnia, and thus to all the belligerents. It goes without saying that this will not have the effect of restoring the "balance" between the forces present. Although the U.S. President's U-turn is quite spectacular, we may still wonder if it will in fact have any effect on the ground, and whether Bill Clinton's position disclosed on Wednesday will put an end to the suspicions (to use a euphemism) that Washington is supplying arms to the Muslims. As for the negotiations, the Muslims, as the main victims of the conflict, do not appear to have many illusions about their chances of obtaining a viable territorial agreement. This is clear from the initial rumblings from the Talloires meeting and from the fact that they have put increased military pressure on the Serbs in the north of the country.
