In mid-1990 in London the alliance formulated the offer for cooperation with the East and, a few months later, it confirmed it in the CSCE Charter of Paris. A year later in Rome NATO adopted its new strategic concept, which is adapted to the changed situation. Almost at the same time, the 12 member states of the then-European Community agreed on the treaty for the establishment of the European Union (EU), which envisages an independent foreign and security policy by using the Western European Union (WEU) as a complementary institution to NATO. Already these few stations mark the speed of development following the upheavals in the East. Nevertheless, now in Brussels there were once again new factors, such as, above all, the uncertainty about the Russian reform policy, that characterized the debate, at the end of which it remains unclear what the security structures on the old continent will be like in the end but whose result should clarify the relationship between Europe and the United States and the former East Bloc at least for some time. In shaping relations with Russia, the other CIS republics, as well as the Central East European countries, which are all already cooperating with NATO in the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, the alliance partners agreed to the U.S. concept of Partnership for Peace without any major debate. Bilateral Cooperation It offers these countries the opportunity to introduce close bilateral military cooperation with NATO, for instance through joint maneuvers, training for peace missions, and consultations in the case of a threat. Accession to the alliance, which is demanded above all by the reform states Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia as well as by the Baltic countries after the election success of Russian rightist-nationalist Zhirinovskiy, is offered as a prospect, but without giving any specific date. This is done out of consideration for Russian fears of being surrounded and avoids drawing a new, at least theoretical border in Europe. This priority set by Washington is useful certainly as long as there are justified hopes that the Moscow reform process will be continued. Furthermore, this method of action also corresponds to the rhythm of the EU, which has established links with most of these countries through an association with the promise of membership at a later, unspecified date. The Second Pillar of the Alliance For the relationship between Europe and its most important partner on the other side of the Atlantic U.S. President Bill Clinton surprisingly provided a positive emphasis in Brussels by confirming a minimum U.S. troop presence of 100,000 men and the express support of the independent foreign and security policy development of the EU as a second pillar of the alliance. The indispensable security policy ties between the United States and Europe have been clearly affirmed. At the same time, the new Common Foreign and Security Policy of the Twelve can now be initiated more quickly after the Maastricht Treaty came into force with delay at the beginning of November 1993. The envisaged close interlacement with the WEU, of which almost all EU states are members, can be intensified because of the readiness of the alliance to enable the WEU to use NATO resources for independent operations. During his visit to the Brussels EU Commission today the agreement on concluding the Uruguay round, which was achieved recently after long conflicts between the EU and the United States, gives Clinton the basis for contributing further elements to improving the Transatlantic climate also in the field of the economy. The NATO summit gives the impression of being a further step in the direction toward a new security policy structure in Europe after the end of the Cold War. Of course, it would be more convincing if the partners were not still helpless in the face of the bloodshed in the former Yugoslavia. The renewed affirmation of the alliance's readiness for limited air strikes at Serbian positions in Bosnia hardly gives rise to hope in view of the previous experiences.
