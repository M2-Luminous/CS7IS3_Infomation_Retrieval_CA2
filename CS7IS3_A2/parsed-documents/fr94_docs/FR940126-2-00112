ADDRESSES: Requests for documents should be sent to: Aniline and 2,4-Dimethylphenol Proposal Water Resource Center, (RC&hyph;4100) U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460. Send written comments on the draft documents to: Aniline and 2,4-Dimethylphenol Proposal, Comment Clerk; Water Docket (MC&hyph;4101), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460. Commenters are requested to submit any references cited in their comments. Commenters are also requested to submit an original and 3 copies of their written comments and enclosures.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Information Section 304(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1314(a)(1)), directs EPA to develop and publish criteria reflecting the latest scientific knowledge on the identifiable effects of pollutants on public health and welfare, aquatic life and recreation. The draft criteria announced in 58 FR 61910 are intended to protect aquatic life and were derived using the 1985 ``Guidelines for Deriving Numerical National Water Quality Criteria for the Protection of Aquatic Organisms and Their Uses'' (50 FR 30784). All of the criteria developed by EPA using this methodology are summarized in Quality Criteria for Water 1986 (1986 ``Gold Book'') (which is updated periodically.) EPA's criteria documents provide a comprehensive aquatic toxicological evaluation of each chemical. For toxic pollutants, the documents tabulate the relevant acute and chronic toxicity information for aquatic life and derive the criteria maximum concentrations (acute criteria) and criteria continuous concentrations (chronic criteria) which the Agency recommends to protect aquatic life resources. The proposed criteria announced today are not intended to protect human health and do not address human health concerns.
