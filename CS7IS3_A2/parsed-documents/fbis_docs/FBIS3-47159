"Pyongyang will soon recognize that mutual nuclear inspection between South and North Korea to implement the South-North non- nuclear declaration is an unchangeable position of South Korea and the United States as Pyongyang-Washington negotiations make progress," Yi, who is also unification minister, told the National Assembly Foreign Affairs and National Unification Committee. The two Koreas were negotiating an exchange of special envoys when working-level contacts were abruptly suspended by the North in early November last year. Seoul had asked that the special envoys discuss the North Korean nuclear problem and summit talks, but Pyongyang insisted they should only talk about a summit. "We cannot rule out the possibility that an exchange of special envoys to settle North Korea's nuclear problem can be realized and that, with gradual settlement of the nuclear problem, inter-Korean exchanges and cooperation in the fields of personnel and materials will be promoted little by little," he said. Yi said he also expected North Korea to propose a contact and exchange of personnel with private organizations in South Korea in a bid to weaken the government's position. North Korea, which has reinforced its underground military facilities and saved enough war materials to fight without outside help for up to five months, is expected to maintain its war mobilization posture this year, he said. "North Korea is developing a SCUD-E (Nodong-2) missile as a strategic weapon and has expanded its SCUD regiment to a SCUD brigade," he said. Yi explained the government's basic policy on the North and said that the government, if it judges that North Korean nuclear transparency is secured, will begin putting into practice the projects contained in the basic and attached North-South agreements. "The reunion of divided family members, which could help alleviate their agony and sadness, should not be delayed any longer. It is a basic human matter transcending ideology and political system," he said. To bring about reunions, Seoul will establish a meeting house in Panmunjom where members of separated families from South and North can meet and a post office where mail can be exchanged, he said. The South will actively push ahead with consultations with the North on ways to allow old people to visit their birthplaces in the other half, Yi said.
