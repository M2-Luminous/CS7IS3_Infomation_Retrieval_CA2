The Ministry of Internal Trade plans to introduce a "commodity accountability system" to all State and collectively-owned stores later this year. The proposal has been welcomed by consumers. "This is an important move which will make our work easier in the protection of consumers' rights," said a spokeswoman with the Beijing-based China Consumer Association. But the new rule will need to be given more publicity in order to make it effective, she added. Trials were set up in a number of State-owned stores in big cities last year. The new system obliges State-owned stoles to handle consumers' complaints on sub-standard goods, offering a repair and exchange service and paying compensation if necessary. In this way, customers can settle their grievances quickly. And shopkeepers will not be able to pass on responsibility to producers. Under the commodity accountability system store managers and consumers can confront the producer if a shoddy product causes injuries. Only when consumers demands have been met other concerns such as quality and transport problems can be addressed by the stores to the manufacturers and the transporters. But the system will not apply to privately owned shops and markets. The aim of the new system is to help establish and maintain a reliable image for State and collective-owned stores and prevent shoddy commodities from entering these shops the official said. Since the trials were started last March the new practice has been successfully implemented in 100 State-run department stores in Tianjin, Beijing, and Harbin. Business volume in Tianjin stores increased by 30 per cent in six months since the system was introduced. And the number of consumer complaints dropped by 50 per cent. In Beijing 50 shops and department stores were praised by the public for their improved service.
