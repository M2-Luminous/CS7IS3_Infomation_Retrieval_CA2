The report was prepared by Pedro Nikken, an independent UN human rights expert. Juan Ramon Medrano, the official spokesman of the former guerrilla movement, stated at a news conference: "It seems to us that the position of several officials, who said that Nikken did not come to the country to verify the information in his report, is a bit cynical." In the document, which was presented at the UN Human Rights Commission meeting in Geneva, Nikken expressed his concern over the deterioration of human rights in El Salvador, adding that the pace of compliance with the peace agreement "unfortunately has weakened. Presidency Minister Oscar Santamaria challenged the report and strongly criticized Nikken. According to the minister, Nikken prepared the report without visiting the country. Nikken, however, recently stated he was unable to visit the country because Salvadoran immigration authorities had not processed his entry permit. The FMLN's Medrano pointed out that "the government was the one that blocked Nikken's visit," and he added that the report had been prepared with information provided by UN officials who are in El Salvador. Medrano said, "The fundamental aspect and also what causes more apprehension is that the report underscores the existence of armed groups with political objectives, as the government calls them, or `death squads' if you talk in plain Salvadoran Spanish." He added that up until now, authorities have not solved the cases of 40 FMLN members who have been murdered since the peace agreements were signed in January 1992. "Furthermore, three FMLN directorate members were also murdered and those cases have not been solved either, even though there was initial evidence," the FMLN spokesman observed. In his report, Nikken asserted that in 1993, the practice of torture has claimed more victims in the country and that "arbitrary arrests continue on a regular basis." Meanwhile, Salvadoran Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Salavarria requested in Geneva last week, that UN human rights observers be withdrawn from El Salvador because of the "advances" made after the conclusion of the civil war. However, FMLN Adjunct Coordinator Marcos Jimenez stated, "The UN report is an obstacle for the government currently because it shows that the human rights issue must continue in the UN agenda in Geneva." The FMLN leaders said the human rights situation in the country was "serious." FMLN spokesman Medrano also condemned the murders of two leaders of Arena [Nationalist Republican Alliance] (governing rightist party), which were perpetuated in separate locations by unidentified people last Saturday. He likewise censured the attack against an Arena deputy in San Salvador last week. He said: "We condemn these events with the same energy with which we censured the murder of our members. We demand a thorough investigation of these crimes to ensure that they will not be used to generate further confrontation and to show that the FMLN party had nothing to do with them." He added that if any FMLN member had participated in those crimes "the entire weight of the law must fall of him because the FMLN Directorate and members are on the road to peace." The FMLN will participate in the first International Peace Culture Forum to be inaugurated in San Salvador tomorrow. It will be represented by a commission headed by FMLN General Coordinator Shafik Handal. The FMLN leaders criticized the government for refusing to comply with several points of the peace agreements, mainly those related to the implementation of programs for the social reentry of former FMLN and Army combatants, the deployment of the new Civilian National Police in the country, the transfer of lands, and the reforms to the judicial system.
