Priorities Priority 1_Personnel Specifically Trained to Deliver Services in Client Assistance Programs Background The Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;569) made significant changes in rehabilitation service provisions under Title I of the Act. Client Assistance Programs (CAPs) provide assistance in informing and advising all clients and applicants of available benefits under the Act. Section 302 of the Act includes personnel specifically trained to deliver services in CAPs to be among the personnel that the Rehabilitation Training program must consider in reviewing personnel shortages and training needs. Through the 1992 Survey of Personnel Shortages and Training Needs in Vocational Rehabilitation, CAP directors have reported critical training needs for both CAP administrative and service-delivery personnel. The Secretary has identified a maximum possible project period of 60 months. The Secretary believes that at least 36 months will be necessary to meet the requirements of the priority. The Secretary will be assessing, during the third year of the project period, whether there is a need to provide funding beyond 36 months. Priority The project must_ •Provide training to CAP personnel on an as-needed basis, including_(1) Management training on skills needed for strategic and operational planning and direction of CAP services; and (2) Consumer advocacy training on skills and knowledge needed by CAP staff to assist persons with disabilities to gain access to and to use the services and benefits available under the Rehabilitation Act, particularly new Title I requirements; •Coordinate training efforts with training supported by the Center for Mental Health Services and the Administration on Developmental Disabilities for protection and advocacy on common areas, such as financial management; and •Include both national and regional training seminars in each project year.
