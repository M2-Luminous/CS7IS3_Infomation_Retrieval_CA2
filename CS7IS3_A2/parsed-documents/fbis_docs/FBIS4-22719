A Round Without Winners"] [Text] The city electoral commission is continuing to verify the results of the elections. Chairman of the Electoral Commission Vladimir Fomichev stated yesterday that, as of yesterday, the elections might be considered validly held in only 25 districts, with a winner not being revealed in any one of them. Voting is to be held yet again on 3 April everywhere. Democratic Unity was the most successful among public associations that took part in the campaign: All of its candidates qualified for the second round. All of St. Petersburg managed to qualify six candidates, the City We Love--two candidates each [as published], and Business St. Petersburg and the Motherland--one each. Another 15 participants in the second round were nominated by the voters in their districts. The city commission is continuing to review petitions concerning violations. However, observed Fomichev, even if the case of propaganda on election day is proven, it is not clear what sanctions can be used. The commission is not entitled to bump a candidate out of the competition; meanwhile, ruling the elections invalid would result in punishing not only the violator but also his competitor. Meanwhile, the future of the new representative organ of power in the city remains uncertain. According to the regulations, the first meeting of the City Assembly should be held no later than the 30th day after the elections. However, it is already clear that the City Assembly will have legal incapacity until the repeat elections are held (the date has not been determined yet). No fewer than one-half of the established number of the elected representatives of the people should be present even in order for a meeting to have the right to make decisions. Besides, many fundamental decisions (this is particularly the case with mutual relations with executive power) may only be passed by the assembly by two-thirds of the votes. Vladimir Fomichev refused to comment on this situation. He stressed that the directive of the mayor to extend voting was addressed directly to precinct electoral commissions, whereas the city commission restricted itself to establishing procedures for sealing ballot boxes. When journalists inquired whether this means that precinct commissions report to the mayor, Fomichev merely shrugged his shoulders: "You are asking strange questions." To this day the legitimacy of the mayor's decision to extend the elections by one day has not been determined. As is known, on Monday the procuracy lodged a protest with the mayor's office which points out that the length of voting is established by Article 33 of the Basic Regulations on Elections to the Representative Organs of State Power of the Russian Federation Components, which were confirmed by an edict of the president on 27 October of last year, and cannot be changed. Yesterday, Anatoliy Sobchak signed a response to the protest of the procuracy. In the response he rejected the complaints. The response reads: "An organ that has issued a regulatory act is entitled to amend it." In the opinion of the mayor, Article 33 of the Basic Regulations imposed a ban on changing the length of elections for district electoral commissions, but not for the organ which has issued election regulations. Besides, the mayor recalled that the Basic Regulations are advisory in nature. The procuracy refused to comment on Anatoliy Sobchak's response, referring to the fact that this document has not been received through official channels yet. In any case, under legislation in effect the procurator is left with just two possible alternatives for action: accept the arguments of the mayor's office or forward the protest to the courts. What is to be done? Representatives of seven electoral associations tried to answer this question yesterday. Igor Artemyev (the City We Love) and Aleksandr Belyayev (Democratic Unity) informed their colleagues about a conference held at the mayoralty. Anatoliy Sobchak expects to conduct a second round in the fall in the belief that the Goodwill Games will improve the mood of the citizens. In his opinion, the elected deputies should focus on working with the voters. A majority of those in attendance proceeded from the need to acknowledge that the elections were not validly held in all districts because the extension of the elections made them illegal. Aleksandr Belyayev voiced a different point of view. According to him, Anatoliy Sobchak was entitled to change the voting schedule. An agreement in principle on forming councils of electoral associations was reached at the meeting. The issue of the future of executive power is up in the air. The Motherland and Great Russia insist on restoring the powers of the old city soviet. Our City--Our Home proposed to create an organ which is new in principle for the duration of the transition period--the public chamber of St. Petersburg. A law on such chambers could be passed by the State Duma. On Friday the State Duma will consider the issue of the elections in St. Petersburg. Sobchak has already stated that he will challenge any decision of the parliament.
