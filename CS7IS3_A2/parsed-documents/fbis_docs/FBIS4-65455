[Adams] Well, I think it is gratifying that for five months we were told that clarification wasn't necessary, that it was a matter of take it or leave it, and now we are being told -- yes there are issues that need clarifying, there are questions to deal with, core issues. I do think on a personal level that the British response was a little bit childish, a little bit begrudging. I mean the real test would be in the answers that they supply which need to be comprehensive, which need to be honest. We are not dealing with clarification here as a matter of formality, we're dealing with getting comprehensive, honest, and unambiguous responses to detailed questions. [Snow] What is the prize if you get the clarification you seek? [Adams] We are engaged in a peace process. I mean, there aren't any quick fixes. Our response is dictated to a large degree by what the British Government's clarifications and elaborations are. [Snow] Could be as strong as to say -- yes a permanent cessation of violence is on my agenda under the right circumstances? [Adams] Well it was on my agenda from the very beginning. When John Hume and I kick-started the whole peace process, an end, a cessation, a complete stop to all armed action by the IRA, by the British, by the loyalists was quite clearly on my agenda. That's part of a peace settlement. We have to persuade people engaged in armed actions to give up those actions, to be part of a process, and that's why I said at the beginning of this interview -- peace requires change and we have to move the whole position forward -- the British Government responding in a comprehensive way, engaging in the peace process. Providing clarification allows the whole business, the whole search for peace to move forward. I hope it would lead to cessation of armed actions by those engaged in armed actions, but I'm not going to raise expectations to have them dashed again. I want to move forward building the bricks on which a solid foundation for lasting peace can be established, and it's important also that we want a lasting peace, we want a durable peace, we want a peace settlement. [Snow] All right then, what are you holding out to the British people as something that they can cling on to? What is the best expectation that we could see? Are you talking in terms of weeks, months, years? [Adams] Well, I don't know, I have always said that we are into the conflict resolution phase of this struggle. I don't know how long that phase is going to take. I want it to be as short as possible, I want people around me, all the people of this country and the people of Britain who deserve peace as much as the people in Ireland to have a normal, political life, to have a society which is just. So we are definitely in the final phase. There will be unforeseen obstacles in the way. There will be difficulties. It will be dangerous and risky. How long will it take -- I don't know. The sooner and the shorter the better.
