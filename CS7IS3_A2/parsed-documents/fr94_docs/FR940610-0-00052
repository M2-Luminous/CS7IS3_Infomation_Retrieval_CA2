FR940610-0-00052 FR940610-0-00023 E:GRAPHICSER10JN94.000 Where: n=the estimated number of years of useful life, i=the applicable interest rate under section 7520 of the Internal Revenue Code, v=1 divided by the sum of 1 plus the applicable interest rate under section 7520 of the Internal Revenue Code, x=the age of the life tenant, and lx=number of persons living at age x as set forth in Table 80CNSMT of §20.2031&hyph;7 (or, for prior periods, in §20.2031&hyph;7A) of this chapter. (3) The following example illustrates the provisions of this paragraph (b): Example. In June 1992, A, who is 62, donates to Y University a remainder interest in a personal residence, consisting of a house and land, subject to a reserved life estate in A. At the time of the gift, the land has a value of $30,000 and the house has a value of $100,000 with an estimated useful life of 45 years, at the end of which the value of the house is expected to be $20,000. The portion of the property considered to be depreciable is $80,000 (the value of the house ($100,000) less its expected value at the end of 45 years ($20,000)). The portion of the property considered to be nondepreciable is $50,000 (the value of the land at the time of the gift ($20,000) plus the expected value of the house at the end of 45 years ($20,000)). The interest rate prescribed under section 7520 for June 1992 is 8.4 percent. Based on an interest rate of 8.4 percent, the remainder factor for $1.00 prescribed in §20.2031&hyph;7 of this chapter for a person age 62 is 0.29567. The value of the nondepreciable remainder interest is $14,783.50 (0.29567 times $50,000). The value of the depreciable remainder interest is $17,387.20 (0.21734, computed under the formula described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, times $80,000). Therefore, the value of the remainder interest is $32,170.70. * * * * * (e) *␣*␣* (1)(i) If the valuation of the remainder interest in the real property is dependent upon the continuation or the termination of more than one life or upon a term certain concurrent with one or more lives, a special factor must be used. (ii) The special factor is to be computed on the basis of_ (A) Interest at the rate prescribed under §25.2512&hyph;5 (or, for certain prior periods, §25.2512&hyph;5A) of this chapter, compounded annually; (B) Life contingencies determined from the values that are set forth in the mortality table in §20.2031&hyph;7 (or, for certain prior periods, §20.2031&hyph;7A) of this chapter; and (C) If depreciation is involved, the assumption that the property depreciates on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. (iii) If any part of the property is subject to depletion of its natural resources, such depletion must be taken into account in determining the value of the remainder interest. (2) In the case of the valuation of a remainder interest following two lives, the special factor may be obtained through use of the following formula: E:GRAPHICSER10JN94.001 Where: n=the estimated number of years of useful life, i=the applicable interest rate under section 7520 of the Internal Revenue Code, v=1 divided by the sum of 1 plus the applicable interest rate under section 7520 of the Internal Revenue Code, x and y=the ages of the life tenants, and lx and ly=the number of persons living at ages x and y as set forth in Table 80CNSMT in §20.2031&hyph;7 (or, for prior periods, in §20.2031&hyph;7A) of this chapter.
