His trip to Saudi Arabia, Oman, Bahrain and Kuwait comes just weeks after Defence Procurement Minister Jonathan Aitken visited the region to promote defence equipment. Brian Newman, defence analyst at London stockbrokers Henderson Crossthwaite said: "The Middle East remains the market with the highest spend and best prospects for British industry. It is encouraging that the current government is giving exporters so much support." Britain has already clinched massive contracts in the region, spearheaded by the 20 billion pounds sterlin Al Yamamah deal with Saudi Arabia. And industry is chasing numerous lucrative new contracts, including Hawk aircraft, Challenger tanks and minehunters for Saudi Arabia, Piranha armoured personnel carriers, AS90 howitzers and Super Lynx helicopters for Kuwait, and more Super Lynxes for Oman. Saudi Arabia is also considering leasing the Royal Navy's 1 billion pounds sterling fleet of four new Upholder submarines. Mr. Rifkind, who left today, said: "This will be my first visit to the Middle East for more than a year, and my first ever visit to Oman. "The UK is fully committed to supporting security and stability in the Gulf region and I hope my visit over the next few days will be seen as further evidence of that resolve."
