The editorial says: The world economic crisis has caused numerous difficulties for the Swedish economy. As a result, the Swedish Government, headed by Prime Minister Carl Bildt after the 1991 election, has cut its development aid to foreign countries. However, it has increased aid to our nation and has become the country with the largest volume of non-refundable aid to Vietnam. The Swedish Government and businessmen have highly appraised Vietnam's renovation process and hailed the achievements recorded by our country in this regard. Our Swedish friends have also expressed their wish to expand cooperation with Vietnam and enhance the fine relations between the two countries. The official visit to Vietnam by Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt is a significant event in the Vietnam-Swedish relations and is in line with Vietnam's open door foreign policy. The Vietnamese people warmly welcome the first visit to Vietnam by the Swedish Prime Minister and wish him splendid success. Indeed, the visit will contribute to strengthening the friendship and cooperation between Vietnam and Sweden, thereby meeting the aspiration and interest of the two peoples and strengthening peace, stability, and development in the region. 062300
