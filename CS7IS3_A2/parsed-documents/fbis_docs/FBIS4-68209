Stefashin, candidate of military sciences, and Colonel M. Markov] [Text] This is the first in a series of articles on Chinese military science. It provides a general impression of the subject in question. In the next journal issues we will tell about military-scientific establishments and training of cadres for them, the status of military-economic and military-technical sciences, and organization of military research. Chinese scientists look at four periods in the development of the country's modern military science. It is believed that the first period begins with the appearance of works by Mao Zedong in the late 1930's and ends in the 1940's. It is characterized by an interpretation of theoretical questions of military problems revealed by Mao in a number of theoretical studies such as "Questions of the Strategy of Guerilla Warfare Against Japanese Invaders," "On a Protracted War," "War and Questions of Strategy" and others. The second period falls in the 1950's and is marked by the extensive adoption of Soviet military experience both in military-theoretical as well as military-technical studies. A network of military educational institutions, scientific research establishments and post-graduate work was established at this time. The third period comprised the years of cultural revolution (1966-1976), when the country's leadership rejected military cooperation with the USSR. General stagnation of military research is a distinctive feature: There was a sharp drop in volume and quality of military RDT&E, but work to create nuclear weapons and missile-space equipment was carried on actively. Profound transformations of the state's entire military system were required with transition to a reform policy in the late 1970's. This became the beginning of the fourth period, which continues at the present time. It is characterized by a large-scale unfolding of military-scientific research, which was not seen in the preceding three periods. With consideration of changes in the political, military-strategic and economic situation in the country and world, especially in the Asiatic-Pacific region, Chinese military specialists prepared fundamentally new provisions for the military-political leadership in a short time on problems of national security and Armed Forces organizational development. Up to the end of the current century they recommended being guided by the concept of "priority development of the national economy" with respect to defense organizational development and to rely on the "state's comprehensive might" and political authority for establishing their leadership. The present highly dynamic development of military science was facilitated not only by increased attention to it on the part of the country's leadership, but also by its "conversion," i.e., emergence from a closed, isolated system of a purely defensive nature into the broad market of "know-how" and introduction of military technologies to civilian production. The number of such projects and developments which are becoming the property of the civilian sector of the economy is growing continuously. There were around 40 of them in 1983, already 800 in 1984, and over 20,000 in 1985, which contributed to a constant growth in volume of funds for economic agreement work, consultations and S&T servicing of projects between military-scientific establishments and enterprises of the country's economic complex. (In 1984, for example, it was around 430 million yuan and in 1985 it exceeded one billion yuan). This trend also is preserved at the present time. In analyzing the history of development of military science, it should be noted that in the first three periods China approached a solution to problems of military theory from purely dogmatic Maoist positions. This placed an imprint on development of general problems of military thought, and in particular on the conceptual apparatus, which is an instrumental part of military research. To this day the role and place of military science and its divisions have been the subject of scientific disputes. Chinese scientists note that with the development of military affairs, new directions appear in military science, including "military-social science," "military-economic science," the "science of military mobilization," and "military forecasting," but their place and collateral subordination have yet to be determined. Official PRC Ministry of Defense publications define military science in the broad sense by the term "military theory," which is understood to mean systemized knowledge in the area of military affairs and of war as a whole which realistically reflects the evolution of military organizational development, the nature and regularities of warfare, and the very process of obtaining this knowledge. At the present stage military theory is called upon to study problems holding a priority position such as war and peace, war and politics, the interrelationship of defense organizational development and economic organizational development, and dialectics of military affairs. Chinese specialists believe that the level of development and practical value of military theory are determined by the degree of conformity of the "new strategic situation in the world to the level of China's economic development, to the status and development prospects of weapons and military equipment of the People's Liberation Army of China [PLA], and to requirements of modern military doctrine and missions of organizational development of the regular Armed Forces." The following are components of military theory: leading ideas, military science, science on armed forces organization, history of military affairs, military history, and military geography. Chinese theorists interpret leading ideas as a system of scientific views which combine general provisions of Marxism-Leninism on war, peace and the army as well as the specific experience of revolutionary wars in China. Military ideas of Mao and Deng Xiaoping are their basis. Military science is defined as a system of knowledge about the nature of war, the country's preparation for it, and methods of its conduct. Military science accomplishes the following tasks: research of the strategic nature of modern wars; development of doctrinal views on defense organizational development and on the country's military-technical and military-economic policy; cognition of regularities and methods of preparing and conducting warfare; development of pressing problems of technical outfitting and economic support of the Armed Forces. Theory of military art as well as military-technical and military-economic sciences are components of military science. The theory of military art is understood to mean various fields of knowledge encompassing theoretical and practical aspects of preparing and conducting military operations of a varying scale. The theory of military art includes theories of military strategy, operational art and tactics. Military-technical science, which engages in developing military equipment and the technology of its production, is considered a very important factor determining the country's military-technical and military-economic potentials and defense capability. Military-economic science represents a system of knowledge on military-economic problems relating to production of means of warfare and to war as a whole. As an independent field of military knowledge, however, it still has no specific place in the set of components of military science, which is a constant subject of theoretical arguments. A number of Chinese military scientists place military-economic research among problems of military-technical science, others examine it in the theory of military strategy, and still others suggest making it an independent division of military science or an independent field of military theory. The science on armed forces organization is a system of knowledge on regularities and principles of Armed Forces organizational development. It studies questions of determining directions of development of the Armed Forces structure and ratios of branches of forces and combat arms; performs tasks of substantiating the PLA's quantitative and qualitative makeup for peace and wartime; determines principles of manpower acquisition for military formations and units and the procedure for performance of duty and for functioning of the cadre training system; studies problems of discipline, combat training and the provision of military equipment and supplies; and develops recommendations on billeting troops, the basing system for naval and air forces, training of reserves, and establishment of mobilization stockpiles. The history of military affairs studies the history of the origin and development of military affairs. Its components are the history of wars, history of armed forces, history of military equipment, history of military thought and history of military art. The regularities and trends in development of armed forces and military art are revealed and theoretical and practical recommendations on improving military affairs are offered within the scope of these sciences. Being a component part of general historical science, military history studies the causes, role and place of warfare of popular masses, classes and parties in the overall process of development of mankind and the state. It views the history of wars as a sociopolitical phenomenon, and the military system (the army) as an instrument of violence and a very important element of state organizational development. Military geography studies military-political, military-economic and natural conditions, elements of terrain relief and their influence on conduct of combat operations, as well as the historical-geographic features and operational preparation of probable theaters of military operations. The structure of Chinese military theory (see figure) graphically demonstrates that the predominant place in it is held by military science, whose main task at the present stage is to give theoretical and technical support to modernization of defense and to ongoing military reforms. In performing this task, Chinese researchers arrived at the conclusion that "reform is a means of self-improvement of the army" and it "must follow its own national path." The principal contradictions in Chinese Armed Forces organizational development are considered to be their nonconformity to demands of modern war and the still low level of PLA modernization on the one hand, and on the other hand, the fact that under present conditions the Army has ceased to be an effective means of achieving political goals which can be used in all cases and at any time. Difficulties connected with determining directions of Armed Forces development stem from this. Structure of military theory To perform its principal task, Chinese military science now is resolving the following specific problems: - forecasting the military-political situation and possible variants of initiation of military operations in the course of which the country's interests may be affected; - technical substantiation of the military-political course and principles of defense organizational development and military reform; - revelation of features of modern wars and development of new forms and methods of warfare; - scientific argumentation of directions of development of weapons and combat equipment and a determination of their most important kinds for future wars; - substantiation of territorial stationing of military force elements; - precise determination of goals, missions and content of military education. Chinese scientists assert that all research on military questions in the PRC has specific features, which are--relying on Marxist-Leninist theory and the military ideas of Mao and Deng Xiaoping, military-scientific research should be linked closely with the practice and traditions of the state itself and the Army. In conducting such research it is considered necessary to rationally combine the international and national theory and practice of military organizational development and the applied and basic research on military subjects. Thus, a characteristic feature of the present, fourth, stage of development of Chinese military science is the sharp increase in its role of developing practical recommendations for the country's military-political leadership. New trends have begun to predominate in China's contemporary military science: - the growing influence of military science on state decisionmaking not only in the military policy area, but also for many domestic and foreign policy problems; - use of results of military-scientific research for further developing China's "strategic course" and for resolving complex national security problems; - the determining influence of military-scientific research on a search for the main, future, and optimal directions of Armed Forces organizational development and their combat employment in different kinds of wars and military conflicts; - conduct of military-scientific research in support of military policy requirements not only of today, but also for the long term (right up to the middle of the next century); - rapid development rates of military science, an expansion of its content, and the appearance of new independent divisions; - activation of conversion of military research with wide use of general scientific and special research methods typical of world and national scientific schools. In conclusion, one can state that at the present stage of military organizational development the problem of development of military theory has begun to occupy a very important place in the work of the PRC military-political leadership, which believes that "correct theoretical conclusions permit reaching the goal by the shortest path," and that theory itself, including military theory, must outstrip practice. In addition, Chinese analysts believe that victory cannot be won either over a weak or a technically superior enemy without the presence of advanced theory. Therefore, rapid development not only of applied, but also of basic directions of theory is a characteristic feature of China's modern military science.
