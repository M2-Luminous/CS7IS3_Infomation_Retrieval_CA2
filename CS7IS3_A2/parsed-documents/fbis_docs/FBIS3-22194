Incidentally, it was noted that the drop in production also has its positive aspects: there was a 12-percent decrease in comparison to 1992 in pollutant emissions into the atmosphere from ``stationary sources.'' Virtually all other pollution indices increased last year, though only slightly. There was an increase in pollutant emissions resulting from the use of low-quality types of gasoline. For example, a Russian-made passenger car produces almost as much pollution as seven U.S.-made automobiles (roughly 21 grams/kilometer per car, as opposed to 3 grams/kilometer for an American car). More than 4,000 tonnes of lead-containing compounds were released into the atmosphere. Direct environmental damage as a result of these emissions is estimated at more than R3.0 billion [rubles] annually. The results of observations by experts carried out in the atmosphere around Russia's cities and industrial centers indicates an increase in concentrations of carbon monoxide, carbon disulfide, phenol and nitrogen oxides. During the first half of 1993 a total of 207 cases of maximum permissible pollutant levels being exceeded by factors of 10 or more were reported in 44 cities around the country. There were 88 reported incidents of massive one-time air pollution. According to environmental protection agencies, the damage done by air pollution alone was R280 million in the first six months of 1993. According to the minister the condition of fauna has also worsened. Populations of many valuable animal species have dropped to dangerously low levels, and fish catches are down as well. The reason is habitat exhaustion, as well as a marked upsurge in poaching. Another equally important problem for ecologists is emergencies caused by natural disasters and manmade accidents. 1993 witnessed many such incidents. One need only recall the accident at Tomsk-7 in April, the flooding in the Urals, and the numerous explosions in transportation systems and at a number of mines. A lack of funding and a wide range of other reasons do not permit the minister of environmental protection to hope that the situation will begin to improve in the near future. In Viktor Danilov-Danilyan's opinion, the task for 1994 will be ``at the first stage, at least to halt the worsening of the environmental situation.''
