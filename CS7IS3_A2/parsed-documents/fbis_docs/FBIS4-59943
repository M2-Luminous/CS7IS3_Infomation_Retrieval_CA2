The daily wrote in its editorial that it was not solely a product of "Wahhabi house of Saud" but a declaration jointly engineered by the western forces of arrogance. It stressed that King Fahd, for understandable reasons, could not tolerate even peaceful demos against the U.S., Israel and other enemies of Islam on `his' territory. Turning to the deployment of Saudi security forces around the Iranian pilgrims headquarters this week, the paper noted that the heavy military concentration around the building was regarded as another recipe for disaster had the `deliverance from unbelievers' rally taken place. "The world is not unaware of Saudi Arabia's military, political and economic ties with Washington and how American strategists (with due help from Britain) advise the royal family on everything from gardening to foreign-policy making," wrote the article. "If Muslims unite," the daily suggested, "no earthly power can resist them. Evil powers are well aware of this and thus cannot bear to see hundreds and thousands of pilgrims condemning their interference in Muslim affairs." KAYHAN INTERNATIONAL concluded by saying that the Saudi rulers will never command the respect of the ummah for indulging in practices detrimental to the lofty cause of Islam and its followers. "They should open their eyes to the stark realities of today's world in which nations big and small want their leaders to get out of America's satanic orbit. For how long can the `guardians of the holy shrines' keep alien interest on the top of their national agenda?"
