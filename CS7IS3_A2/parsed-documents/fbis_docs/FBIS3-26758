Shanghai began to spread general knowledge of computers among students in 1986 to meet the needs of its high-tech development. Middle schools now have a total of 8,000 micro-computers, with 600 lecturers and 140 managerial workers. They have compiled and published four series of computer teaching materials. Altogether 165,000 students have obtained computer certificates over the past six years.
