The first 250-word article states: "Although he guarantees that his main priority is to run for a Senate seat for the Liberal Front Party, PFL, Bahia Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, yesterday admitted for the first time during a luncheon held for him by the Rio de Janeiro Businessmen Association that he may run as a candidate for the presidency of the Republic. `I will continue crafting an alliance for the first voting round with all the parties whose candidates may withdraw. My name is available, but I would be the sixth option because I also defend five other candidates,' Magalhaes said before 200 businessmen, including Globo Companies' Roberto Marinho, his longtime friend." In a second 200-word article describing his speech to the Rio businessmen, Magalhaes harshly criticizes the economic policy of Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso. Magalhaes states: "The fiscal reform that the government wants to pass will not yield any results. It will only increase taxes for you. The government is not brave enough to say that the Real Value Unit, URV, is a disguised dollarization of the economy that will create salary problems like in Argentina and Mexico." Magalhaes continues by saying that the government needs a "credibility shock," which for him means an "effective fight against corruption and tax evaders, and an immediate constitutional revision. `We need a strong government and a return to the principle of authority,'" Magalhaes said. The third 250-word article describes Magalhaes as a political chess master who, although he seems to be warming up the seat for another candidate, is really doing it for himself. His speeches gain more media coverage than the Citizenry Caravan carried out by opponent Luis Inacio Lula da Silva. The article states that the other presidential candidates, Jose Sarney, Orestes Quercia, and Paulo Maluf, are morally discredited, while Antonio Britto finds strong resistance within his own party. The candidacy of Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso depends on whether he can control inflation; otherwise his party will have to support Senator Mario Covas. Considering this, Magalhaes is launching himself as the "sixth option."
