Rashid told MENA that the Palestinian delegation will call on the Arab League to take a unified stance in the face of repeated acts of aggression by the Israeli settlers and Army. The Palestinians will also urge international protection of the Palestinian people for security and stability to prevail and as a necessary condition for pursuing efforts to achieve a just and comprehensive peace, Rashid said. Rashid said that the Palestinians will also call for the presence of Israeli settlements in the occupied Arab territories to be reconsidered. He added that there is a need to remove these settlements because of the threat they pose to the peace process. Answering a question about the massacre's effect on the peace talks between the Palestinians and Israel, which have already made significant progress, the Palestinian official said that such attacks certainly affect the peace process and demonstrate Israel's lack of credibility.
