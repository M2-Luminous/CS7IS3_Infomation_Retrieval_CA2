The Socialists hope that, although relative victors, Slobodan Milosevic will give them the mandate. This will probably happen, since none of the opposition parties have expressed the desire to form a party [stranacka] government or even a coalition government. All parliamentary parties have also announced that they would not support a Socialists' minority government. Zoran Djindjic, chairman of the Executive Council of the Democratic Party [DS], is the only one currently proposing a solution that could perhaps save the day. His proposal to form a government of national salvation (in which neither the mandator nor the majority of the ministers would be from the Socialist Party of Serbia [SPS]), has been decisively rejected only by the SPS and the Radicals. If the Socialists continue to insist on ruling alone, all the opposition leaders foresee new elections as early as spring. According to constitutional procedure, the new parliament should meet 20 days after the final electoral results are announced. In the meantime, the president of the republic should appoint a mandator for forming the government, after which the deputies would have two months to discuss the forming of the new government. If they are unable to do this within the allotted time limit, the assembly is automatically dissolved and new elections are held. "The Montenegrin Recipe" The Socialists announced their electoral victory as early as the electoral night of 19 December, after which they announced that they would form the new government alone. The euphoria, however, did not last long, and, just a few days after Ivica Dacic's statement that the SPS would not form a coalition with anyone, they sobered up and announced the "Montenegrin recipe." Yesterday Dacic said that the Socialists might offer a ministerial department or two to everyone except the Radicals. Since all the parties have stated that they do not wish to be part of a Socialist government, the SPS might employ another maneuver, and, under the pretext of an expert government, win over certain opposition parties. According to Dacic, however, this is in Slobodan Milosevic's domain and not the SPS's. For the time being, the SPS is still considering a mandator from its own ranks. The names that have come up are those of Dragan Tomic, manager of Simpo, Oskar Kovac, Zeljko Simic, and even Radoman Bozovic. In case this is not accepted, the SPS might consider a new Panic, or Zoran Djindjic, as the "least of opposition evils." The Socialists have lately been toying with the possibility of securing the necessary three votes with the deputies from ethnic minority parties. The coalition of the two Albanian parties from southern Serbia has decisively denied the possibility of supporting the SPS. Moreover, the Socialists will not get the three votes from the Democratic Community of Vojvodina Hungarians [DZVM]. Caba Sepsej, DZVM vice president, said for BORBA: "I personally think, and I believe that this opinion will be accepted by my colleagues from the party, that we are not the ones who should make decisions about the government in Serbia. This is an issue that should be solved by the parties of the majority people. We are, of course, always in favor of democratic options, the end of the war and integration into European trends, yet it seems we have no influence over any of this. The majority people's parties are unanimous in this, just as they are in relation to minorities." Djindjic Is Ready Some opposition parties see Zoran Djindjic as being the "savior" of the Socialist majority. In a statement to BORBA, Djindjic decisively rejects the possibility of DS deputies supporting a minority government of the Socialists or any other coalition government in which the Socialists would have the majority. In order to have a capable and efficient government, which we have not had so far, it has to be trusted by the majority of the parties in the parliament. Parties that wish to form a party government do not respect the will of the people and show that their only goal is power. The greatest responsibility lies with the largest party, adds Djindjic. First of all we need to establish the concept of the new government and find the smallest common denominator, which at the moment is solving the basic problems of the people. If this were the new government's program, every party would support it. In order to form a government of national salvation everyone should take a step back from party interests in favor of national interests. I am ready to support such a government even if not a single one of our members is in it, claims Djindjic. He also stresses that he is ready to take on the responsibility and role of mandator of such a government. In response to accusations of SPS leaders that he is courting the Socialists, Djindjic says that this is illogical and strange, even for Seselj, who is known for his "strange logic." "If I am proposing a solution that will end the SPS's monopoly on power, I fail to see how this could be interpreted as courting the Socialists. The SPS must be ready to make the greatest sacrifices," says Djindjic. Discontinuity of Power? The new DS leader hopes that he will win the support of the Democratic Movement of Serbia [Depos] and the Democratic Party of Serbia's [DSS] support for such a government: "with the exception of cadre issues, they cannot have a different approach from us. A discontinuity of power must occur. A moderate variant of such discontinuity is possible only with a government of national salvation." However, the other political power in Serbia -- Depos -- does not expect the president of the state to give them the mandate, and it seems that they also do not believe in the possibility of a coalition government of everyone with the exception of the SPS. Commenting on the proposals currently in circulation, Serbian Renewal Movement [SPO] spokesman Ivan Kovacevic said that he did not believe that anyone would vote for an SPS minority government, but he does not reject the possibility of discussing a government of the type proposed by the DS. Two years ago we proposed a government of national salvation. Such a government should primarily create conditions for the first democratic elections. Such a government cannot be formed by the SPS and they cannot have the majority in it. The DSS is convinced that the government will be formed by the SPS. That is a certainty, says Milorad Jovanovic, DSS spokesman, just as it is certain that the opposition will be against this government. Deputies of minority parties and perhaps some other parties could secure the majority for the SPS. The DS has, for example, showed the most affinity for such a possibility, whereas the DSS is the last one on the list of those who could agree to something of the kind. The SPS is in dire need of support, but judging by everything it does not have the possibility of forming a stable government, says Jovanovic. Is a Parliamentary Crisis in View The Serbian Radical Party [SRS] is convinced that the electoral results will lead to new elections. Vojislav Seselj, president of the SRS, says that there will be no support for an SPS minority government, but he also does not believe in the possibility of an opposition government or a government of national salvation. In response to what the Radicals role in this situation is, Seselj said that "we will continue along our path; we will neither support the SPS, nor will we oppose them in coalition with the DZVM." Rumors that Milosevic will soon summon for consultations all party leaders with the exception of Vojislav Seselj testify to the fact that the Socialists will try to win over other parties for their "expert government." Milorad Jovanovic (DSS), however, believes that the SPS is not ready to look for a coalition partner and that is why he foresees "new elections, new hassles, and finally, the SPS deputies' loss of even the relative majority in the assembly. The current 123 will boil down to a realistic 80 to 90 mandates," says Jovanovic. Ivan Kovacevic (Depos) also does not foresee a stable parliamentary future. "What will follow is a brief parliamentary crisis and new elections in the spring." Djindjic says that the only salvation for the Socialists' government would be for the parliament never to hold a session and to be dissolved immediately. In that case, the elections would take place as early as May. The Socialists probably expect that the sanctions will be lifted in the meantime, which could be an electoral point for them. Not all citizens will live to see that, and those that do survive will not be aware that elections are taking place, says Djindjic.
