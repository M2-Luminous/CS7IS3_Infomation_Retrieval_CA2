Guangzhou Executive Vice Mayor Chen Kaizhi and Wu Liang made the these remarks at a news conference of the city people's congress today. Chen said: The city started exploring the change of operation mechanism in state-owned enterprises last year. The authorities will change the traditional methods of granting loans and so on to money-losing enterprises and will not help them out so they can thoroughly remold themselves. With regard to existing enterprises, especially young and lively enterprises, it is necessary to quicken the pace of changing their mechanisms. We should take advantage of their adolescent years to help them find "mothers-in-law" and marry them off to establish a modern enterprise system. Wu Liang said: Last year, Guangzhou boldly "conceded markets, profits, and ownership right" to foreign businesses, and it will accelerate this process this year. Various enterprises, whether newly-established, profit-making, or good old ones, also should be sold. We are even ready to sell whole factories. Some tertiary industries, including commerce and retail and catering businesses, as well as tunnels and bridges, will also be sold in a planned and restrained manner. However, there should be coordination with the central government on certain items. Wu said: By selling shares we can use the funds for more necessary construction projects in Guangzhou, including the construction of underground railways and roads. Speaking on excessive price rises last year, Wu said: We shall adopt feasible measures to keep down prices. These measures include the establishment of a fund for keeping down prices and the establishment of a reserve system for important nonstable food; the implementation of a system of putting on record price increases for important commodities; tighter management of collection of administrative and service charges and adoption of macroeconomic regulation and control measures over the sales of commodities that can yield exorbitant profits; and acceleration of the "shopping basket" project in an effort to keep the rise in retail price index to within 15 percent this year.
