President Milosevic said there was no real chance of the international community playing a positive role in the Yugoslav crisis as long as it failed to face the truth, as long as it accused Serbia of the aggression, as long as it fueled fundamentalism, and as long as it continued sanctions against the Serbian people in flagrant contravention of the UN Charter. By accepting the EU's proposals, the Serbian side has demonstrated its commitment to peace. It has transpired that the war is being waged by those forces that instigate the Muslim side into armed conflicts, something that is undoubtedly to their detriment and claims a large number of casualties. It is obvious that the policy of pressures and threats has resulted in total fiasco and that a peace process, whereby all warring parties are treated equally and the international community is impartial, is the quickest way to peace, a normalization of the situation, and a just political solution to the crisis. President Slobodan Milosevic pointed out that the continuation of economic sanctions against our country was counterproductive, as they represent an obstacle to the restoration of peace. This is why the international community ought to abolish them. It was stressed during the talks that the international community should exert strong influence to discourage and thwart the proponents of the war option and that it should be decisive in stopping Muslim armed provocations and offensives against the Serbs side to stop the war from escalating and to prevent further destablization in the region. Serbia favors an agreement on a permanent end to hostilities on the territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina through an unbiased involvement of the UN peace forces. For this reason, the efforts to restart the negotiationg process are the international community's priority task. The republic of Serbia will continue to favor negotiations as a way of resolving the crisis and will insist that the peace process cannot be developed through the use of force but rather through equal respect for the interests of all three sides. The Yugoslav minister of foreign affairs, Vladislav Jovanovic, also took part in the talks.
