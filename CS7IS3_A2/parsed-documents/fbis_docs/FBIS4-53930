In a speech to the Federation of Korean Industries, Yi said inter-Korean economic cooperation including businessmen's visits to North Korea are not being allowed due to the nuclear problem, adding that "this will continue until the nuclear dispute takes a turn for the better." He said, however, that the government will take a flexible attitude toward economic cooperation, considering the development of the nuclear issue, in preparation for a variety of opportunities that may come with the settlement of the nuclear row. Yi was speaking before a group of businessmen interested in South-North Korean trade at an event arranged by Rep. Kang Kyong-sik of the Democratic Liberal Party and Rep. Yi Pu-yong of the Democratic Party. The participants, from major business groups, insisted on a positive line in South-North trade to ensure economic development in the long term, although they understand the government's position of linking economic cooperation with the nuclear problem.
