Although the Russian initiative appears to be positive and to be aimed at breaking the stalemate in the Arab-Israeli negotiations, this initiative should not make us believe that Russia, which attended the first Madrid conference under the umbrella of the Soviet Union that was then passing away, can now assume a leading role in events under its current circumstances, which are no better than those prevailing when it attended the first conference in Madrid. As for the French initiative, it is not only very bad because of its timing, but also because of its contents, which activate military relations with Israel--relations that have been nearly severed since the aggression in 1967. Contrary to the position expected from Paris, in light of its exclusion from negotiations and from its previous effective role in reaching an agreement--the same as the case with Europe, China, and Japan--we see France courting Tel Aviv and concluding a military pact for research and development instead of seeking to foster relations with the Arab parties to the negotiations, which are besieged by Israeli intransigence and U.S. pressure. This pact implies encouragement for Israel to continue the expansionist, Zionist, and aggressive policy. We view the Russian initiative positively, in spite of the possible intentions and circumstances that serve Moscow's objectives of seeking more Western assistance and restoring U.S. political support for Russian President Boris Yeltsin, which has begun to falter. As much as we are disturbed by the negative French initiative, we know that the U.S. Administration is the main party responsible for the crisis in the negotiations. It is a result of the full and unlimited U.S. support for Israel and because the United States prevents the international community from carrying out any positive role in implementing the resolutions of the international community or forcing Israel to heed the UN resolutions on our rights in Palestine and the Arab territories occupied after the 1967 aggression. We, as well as the entire international community, know that Washington monopolized the role of the sole power able to influence international events in general and our negotiations with Israel in particular. We also know that any failure or slowness in these negotiations and any Zionist threat to world security and peace in this region is the full responsibility of the United States. In spite of this belief, which many people share with us, we welcome the positive Russian initiative, and condemn the negative French initiative launched at this delicate time.
