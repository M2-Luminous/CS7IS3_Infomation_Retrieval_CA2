"The last resort the premier can use when facing off with parliament is the right to dissolve (the lower house) and I won't throw this away," Hata said in a television interview. But Hata, who has governed with minority support since late April, said the public will be disillusioned if the next general poll is contested under the current multiseat system and the nation's years of political reform efforts are foiled. An election under the existing system, which is soon to be replaced by a new system combining single-seat constituencies with proportional representation, "is not unimaginable," the premier said. "(But) the next election should be contested under the system of single-seat voting districts combined with proportional representation," Hata said. Although the Diet legislated in January a package of electoral reform bills for the lower house, the additional passage of a yet- to-be-formulated bill that redraws the electoral map is required to allow the next election to be lawfully contested under the new system. The primary opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), is poised to file a no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet after the long-overdue fiscal 1994 national budget clears the Diet on Thursday. The Social Democratic Party (SDP), a former member of the ruling coalition and now the second largest opposition force, has also threatened to bring down the Hata government in a no-confidence vote. The premier said he will continue efforts to bring the SDP back into the fold, because in the last government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, the SDP and other coalition partners, including Hata's Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], managed to resolve differences over a host of key policy issues. Hata also said he will welcome those who break away from the LDP and join forces with the coalition if they are determined to push for national reforms. On the economic front, the premier spoke of the need to increase indirect taxes so as not only to continue large-scale income and residential tax cuts in 1995 and beyond but also to secure revenue for future national reform programs. Hata expressed hope that the tension on the Korean peninsula will be defused after the United States and North Korea resume high-level talks on Pyongyang's alleged push for nuclear weapons.
