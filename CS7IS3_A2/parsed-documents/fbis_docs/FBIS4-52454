"It is up to the UNHCR to speed up the repatriation of Laotians, not to allow it to drag on as at present," Mr. Khachatphai said. The UNHCR "succeeded to repatriate some 300,000 Cambodians in one year," he said. "There are now only an estimated 25,000 Laotians left in Thailand and they want to go home." The setting up of more reception centres in Laos would speed up the repatriation process and support Thailand's plan to close the last refugee camp for Laotians by the end of this year. There are two reception centres in Laos, in Vientiane and the southern province of Savannakhet. In last week's repatriation movement, a group of 442 Hmongs from the last Thai camp at Ban Napho in Nakhon Phanom province went to the reception centre of Hatsaifong in Vientiane. The NSC deputy secretary expressed confidence that the UNHCR would receive financial support from private donors. The remaining Laotians were a comparativeIy small number, he said. Laos is trying to speed up development and has achieved economic growth of no less than six-seven percent a year in the past three years.
