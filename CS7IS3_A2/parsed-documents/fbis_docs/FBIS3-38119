Mr Reynolds confirmed earlier that he would answer Mr Adams's request for clarification of the document he signed with Prime Minister John Major in London last month. But the Irish premier also made clear he could add little to a series of public speeches he made about the peace initiative and its aims. Mr Reynolds has sought to spell out the aims of the joint Anglo-Irish statement on a number of occasions in a bid to provoke a positive response from the IRA and its Sinn Fein allies. So far, though, the hardline republican movement has restricted itself to continuing consultations about the document with its membership. Sinn Fein-staged public meetings on the issue are set to continue throughout Ireland until the middle of next month, ahead of the party's annual conference in Dublin. In his reply to Mr Adams -- who sent a similar letter to Mr Major -- Mr Reynolds is understood to have spelled out the consequences of an end to the IRA terror campaign. This is thought to have centred on the timing of exploratory talks with Sinn Fein as part of the political process bid to resolve the issue of Northern Ireland. Since the December 15 signing of the peace statement, Dublin has been more willing than London to move towards clarification of the document, while stopping well short of any form of renegotiation. But in Dublin on Friday [28 January], after a meeting of the Anglo-Irish intergovernmental Northern Ireland Conference, Ulster Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew appeared to suggest that he, too, would clarify some of the issues. Deputy Irish premier and Foreign Minister Dick Spring, who jointly chaired the conference session, today said every opportunity to spell out the aims of the peace declaration had to be taken. He believed all the neccessary clarification was in the "carefully and well-thought-out document," but stressed: "We are not going to foreclose on the prospect for peace on this island."
