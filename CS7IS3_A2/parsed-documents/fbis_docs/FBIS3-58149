It approved six measures, only one of which -- the new trade union election regulations -- has been agreed to by the trade unions. The measures concerning reforming dismissal, collective bargaining, and regulations governing apprenticeship contracts, and increasing 1994 pensions by 3.5 percent are rejected by the trade unions and are the catalyst for the 27 January general strike. Agreement als has not been reached concerning the increase in the interprofessional minimum wage, which is scheduled to rise 3.5 percent -- the figure proposed by the government. Yesterday's cabinet meeting was of a markedly economic nature. The government approved the outstanding labor reform measures, including a draft bill reforming the Workers' Statute in the sections concerning dismissal and collective bargaining. It includes a measure on trade union elections, to which the main trade unions agreed, and is the only agreement reached in the dialogue process, which has been taking place since August. A second draft bill legalizes temporary employment agencies. The government approved regulations which finally pave the way for introducing apprenticeship contracts and amending the terms of part-time work and practical training, and gave the go-ahead for the measure on establishing a schedule for various 1994 social-security pension brackets. Pensions Increase The increase in all pensions from 1 January, as envisaged by the overall state budgets, will be 3.5 percent, and it is accompanied by a review clause which will be applied if real inflation is higher than forecast -- 3.5 percent. This guarantee clause embodies the formula proposed by the trade unions, although full agreement was not reached in the negotiations with the government because of some loose ends. Total 1994 expenditure on pensions will be 5.8 trillion pesetas -- 8.6 percent higher than this year. The maximum state pension will be 254,140 pesetas per month, equivalent to 3,557,960 pesetas per year. The 1994 interprofessional minimum wage (SMI) will increase by 3.5 percent, in contrast to the 6.5 percent proposed by the trade unions, which were demanding the recovery of the lost purchasing power. The SMI for workers over the age of 18 is set at 60,570 pesetas per month and 847,980 pesetas per year. For those under the age of 18, it will be 40,020 pesetas per month and 560,280 pesetas per year. Temporary workers over the age of 18 will be paid 2,870 pesetas per day, and those under the age of 18, 1,896 pesetas. Labor Minister Jose Antonio Grinan said after the cabinet meeting that the aim of the labor reform package is for "every possible job to become a reality." The government hopes that the measures approved yesterday will enjoy as much support in parliament as the reform of personnel recruitment achieved Tuesday -- over 90 percent. If any kind of agreement can be reached with the employers' organization or with the trade unions, it will be embodied in the texts submitted to the Congress [of Deputies]. Yesterday, Grinan stressed once again the government's desire to reach an agreement on incomes for the next few years, although it will undertake no initiative beyond what the employers' organization and the trade unions decide, because "the responsibility" for negotiating the agreements rests with them. In order to complete the package of measures approved yesterday, only regulations concerning the implementation of personnel recruitment reform remain. This reform involves introducing subsidies for enterprises -- mainly small enterprises -- that hire unemployed people receiving unemployment benefits. Jose Antonio Grinan specified yesterday that the government wants these initiatives to enjoy the greatest possible agreement among the political parties, and that the government is considering to which groups this assistance should be allocated and what kind of measure to introduce in order to ensure that the resources devoted to unemployment help establish active employment policies.
