The foreign ministers of Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela will also have to solve the problem created by the presence of Mexico in the ALADI after it joined the NAFTA with the United States and Canada. Article 44 of the Montevideo Treaty which created the ALADI obliges a member country to extend to all ALADI members the advantages it grants to third nations. Mexico asked that this article not be implemented and that it prefers bilateral negotiations with the other partners. In a news conference ALADI Secretary General Brazilian Antonio Antunes said today that the Eighth Council of Foreign Ministers will study the ways to strengthen the role of the association in "the house of regional integration." Antunes especially referred to the agreements reached in the current subregional and bilateral integration process taking place in Latin America, and on how to implement them. He also talked about establishing regulations to strengthen the current trends of intraregional trade. Antunes noted the "outstanding growth" of regional trade which according to figures of the ALADI Statistics Department reached $22 billion, some 18 percent higher than last year. In 1992 trade grew 29 percent in relation to 1991. Antunes said regional trade has become a "great choice for the region" and that world trade grew 3.3 percent in 1993. Regarding Mexico, the NAFTA, and its compatibilization with the ALADI, Antunes said a special group established after months of discussions an interpretative protocol of Article 44 to allow temporary exceptions to this article. He added that Mexico must carry out bilateral negotiations on ways to compensate for the losses caused by the agreement with third countries.
