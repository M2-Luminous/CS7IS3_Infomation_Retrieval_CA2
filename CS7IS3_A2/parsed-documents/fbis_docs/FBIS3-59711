This product will enable semiconductor makers to save time as it does not require molding. Moreover, it will minimize material waste, allowing manufacturers to economize on epoxy resins which currently are in short supply. Since production of powdered sealing material will be reduced, the ratio of the mini-tablet type will increase by from 40% to over 50%. There are three forms of semiconductor sealing materials, viz., powder, a large square tablet measuring a few centimeters on all sides, and a mini tablet in the size of an IC package. Semiconductor makers who use a powdered-form sealing material dissolve it before injecting it inside the IC package. With this method, some sealing material remains on the injection guide. As for the large tablet type, since its excess material must be cut off, it produces waste. Although the molding of the mini tablet requires an extra work, adding to cost, since it produces no waste, demand for it appears to be rising in recent months. Together with Hitachi's affiliate, Hitachi Chemical Malaysia, the Minamiyuki Plant is producing 9000 tons of semiconductor sealing materials a year. By February 1994, the Minamiyuki Plant plans to install additional molding machines. The explosion which destroyed the Sumitomo Chemical Ehime Plant (Niihama City) last July is creating concern for possible tightening of demand and supply of epoxy resin, a main raw material for semiconductor sealing materials. Following the example of Hitachi, which is reducing 20% of epoxy resins normally used, semiconductor makers will urge each sealing material company to implement efficient use of epoxy resins more in the future.
