While describing the report as "unfounded and baseless", the note asserted that "after the recent successful flight of Agni, all the objectives set for this mission have been achieved". This, in fact, suggests that the project is being abandoned altogether, whereas the HT report had only said it was being put on hold for the present. While not contradicting that the DRDO [Defense Research and Development Organization] had been denied the [Indian Rupees] Rs 5 crore it had sought for conducting three more Agni test flights, the official note says that fund requirements of different departments are decided "in relation to progress of various projects. Individual scheme-wise allocation is not undertaken at the Government level".
