The central question now is Norway's accession negotiations. Oslo's talks with the Twelve will resume tomorrow, and on the table are questions on which agreement is difficult, including our country's dispute about fishing resources. Good evening, Foreign Minister Solana. [Solana] Good evening. How are you? [Announcer] Tomorrow, or rather in a few hours time, you will be traveling to Brussels precisely for these negotiations. What does the enlargement of Europe, of the European Union, mean, and above all how will it affect our country? [Solana] Look, basically it means getting a stronger Europe from the political point of view: Three countries or four countries, if Norway joins in the end, are joining, and they are solid countries from the democratic point of view. And also a stronger Europe economically, with regard to everything concerned with the commercial life of Europe, because the countries that are joining are economically prosperous. Therefore, we have a greater ability to exert influence in the world, politically and economically. And from Spain's viewpoint it means opening new markets, and opening new markets basically in areas to do with agriculture and fishing, if we achieve what I believe we will achieve in the negotiations with Norway, namely an increase in our fishing quota, basically cod. [Announcer] Yes, Spanish fishermen are interested in recovering that historical right to fish in Norwegian waters, as you said, and Spain will therefore, now claim 7,000 tonnes of fish as a historical quota -- which it ceased catching in 1981 when we Spaniards were expelled. Are we going to recover those fishing grounds, and what is the Spanish position if Norway sticks to its position of not giving in? [Solana] Well, I want to speak very clearly to you, and through you to the citizens and fishermen of Spain. We will recover not only those 7,000 tonnes of cod that we are asking for as a historical right, which we have not had since 1981, but I believe that we will also be able to consolidate a further 3,000 or 4,000 tonnes of cod a year. And I want to say very clearly that if we do not achieve this objective or something close in the area of fishing we will not be able to celebrate Norway's accession to the European Community, the European Union. Spain is going to maintain a firm stance on this because we believe that it is our right. Our right is that when other countries join they too should open their markets. [Announcer] Mr. Solana, let us change the subject and talk about former Yugoslavia. Everything seems to indicate that the warring parties in former Yugoslavia will have to live together. It has also been made clear that the Americans and the Russians have made their mark as powers once more. What role is the European Union going to play in this conflict, then, and above all, what is the Spanish position on sending more Blue Helmets? [Solana] Basically you are asking three things. Firstly, I believe, and hope and wish, that the peace process is spreading now in the agreements between Croats and Muslims. I believe that the understanding on Sarajevo will be a very important step for peace, and I believe that it will be possible to give it a final form. As you know, there was a fresh UN resolution yesterday, even appointing a person to take charge of the administration -- not the complete administration yet, but that of the collective services of Sarajevo -- to imprint that sense of peace. Secondly, as for Russia and the United States, for many months the European Community has been asking for Russia and the United States to be involved, because it was very important when it came to turning to peace -- or to war then, to peace now. Russia has a very important role to play with the Serbs and we knew that the United States had to play an important role with the Bosnian Muslims, who needed the backing of the United States in order to turn in the direction that they have just turned. And thirdly, about further Blue Helmets. Spain has made and is making a great effort. The normal thing is for us not to send any more soldiers because we have already fulfilled our obligations, we are fulfilling our obligations very well. But if it were necessary, in extremis, I do not think that in any case we could send more than what in military terms would be a company or thereabouts. But it would be in an extreme case in which the need of further forces by General Rose or the United Nations were a requirement of great importance. [passage omitted]
