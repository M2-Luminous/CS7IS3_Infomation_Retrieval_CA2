At a hearing of the East Asian and Pacific Affairs Subcommittee under the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Lord said, "Frankly, we were surprised at the reaction. We are sorry about it. We think it was exaggerated beyond its significance." U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Asian and Pacific Affairs Thomas Hubbard made a speech at American University on Feb. 25 in which he stated that the United States advocated the repeal of South Korea's National Security Law, which prohibits any unauthorized contact with North Korea and any public statements or acts sympathetic to the North Korean regime. The remarks came under immediate fire as unwelcome interference in Seoul's internal affairs. Hubbard drew even more criticism because he was chief U.S. working-level delegate to nuclear negotiations with North Korea. Lord said, "Mr. Hubbard's speech at the time was overwhelmingly pointing to the good relations with South Korea, the positive steps they have been taking, including in democracy and human rights. And he in the course of that stated we believe that it would be better if the National Security Law were repealed. "He had no desire to interfere in South Korea's domestic affairs. He is a very good friend of South Korea and he believes, as we all do, they have made tremendous progress, and it's symbolized by President Kim, a 30-year dissident, being president." Lord said he did not want to exaggerate the issue's importance again. "I really would like to make the point that the South Koreans should be praised for their advances toward democracy and human rights. And this should not obscure that." He added, "I do note that I believe that since the speech, the South Koreans are now considering repealing the provision."
