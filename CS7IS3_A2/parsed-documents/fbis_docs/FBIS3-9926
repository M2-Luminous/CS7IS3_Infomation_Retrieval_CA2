That is why I listen to the Guatemalan people. With the law in our hands, we are going to continue working. [Reporter] You said on one occasion that you were being pressured into resigning? [De Leon] No, no, no, I have never been pressured. I sometimes have high blood pressure because of all the obstacles I must face. There is no pressure. I cannot resign. How could I resign a popular mandate? How would I stand? I have a huge challenge ahead. I do not think it would be wrong for me to say that I have been the Guatemalan president who came to the presidency under the worst conditions in the country's history, facing huge challenges, an economic crisis, and a political crisis that we are now overcoming. We have also faced a social crisis. I boarded a ship sailing rough waters in the middle of a hurricane. We are now sailing away from the hurricane, and I have to turn it over to my successor in peaceful waters or at a safe port. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] [De Leon] We are doing well at the international level. They are aware of our efforts. They are aware of the political commitment of the president and my administration. In that regard, it is logical for this to happen. If the human rights situation deteriorated, it would be logical for them to think that way. We are going to wait for the Geneva resolution. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] [De Leon] I prefer not to comment. Draw your own conclusions. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] as for human rights violations reported in Mexico [words indistinct]. [De Leon] Many things are said abroad. I would like them to say those things here in Guatemala. Here is where we have to rebuild Guatemala. Here is where we have to build peace. It is not going to be done outside Guatemala. Those who are here, those of us who have suffered the consequences of the armed confrontation that has lasted over 30 years, we are the ones who must truly assume that responsibility, and we have assumed it. To be saying in Mexico that we are violating human rights....[pauses] We must ask these people if they know where Santiago Atitlan is. We must ask them how many years it has been since they were here. I do not know, they may have been here before but under different circumstances. Thank you. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] [De Leon] We have already begun paying state workers according to the schedule. Of course we are not going to pay those who were involved in the (?strike), and there is proof of that.
