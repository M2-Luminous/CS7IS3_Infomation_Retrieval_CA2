FR941205-0-00119 FR941205-0-00026 Hawaii State Law Federal listing will automatically invoke listing under the State's endangered species legislation. Hawaii's Endangered Species Act states, ``Any species of aquatic life, wildlife, or land plant that has been determined to be an endangered species pursuant to the [Federal] Endangered Species Act shall be deemed to be an endangered species under the provisions of this chapter *␣*␣*'' (HRS, sect. 195D&hyph;4(a)). The State law prohibits cutting, collecting, uprooting, destroying, injuring, or possessing any listed species of plant, or attempting to engage in any such conduct. State law also encourages conservation by State agencies. Laws relating to the conservation of biological resources allow for the acquisition of land as well as the development and implementation of programs concerning the conservation of biological resources (HRS, sect. 195D&hyph;5(a)). National Environmental Policy Act The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement, as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuant to section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A notice outlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published in the Federal Register on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).
