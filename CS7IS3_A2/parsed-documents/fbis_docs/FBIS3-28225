Kantor and Hata reached the accord during a breakfast meeting at the ministry's Iikura Guesthouse. It was the second meeting between the two men since Kantor arrived in Tokyo on Tuesday. Kantor and Hata agreed that both Japan and the United States should strive to solve the "remaining problems" in the trade talks before the February 11 summit between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton in Washington, they said. Japanese and U.S. negotiators are supposed to draw up a progress report on the framework talks in time for the Washington summit, the third round of talks between the two leaders since Hosokawa assumed the office of prime minister last August, they said. But the two sides remain deadlocked over the definition of the "objective criteria" to measure the progress of foreign access to Japanese markets. The United States wants to set numerical targets but Japan opposes any indicators on the grounds they could lead to managed trade. Hata told Kantor he wants the report to balance all three main themes of the framework talks -- the macroeconomy, microeconomy and global cooperation, the officials said. Although Kantor and Hata did not argue over "objective criteria" in the morning talks, they appeared to have shared the perception that the "remaining problems" concern the difference between Japan and the U.S. over their respective definitions of the term, the officials said. The subcabinet-level negotiations will be held in Washington as early as next Monday, the officials said. Hata told a press conference that through a series of talks between Kantor and high-level Japanese officials this week, Japanese and U.S. negotiators were able to confirm their "strong intentions" to successfully wrap up the bilateral framework talks. Hata said Kantor gave high marks to Japan's efforts to introduce measures to stimulate the economy and quoted him as saying the developments of the past few days over the introduction of a new tax system are "dramatic." Meanwhile, a senior Trade Ministry official also said Friday the Japan-U.S. subcabinet-level negotiations will resume in Washington as early as next Monday. The official, who declined to be named, said a broad agreement has already been reached on government procurement of medical and telecommunications equipment, except their numerical targets. Japan is willing to reach an accord on automotive issues but it has no intention of yielding to the U.S. demand for numerical targets for Japanese imports, the official said.
