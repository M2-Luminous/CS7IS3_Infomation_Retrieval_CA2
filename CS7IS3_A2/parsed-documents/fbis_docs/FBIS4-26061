Officials from the Aisheng group under Northwest Engineering University said that in one or two years they plan to export two new models of unmanned planes, which can be used in monitoring, location and tracking of targets on the earth. The group has already exported over 30 of its unmanned planes to South Asia, Africa and South America. The good performance of these planes have been highly appreciated by the overseas customers, said the officials. Since 1958, the group in the capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province has produced more than 6,000 unmanned planes of 13 types, which have found a wide use in border patrols, the anti-drug fight, aerial surveying and disaster observation. The group's latest unmanned plane was developed last year. The officials said its overall technical level is state-of-the-art internationally. Weighing less than 85 kg, the plane can fly as high as 5,000 m at 100 m per second. It has an optimum flight duration of one hour or 40 km and is equipped with advanced electronic instruments, said the officials. The group has received many inquiries from overseas about buying unmanned planes for various uses, the officials added.
