Kim had lunch with former Presidents No, Chon Tu-hwan and Choe Kyu-ha at Chongwadae [presidential office] on Monday, and explained the policy of his government. No said he was sorry his people had burdened Kim and blamed his own "lack of virtue" for their wrongdoings. Kim did not respond in detail. "The president's unchangeable firm belief is that there cannot be exceptions, according to the principle of equity, in dealing with those who are on trial for their irregularities and obviously violated the law," a member of the presidential staff said. "The cases of former government officials will be dealt with in strict fairness under the law and according to the principle of justice without sanctuary."
