Discussing privatization, the president said it suffers from disorder and abuse of authority by officials. The first stage of the process, hopefully to be completed this year, was very successful, Brazauskas said. He urged the government to carefully prepare a legal basis and a program for the next stage of state property privatization. The president said the previous year was quite successful because economic stabilization was achieved and foreign trade became much livelier. Brazauskas said the principal task this year will be to sign a free trade agreement with the European Union. He noted, however, that "very serious conclusions need to be drawn" in stimulating foreign investments and attracting foreign banks to Lithuania. A new law on banks should be adopted as soon as possible, he said. "I think commercial banks should not be treated so skeptically." In his opinion, the central bank should actively cooperate with commercial banks and other private structures, in order to boost the circulation of capital and to increase credit resources. The president said a number of serious problems remain in industry and agriculture. Brazauskas expressed hope that production will finally begin to grow this year.
