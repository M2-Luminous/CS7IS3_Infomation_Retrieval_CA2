The resolution said the meeting discussed the issue of promoting the independent and peaceful reunification of the country by forming strong units based on great national unity to counter outside forces, the United States and Japan, and the South Korean puppet clique that are trying to make a dangerous adventure under the pretext of the North's "nuclear issue." It called on all the regional headquarters overseas to actively take part in the movement of "10,000 people's declaration" with a view to strongly urging the United States to observe the conclusions reached at its talks with the DPRK, rallying the forces of the whole nation to smash Japan's scheme to become a military power and having the Korean Armistice Agreement replaced with a peace agreement. The resolution also called for making efforts to successfully hold the fifth pan-national rally slated for this year as a great festival of the whole nation.
