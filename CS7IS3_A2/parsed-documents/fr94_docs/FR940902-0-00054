FR940902-0-00054 FR940902-0-00010 It is the Department's experience that allocation based on ``benefits received'' has not added much workload burden and alternative methodologies have been developed by most JTPA entities. For many JTPA entities, allocating administrative costs based on each program's share of total direct costs, salaries and fringe benefits, or total program costs compared to the total direct costs, total salaries and fringe benefits, or total costs of all programs administered by an entity are acceptable methodologies. The Department cautions, however, that some of these methodologies may not be acceptable for particular JTPA entities. Each organization is different and costs, particularly direct costs, are charged differently. It will require a self-examination by each entity to determine the best approach. Assistance can also be obtained from the State's or SDA's auditor. The use of financial-based methodologies is encouraged; however, the Department will accept any treatment of pooled costs and allocation methodologies that are consistent with GAAP applicable in each State. The Department cautions that a methodology that is based solely on contribution to the pool may be questioned in audits. Finally, in response to the questions about the proper charging of title II&hyph;B administrative costs at the State level, ยง627.440(b) establishes the JTPA cost objectives for State-administered programs and the State's overall administration of title II activities. To clarify this issue, however, ยง627.440(b)(10) is revised in the final rule to specifically include State administrative costs associated with title II&hyph;B. Classification of Costs Section 627.440 establishes the minimum levels of accountability for JTPA funds, provides the Secretary's definitions of the cost categories, and provides specific treatment for the classification of certain types of costs that have frequently been at issue in the JTPA system. At ยง627.440(c)(2), the regulations provide that incentive funds, both title II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C, received by an SDA may be combined and used without regard to cost categories or cost limitations. A number of commenters on this provision were pleased with the treatment accorded incentive funds, however, several commenters appeared to have missed or misread this provision. No change is made to the final rule. Within the definitions of the JTPA cost categories, at ยง627.440(d), a number of comments expressed concern about the treatment of tuition, work experience wages, insurance, and the difference between public information costs and the costs of outreach. Another frequent comment concerned the treatment of project directors and other positions that perform both administrative and program functions. Commenters on this subject fell into two groups. One group, which appeared to have missed the provisions of paragraph (e)(1), argued that the costs of such positions should not all be charged to administration. Some requested that such positions be charged entirely to training. The other group, focusing on paragraph (e)(1), commented on the burden and mechanics of time distribution. The Department agrees that the language in the preamble of the interim final rule concerning tuition was somewhat inconsistent and more restrictive than this section of the regulations. The Department's intent is to permit costs frequently associated with tuition costs, such as entrance fees, to also be charged to the direct training category. The Department believes that the regulation adequately expresses this intent. In addition, tuition, entrance fees, and other usual and customary fees of other educational institutions, such as postsecondary vocational institutions specified at section 481(c) of the Higher Education Act, are another example of payments to vendors that are appropriately charged to the direct training category. The final rule removes the reference to section 141(d)(3)(B) of the Act to clarify that such payments to any educational institution in a vendor relationship that also satisfies the other criteria of paragraph (d)(1)(vi)(B), are direct training costs. Where tuition is part of a subrecipient agreement, rather than a vendor relationship, and the agreement also includes other components, the costs of tuition are chargeable to the direct training category. A new paragraph (d)(1)(vii) is added to the final rule specifying that payments to participants that represent hours spent in a direct training activity (such as work experience) are direct training costs. In addition, the word ``insurance'' is removed from the definition of administration since this is a type of cost that should be charged or allocated to each of the benefitting categories. Some commenters raised the question of how the costs of curriculum development or training materials should be charged. The Department believes that these costs are properly charged to the direct training cost category.
