Nearly 4 million people and more than 14 million heads of livestock are suffering from the dry spell. "The shortage of water was so serious that many locals in arid areas in Northwest Gansu Province had to get water from far away," the Beijing based State Anti-Drought Office (Sado) said yesterday. The drought, which began last fall, has hit the most important winter wheat and cotton-producing areas. More than 5.3 million hectares of winter crops in 12 north, northwest and northeast provinces have been affected, while another 8.7 million hectares are running out of moisture, the latest statistics show. Even though snow fell in some drought-ridden areas in mid- February, the moisture level was far from enough to meet the demands of winter wheat. This summer's harvest is now being threatened. The precipitation, ranging from 1-10 millimetres in most of the drought-stricken areas, was too little to fully ease the persistent drought, while more rainfall is badly needed for the winter-crop growing, "drought officials told China Daily. As a result, more than 35 per cent of winter wheat seedlings in northwest Gansu Province are not growing well and many are dying. And the latest weather forecasts provide little hope of escaping the drought soon. The dry spell is expected to continue through the end of the month as rainfall will be less than in previous years throughout northern regions and even in some parts of the south.
