The radio of the Bosnian Croat state of Herceg-Bosna said on Saturday that Moslem forces in the region of Kiseljak, Kresevo and [word indistinct] continue violating the ceasefire agreement by opening mortar and infantry fire on Croat positions. The radio said that the situation in the other Moslem-Croat fronts was somewhat quieter but that the Moslem army continues reinforcing its positions, regrouping and bringing in fresh troops. The Zagreb-based Croatian radio, however, said that on Saturday afternoon the Croat part of the Herzegovina city of Mostar was hit by a shell fired from the Moslem positions, after which a general alert was sounded. Moslem Sarajevo radio claims that Croat snipers in Mostar continue firing on the separation line and civilian facilties in the Moslem-controlled part of the city. According to the radio, in the southern parts of Mostar, the Croats are torching the remaining Moslem homes to prevent their owners from returning. The Bosnian Moslems and Croats, who have been fiercly clashing in central and southwest Bosnia since last spring, are continuing their battles despite a draft agreement on a Moslem-Croat federation in this ex-Yugoslav republic which was signed early this month in Washington under strong U.S. pressure. The military part of this agreement was on Saturday signed by the commanders of the Moslem and Croat forces, Rasim Delic and Ante Roso.
