Katyal; all quotation marks as published] [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 14--The Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, today urged friends of Pakistan--an obvious reference to the United States, among others--to persuade Islamabad to be responsive to India's approach for normalising and building up bilateral relations. The Pakistan Prime Minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, had heightened the anti-India rhetoric to unprecedented levels on Kashmir which, naturally, aim in the way of dialogue he said. Mr. Rao underscored the futility of this course, for eventually she would have to come to the negotiation table. Her own father had signed the Shimla agreement and someone had to tell her, according to Mr. Rao, to adhere to it. The Prime Minister made these points in a conversation with the visiting U.S. Senator, Mr. Daniel Patrick Moynihan who said he would convey these views to his President, Mr. Bill Clinton. Mr. Moynihan gave a similar assurance when Mr. Rao stressed the urgency of all out efforts to end the Bosnia crisis which was fuelling the fires of Muslim fundamentalism all over the world. The current state of Indo-Pakistan--and also Indo-U.S.--relations figured at length at the meeting the Prime Minister had with Mr. Moynihan who is the chairman of the U.S. Senate Panel on South Asia and a former Ambassador to India. Framework Exists Mr. Moynihan, who sought the Prime Minister's views on Indo-Pakistan ties, was told that a framework of dialogue between the two countries already existed in the form of the Shimla Agreement. India, according to Mr. Rao, had offered to continue talks for good-neighbourly relations but Pakistan's actions in continuing its support to terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir and its world-wide anti-India propaganda were major barriers. According to Mr. Moynihan, the United States continued to favour the Shimla Agreement framework for Indo-Pakistan talks. The present rhetoric was not going to help Pakistan, said Mr. Rao. Unless Islamabad jettisoned the Shimla framework there was no justification for its leaders to go from place to place. "I am a serious-minded person. I do not want to indulge in rhetoric. It would be waste of time and energy and would encourage tension," Mr. Rao said. `Strange' It was strange, according to the Prime Minister, that India should be blamed for human rights violation when it had an independent judiciary, free press, and democratic system--and now a human rights commission to probe cases of excesses. Mr. Moynihan remarked: "You have my sympathies and respect." Regarding Indo-U.S. relations, they discussed both the positive and the negative aspects in the bilateral field. Mr. Moynihan was happy at the growth of economic ties, as evidenced by the level of U.S. investments in India last year, which was higher than that of the previous 40 years. He expressed satisfaction at the progress of the economic liberalisation programme in India. `We don't have bomb' As the discussion turned to nuclear non-proliferation, Mr. Rao assured Mr. Moynihan that India did not have a bomb and therefore there was no question of dismantling it. If they (Pakistan) have it they should dismantle it, he said. Mr. Rao's reference to "friends of Pakistan" was obviously intended to be a hint to the United States to try to restrain Pakistan from pursuing its no-holds-barred anti-India campaign. In the immediate context, it could mean persuading Pakistan to continue the dialogue begun last month at the level of Foreign Secretaries on the basis of the six Indian proposals, regarded as positive by Washington, instead of using the international for anti-India tirades. As a matter of fact, the Pakistan Foreign Secretary, Mr. Shahryar Khan, was now in Washington--obviously to seek U.S. support to his Government's move to use the U.N. Human Rights Commission for an anti-India campaign. This could be an appropriate occasion for the United States, if it so wanted, to counsel Pakistan against recklessness. Mr. Moynihan's visit here comes in the wake of the Senate panel's hearings where the Clinton Administration's policy on South Asia and the style of the Assistant Secretary of State, Ms. Robin Raphel--the cause of extreme disquiet here--were sharply criticised. Mr. Moynihan strongly defended India on the human rights issue, saying that its Constitution provided firm guarantees of individual freedom and its record since 1947 was impeccable. This was followed by a warning about the futility of mechanical application of the standards of civil liberties to situations of ethnic conflicts.
