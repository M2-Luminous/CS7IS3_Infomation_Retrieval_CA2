The agreement was signed in Washington by officials from the consortium, the Russian Ministry of Fuel and Energy and the local government of Sakhalin, the officials said. The consortium comprises Mitsui and Co. and Mitsubishi Corp. of Japan, McDermott Inc. and Marathon Oil Co. of the United States and the Royal Dutch/Shell Group. They said the consortium will start exploration efforts in a few years, subject to approval by the Russian federal legislature and the local Sakhalin assembly, and start production early in the 21st century. Surveys have shown the area proposed for exploration has potential deposits of 100 million tons of crude oil and 400 billion cubic meters of natural gas. Crude oil production from the project, which is expected to cost approximately 1 trillion yen, is expected to amount to a maximum of 180,000 barrels per day. All the crude oil produced will be exported to Asia, including Japan, while two-thirds of the natural gas will be exported and the rest will be consumed in Russia, the officials said.
