FR940712-0-00018 FR940712-0-00007 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 215 [Docket No. 940414&hyph;4191; I.D. 032494B] Marine Mammals; Subsistence Taking of Northern Fur Seals AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Final rule; fur seal subsistence harvest estimates on the Pribilof Islands. SUMMARY: Pursuant to the regulations governing the subsistence taking of northern fur seals, NMFS is required to publish an estimate of the number of seals expected to be harvested in the current year to meet the subsistence needs of the Aleut residents of the Pribilof Islands, AK. Additionally, this document amends existing fur seal regulations, making the subsistence harvest take estimates applicable for 3 years instead of 1 year. The intended effect of this rule is to limit the take of fur seals to a level providing for the subsistence needs of the Pribilof residents while minimizing negative effects on the seal population. EFFECTIVE DATE: This final notice of subsistence need estimates is effective July 12, 1994, and applies to the harvest beginning June 23, 1994. The final rule that amends existing fur seal regulations, making the harvest estimates applicable for 3 years instead of 1 year, is effective August 11, 1994. ADDRESSES: Dr. William W. Fox, Jr., Director, Office of Protected Resources, 1335 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Steve Zimmerman, (907) 586&hyph;7235, Margot Bohan or Michael Payne, (301) 713&hyph;2322. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The northern fur seal ( Callorhinus ursinus ) population is considered depleted under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) (50 CFR 216.15(c)). The subsistence harvest of northern fur seals on the Pribilof Islands, Alaska, is governed by regulations found in 50 CFR part 215, Subpart D_Taking for Subsistence Purposes, and has been regulated to minimize negative effects on the population. These regulations were published under the authority of the Fur Seal Act, 15 U.S.C. 1151 et seq., and the MMPA, 16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq. (see 51 FR 24828, July 9, 1986). The purpose of these regulations is to limit the take of fur seals to a level providing for the subsistence needs of the Pribilof Aleuts while using humane harvesting methods, and to restrict taking by sex, age, and season for herd management purposes. The St. Paul and St. George Islands' harvest estimates are given as a range, the lower end of which can be exceeded if NMFS is given notification and the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), determines that the subsistence needs of the Aleut residents from either of the islands have not been satisfied. Conversely, the harvest can be terminated before the lower range of the estimate is reached if it is determined that the subsistence needs of the Pribilof Aleuts have been met or the harvest has been conducted in a wasteful manner. NMFS published a summary notice of the 1993 fur seal harvest on November 1, 1993 (58 FR 58297). The proposed estimates for the 1994 fur seal subsistence harvest and the proposed rule to make the harvest take estimates applicable for 3 years instead of 1 year were published on May 13, 1994 (59 FR 25024). Following acceptance and consideration of public comments on this proposal, NMFS is publishing this final notice of the expected harvest levels for 1994, as follows: St. Paul Island: 1,645&hyph;2,000; St. George Island: 281&hyph;500. In addition, this document amends existing fur seal regulations, making these take estimates applicable for 3 years instead of 1 year.
