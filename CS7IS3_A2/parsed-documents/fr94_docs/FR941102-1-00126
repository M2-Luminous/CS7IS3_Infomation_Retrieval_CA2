FR941102-1-00126 FR941102-1-00020 The Commission also is proposing to require broker-dealers who receive payment for routing orders to include information on the confirmation. Proposed Rule 10b&hyph;10(a)(7)(B) would require, for any monetary payment for order flow received, confirmation disclosure of the range of payments received on a per share basis. Proposed Rule 10b&hyph;10(a)(7)(iii)(C) would require, for any non-monetary payment for order flow received, an estimate by the broker-dealer of the range in value of non-monetary compensation on a per share basis. Because it may not be possible to identify immediately after execution which orders are subject to payment for order flow arrangements or the pro rata value of a specific order, the Commission is proposing to require disclosure of an estimate of the range in value of compensation that may have been received, stated on a per share basis. Proposed Rule 10b&hyph;10(a)(7)(iii) (B) and (C) also would require, for any non-monetary payment for order flow received, a statement that the nature and source of such compensation will be furnished upon written request of the customer. In crafting the proposed amendments, the Commission is mindful of the concern that requiring quantification of monetary but not non-monetary payment for order flow could result in broker-dealers moving toward potentially undisclosed compensatory practices, such as non-monetary payment for order flow. 8 Thus, it has sought to require disclosure of non-monetary payment for order flow similar to the disclosure requirements established for monetary payment for order flow. This is intended to provide customers with equivalent information to evaluate a broker-dealer's order routing arrangements, and to remove any regulatory disparity between monetary and non-monetary payments. 8 Some commenters argue that treating monetary and non-monetary payment for order flow differently creates an incentive for dealers to restructure cash payment arrangements into payments in kind. The Commission invites commenters to address whether the proposed amendments would accomplish these goals, and whether there are other ways to accomplish these goals. The Commission specifically requests comment on the ability of broker-dealers to determine whether a non-monetary payment is in return for order flow, and their ability to estimate the value of the various forms of non-monetary payments. B. Internalized/Affiliate Practices Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3, as adopted, requires broker-dealers who receive payment for order flow to disclose their policies for determining where to route orders that are subject to payment for order flow absent specific instructions from customers. That Rule would not expressly require broker-dealers to provide information about their order routing policies if instead of receiving payment for order flow in return for routing orders, they simply executed the orders for their own account. 9 9 In recent years, multi-service broker-dealers, clearing firms, and others have acquired interests in specialist units, particularly on regional exchanges, although several specialists on the New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') and American Stock Exchange (``Amex'') are affiliated with upstairs firms. These firms then route small customer orders for execution to their affiliated specialist. See Division of Market Regulation, Securities and Exchange Commission, Market 2000: An Examination of Current Equity Market Developments (Jan. 1994) (`` Market 2000 ''), Study II at 9 and Exhibit 29. The Commission recently discussed the potential implications of internalization for the structure of the national market system in the context of proposals by two national securities exchanges to establish or extend marketplace programs that might facilitate internalization practices. See Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 34078 (May 18, 1994), 59 FR 27082 (May 25, 1994) (File No. SR&hyph;BSE&hyph;93&hyph;12); 34493 (August 5, 1994), 59 FR 41531 (August 12, 1994) (File No. SR&hyph;CSE&hyph;94&hyph;06). Internalized/affiliate practices also were discussed in Congressional hearings on market structure a few months ago and, earlier this year, the Division of Market Regulation discussed this topic in its Market 2000 Report. See Market 2000, Study II at 9 and Exhibit 29; Oversight Hearing on the Structure of the Marketplace with a Focus on the Market 2000 Report and the Unlisted Trading Privileges Act of 1994 Before the Subcomm. on Telecommunications and Finance of the House Comm. on Energy and Commerce , 103d Cong., 2d Sess. (1994). The Commission is concerned that internalized/affiliate practices may raise questions similar to payment for order flow practices regarding the obligations of brokers to their customers, such as whether firms that internalize order flow are providing best execution of customer orders. 10 In proposing Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3 in October 1993, the Commission invited comment on the implications of these practices and whether additional disclosure would be desirable. 11 Seven commenters addressed internalization/affiliate practices; six favored a regulatory response 12 and one opposed it. 13 10 An extensive discussion of the ``best execution'' obligation appears in the Adopting Release as well as the release proposing Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3 for comment. See Adopting Release, supra note 1 at nn.26&hyph;36 and accompanying text; Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33026 (October 6, 1993) 58 FR 52934, 52937&hyph;52938 (October 13, 1993) (``October 1993 Proposing Release''). 11 See Id. at n.38. 12 Letters to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC, from: Jules L. Winters, Chief Operating Officer, American Stock Exchange (``Amex''), dated December 21, 1993 (``Amex letter''); Robert F. Price, Managing Director, Alex. Brown & Sons, Inc., dated December 23, 1993; George A. Brown, Brown & Company, dated December 2, 1993; John N. Tognino, Executive Vice President, Capital Markets and Trading, Charles Schwab & Co. Inc., dated December 8, 1993; Chris A. Hynes, President, State Street Brokerage Services, Inc., dated December 1, 1993 (``State Street letter''); and Thomas W. Clegg, Sr., Vice President, Wheat First Securities, Inc., dated November 30, 1993. The Amex stated that internalization impedes price discovery and makes best execution less likely, and because internalized order flow provides the executing market maker with a dealer spread on every internalized trade, there is little incentive for the dealer to narrow the quoted spread. See Amex letter. One brokerage firm argued that the failure to regulate internalization creates a competitive advantage for large integrated firms. See State Street letter. 13 This commenter noted that in an exchange environment, ``the continuous affirmative obligations imposed on exchange specialists and the auction-type trading process inherent in trading on exchanges limit the extent to which internalization can be accomplished.'' See letter from John I. Fitzgerald, Executive Vice President, Legal Affairs and Trading Services, Boston Stock Exchange, Inc., to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC, dated December 10, 1993.
