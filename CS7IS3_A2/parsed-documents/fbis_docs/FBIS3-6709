Eijiro Hata, minister of agriculture, forestry and fisheries, said that though the policy of the ministry's Food Agency is to use only Japanese rice for school meals, schools will be supplied with foreign rice if the principals agree to it. He made the remark to the committee on agriculture, forestry an fisheries of the House of Councillors. The Food Agency has announced that only domestic rice should be used for school meals, but some educators have proposed that use of imported rice would be of educational as well as nutritional value to school children by giving them a direct experience related to the current rice controversy.
