FBIS3-50327 "dreeu018__a94026" FBIS-EEU-94-018-A Document Type:Daily Report 27 January 1994 ANNEX Slovakia Paper Cites `Hypocritical' Hungarian Policies AU2701114194 Prague CTK in English 0945 GMT 26 Jan 94 AU2701114194 Prague CTK Language: English Article Type:BFN [Excerpt] Bratislava, Jan 26 (CTK) -- [passage omitted] The daily REPUBLIKA, published by the state-run Slovak News Agency TA SR, describes the policies of Budapest towards ethnic minorities and complaints by Hungarian ethnic minority representatives in Slovakia concerning their position as hypocritical. The daily notes that according to official data, of Hungary's population of 10 million in 1991, 92 percent were Hungarians, three percent Romanies, and one percent each Germans, Slovaks, Jews, south Slavs, and others. However, according to the same official data, 98 percent of the Hungarian population speak Hungarian while only two percent speak other languages. The daily also points to the contradiction between Hungary's Law on Ethnic Minorities, under which they have the right to be represented in Parliament, and the election law in which such a right is not embedded. "This testifies to the fact that through the Law on Ethnic Minorities Hungary just wants to deceive the world, while the practice is quite different. A similar situation is also with ethnic minorities and the number of its members. On one hand Budapest allegedly recognized the existence of minorities but on the other it actually rejects their existence, because almost every Hungarian citizen speaks Hungarian. And weighing all pros and cons, citizens are right in the long run because the assimilation of non- Hungarians in Hungary is tough and pitiless. To round up all the facts we will receive a gross bundle of hypocrisy in front of the whole world, Europe, and especially of neighbors," the daily writes. We can say without exaggeration that in Slovakia the Hungarian minority enjoys super-rights. In spite of this many of them maintain that they are being deprived of their basic rights. It is possible to live with hypocrisy and to deceive many for some time. But if hypocrisy acquires a double dimension -- that Slovaks and other minorities enjoy all rights in Hungary and the Hungarian minority in Slovakia is deprived of all rights -- it is necessary to speak about pathological abnormality, a disease which should be dealt with in order for it not to paralyze the whole European region as it has already done, for example, in the Balkans, REPUBLIKA concludes.
