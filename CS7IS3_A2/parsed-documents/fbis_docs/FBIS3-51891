This is because most companies declare losses every year. If they admit to making money, they report earnings in the bracket with a top rate of 20 percent. This profile, which better resembles a nation in Africa, is unreal. In Venezuela, it is simply a matter of not paying taxes because of loopholes in the law and because the agency that does the collecting has also fallen victim to the crisis. These are the conclusions of Gustavo Garcia, who teaches at the Institute of Higher Administrative Studies (IESA). Garcia recently completed an investigation of the Venezuelan tax system for the World Bank. "Corporations pose a very serious problem," he said. "Tax evasion rates are extremely high. Some 23 percent of the businesses that file returns claim losses. This is happening in a business world of some 250,000 corporate entities." "In addition, almost 60 percent report earnings of between one and 500,000 bolivars. In all, 83 percent of the businesses that file returns are reporting either losses or earnings of under 500,000 bolivars a year. A scant 4.8 percent claim annual earnings of between a million and two million bolivars." Garcia noted that the latest version of the income tax dates from 1991. Under 1991 rules, the rate for businesses that earn under two million bolivars is 20 percent, not the maximum rate of 30 percent. "And if you count how many claim profits of between one bolivar and two million bolivars," he said, "it turns out that 73 percent of the firms filing returns pay at the 20 percent rate. [Carquez] Does this mean that only 5 percent of corporations are paying what they really owe? [Garcia] Precisely. This is the 5 percent that reports earnings of over 2 million bolivars. [Carquez] But that is unreal. It makes Venezuela look like some country in Africa. [Garcia] If it were true, the nation would be bankrupt. The average corporation pays 281,343 bolivars in income tax, a figure comparable to the most backwards countries in Africa. This comes to $3,517 at the 1992 exchange rate. If company earnings average this little for a whole year, then they are all broke. In constant 1984 prices, it works out to 29,826 bolivars, which at that year's exchange rate is $2,983. However, there are also companies that pay high taxes due to the political and economic fallout that comes from looking like tax dodgers. This shows that the margin for avoiding and eluding taxes is enormous. Many taxpayers do not just break the law. They also take advantage of all its shortcomings to lower their tax burden. [Carquez] What must be done about taxes? [Garcia] Except for oil companies, what you see in the Venezuelan tax system is a persistent drop in collections from both individuals and corporations since 1986. This reflects the extremely high rate of tax evasion in Venezuela. Evasion slashes potential revenues from corporate taxes by about two thirds. The rate is lower for individuals, but figuring out how much lower is far more complicated. The reasons Garcia gives for tax evasion include: weak laws; poor administration; and limitations in the tax code itself. These, he said, "have been building up over time and got even worse during the latest overhaul." Garcia called the value added tax and the corporate assets tax fundamental to the modernization process. But he warned that major shortcomings remain. They make tax collection more difficult because the political will is missing to beef up the agencies that run the Venezuelan tax system. To make up for lost income tax collections, the government has resorted to other taxes, and this has led to huge economic distortions. "With income tax revenues on the slide, payroll taxes have gone up significantly. This partly explains the erosion of real wages in Venezuela and social unrest. Moreover," Garcia said, "the taxes have not been offset by improvements in the services for which they were collected." Payroll taxes have gone up even faster then the rate of inflation, he noted. The 1989 cap of 3,000 bolivars on social security deductions first climbed to 15,000 and last year reached 45,000. "And even though tax hikes were necessary," he said, "the problem is that payroll taxes were the only ones that rose. "The problem is that there is a direct tax on work. This combined with the system of social benefits makes jobs more expensive in Venezuela. So companies tend not to raise wages because it also raises their liabilities. Every increase triggers a jump of 18 percent in the payroll tax." Adding payroll and income taxes together shows how much individuals are paying. "Only those with incomes above 2,000,500 bolivars a year pay taxes comparable to the deductions from the wages of workers making less than 45,000 bolivars a month. "Instead of direct taxes on those with higher earnings, they are imposing more direct taxes on workers. The Venezuelan tax system has strongly contributed to lower wages by overtaxing work while losing its ability to collect from individuals." Once the value added tax and the tax on corporate assets are approved, Garcia expects they will help ease the tax situation in Venezuela. That will leave the income tax in need of three major reforms. Drastic measures are needed to eliminate exemptions, such as the one for agriculture, that are still on the books. Slashes are also needed in the deductions allowed as investment incentives and in many personal tax deductions. When the income tax reform took effect, he recalled, the number of individual taxpayers dropped from 1.3 million in 1991 to only 350,000 in 1992. "We tax 1.75 percent of a population of 20 million and 5.4 percent of the work force," he pointed out. Garcia thinks the cap on payroll taxes must go. He wants this done in order to benefit workers, not companies, and he wants tax delinquency to be punished. "The problem here is that the only sanction with a jail term is the one against tax collectors who keep the money. It is curious that in Venezuela violations of the tax laws are not regarded as crimes," he said. Likewise, he added, the agency that collects the taxes has to be fully autonomous. It must be autonomous administratively, and it must have its own budget. The way to achieve this is to give the agency a budget equal to a percentage of "between 2 and 3 percent" of revenues from nonpetroleum taxes.
