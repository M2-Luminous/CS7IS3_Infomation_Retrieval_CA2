At the sound of the word "fuel," hearts begin to ache with dread in Russia and the near abroad, because this word has long become a synonym for inflation. The problems associated with the TEK look different, however, from the angle of car owners and housewives, well drillers and geologists-prospectors, exchange speculators and VPK [military-industrial complex] brass. Following this line, it would be interesting to find out what the leadership of the TEK itself sees as a priority. The minister of fuel and power engineering met with journalists a few days ago and told them that on one hand he is grateful, if not to all, then almost all, those who write about the TEK; on the other hand, they mainly write about the wrong things or place the wrong emphasis. As a sort of methodological aid, Yuriy Shafranik described three main directions--the three component parts of the TEK's problems. First. We treat TEK output barbarically. The fuel and energy complex is the most "social" of all the sectors. One can somehow survive for two to three days without bread, but not without various kinds of energy. Nevertheless, we expend energy right and left, and expend it stupidly. Not a single product in Russia is produced according to Western standards of energy-intensiveness: For instance, we expend 400 kw-hours to produce a tonne of ammonia, while in Europe this indicator does not exceed 80. Another 25 percent is regularly lost in transportation: For 400 hecacalories produced, about 100 are "dissipated" in pipes. Next, losses during production: In the world more than 12 percent is considered a disaster; here, less than 30 percent is an occasion for celebration. A counterquestion. Is it not the TEK itself that accounts for two out of three aforementioned factors in energy losses: production and transportation? Second. Rate disparity hurts the fuel and energy complex, while in turn influencing all of industry. During the "stagnation" years physical persons paid 4 kopeks per kw-hr, enterprises--2. Approximately the same rate structure is used in the entire world. Today the average rate is 24 rubles [R] per kw-hr, but individuals pay an average of R5. At the same time, regional rate differentials today measure a factor of eight, which should be no more than 2.5 (the regional lobby, naturally, resists rate leveling). This rate disparity hurts industry, which is simply unable to pay. Hence, the insolvency crisis and, as a chain reaction, the TEK's dismal situation. Counterquestion No. 1. Everybody feels sorry for industry, of course, but does this mean that ordinary citizens have to pay for everything--is it not enough that they pay their taxes? Counterquestion No. 2. Leveling rate differentials between regions apparently assumes raising them for those who pay too little, and lowering them for those who carry an excessive burden. Does across-the-board resistance indicate that in the process of "leveling," the regions with low rates are simply being "pulled up" to the level of more costly neighbors? Third. The fuel and energy complex needs money, for which there are no sources. The TEK includes mainly very capital-intensive productions. Money is needed not only for long-term programs and new technologies. Unless 12 planned construction projects are completed in the near future, the energy supply for eight krays and oblast will deteriorate substantially. At the same time, money is needed not only for the TEK's development, but also for the long-awaited restructuring--liquidation--of money-losing enterprises (the corresponding programs already have been drafted with respect to the coal, oil, and gas sectors; in addition, five mines in the Kuzbass [Kuznetsk Basin] need to be closed urgently). However, so far investment is not an option. The TEK has practically no internal investment reserves. Consumers currently owe the entire complex more than R20 trillion. True, now the money will be recovered faster: The recent government decree permits TEK creditors to withdraw money from accounts of debtor enterprises on a nonacceptance basis (immediately, without additional coordination and regardless of whether the debtor acknowledges the debt). But even after money is collected, because of the difficult tax situation only a small part can be reinvested. Ninety percent of the TEK output's price is comprised of items outside of the complex--that is, the price largely consists of tax rates, excise taxes, and reappraisal of fixed assets (the latter boosted prices by 20 percent). Out of the remaining 10 percent they have to pay salaries, cover costs, and only after that invest in new programs. They see as a solution, on one hand, creating a sensible structure of rates (read: individuals should pay more than enterprises--V.O.), and on the other--large-scale conversion to joint-stock holding. First, joint-stock companies, once they are set up, will not allow speculators to feed off them. Second, the mechanism of operation of joint-stock companies will make it possible to shift to internal clearing prices due to working with customer-supplied material. Third, value-added tax can be removed from the company's internal clearing. All of this will enable the TEK to reduce prices for their products, which as a result will undermine inflation at its roots. Counterquestion No. 1. Is it not the citizens--who, in the minister's opinion, pay too little for energy--who in the final analysis pay for all the taxes, excise taxes, and reappraisal of fixed assets? Counterquestion No. 2. Will the money for the completion of the aforementioned 12 construction projects come from the budget? If so, then on which expense line item and how will the TEK compensate for this new hole in the budget? Counterquestion No. 3. Does not one of the reasons the TEK does not have any internal reserves have its roots in the somewhat strange position of heads of TEK enterprises: Instead of seeking a compromise with strike committees they immediately transfer all monetary revenue into salaries and other pay-outs? A few counter- (and very arguable) contentions. The author doubts that he will live long enough to see anyone anywhere in Russia reduce prices for anything at their own initiative. The author has no doubt that many journalists in their search for culprits in some or other problems have formed a sort of personal image of the enemy. For some it is the directors' corps; for others--the defense sector; and for others it is probably the TEK. This is not very good, since it is not the defense sector or the TEK that are at fault--as Mikhail Zhvanetskiy used to say, "the faults of the entire system have started coming out..." Nevertheless, the author is doubly certain that in addition to the group of problems enumerated by Yuriy Shafranik, many other questions are no less important and significant: quotas, licenses, and other bribe-exports; poor justification of enterprises' and sectors' claims to budget means and budget preferences; unclear regulations regarding foreign investment (one day "put the squeeze on them," and the next day, on the contrary, "let them in"), and so on, and so on. It would be good, of course, to see these topics disappear from newspaper pages--but only as a result of a fundamental improvement in the situation.
