A proposal to implement such measures was mentioned during a recent meeting between representatives of the U.S. Government and the Andean Group member-states--namely, Ecuador, Venezuela, and Colombia. The U.S. plan is designed to get Latin American nations to allow the United States to conduct all types of investigations into regional banking matters. Meanwhile, CBN President Olga Arosemena de Guizado has indicated that current banking secrecy regulations in Panama do not pose any obstacles to such investigations. [Begin Arosemena de Guizado recording] At this time, any duly authorized representative of a foreign government can come to Panama and officially request, through the relevant national authorities, an investigation into any crime without having to breach so-called banking secrecy rules. [end recording] Unfortunately, according to the CBN president, any bank in Latin America can be used to launder money. The CBN is currently installing modern computer equipment that will allow it to better monitor deposits made in the country's banks. [Begin recording] [Arosemena de Guizado] What we could have is a client who would go to one bank and deposit 5,000 [currency not specified], and then go to another and deposit another 5,000, and so on, and so on. [Alvarado] [Words indistinct] [Arosemena de Guizado] In such a case, we would never know for sure whether this company is the same one that deposited the same amount in another bank. These kinds of situations could take place. [end recording] The modern computer equipment currently being installed was donated by U.S. AID at a cost of $100,000.
