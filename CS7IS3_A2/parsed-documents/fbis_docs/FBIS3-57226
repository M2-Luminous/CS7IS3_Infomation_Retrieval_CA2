This is 111 percent of what was planned. The energy output of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power station accounted for 42.76 percent of the total amount of electricity produced by all the nuclear power stations. At the same time, the extension of the period of maintenance work at the Khmelnytskyy nuclear power station and individual faults in the operation of all of the nuclear power stations led to the failure to produce 8,071,110 kilowatt/hours more. Last year, a total of 239 accidents were recorded at nuclear power stations. As a result of 62 of them, power units were halted, and 109 led to power reductions. None of the accidents involved an increase in the radioactive background at the stations or around them. In 1993, the share of the energy produced by Ukrainian nuclear power stations increased again. While in 1990, it amounted to 25.7 percent; in 1991 -- 27.1 percent; and in 1992 -- 29.4 percent; in 1993, it reached 32.9 percent. Since 18 January 1994, five Ukrainian nuclear power stations have been producing 42 percent of the total daily output of electric energy. Problems with deliveries of organic fuel are making themselves felt.
