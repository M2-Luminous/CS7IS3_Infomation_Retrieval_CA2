Introduction Forward-looking information 1 occupies a vital role in the United States securities markets. Investors typically consider management's forward-looking information important and useful in evaluating a company's economic prospects and consequently in making their investment decisions. 2 Analysts and other market participants report that they view consideration of management's own performance projections, i.e., earnings and revenues, to be critical to their own forecasts of a company's future performance. As such, forward-looking information is often considered a critical component of investment recommendations made by broker-dealers, investment advisers and other securities professionals. 3 1 The term ``forward-looking statement'' is defined in current Rule 175 as limited to the following: (1) A statement containing a projection of revenues, income (loss), earnings (loss) per share, capital expenditures, dividends, capital structure or other financial items; (2) A statement of management's plans and objectives for future operations; (3) A statement of future economic performance contained in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included pursuant to Item 303 of Regulation S&hyph;K or Item 9 of Form 20&hyph;F; or (4) Disclosed statements of the assumptions underlying or relating to any of the statements described in (1), (2), or (3) above. 17 CFR 230.175. 2 Advisory Committee on Corporate Disclosure to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Report to the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, 95th Cong., 1st Session, (Committee Print 1977) [hereinafter the ``Advisory Committee Report'']; Securities Act Release No. 6084 (Jun. 25, 1979); see also H.

Wheat Commission Until the early 1970s, the Commission prohibited disclosure of forward-looking information. 4 This policy was based primarily on the Commission's perception that such information was inherently unreliable, and that unsophisticated investors would place undue emphasis on the information in making investment decisions. 5 4 Securities Act Release No. 5362 (Feb. 2, 1973). 5 Disclosure to Investors: A Reappraisal of Administrative Policies Under the 1933 and 1934 Acts (1969) at 94 [hereinafter the ``Wheat Report'']. Acting on the recommendation of a number of securities analysts, 6 the Commission formed a Disclosure Policy Group (the ``Wheat Commission'') to study a variety of disclosure issues, including whether projections should be permitted or mandated in Commission filings. 6 Security analysts had suggested that the Commission permit ``controlled'' projections of sales and earnings in prospectuses and other documents filed with the Commission.
