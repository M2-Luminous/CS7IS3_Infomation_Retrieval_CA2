Following a high-speed growth of 13.2 percent in 1992, the economy continued to grow at a super high-speed of 14.1 percent in the first half of 1993. On this basis, whether or not China can truly take a big step forward in 1994 in building a socialist market economy and in restructuring while maintaining a particular rate of economic growth and effectively curbing inflation will be a key to whether or not China's economic development can enter a new stage in the 1990's.

Overall Analysis of Economic Development Trend in 1993 In the first half of 1993, China's economic growth rate was the highest in recent years. The GDP increased by 14.1 percent, and total industrial output value increased by 25.1 percent. Moreover, there was excessive expansion of investment scale, and the growth rate of fixed assets investments of the whole society reached as high as 61 percent, of which the growth rate of investments by state-owned organizations reached 70.7 percent, deducting price factors, the actual growth is over 30 percent, far exceeding the actual growth rate of the GDP. The investment structure is still not sufficiently rational. First, besides an increase in the proportion of investments in communications and transportation, the proportion of investments in energy, raw and processed materials, agriculture, and other basic industries all are in decline. Take state-owned organizations, for example. The total volume of investments in the first half of 1993 increased by 63.6 percent compared with the corresponding period of 1992, but the investments in energy, raw and processed materials, and agriculture grew by 18.1 percent, 51.9 percent, and 28.6 percent respectively. Second, the proportion of nonproductive investments was too high, the growth rate of productive investments by state-owned organizations in the first half of 1993 was 58.6 percent, and that of nonproductive investments was up at 83.1 percent. In particular, the investments in real estate grew too rapidly, and commodity housing investments by state-owned organizations grew by 144 percent. Such a "double high" problem and excessive increase in monetary issue that appeared simultaneously led to a speed-up of inflation. In the first half of 1993, the commodity retail price index of the whole society rose by 10.8 percent, and the price index of the cost of living for city and town residents rose by 13.5 percent, of which that of 35 large- and medium-sized cities rose by 17.4 percent. The CPC and the government have taken necessary measures, and starting from controlling the investment scale and strengthening the financial order, have stepped up macroeconomic regulation and control, and initial success has been achieved. By the end of September, the average growth rate of total industrial output value declined by one percentage point compared with the average growth rate of the first half of 1993. The increasing posture of fixed assets investments slowed down, the growth rate of investments by state-owned organizations from January to September dropped by nearly four percentage points compared with that of the first half of 1993, and newly operated projects reduced markedly. Prices of the means of production turned from speedy rise to relaxation, residents' savings rose rapidly, and the foreign exchange market was tending toward stability. Taking an extensive look at the year 1993, the general trend of economic development is: First, the economic growth for the whole year will maintain a high speed, and the GDP growth rate will be about 13.5 percent. However, the growth situation in the second half of the year will slow down smoothly, and the increase value growth rate of primary, secondary, and tertiary industries will be about 3.5 percent, 20 percent, and 11 percent respectively. As the measures for regulation and control of the central authorities have inhibited newly operated projects to a certain extent, the growth rate of investments in the second half of the year will drop distinctly. But the fixed asset investment scale of the whole society for the year will break through the 1,100 billion yuan, with a growth rate of over 40 percent. Second, both income and consumption of the residents present a rising situation, the market is flourishing and is tending toward stability, and the nominal growth of the total volume of social commodities may reach 23 percent, but the growth of income and consumption of rural residents will still be obviously lower than the average level of all China. Third, the economic growth rate and the investment growth rate in the second half of 1933 have somewhat reduced, but thanks to impacts by the cost push factor and by the excessive scale of monetary issue, and due to the steady rise in consumption demand, prices still continuously increase, and the rise in various price indexes will break through 10 percent. Fourth, the monetary and financial situation has started turning for the better, but will still be beset with difficulties, and new monetary issue will reach a record- breaking level. III. The Importance of Strengthening Macroregulation and Control An important feature in the development of the national economy in 1993 is that when the speedily growing economy probably entered an "overheated" stage, the CPC and the government introduced measures for macroregulation and control. These measures will produce the following direct results: 1. They will curb further deterioration of monetary difficulties and the chaotic situation, prevent excessive expansion of the scale of fixed assets investments of the whole society, avoid further aggravation of inflation, guarantee basic balance between general supply and demand, favorable to maintaining mid-term and short-term economic stability and mid-term and long-term sustained economic growth. 2. They will be favorable to restructuring, to concentrating funds to speed up the construction of basic facilities, relaxing the constraint of the "bottleneck" sectors of the national economy, and laying a foundation for long-term economic development. This is obviously different from the readjustment in 1988-1989. 3. It is an extremely necessary measure and a broad and long-term view to start by strengthening the monetary order. Strengthening the economic order in every aspect, and building up a necessary market order, are important conditions for successfully building up the system of a socialist market economy. The essence and cause for various problems that have cropped up in the present stage of economic growth are not so much of an "overheated" economy as "over-chaotic" economy. Various over-chaotic orders are the fundamental causes that give rise to an "overheated" economy in certain aspects. Therefore, not only monetary order should be strengthened, but orders in various other aspects, such as fiscal levy order, various securities market order, and real estate market order, as well as the working order of various levels of administrative and management departments, should also be seriously strengthened to build up a strict and effective system to be rational follow-up actions for strengthening the monetary order. These are not only the requirements for developing a market economy, but also fundamental measures for maintaining social stability and solidarity throughout China. Another important feature of economic development in 1993 is that China's economic growth is entering a new stage of development. The 14th CPC Congress clearly pointed out that the goal of reform was to put into practice the system of a socialist market economy. Theory and practice have told us that no matter which kind of social system is in place, the market cannot automatically reach general equilibrium and optimum performance, and intervention or regulation and control by external factors is absolutely necessary. Such intervention or regulation and control not only refers to day-to-day macroeconomic regulation and control, but more important it refers to necessary environment and institutional establishments. In the first stage of China's reform, in light of influences by the traditional planned economy, we should emphasize the market economy; in the new stage, we should shift the emphasis onto building a market economy. In the present strengthening of order, the central authorities not only point out the necessity for continued reform, but also put forward the initial framework for building a socialist market economy. This is fundamentally different from the control over an "overheated" economy on previous occasions, and is therefore of important significance. On the other hand, we should also pay close attention to the problems that may probably be brought out in the course of carrying out these measures. First, as the deposit interest rate has increased by a big margin, and the policy of savings to retain value has been put into practice, the loan interest rate will also be compelled to increase by a big margin. This will add to the difficulties of funds supply, and increase the pressure on the cost of enterprises for fundraising, in particular the pressure on that of state-owned enterprises, thus increasing the scope and amount of losses. Second, tight money will result in "debt chains". With the decline in economic growth rate, intermediate demand will greatly decrease, and enterprises with unsatisfactory economic operations will meet with the problem of difficult sales in a market whose temperature is dropping. It can be foreseen that "debt chains" will be a problem that enterprises must encounter in 1994. Third, the consumer goods market basically remains in a state of supply slightly greater than demand. To increase interest rates will encourage the tendency of savings, and reduce consumption. This will only inhibit future investments, with little impact on existing investments. As there has been too big a proportion of investments in general processing industries in the last two years, the production capacity built up therefrom will create new supply within a subsequent period of time. Moreover, there have been excessive increases in the prices of investment goods in the last two years, which add to the cost of future products, and it is extremely difficult to eliminate this kind of price rise pushed by cost. This problem will create obstacles to the stability and balanced development of the economy for a period of time to come. Fourth, the interest rate of long-term deposits at present is too high, and apart from affecting people's expectations it will create problems for banks' long-term operations. First, the actual interest rate that the banks are required to pay for long-term deposits is too high, which increases banks' operational difficulties. Second, in banks' operation of funds, the growth rate of loans for fixed assets is much higher than that of other loans, and the cost of this type of loan will be high, which will create an unfavorable impact on basic facilities construction that mainly relies on bank loans for the source of funds. Fifth, various measures taken at present are an integration of market measures with administrative measures, which basically fit in with the actual situation of tracks changing in China's present economic structure. However, they are of an "emergency" nature, and it is unavoidable for the problem of "one cutting" to emerge in the course of implementation. Moreover, it is also necessary to avoid difficulties in restructuring resulting from the protection of large and influential profit and taxpayers by local governments. The fundamental solution to these problems can only rely on the thoroughgoing reform of the monetary system and the financial and taxation system, and on the establishment and improvement in the system of a socialist market economy. IV. Several Possibilities for a "Soft Landing" in 1994 The measures for macroeconomic regulation and control introduced at present have both to solve the problems of an "overheated" economy, and to maintain appropriate high-speed growth of the national economy, and bear an obvious characteristics of "soft landing." A "soft landing" is not only difficult in operation and control, but there are also several possible results. The first result is: Due to the fact that the strength of various measures for regulation and control are properly controlled, that various levels of leadership and economic management departments are closely coordinated, and that all of China is well coordinated and acts in unison, the momentum of an overheated economy is brought under control, the inflation rate starts declining, and the economic growth rate has dropped to about 10 percent. In a relatively tight economic environment, there is an increase in the weight of reform in the monetary and banking system and the financial and taxation system, and a push for state-owned enterprises to move toward the market. The investment scale both maintains growth and is kept under control, the investment structure is improved, and investments in communications, transportation, post, and telecommunications continue a high growth rate. Moreover, the proportion of investments in agriculture, energy, raw and process materials, and other basic industrial sectors increases. The proportion of nonproductive investments and that of investments in general processing industries decreases, and the overall investment scale maintains a growth rate of about 20 percent. On the other hand, as the residents' income increases, the consumer demand grows steadily, and social general demand maintains a moderate degree of growth. Stimulated by demand, industrial production maintains a growth rate of about 15 percent, and is within the range that the "bottleneck" sectors can support. Economic development is smoothly transitioning to a period of high-speed and steady growth, and can be sustained for a number of years. These are the results which we expect will appear. The key to achieving these results lies in carrying out in-depth reform in an overall manner, building up a complementary system of a socialist market economy, and ensuring an orderly development of the national economy. The emphasis on macroeconomic regulation and control should take structure readjustment and optimization as the center, and effective control of inflation should be an important prerequisite for achieving this goal. The second result is: The strength of macroeconomic regulation and control is too strong, and excessive contraction leads to excessive loss of speed in economic growth, resulting in a "hard landing." The investment scale and price rises are brought under control, but the emphasis of regulation and control is not placed on structure readjustment and optimization. Only speed reduction in economic growth is enforced to fit in with the "bottlenecks" without paying attention to developing the "bottlenecks" sectors. This will not only bring about losses in economic development, but will also become the starting point of the next round of an "overheated" economy. The third result is: As a result of evading the problem of restructuring or being satisfied with a smattering of a subject, far less taking rectification and chaos control and building up the system of a socialist market economy as the final goal of the present macroregulation and control, under the pressure of a number of problems brought by slowing down the rate of economic growth, economic reform stops moving forward, and the deep-level contradictions that impede healthy economic development have not been overcome. Hurriedly relaxing money and control over investment scale and loosening the gate of monetary issue for the sake of stimulating economic recovery leads to an early rebound of the economic growth rate, thus further deteriorating the economic structure. The constraint on communications and transportation is further strengthened, the contradiction between energy supply and demand becomes tense again, the inflation that has just been curbed is revived like dying embers glowing again, and the economic order becomes chaotic. The expectation of residents has deviated from normal, and even provoked factors of social instability, which compels the decision-making departments to take "emergency brake" measures and carry out large scale readjustment and contraction of the economy, thereby resulting in unnecessary losses and seriously affecting the development of a socialist market economy. V. The Characteristics of Economic Development in 1994 As long as no major mistake is made in 1994, the growth of the national economy will continue a momentum of smoothly slowing down. This will provide favorable conditions for strengthening industrial restructuring, and carrying out an overall reform with market economy as a guide. In analyzing the characteristics of macroeconomic development in 1994, we should pay major attention to these three aspects: Growth rate, investment scale, and inflation. 1. The economic growth rate will drop by a moderate degree, but will maintain a high level of growth. The growth rate of the national economy in 1994 will be lower than that of the previous two years, but it is forecast that it will still stay at about 10 percent. There is both necessity and possibility for the economic growth rate to drop by a moderate degree while a high level of growth is maintained. Its necessity lies in: First, moderate reduction of the growth rate fits in with the cyclical stage of China's present economic development. Moreover, it plays the role of appropriately mitigating the constraining contradiction of the "bottleneck" sectors and curbing large price increases, and ensures that the work of economic restructuring will have a good environmental condition to concentrate financial and material resources on vigorously developing the construction of basic industries and basic facilities. Second, maintaining economic growth at a high level is beneficial to avoiding big rise and fall in economic development, reducing the shock caused by cyclical fluctuations, ensuring the stability of economic development, and maintaining a situation of social stability and unity. Third, a moderate reduction in the economic growth rate without a serious loss of speed conforms with the requirements of long-term, steady, and healthy development, and conforms all the more with the requirements of quickening in every aspect the pace of building up the system of a socialist market economy. Such an economic growth rate fits in with the general principles and measures for implementation being formulated by the central authorities for building up and developing a socialist market economy. In analyzing the possibility of achieving such a growth rate, we should see both the possible constraining factors and also various kinds of motive forces. The constraining factors come mainly from two aspects: The "bottleneck" constraint and the system constraint. The constraint by the "bottleneck" of communications and transportation is known to all, and there have been large increases in their investments in the last two years, but time is required before these investments truly play their role. Excessive demand for raw and processed materials has made the increase margin of the prices level of the means of production exceed the 1988 level. The symptoms of energy supply shortages have appeared, and China's energy export in 1991 was about 40 million tons, less than the amount of growth of energy consumption in 1992. With its high-speed economic growth, China will change in one or two years from an energy export country to an energy net import country. Only by appropriately reducing economic growth rate can the "bottleneck" constraint be relatively alleviated. Judging from the supply capacity of the "bottleneck" sectors at present, an economic growth of about 10 percent in 1994 can be basically supported. The system constraint is mainly expressed in the delay in monetary and financial reforms and the delay in functional transformation of government departments. This will provide an opportunity to various factors that cause "over-chaotic" economic activities, and lead to an overheated economy. When high inflation is brought about by an "overheated" economy, the authorities cannot but take emergency braking measures. The motive force that promotes economic growth is mainly investment demand and consumption demand. Since the 1990's, there have been marked increases in the residents' income level, which has reinvigorated the consumer market that has been weak for a time and has led to a steady increase in total consumer demand. In 1994, the consumption growth rate will come close to the GDP growth rate, and the consumer goods market will remain prosperous. The growth of consumption is not just an expansion in quantity, more importantly it is an improvement in quality. Competition in the consumer goods market will become increasingly fierce. The growth of consumer demand will create favorable conditions for economic growth, in particular for the growth of light industrial production and the development of the tertiary industry. Moreover, high savings, which are beneficial to solving the problem of funds shortage, will also constantly bring vitality to economic development. 2. The growth situation of investment scale will reduce, but to maintain a moderate degree of investment is still required, so as to strengthen restructuring. Investment pull is the major motive force of super high-speed economic growth that started in 1992. In 1994, thanks to subjective and objective reasons, the growth rate of fixed assets investments of the whole society will decline by a considerable margin, but the total amount of investment, it is forecast, will still exceed 1.35 trillion yuan, and the actual investment growth rate will still be higher than the actual growth rate of the GDP by one to two percentage points. First of all, to maintain a particular scale of fixed assets investments of the whole society is necessary for achieving a smooth transition to super high-speed operation of the national economy, and it is helpful to preventing economic slides and the intensification of contradiction between general supply and demand. Second, to rationally readjust the economic structure, strengthen the construction of basic facilities, and expand the supply capacity of the "bottleneck" sectors, it is also necessary to strengthen the investments in agriculture, in communications and transportation and post and telecommunications industries, the energy industry, and the industry of some raw and processed materials, so as to solve the problem in the two aspects of investment structure and total amount. To cope with the "bottleneck" constraint, it is improper to take an attitude of "cutting the feet to fit the shoes". We should carry out active and positive economic restructuring by following the principle of concentrating funds and taking preferential measures for developing the "bottleneck" sectors. Not only the strategic actions of vigorous development of basic industries will contribute to economic growth, but the gradual mitigation of the "bottleneck" constraint will also promote an overall and high-speed growth of the national economy. Third, due to unbalanced development in reform and opening-up, and thanks to the differences in the original conditions, there is now an ever-greater gap in economic development between the coastal areas and the interior and remote areas, which has become a problem that requires an immediate solution. To speed up the economic development of the interior and remote areas, and to reduce regional gaps, it is also necessary to increase investments in these areas by in-depth reform. Finally, initial success has been achieved in the macroregulation and control measures taken by the central authorities in 1993, there have been large increases in the residents' savings, and the banking and monetary system has concentrated through rectification considerable amount of funds that can be made use of, thus providing funds conditions for maintaining a certain scale of total investment amount in 1994. Maintaining a particular scale of fixed assets investments in 1994 will be an important propelling force for maintaining a certain economic growth rate and speeding up economic restructuring. The measures for regulation and control taken by the central authorities in 1993 have been generally well received by economic circles overseas, which has not only strengthened the confidence of investors overseas for short-term stability of China's economy, but has also enabled them to see a bright future of long-term, healthy, and high-speed development of China's economy, and helped them extend their vision of investments from coastal areas to China's hinterland. In 1994 and in a number of years to come, foreign capital will play an ever more important role to maintaining a continuous growth of the scale of fixed assets investments in China. The proportion of local investments in the fixed assets investments of the whole society rises continuously. In 1992, the proportion of local investments in total investments reached 60 percent. From January to August 1993, in investments in state-owned enterprises alone, the proportion of local investments rose to 62 percent, with a growth rate of 74.3 percent. In 1994, local investments will still occupy an important proportion, but the tendency of local government behavior which runs counter to the policies of the central authorities has not always been effectively overcome. In economic development and maintaining growth rate, local initiatives should be brought into play and relied upon. However, one of the formidable enemies in strengthening macroregulation and control and maintaining economic stability is blindness in local development. To solve this problem, we should of course rely on certain administrative means, but the key still lies in building up as soon as possible the system of a socialist market economy, and standardizing the behavior of various levels of government from the angle of system, so as to obtain the results of a coordinated, steady, and all-round development of China's economy. 3. It is difficult to reduce the pressure of inflation, and prices will still remain high. Due to influences by the cost push factor and excessive monetary issue during the previous period, their delay effects and the introduction of a number of necessary reform measures have made the control over inflation in 1994 become an extremely arduous task, and it will be very difficult to keep the price rises below 6 percent. It is estimated that the retail price level of the whole society in 1994 will come close to 10 percent, and the price index of the living cost for city and town residents may possibly break through 10 percent. In 1992 and 1993 prices of raw and processed materials as investment goods rose by a big margin, which resulted in increases in the cost of products of the manufacturing industry. As the increase margin is too big, it is very difficult for enterprises at the present technological level and economic strength to digest it completely, and about 50 percent of the price increases of the means of production, it is estimated, will be shifted to the prices of the consumer goods. The prices of investment goods in 1993, it is estimated, will increase by 18.5 percent, of which about 9 percent will be shifted to the prices of the consumer goods in the following year and the years afterwards. These are price increases pushed by cost, and can in no way be overcome by further reduction of demand. Another important cause of price rises is the large increase in the amount of money in circulation. A 30 percent growth is estimated for 1993, and it is impossible for it not to produce a push on prices in 1993 and 1994. Plus influences by other factors, the margin of increase in social retail prices in 1994 will come close to 10 percent. If certain errors again appear in macroregulation and control and management in 1994, it will be possible that prices rise will again break through 10 percent. VI. Policies Proposals Based on the above analysis, successfully achieving "soft landing" and maintaining a particular economic growth rate in 1994 should be the goal of macroeconomic work. Optimizing the industrial structure should be the central task of various kinds of economic work, and curbing inflation is an important prerequisite for achieving the above goal. Quickening the pace of reform systematically and in an overall manner and building up the system of a socialist market economy are fundamental guarantees for a sustained, high-speed, and healthy development of China's economy. 1. Properly control the strength of macroregulation and control. Pay attention to historical experiences and lessons, continue implementation and improvement in the regulation and control measures taken at present, keep strengthening the monetary order, the financial and taxation order, and the order of various kinds of market, and do better jobs in macroregulation and control. The present "soft landing" work is in a state of direct regulation, many problems accumulated during the previous period have not been effectively overcome, and the difficulty is therefore greater. There are some positive factors in the present regulation and control. For example, the impact on nonstate-owned enterprises is greater than that on state-owned enterprises, the impact on inhibiting local investments is greater than that on investments by the central authorities, and the impact on group consumption is greater than that on the residents' consumption. But we must also see that to solve fundamentally the problems in various aspects of macroeconomic operation, exceedingly difficult and unremitting efforts are still required to solve the problems in structure and mechanism. It is necessary to guard against "one cutting," and to carry out classified guidance aiming at regions and industries, so as to ensure a successful realization of "soft landing." At least before the second half of 1994, it is not suitable to introduce measures that stimulate excessive resumption of economic growth, and earnestly put the stress of development on readjusting and optimizing the economic structure. This is because: First, the economic growth rate will slide in 1994, but a growth of about 10 percent is still high-speed, and a growth of over 15 percent of total industrial output value is quite spectacular. Even if the economic growth rate for 1995 is reduced by a further 2 percent, a growth rate of 8 percent is not low. Second, the pressure of inflation in 1994 will be enormous. There were excessive monetary issues in 1992 and 1993, and considering the cost push and other factors, even if tight money will continue in 1994, the price rises will also come close to 10 percent, and stimulation of economic recovery will only aggravate inflation. Third, the tense situation of communications and transportation where problems are most concentrated in the current cycle will not be relaxed before 1995. It is impossible for the energy shortage problem, the shortage of oil and electricity in particular, to ease up in 1994, and even if there are large increases in energy investment, it is difficult to see the results in one or two years. The stress of macroeconomic policies in 1994 should be placed on speeding up reform and restructuring. If we do a good job in economic restructuring in 1994, and earnestly increase the strength of investments in basic industrial sectors, appropriately control the investments in other sectors, then we can first ensure a moderate degree of growth of investment demand (it is suitable to keep the margin of investment at 20 to 25 percent), and achieve "soft landing." Second, we can increase the supply of the "bottleneck" sectors, and lay a foundation for the next economic recovery, and even for a long-term and high-speed growth of the national economy. 2. Readjust and optimize the industrial structure, and lay emphasis on strengthening the investments in agriculture, the communications and transportation and post and telecommunication industries, the energy industry, and the industry of some kinds of raw and processed materials. It is necessary to improve the investment performance by investment structural reform to better solve the "bottleneck" constraint problem. At present, it is necessary to solve well problems in five aspects: First, the development of the "bottleneck" sectors mainly relies on the increment readjustment of increasing the supply capacity by investments, it is therefore necessary to enlarge the quantity of state investments (including those by the central and local authorities). This makes it necessary to increase the state revenue and increase the proportion of revenue in the national income by financial and taxation structural reform. In expenditure, it is necessary to enlarge the proportion of investments in basic facilities, so as to ensure the source of funds. Second, it is necessary to reform the investment structure, carry out the joint stock system and various other forms of funds raising and financing by long-term loans and issue of construction bonds, and fully draw and guide social funds and foreign capital to make investments in basic facilities construction. Third, the state is required to work out and carry out rational industrial policies, and promote a speedy development of basic industries and basic facilities construction. Fourth, it is necessary to further reform the pricing structure, follow the principle of the market economy, mobilize the initiatives of investments and operations by economic benefits, and speed up the pricing reform of communications and transportation and energy within the scope allowed by the inflation rate. Fifth, it is necessary to actively introduce market competition mechanism in industries of communications and transportation and post telecommunication which are highly monopolistic. To break industrial monopoly in unnatural monopolistic sectors is the most effective method for developing these sectors. 3. Strictly control inflation. The goal for controlling inflation in 1994 should be: Relax the intensity released by the pressure of inflation and strive to lower the rate of price increases in 1955 and the years afterwards. In 1994 we should strive to control the price increase rate at about 8 percent without breaking 10 percent, and actively create conditions to try to keep the rate of price rises in 1995 at about 6 percent. So long as there is no further expansion of investments in the recent period, and appropriately control the growth rate of money in circulation, it is possible to achieve this goal. This makes it necessary to speed up the monetary and financial structural reform, make proper arrangements in monetary and financial planning, control basic currency growth rate, the amount of monetary issue in particular, and control the credit scale strictly in accordance with the need of a moderate and high-speed economic growth. According to forecast simulation, new monetary issue in 1994 should be controlled within 100 billion yuan, and new credit scale should be limited to 550 billion yuan. However, one of the causes for the excessive increase in the price index of the residents' living cost is too rapid increase in the prices of daily necessities and services which have relatively small income elasticity. In this respect, the guiding control and mandatory control on the part of the state should play a role to inhibit influences by artificial factors. 4. Quicken the pace of building up the system of a socialist market economy, make preparations for various reforms, and make 1994 a year of major reform. Beginning from now, we should make preparations. First, study the opportune moment and measures for reform, and the balanced and overall developments of various aspects to ensure an orderly progress of reform. Second, make necessary public opinion preparations to ensure that the psychological expectation of the resident are normal. Third, study the bearing capacity of various aspects about the measures of reform, so as to keep a rational quantity limit and the scope of strength under control. Fourth, study the problems and deviations that may possibly crop up in the course of implementation, work out preventive measures aiming at specific goals, speed up the building of economic legal system, and ensure the successful progress of reform. Speed up the pace of reform systematically and in an overall manner, beginning first from the reform of the monetary and financial systems, followed by various other complementary reforms. This will enable China's reform to enter a new stage. It not only can ensure a stable development of the national economy in the next one or two years, but will also open up a vast world for high-speed development of China's economy in this century and over a long period of time to come.
