This year was extremely difficult for the Haitian people who hope for a different kind of year for 1994. On the occasion of this end of the year, politicians and legislators invade the radios and the press to address the nations. In various messages, those political and parliamentary personalities are calling for a solution to the crisis. First of all, the Senate president calls on Haitians to overcome narrow concepts and to keep what is essential. In his message, Firmin Jean-Louis asks the various protagonists of the crisis not to consider themselves the unique holders of truth. The president of the National Assembly believes that national reconciliation is still possible in 1994. Here is a summary of this speech, made on 30 December by the Senate president, with Edner Jean: [Begin recording] [Jean] Of 1993, Firmin Jean-Louis will carry a souvenir of the year loaded with anguish, broken dreams, a country that has reached rock bottom. However, he recalls that 1993 also carried with it the most ambitious dreams -- the dream of seeing the resolution of the crisis on the one hand, and on the other, a new start including democracy, a state of law, economic and social progress. It is the opposite, however, that the Senate president observed this 30 December. He noticed among other things the pauperization of the middle class, the annihilition of the country's deprived classes, a phenomenon caused by the worsening of the economic situation. On the political plane, it is generalized institutional crisis: The state runs on the sly; the Cassation Court lodged an appeal against a decree pensioning off its president; the supreme audit court and its administrative litigation are floundering in an unending internal crisis; the government is basically headless; the parliament is working administratively, but without political efficiency, notes the president of the National Assembly, before adding that from this absence of a state follows the emergence of nonconventional forces which exercise enormous pressures on the entire society -- pressures, threats, and even violent and deadly actions. He takes as proof the latest events in Cite Soleil. [Jean-Louis] The systematic violations of human rights did not stop multiplying. The most recent and horrible episode would perhaps be the one in Cite Soleil about 72 hours ago. Assured of impunity, individuals, in broad daylight, put the burning torch to more than 200 small houses, leaving fathers and mothers in despair, mourning, and in fear of counting their dead ones. [In Creole] About three days ago, we know what happened in Cite Soleil, where people set fire to more than 200 family houses. They killed people, and people are so afraid they dread counting the dead bodies. [Jean] However, he refuses to speak of definitive failure, nor that he sees futility in the painful sight of a nation seeking its way. President Firmin Jean-Louis, and with him the entire Senate, are rather of a constructive, productive optimism, expressing a desire to see Haitians triumph in the concepts of great and small concord, in order to keep what is essential: the reconciliation of the nation with itself. [Jean-Louis in French] To President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, to Prime Minister Robert Malval and the government's members, to the general command and members of Haiti's Armed Forces, to the leaders and members of the various churches working in the territory, to the political leaders, to the labor unions, the socioprofessional associations, to the students, members of the media, to the representatives of the international community, to the 18 January elected legislators who voluntarily agreed to refrain themselves until the seating of the arbitration committee that we impatiently await, to all of you, Haitian brothers and sisters from here and everywhere in the world, we fervently wish you courage, health, and happiness. May each of us stop considering himself the unique holder of the historical weight of our founding ancestors. May we be able, Haitians and foreigners, to show restraint in the face of another's opinion. Then and only then will there be a start in Haiti, an era of a state of law and, we hope to see one day [word indistinct] of new times, awaited by all. [Jean] Through this message at the end of the year, Firmin Jean-Louis showed that he still enjoyed the trust of the other members of the Senate Bureau who all supported his statements, but silently, as if to say that a compromise is still possible between the Alliance and the constitutionalists.
