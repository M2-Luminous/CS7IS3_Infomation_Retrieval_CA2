Second, what is taking place is an ethical, political, and media crime against liberties in Lebanon. Third: I have never heard of the so-called Jiris Tawfiq al-Khuri. Simon Edmond al-Kharyati was a member of the Lebanese Forces before the dissolution of the militias. With regard to those against whom arrest warrants were issued, they left Lebanon more than one year ago. [Tarabayh] Do you admit some of these elements were members of the LF before the dissolution of the militias? [Ja'ja'] Yes. [words indistinct] I told you who were with LF when it was still militias. [Tarabayh] Who, among the suspects, were members of the LF before the militias were dissolved? [Ja'ja'] Among the detainees, Simon Edmond al-Kharyati was a member of the militias. Tony Ilyas 'Ubayd left Lebanon at least one and one-half years ago and is now in Australia. [Tarabayh] What about the arrest of Colonel Fu'ad Malik, who is still a member of the LF? [Ja'ja'] Yes, of course. I consider this a political issue which aims at striking at the people's belief in their political, social, and religious institutions. Tony Ilyas 'Ubayd left Lebanon one and one-half years ago; Rushdi Tawfiq left Lebanon three years ago; and John Yusuf Shahin left Lebanon one year ago. Documents will be presented about the places of residence of those persons: Two in Australia and one in Canada. This will prove they have not returned to Lebanon since their departure. [Tarabayh] It has been reported that LF security was certainly infiltrated by the Israeli Mosad. Do you admit this? [Ja'ja'] Never. [Tarabayh] It is said that former members of LF security were trained by and had good links with the Israeli Mosad. These are facts. [Ja'ja'] I ask for public trials and defense lawyers. Investigations will reveal all facts to public opinion and the media. [Tarabayh] What are the steps to be taken by the LF in light of this situation? [Ja'ja'] We will demand public trials to see who is right. [Tarabayh] What is the situation now in Ghidras? [Ja'ja'] The situation has not changed. There are more restrictions on people coming to Ghidras. [Tarabayh] Thank you, Dr. Samir Ja'ja'.
