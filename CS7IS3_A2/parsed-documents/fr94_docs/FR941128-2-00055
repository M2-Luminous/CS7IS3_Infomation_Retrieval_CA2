FR941128-2-00055 FR941128-2-00044 Cost of Capital, Taxes, and Other Imputed Costs Table A&hyph;3 shows the financing and tax rates, as well as the other required PSAF recoveries proposed for 1995, and compares the 1995 rates with the rates used for developing the PSAF for 1994. The pre-tax return on equity rate decreased from 12.7 percent in 1994 to 12.1 percent for 1995. The decrease is a result of 1993 BHC financial performance included in the 1995 BHC model, relative to the stronger 1988 BHC financial performance in the 1994 BHC model. The decrease in the FDIC insurance assessment from $19.8 million in 1994 to $19.0 million in 1995, shown in Table A&hyph;3, is attributable to lower adjusted gross cash items in process of collection (CIPC) and lower clearing balances. The FDIC rate of $0.26 for every $100 in clearing balances remains unchanged from the rate used in the 1994 final PSAF. Net income on clearing balances for 1995 is projected to be $21.3 million, down from $25.4 million estimated for 1994. This decrease of $4.1 million is due to the decrease in excess clearing balance levels, partially offset by a wider spread between income, which is earned at the 90-day Treasury bill rate, and expense or interest, which is paid at the federal funds rate. Capital Adequacy As shown in Table A&hyph;4, the amount of capital imputed for the proposed 1995 PSAF totals 35.9 percent of risk-weighted assets, well in excess of the 8 percent capital guideline for state member banks and BHCs. 1995 Fee Schedules Overview Based on the Reserve Banks' estimates of costs, volumes, and revenues, the proposed 1995 fees for priced services are expected to yield net income of $36.0 million for the year, compared with a targeted ROE of $31.5 million. Thus, the Reserve Banks project that 100.6 percent of total expenses, including targeted ROE, will be recovered. In addition, during 1995, approximately $19.1 million of automation consolidation special project costs, including about $0.8 million that were deferred in prior years, will be recovered. Additional finance charges for 1995 on accumulated deferred special project balances will be $2.5 million, resulting in accumulated special project costs to be recovered in the future of $36.7 million. 1 1 In 1981, the Board adopted a policy that permits the Reserve Banks to defer and finance development costs if the development costs would have a material effect on unit costs, provided a conservative time period is set for full cost recovery and a financing factor is applied to the deferred portion of development costs. For the most part, 1995 fees approved by the Board do not include significant changes in the level or structure of fees for priced services. For the electronic payment services_funds transfer, book-entry securities, and the automated clearing house (ACH)_all operating costs and imputed expenses, including targeted ROE, are expected to be recovered. Some electronic connection fees will be raised to reflect the higher costs associated with the higher service levels available through the Fednet ® communications network. The Board, however, has approved a modest reduction in the funds transfer fee. The check service also is expected to achieve full cost recovery, including targeted ROE, in 1995. Although continued volume losses are anticipated due to depository institutions' growing use of direct presentments under the same-day settlement rule and continued consolidation of the banking industry, the Reserve Banks expect the decline in volume to be more moderate than it was in 1994. The Board was able to approve modest increases in fees because the Reserve Banks are taking aggressive steps to reduce costs. For example, the Reserve Banks are reducing staff and making greater use of automation to improve operating efficiency. In addition, the Reserve Banks are improving deposit deadlines, promoting electronic presentment and deposit products, and developing products using image technology. The noncash collection service has faced rapidly declining volume levels since the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA) was enacted. Due to significant volume losses, the Reserve Banks incurred an operating loss in 1993 and project operating losses in 1994 and 1995. The service should realize lower and more stable costs once all operations are consolidated at two sites in 1995. In November 1993, when the Board considered the 1994 fee schedules, volume-based fees were approved for selected check products and the noncash collection service. The Board also has requested the staff to develop criteria for the use of volume- based fees. 2 Econometric studies of the cost structure of Federal Reserve payment services are being conducted to determine if criteria based on scale efficiency are relevant. Preliminary results indicate that the use of volume-based fees is not appropriate for paper-based check services. A similar study of the cost structure of the noncash collection service was deemed impractical because of the rapidly declining volume levels. Analysis of the cost structure of electronic payment products is in progress. The Board has approved: 2 For the notice approving the use of volume-based fees for certain check and noncash products, see 58 FR 60649, November 17, 1993. For the announcement of the 1994 PSAF and fee schedules, see 58 FR 60639, November 17, 1993. (1) Eliminating the volume-based fees for paper check products, which were introduced by the Minneapolis Reserve Bank in 1994; (2) Permitting the Richmond and Minneapolis Reserve Banks to retain the volume-based fees for the selected electronic check products that were approved by the Board until scale efficiency studies of electronic payment products are completed; and (3) Retaining the present volume-based fees for the noncash collection service because they are enabling the Federal Reserve to maintain a stabilizing presence in the noncash collection market. The Board expects the results of its econometric studies to be available during 1995. Although the Reserve Banks acknowledge that their cost, volume, and revenue projections are somewhat uncertain due to the continuing changes in the interbank check collection market and the implementation of FRAS, as well as Fednet ® , the Board believes that the Reserve Banks' proposed 1995 fee schedules are reasonable.
