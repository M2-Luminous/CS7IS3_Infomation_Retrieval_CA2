FR940512-2-00142 FR940512-2-00066 [Docket Nos. 030&hyph;05260, 070&hyph;00314, 040&hyph;08188, License Nos. 29&hyph;01442&hyph;01, SMC&hyph;1181, SNM&hyph;296; EA 94&hyph;043] Ledoux and Co., Teaneck, NJ; Order Suspending Licenses I Ledoux and Company (Licensee) is the holder of Byproduct, Source Material, and Special Nuclear Material Licenses Nos. 29&hyph;01442&hyph;01, SMC&hyph;1181, and SNM&hyph;296 (Licenses), respectively, issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission) pursuant to 10 CFR parts 30, 40, and 70. Byproduct material License No. 29&hyph;01442&hyph;01 authorizes the Licensee to possess byproduct material for use in the analysis of fission products and neutron-induced radionuclides in various materials, and to possess byproduct material to be used in the calibration of radioassay equipment, including the development of analytical chemical procedures. Byproduct material License No. 29&hyph;01442&hyph;01 was originally issued on November 20, 1956, was most recently renewed on March 8, 1989, and was due to expire on March 31, 1994, but has remained in effect pursuant to 10 CFR 30.37 and a timely request for renewal by the Licensee in accordance with a Licensee letter dated February 24, 1994. Source Material License No. SMC&hyph;1181 authorizes the Licensee to possess source material for analysis of samples and preparation and use of working standards. Source Material License No. SMC&hyph;1181 was originally issued on December 14, 1973, was most recently renewed on January 10, 1991, and is due to expire on January 31, 1996. Special Nuclear Material License No. SNM&hyph;296 authorizes the Licensee to possess plutonium and uranium-235 for use in laboratory sample analysis and calibration of instruments. Special Nuclear Material License SNM&hyph;296 was originally issued on April 1, 1959. This license was most recently renewed on March 13, 1989, and was due to expire on March 31, 1994, but has remained in effect pursuant to 10 CFR 303.37 and a timely request for renewal by the Licensee in accordance with a Licensee letter dated February 24, 1994. II As of July 27, 1990, the Licensee was required to comply with the regulations set forth in 10 CFR 30.35, 10 CFR 40.36, and 10 CFR 70.25. These regulations require that licensees authorized to possess licensed material in the amounts listed in the above-listed Licenses, must submit a certification of financial assurance or a decommissioning funding plan to the NRC. These regulations have been established to assure that licensees demonstrate adequate financial responsibility that funds necessary for a safe decommissioning are available and planned, thus providing adequate assurance that the facility will be decommissioned prior to terminating licensed activities. On August 18, 1992, the NRC issued a Demand for Information to the Licensee since the NRC had not, as of that date, received financial assurance from the Licensee. The Demand for Information was issued to determine whether the Licenses should be modified, suspended or revoked. NRC sent letters dated October 21, 1992, and November 16, 1993 to the Licensee, and telephone conversations were held with the Licensee on September 28, 1990, January 13, 1992, December 14, 1993, and January 5, 1994, emphasizing the importance of providing the NRC the required financial assurance. Furthermore, an NRC inspection was conducted on October 18&hyph;19, 1993 (during which the Licensee committed to provide the required financial assurance by the end of 1993), and an enforcement conference was held with the Licensee on March 15, 1994, to emphasize the significance with which the NRC viewed the failure to provide financial assurance. In response to the NRC Demand for Information, dated August 18, 1992, Ledoux and Company provided, by letter dated September 10, 1992, a decommissioning cost estimate of $113,013. However, a financial assurance mechanism to cover the estimated amount was not provided. On November 5, 1993, the Licensee informed the NRC by letter that it intended to establish an escrow account in the amount of $125,000 as its financial assurance mechanism by January 1, 1994. On December 28, 1993, the Licensee informed the NRC by letter that it needed more time to provide a suitable financial assurance mechanism due to unforeseen circumstances. During the enforcement conference on March 15, 1994, Ledoux and Company representatives indicated that a financial assurance mechanism would not be provided in the next month. On April 5, 1994, the Licensee stated in a letter that it was planning to provide 2 ``letters of credit *␣*␣*'' and that it would need some time. However, to date no financial assurance mechanism has been provided to the NRC.
