The Transitional Executive Council [TEC] said every member of the force would have to sign the code which requires him or her to uphold the law, not to discriminate against an individual or group, and to use the minimum force necessary. The disciplinary code covers riotous behavior, disobedience and insubordination. A subcommittee of the TEC's management committee is to visit the base later this week.
