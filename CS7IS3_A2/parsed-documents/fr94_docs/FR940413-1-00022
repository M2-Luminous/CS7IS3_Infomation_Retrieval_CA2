FR940413-1-00022 FR940413-1-00006 For the reasons set out in the preamble, it is proposed to amend 30 CFR part 220 as follows: PART 200_ACCOUNTING PROCEDURES FOR DETERMINING NET PROFIT SHARE PAYMENT FOR OCS OIL AND GAS LEASES 1. The authority citation for part 220 continues to read as follows: Authority: Sec. 205, Pub. L. 95&hyph;372, 92 Stat. 643 (43 U.S.C. 1337). 2. Paragraph (b) of §220.030 is revised to read as follows: §220.030 Maintenance of records. * * * * * (b) The Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act, 30 U.S.C. 1713, requires that NPSL records be maintained for 6 years after they are generated unless the Secretary or designee notifies the record holder that an audit or investigation involving such records has begun, and that they must be kept longer. Because NPSL audits or investigations may not start within 6 years of lease record creation, the NPSL operator must provide records under either paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2): (1) The current NPSL operator must provide MMS all the NPSL capital account records annually through the end of lease operations. The first records must be supplied within [60 days following the final rule's effective date], or, for new operators, within 60 days of the date they become the new operator; all NPSL records created up to that time, except any provided earlier, must be included. Following the initial submission the operator must submit records each calendar year through cessation of operations by January 31 of the year following the end of the calendar year. The records must be mailed to the Minerals Management Service, Royalty Management Program, Deputy Associate Director for Audit, P.O. Box 25165, Denver, Colorado 80225&hyph;0165; or (2) The current NPSL operator may sign an agreement with MMS to maintain records on the NPSL capital account for 6 years after cessation of operations and make them available to MMS for audit or investigation on request. This signed agreement must be received by MMS on or before the date the initial records must be supplied under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and submitted to MMS at the address under paragraph (b)(1). Under the agreement, records must be kept until an audit or investigation is completed and the Director releases the recordholder from maintaining the records. But, if other sources later show evidence of possible fraud, collusion, or underpayments, MMS may further examine records and transactions of earlier audit periods. 3. Paragraph (c) of §220.031 is revised to read as follows: §220.031 Reporting and payment requirements. * * * * * (c) Each lessee subject to this part shall submit with the required Form MMS&hyph;2014, which shall be due at the same time as the report required in paragraph (b) of this section, any net profit share payment due the United States for the period covered by the report. * * * * * 220.032 [Amended] 4. Paragraph (d) of §220.032 is amended by revising the reference to ``§220.033'' in the first sentence to read ``30 CFR part 217.'' §220.033 [Removed] 5. Section 220.033 is removed. §220.034 [Redesignated as §220.033] 6. Section 220.034 is redesignated as §220.033. 7. Paragraph (a) of redesignated §220.033 is revised to read as follows: §220.033 Redetermination and appeals. (a) If an inspection of records or an audit causes the Director to find an error in the NPSL capital account or the net profit share payment_whether in favor of the Government or the lessee_the Director will redetermine the net profit share base, recalculate the net profit share payment due the United States, and notify the lessee of the recalculation. * * * * * [FR Doc. 94&hyph;8810 Filed 4&hyph;12&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;MR&hyph;M
