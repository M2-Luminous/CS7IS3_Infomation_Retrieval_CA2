Over a period of 40 years the USSR [Union of Soviet Socialist Republics] took some 220,000 tons of uranium -- the raw material for its military and civilian nuclear programs -- from the ore deposits of southern Saxony and Thuringia. Its legacy is Germany's biggest ecological disaster. Environment experts fear that decontaminating it properly will cost far more than the 13 to 15 billion Deutsche marks [DM] officially estimated. Those who gained from the wasteful exploitation of nature and human beings will not pay the price of it. Bonn inherited the GDR's half of Wismut anyway, and in May 1991 the USSR handed its half over as well--and with it all responsibility for more than 3,000 radioactive waste heaps, 300 shafts and mines and a large number of sludge lagoons containing uranium and radioactive decay products. The bomb must be defused by the successor company Wismut GmbH. The resources--about DM700 to 800 million a year--will be provided by its sole shareholder, the Federal Ministry of Trade and Industry. Chief executive, Manfred Bergmann, estimates that the ecological repair work will take 10 to 15 years. Then it will be possible to "build kindergartens again" on the contaminated areas. Trade and Industry Minister Rexrodt explains that the "Wismut project" meets "international standards." Environment experts think otherwise. Munich radiation biologist Edmund Lengfelder says that the GDR's lax radiological protection rules have been perpetuated in the Reunification Treaty for what was once the world's third largest uranium mining area, in particular. According to Gerhard Schmidt of the Darmstadt-based Ecological Institute, the lack of statutory rehabilitation targets such as are standard in the USA is painfully obvious. "Wismut has no measuring stick for its work." Whether Wismut has the technology to keep the environmental hazards permanently under control is also a matter of controversy. Lengfelder disputes in particular that the radioactive sludge lagoons are securely sealed -- a great hazard for the groundwater. "Perfect reclamation" could easily breach the DM100 billion cost limit, the radiation biologist believes: "Bonn must know what quality it wants. It is a political matter." Worse than that: After thoroughly plundering the uranium stocks, in 1962 Wismut gave all the worthless mining areas back to the respective local authorities. These are now getting not a penny from the pot in Bonn.
