He's not about to let them throw a monkey wrench into his plans, even if his choice of words might have been a little less harsh. And least of all after his return from Washington and New York, and the friendly echo that his obligatory performance triggered there. Calmly, he predicted that also the grumbling in the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] caucus in the Bundestag over his "governing program" would subside once the matter had begun to be discussed there--as has always been the case in the past. And just as calmly (please read on!) did he come out of the debate, which never materialized. Calmness is his trade mark and, in part, perhaps even his program. Translated into political terms, this means that he would somehow like to occupy the political middle. Such imperturbability resembles that of the chancellor, who, incidentally, is likewise averse to releasing the ominous middle. The "rock-in-the-breakers" motif is indeed currently being experienced in two versions [Scharping's and Kohl's], and the adherents of both politicians are undecided whether to view their tremendous unruffledness as exciting, frivolous, or boring. As was the case among the comrades in Eckernfoerde during their party congress, and, for that matter, is the case generally among many Social Democrats being questioned at this time, the prevailing mood tends more in the direction of criticism. But does one want to rob the candidate and party chairman of the optimism with which--as he did again recently before the representatives--he speaks of "resoluteness and unity"? Who is spreading the bad mood in opposition? Silence prevails in the room, aside from a few cursory peripheral comments concerning minor changes that might be made to give the consumer, taxation, and traffic policies a little more color. Not to forget the 250 German marks [DM] child allowance. To be sure, Rudolf Scharping says that he wants a discussion, now! But at the same time this discussion must, at the latest, be over and done with by the party congress on 22 June in Halle. But such a discussion will never even materialize. Even the representatives from Schleswig-Holstein had already forgotten, by the time they left for Bonn, their misgivings about the "timidity, lack of profile, and ennui," which could cause the electoral victory to be squandered. Doubts are growing, and, what is more, within the SPD, whether the single issue of employment will suffice to unseat the incumbent chancellor and to serve as the basis for the great transition. Members of one group are asking for small changes in direction. The others, such as Michael Mueller, are hoping that the transition in October will bring about some fundamental changes, and they would now like to get at least some idea of this change: to wit, how the civilization process can still be controlled in the future and an entirely amorphous development prevented. And that despite the realization that the economy is dramatically distancing itself from intervention by the federal state. Whether they be wishes for small guidelines or hopes directed at a major change in paradigms--many of the party colleagues are currently shelving their doubts. In view of this, it is nothing short of a bold exception to the rule when the Social Democrats from the north play out their trump cards by insisting on a 1.5 percent property levy on the "especially rich," which would allegedly bring in DM600 billion in additional revenues, a labor market tax on civil servants and the self-employed, a speed limit, renunciation of the Intercity Express project [a planned high-speed rail line between Hamburg and Berlin], or a Bundeswehr trimmed down to 300,000 soldiers. Rudolf Scharping will have to give in to some extent, to be sure. But basically there has been no change in the "campaign philosophy" as recently formulated in the TAGESZEITUNG by SPD whip Guenther Verheugen, according to which "financial security, job security, social security, internal and external security," are the issues of primary concern. Security per se. Together with its siblings: Caution! Freedom from risks! Avoidance of conflicts! In Verheugen's opinion, a speed limit would be an "absolute killer topic" [during the campaign]. The secretary continued: Election results of recent years have shown that, on the one hand, majorities can be gained for parties showing a tendency to bring about change. On the other hand, however: "Whereby--I admit--it is difficult to distinguish whether the people really want changes or whether they are simply so dissatisfied with what they have been offered in the past that anything at all is preferable to what they have now." Do they just want to get rid of Helmut Kohl, or do they want more? In the assessment of this question, the SPD is unsure of itself, and resulting from this uncertainty is its "security philosophy." But since it does not know if the people want "real changes," e.g. in matters related to the environment, the party is likewise reluctant to become truly more precise. Always to be recommended, to be sure, is that reality not be lost sight of for sheer bureaucracy and red tape. In that case, however, based on the ideas promulgated to date, how is even a breath of the atmosphere of breaking up and launching a new beginning to be conveyed? And what is more: If the election year is not utilized to gain majorities for certain policies, where, in the period of doubt that prevails afterwards, are the impulses and the inner legitimacy to come from which are to serve as the basis for the new beginning? Basically no differently than the CDU [Christian Democratic Union], the SPD, as well, must after all first recreate leeways for creative politics. It is precisely at this juncture that confidence in Helmut Kohl has waned. What is politics able to accomplish at all any more? And what are parties able to accomplish in the process? And could the cogoverning opposition accomplish more and other things along these lines than Kohl's coalition? If, for example, in matters pertaining to the ecology, the SPD currently ignores or puts off until after the election much of what has been laboriously learned in the course of time, this can hardly be quickly made up for again tomorrow. What is unimportant today will not automatically become relevant again tomorrow. All this is being carried on the shoulders of Rudolf Scharping alone, without a "team." At most, Oskar Lafontaine becomes slightly perceptible along the periphery. But otherwise? The chairman either takes everything on himself, or (more likely) he mesmerizes everyone with his sober reflectiveness. At any rate, the SPD campaign seems to consist primarily of him. The situation is similar in the CDU with Kohl, and in the FDP [Free Democratic Party] with Kinkel: politics as a solo program. Patiently, Rudolf Scharping answers his critics by pointing out that so far he has always reached his objective. With unruffledness. Witness the asylum law, the blue helmets, appointment to the Constitutional Court. The more often Scharping puts something off for the future, the more impatient some of his adherents become, however, or they defect to the Greens, something which the latter can only welcome. The fact that shedding ballast and leveling out differences with the government are not enough must, at the latest, have become clear to Scharping during his America trip. For hardly does he show a willingness to yield and does he discover (not only foreign policy) commonalities, when CDU caucus chairman Wolfgang Schaeuble and others search anew for what separates them. Here with the notion that the Bundeswehr be employed domestically, there with the proposal that it be used in the Balkan conflict as well--all these things are not least intended to show the opposition, despite all its adjustments, in an unflattering light. A dangerous game, both with the constitution as well as with "Francistic methods," thus Scharping's reply to Schaeuble. But does the SPD have much of its own to counter this with? Aside from distancing itself--did it prepare itself early on and adequately to oppose the fact that foreign policy a la Schaeuble is being increasingly subordinated to "nationalistic criteria," as Scharping now claims? If it is convinced of its need, should it not long since have evidenced a firm Europe-oriented policy? Can it offer the East Europeans greater "membership prospects" today than the government, and in addition one which has also been coordinated in the West? Did it counter, in good time, Schaeuble's recommendation that unity can only be gained with national emotions? So far the SPD has not come up with an answer to the question as to how it can win over those who adhere to their "breaking up atmosphere" in the event a policy marked by vagueness and putting off and a very imperturbable candidate perhaps do not suffice. The Discovery of Slowness--thus the title of a novel published in the early 1980's. These words took wing, seemed to breathe zeitgeist, indeed even seemed to serve as a prescription for politics. But is it appropriate for today's dramatic conditions? Can it be a prescription for the 1990's? Sten Nadolny's hero, incidentally, the slow one, got far, but he fell short of reaching his objective.
