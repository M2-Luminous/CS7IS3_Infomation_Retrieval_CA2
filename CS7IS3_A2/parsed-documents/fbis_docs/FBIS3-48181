A government official revealed on 18 January: "If North Korea allows the IAEA inspection team to visit North Korea to receive practical [silchilchokin] inspection of the seven reported facilities and agrees to the exchange of special envoys of the South and North, this will be recognized as a breakthrough in resolving the nuclear issue, thus making it possible to allow businessmen to visit North Korea." This greatly eases the government's policy that was decided upon at the August reunification-related ministers meeting in which it decided that `businessmen will be allowed to visit North Korea only when North Korea completely returns to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and agrees to the inspection of unreported facilities in Yongbyon.' If a breakthrough is made on the nuclear issue, the government plans to allow technicians to visit North Korea to activate the consignment processing trade [imgagong kyoyok]. A government official said: "The volume of South-North trade was reduced by six percent last year because of the nuclear issue. However, processing trade for reexport [witak kagong] increased by seven to eight times, thus showing the possibility of South-North trade. Necessary measures will be taken at the government level this year to actively assist such processing." If North Korea accepts the IAEA's inspection and also the South-North mutual inspection, the government will actively work on opening direct South-North sea route which is being pointed out as the greatest obstacle in South-North trade. The government will also establish a South-North exchange cooperative subcommittee to provide measures for guaranteeing investment, preventing double taxation, and providing procedures for disputes. It was learned that the sea routes between Inchon Port-Nampo Port, Pusan Port-Wonsan Port, and Pohang Port-Chongjin Port will be the most likely sea routes already agreed upon between South and North Korea in case a direct sea route is established. The government plans to make a final decision over this matter at the 25 January reunification-related ministers meeting.
