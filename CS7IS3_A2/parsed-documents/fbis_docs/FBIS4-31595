To meet the negotiated price of 70 million German marks [DM], the Swedes will pay DM20 million in cash, DM25 million in equipment, and hand over patent rights worth DM25 million. Eriksson's purchase of Tesla is considered one of the most important steps in the privatization process in Croatia in terms of the future of its employees rather than purely as a business deal. Over a five-year period the work force will be gradually reduced from 3,500 to 1,000, after the surplus employees have been retrained.
