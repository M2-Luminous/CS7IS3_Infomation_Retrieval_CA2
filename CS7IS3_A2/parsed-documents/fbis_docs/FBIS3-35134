It is expected that former head of the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting will takeover the second most important and sensitive post today. Hashemi was replaced on Sunday by former Minister of Islamic Culture and Guidance Dr. 'Ali Larijani. The post is qa'em-maqam, as it is called in Persian, since the first deputy traditionally has no specific or defined duties. 'Ali Mohammad Besharati held the post before being appointed interior minister by President 'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani last August. Besharati, a member of the Islamic Consultative Assembly, the Majles, during its First Term, was appointed first deputy at the Foreign Ministry in 1983. During his term of office, he was assigned Persian Gulf affairs by Dr. Velayati. It is popularly believed that Besharati was more than successful in his mission despite transparent Western schemes to keep a rift between Iran and the Arab countries on the other side of the Persian Gulf. It will be interesting to see what particular assignment is given to Hashemi. The former student of the University of California, Berkeley, could be a big help to Dr. Velayati because of his awareness of the West and America in particular.
