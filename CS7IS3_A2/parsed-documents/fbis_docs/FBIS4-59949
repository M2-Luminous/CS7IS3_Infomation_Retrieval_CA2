During the Iranian political envoy's meeting with the Turkish president, the two sides exchanged views on issues related to northern Iraq, bilateral, politico-economic ties and Mr. Demirel's forthcoming visit to Tehran in mid-summer. During his brief stay in Ankara, the Iranian deputy foreign minister for Asia and Pacific affairs also called on the Turkish foreign minister and the two sides focused their discussion on bilateral issues. Iran and Turkey have been exchanging views through the visits of their diplomatic delegations to the two countries during the past year and the level of the delegations ranged from deputy minister to first vice president level according to the significance of the issues under discussion. The Turkish president's forthcoming visit, if it materializes, can be considered as the climax of such counselling since the new world conditions, such as the White House evolved new world order and the U.S. President's efforts aimed at spreading the same and imposing the wrong model on the rest of the world, as well as the emergence of the Central Asian republics and Iran's strategic geopolitical role in the region, have made ever greater understanding and closeness between Iran and Turkey inevitable. This is significant when the critical situation in northern Iraq, which apparently claims to have a kind of independence, can actually be a bitter and critical beginning or a political test for the division of countries in the region. In view of the significance of the issue and not withstanding the two countries' efforts for establishing peace and security on the joint border, events related to northern Iraq have always been on the agenda of Iran-Turkey talks. This is so because the continuation of the situation not only means greater instability in northern Iraq but it can also create crises for Iraq's neighbors: Iran, Turkey, and Syria. There is no doubt that the ongoing crisis in northern Iraq is largely the outcome of the strategic blunders committed by the officials of that country during the early nineties. But the vigilant and farsighted manner in which Iraq's neighbors deal with the current situation in that country can level the way for the return of durable peace to the region and discard domination seeking powers' justification for the presence of alien troops in this geographical boundary.
