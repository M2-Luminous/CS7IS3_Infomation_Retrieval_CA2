In his assumption of command speech, the new chief of this strategic territory stated among other things that terrorism and drug trafficking continue to undermine Latin American democracies. One can expect almost anything from a U.S. general (on active duty) except that he be so misinformed. Perhaps, however, McCaffrey's remarks were part of the profession of faith of the bullheaded U.S. military, whose only current mission seems to be meddling in the internal affairs of other countries while always seeking a pretext to conceal the ploy. What fundamentally undermines the democracies in America is the indiscriminate implementation of neoliberal policies that have plunged the people into edginess over poverty and the possibility of losing their jobs. Despite being elements of destabilization, terrorism and drug trafficking have less bearing on the internal situation of the Latin American nations than the adjustment plans. Moreover, if indeed drug trafficking and terrorism stemming from drug trafficking played a key role in destabilizing governments, countries such as the United States would carry a large share of the responsibility, primarily because U.S. drug demand is the greatest in the world. One really has to read between the lines in McCaffrey's speech--mainly when he says his purpose in the Southern Command is to continue establishing ties of cooperation in the entire Latin American region to promote and consolidate security. In general terms, those ties of cooperation take the form of dispatching U.S. troops from the Southern Command, which is headquartered in Panama, to various countries. Once there, they conduct missions of repression, such as the ones conducted periodically in Bolivia and other nations to eradicate the coca crop. More often that not, U.S. soldiers conduct these tasks in the company of local troops. This is often a mere formality, because the one taking the lead in planning the repression is the U.S. side. In recent years, however, U.S. Army troops have tried to disguise their interventionist ploys using the pretext of social assistance--namely, the construction of bridges and roads and the repair of this or that rural school, tasks that do not hide their true intentions. Today, under different pretexts, U.S. troops are deployed in remote and rugged areas of Latin American nations. The speech about cooperation does not deceive anyone today, because the United States has always had the ambition to control everything in our nations. In addition, Gen. McCaffrey, whose past is linked to U.S. military intervention in Vietnam and Iraq, knows he is the appropriate figure to hold the post of chief of the Southern Command. Fortunately, the meddling incursions of the U.S. military from the Southern Command will exist for only five more years, because on 31 December 1999, the Torrijos-Carter treaties signed in 1977 should begin to take effect, which will put an end to the U.S. presence in Panama and will return the nation's interoceanic waterway to the Panamanians.
