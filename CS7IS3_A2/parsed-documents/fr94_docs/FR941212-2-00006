FR941212-2-00006 FR941212-2-00004 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission [Docket No. GP95&hyph;3&hyph;000; FERC No. JD92&hyph;02505T; Texas-15 Addition 3] Railroad Commission of Texas; Tight Formation Area Determination; Notice of Preliminary Finding December 5, 1994. On December 23, 1991, the Railroad Commission of Texas (Texas) submitted its determination that the J through Y Sands portion of the Vicksburg Formation (also known as the Lower Vicksburg), underlying parts of the McAllen Ranch Field in Hidalgo County qualifies as a tight formation under Section 107(c)(5) of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA). 1 1 The designated area, which is the same for each Lower Vicksburg sand, encompasses approximately 15,100 acres in portions of ``San Ramon'' Juan Farias Grant (A&hyph;62) and the ``Santa Anita'' Manuel Gomez Grant (A&hyph;63), in Hidalgo County. For the reasons discussed below, the Commission issues this Notice of Preliminary Finding that Texas' determination for the J&hyph;Y Sands (Texas-15 Addition 3) is not supported by substantial evidence. Background After staff sent two tolling letters requesting Texas to provide a statement explaining its determination and requesting additional data to support the determination, an informal conference was held at the request of Shell Western E & P, Inc. (SWEPI), the applicant before Texas. Following that conference, Texas, at SWEPI's request, issued separate tight formation area determinations for portions of the M, R, S, and T Lower Vicksburg Sands that are also included in the Texas-15 Addition 3 determination, and deferred answering staff's tolling letter. 2 By order issued September 30, 1994, the Commission affirmed Texas' separate determinations for the M, R, S, and T Sands. 2 The M Sand determination (Texas-112, FERC No. JD93&hyph;04541T) covers 3,010 acres. The R Sand determination (Texas-113, FERC No. JD93&hyph;04589T) covers 1,440 acres. The S Sand determination (Texas-114, FERC No. JD93&hyph;04590T) covers 11,700 acres. The T Sand determination (Texas-115, FERC No. JD93&hyph;04591T) covers 7,320 acres. On October 27, 1994, Texas responded to staff's second tolling letter in the Texas-15 Addition 3 proceeding by submitting SWEPI's commentsand stating that those comments should satisfy the concerns raised in the tolling letter. The comments provide additional explanations for why SWEPI believes that the recommended formation meets the guidelines but contain no additional data on permeability or flow rate characteristics. Discussion Permeability Guideline Section 271.703(c)(2)(i)(A) of the Commission's regulations requires the jurisdictional agency to show that the in situ permeability to gas, throughout the pay section in the formation, is expected to be 0.1 millidarcy (md) or less. 3 3 Order No. 567, issued on July 28, 1994, rescinded the Commission's NGPA's regulations, including Section 275 as of that date (68 FERC ¶61,135). The Commission stated, however, that rescission of Part 275 is prospective only and that timely filed applications for well determination proceedings still pending before the Commission will continue to be subject to the requirements of Part 275 as that section existed before July 28, 1994. Each recommended sand (J, K, L, M, *␣*␣* etc.) is actually a sand package, consisting of multiple sands; the recommended area for each Lower Vicksburg sand package is the same, whether the sand package is present throughout all of the approximately 15,100-acre recommended area or not. The record contains permeability data for only 17 of the 97 wells drilled within the recommended area. In addition, as shown below, permeability data was not provided for each sand package.
