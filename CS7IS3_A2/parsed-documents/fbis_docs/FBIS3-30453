In an interview for CTK, ITAR-TASS and AP, dedicated to the latest developments in Russia, Havel said he has always had much liking for the reform efforts of former Russian First Vice-Premier Yegor Gaydar and former Finance Minister Boris Fyodorov. "I hope that the current changes will not mean the freezing or stopping these reforms. If reforms were to be stopped half-way it would be even worse than if they had not been started at all," Havel said.
