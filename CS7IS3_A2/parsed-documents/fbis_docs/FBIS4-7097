FBIS4-7097 "dreas082__a94006" FBIS-EAS-94-082-A Daily Report 27 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan Kaishin Formation Creates `Discord' in Coalition Kaishin Formation Creates `Discord' in Coalition OW2804091594 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 27 Apr 94 Morning Edition p 2--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2804091594 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Excerpts] On the afternoon of 25 April, the same day that Tsutomu Hata, chairman of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], was elected in the Diet as the next prime minister, some ruling coalition parties formed the Kaishin parliamentary group. In reacting against the parties' formation of the parliamentary group, the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] then broke away from the coalition. The "post-Hosokawa political situation" is plunging the entire political world into great chaos and is leaving open the possibility of a second realignment of the established political parties. The discord over formation of the parliamentary group is creating a ripple within Shinseito, which has so far boasted of its cohesion, and is creating the possibility that the Japan New Party [JNP] will split again. Mr. Hata, who was elected prime minister in the Diet but who has yet to form his cabinet, is still unable to inaugurate his government. The functioning of politics is in a state of complete paralysis. Five political parties and a group including Shinseito formed the parliamentary group, but the parliamentary group hit a snag just one day after it was formed. In reacting strongly to moves by the five political parties and a group to form the parliamentary group without prior consultations, the SDPJ broke away from the coalition. The Hata government thus would remain a minority in the Diet without the SDPJ and the foundation of the Hata government would be unstable. Moves are afoot to explore ways to scrap the parliamentary group. Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa is coming under a barrage of criticism from some Shinseito members for promoting the formation of the parliamentary group while keeping key senior Shinseito members in the dark about it. The formation of the parliamentary group may trigger another split of the JNP. [passage omitted on meeting of Shinseito] The Shinseito members who had prior knowledge of the formation of the parliamentary group, which was done on 25 April, were only Mr. Ozawa; Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of international trade and industry; and Sadao Hirano, a member of the House of Councilors. Mr. Toshio Yamaguchi is said to have been involved in the formation of the parliamentary group, and his involvement has sparked anger among Shinseito members, which is adding fuel to fire. A senior Shinseito member said bluntly, "No matter what Mr. Ozawa does from now on, we no longer trust him." The "Ozawa myth" has been abruptly tarnished. The JNP, which is led by former Prime Minister Hosokawa, is in a more serious situation. Discord is growing between the party executive, including Secretary General Matsuoka, who has ridden the wave of the Ozawa-Hosokawa alliance, and antiexecutive members. The formation of the parliamentary group is becoming the seeds of fresh intraparty strife. Dozens of JNP members including Mr. Takashi Kawamura met in Tokyo on the evening of 26 April. During the meeting, they decided to ask the executive to shelve the parliamentary group and they termed the process of forming the parliamentary group absurdly hasty. Three legislators who recently quit the Japan New Party have formed the Group Seiun, and this group and some junior antiexecutive legislators are rumored to be planning to join Sakigake [Harbinger]. In this situation, acting Shinseito Secretary General Kozo Watanabe told a meeting of Shinseito legislators on 26 April: "Former Prime Minister Hosokawa and Chairman Ouchi of the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] have proposed forming a parliamentary group while calling on Shinseito to join the group. The proposal was made when the ruling coalition parties discussed choosing Mr. Hata to be prime minister. Shinseito responded gratefully to the proposal and decided to accept it." Commenting on the formation of the parliamentary group, the notification of which was made to the Diet on 25 April when Mr. Hata was elected in the Diet as the next prime minister, a leader of the DSP stressed that the parliamentary group was formed on Shinseito's initiative, saying, "A veteran Shinseito politician who is well versed in Diet affairs has insisted on forming the parliamentary group, and our party acceded to his insistence." Moves are spreading within Shinseito to "make efforts to seek an understanding with the SDPJ by scrapping the parliamentary group." According to a senior Shinseito member, "Mr. Ozawa thinks only of a frontal breakthrough" and his obstinacy is keeping the political situation deadlocked.
