At the end of the contact the head of the North side's delegation briefed home and foreign reporters on the contact here. According to him, the North side at the contact urged the South side to accept the reasonable proposal it had made at the sixth contact, a proposal to announce in a joint communique that the sides confirmed again each other's will for the exchange of special envoys and agreed on their early exchange. At today's contact it also proposed to the South side to clinch the discussion of working procedures on the basis of the North-tabled "Agreement on the Exchange of Presidential Envoys Between the North and the South" and sign the agreement. The South side, however, repeated trite words this time, too. It categorically objected to the North side's proposal of publishing a joint communique and to its suggestion that the questions of observing the principle of national independence, deciding on the way of national reunification and of promoting the great unity of the whole nation be stipulated in the draft agreement with regard to the mission of special envoys. Drawing attention to the fact that the South side's "minister of the unification board" yesterday officially predicted that Wednesday's working-level contact would end in failure, the North side said this remark itself showed a very dangerous position. Much upset, the South side tried to parry it with the subterfuge that reporters gave a wrong account of what the "minister of the unification board" said. The process of the contact today clearly showed that the South side was taking a stand to put the brakes on the third round of DPRK-USA talks by deliberately creating difficulties in the way of discussion of working matters for the exchange of special envoys. It was agreed to have the next, 8th working contact in the Southern portion of Panmunjom on March 19.
