ACTION: Notice of preliminary results of antidumping finding administrative review. SUMMARY: In response to a request by Yamaji Fishing Net Co., Ltd. (the respondent), the Department of Commerce (the Department) has conducted an administrative review of the antidumping finding on fishnetting of man-made fiber from Japan. This review covers one company and the period June 1, 1992 through May 31, 1993. For these preliminary results, we applied the best information available (BIA). The review indicates the existence of dumping margins during the period. We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results. EFFECTIVE DATE: March 14, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kim Moore or Lisa Raisner, Office of Antidumping Compliance, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230, telephone: (202) 482&hyph;0090/3518. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On June 6, 1972, the Department of Treasury published in the Federal Register (37 FR 11560) the antidumping finding on fishnetting of man-made fiber from Japan. On June 7, 1993, the Department published a notice of opportunity to request review for the period June 1, 1992 through May 31, 1993 (58 FR 31941). The respondent requested, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.22(a) that we conduct an administrative review. We published the notice of initiation on July 21, 1993 (58 FR 39007). The Department has now conducted that administrative review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff Act). Scope of the Review Imports covered by the review are shipments of fishnetting of man-made fibers, not including salmon gill netting, from Japan. The merchandise is currently classified under item numbers 5608.11.00, 5608.19.10, and 5608.90.10 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). The HTS item numbers are provided for convenience and customs purposes. The written product description remains dispositive. This review covers entries of the subject merchandise by Yamaji Fishing Net Co., Ltd., during the period June 1, 1992 through May 31, 1993. Analysis Although Yamaji attempted to respond to all Department requests for information, the data submitted was unverifiable. In particular, at verification in Japan we discovered that approximately 40 percent of total home market sales had not been reported. Furthermore, because Yamaji did not prepare adequate source documentation, the Department was unable to complete sales traces to its satisfaction. Finally, significant discrepancies and errors in Yamaji's sales listings were identified, thereby making it impossible to verify several of Yamaji's claimed adjustments. For further information on the deficiencies in the respondent's questionnaire response, see the verification report filed on the record of this case. Because we have no data upon which we can reliably base our analysis, the Department must use BIA for its preliminary results of review. Best Information Available In accordance with section 776(c) of the Tariff Act, we rely upon BIA in cases where a party refuses or is unable to produce information requested in a timely manner and in the form required, or otherwise significantly impedes proceedings. The Department generally uses a two-tiered approach in its choice of BIA. For uncooperative respondents or respondents which substantially impede the proceedings (``first tier''), the Department uses the higher of (1) the highest rate for any company from the original investigation or prior administrative review or (2) the highest rate found in the current review for any company. For respondents which attempt to cooperate (``second tier''), the Department uses the higher of (1) the highest rate ever applicable to the firm for the subject merchandise or (2) the highest calculated rate in the current review for any firm (see Antifriction Bearings (Other than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof from France, et al., 58 FR 39729, July 26, 1993). As outlined above, the second-tier BIA rate should be applied, since Yamaji was essentially cooperative. Accordingly, we will continue to apply Yamaji's previous rate of 18.30 percent, which is both the highest rate ever applicable to the firm for the subject merchandise and the highest rate in the proceeding (see Fishnetting of Man-Made Fibers from Japan; Final Results of Administrative Review of Antidumping Finding, 56 FR 49457, September 30, 1991).
