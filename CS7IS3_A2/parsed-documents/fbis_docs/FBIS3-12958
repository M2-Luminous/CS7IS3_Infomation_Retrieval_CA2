Beloved citizens, I address you today to express my love and to thank you for everything you have shown over the past days in terms of your sincere emotions and condolences over the painful loss of the late Basil. From the day when Basil left this earth to face his creator, I have been constantly preoccupied with two things: Basil's departure and your sensitive and noble stand and sentiments, which covered the entire country, filled every town and village, and clearly manifested itself all over our land. This remarkable phenomenon, with its national and human dimensions, attracted the attention of people outside the country. It won appreciation and admiration in terms of its noble and sincere meaning and its manifestation of national unity. Sincere people who are cohesive in weal and woe, in happy and sad times, are always able to build their country, develop their life, and realize, defend, and preserve their aspirations. I have been engrossed by two things from the very beginning. One was Basil's departure, because I am a father and any father is pained by the death of his son. However, I was not saddened only because he was my son. He possessed many talents, capabilities, and characteristics that surfaced in him from his childhood and grew over the years and reached an advanced stage of ripeness, firmness, and clarity. At this advanced stage and at 32, the peak of his youth and activity, Basil left this life, his people, and homeland. I am not going to enumerate his talents and capabilities. This may be done at a later time. Basil left many friends and comrades who knew and lived with him and who knew a lot about him. However, they did not know him as his father did who lived with him for 32 years. Basil had a pure, spotless, and unambiguous nationalist upbringing. The homeland is sacred. It deserves more than anything else all kinds of supreme sacrifices. This is a fateful, moral, human, and religious issue that does not wane and grow as time poasses, but remains as constant as time and as strong as the continuity of life on earth. It is a cause that is above all other causes and whose justice is above all other types of justice, a cause that makes everything that serves it an accepted possibility and a duty. It is the homeland whose air we breath, whose water we drink, and whose food we eat. In light of all this, love and unity grow among its homeland. Hence, and stemming from this concept, Basil loved his mates, friends, and fellow citizens. From this concept came Basil's optimism and confidence in the future of the homeland and people. Thus, he loved benevolent deeds and loved to serve both the people and the public interest. Basil reacted with the community and loved the people. He was a brother of each youth in this homeland and a faithful friend of each citizen who actively worked to serve everyone. Basil did this whenever an opportunity was available, whenever he could support a man in need or anyone who was done an injustice, and whenever he could stand against those who did injustice to others and encroached on others' rights, directly or indirectly. All this and much more attracted me to both Basil and his departure. What attracted me much to you, beloved brothers, was your great stand, your great sympathy and the extension of condolences, and your understanding that the event was a general one and that it concerned everyone. Your understanding was correct and embodied nobility, faithfulness, and patriotism. Beloved ones, we have long reciprocated love and shared concerns and burdens. We will continue to do so as long as we are alive, so our coming generations will inherit our humanitarian, social, and national values, with God's help. What relieved the sorrow was your genuine sympathy -- men, women, and children. This was the source of real consolation. Brothers and sons, the true sentiments you have shown are beyond description. I can find no words to express my impressions about what I saw, sensed, and heard in the past days. I wish I could shake hands and talk to you, one by one, in order to express to each of you my gratitude and appreciation for this great stand. However, you know that the time factor and vast distances would preclude this. I was unequivocally confident that your sentiments toward me were genuine. Through your deep sympathy for the painful event which took place, you once again confirmed the genuine character of our great people, who have always proved this character on all occasions, whether happy or sad. This has consolidated and further entrenched national unity. As I always say, national unity is our sharpest and most important weapon in confronting all challenges and calamities of life. What I saw with my own eyes when we left home on our way to the airport to take the body to the burial ground embodied the meaning that I have mentioned. From my home to the airport, people gathered along both sides of the road. Nobody gathered them there. Nobody, including members of the household among whom Basil lived, knew what time we were to leave because the departure time was connected with a number of details. The people who gathered along the streets were not spectators. Sadness was clear on the faces of everyone, men and women. They were either crying or raising their hands in prayer. In more than one place, I saw a number of men collapse on the ground. These sad and grave scenes all along the road made our souls more sublime. Deep sadness engenders strength and determination to be patient as if this is the purport of God's wisdom when he counseled patience and brought good tidings to the patient. With this faith, I faced the disaster when I was informed of it by the minister of defense, the chief of staff, and the foreign minister who came to my house. Everyone of you can imagine the impact of such a shock. After they answered my queries, I told them: God be praised. God has given and God has taken. Basil's demise is a great loss. One of them said it was a national loss. I said: That is what I think. Let us rely on God. The slogans which were raised everywhere, repeating phrases such as: We Are All Basil, We Are all Your Sons, have left deep, and immense impression on our hearts. Rest assured that I share this feeling with you from the bottom of my heart. For me, each citizen in this country is either a son or a brother, just like Basil. We are one big family and you are all my sons and brothers of whom I am very proud and on whose originality, zeal, and boldness I rely when the need arises. I send my sincerest love, thanks, and appreciation to all of you, beloved citizens, men and women, at home and abroad; party members and officials of parties and of state; officers and NCO's in the Armed Forces; men of religion and ulema; members of popular, professional organizations, and trade unions; university professors, teachers, and students; all the sportsmen, knights, and youths; people in towns and in the countryside; and all sectors of the people. I send my love, thanks, and appreciation to all those who participated in any sad demonstration, sat in a condolences meeting, and took pains to go to al-Qardahah to offer condolences. I send my love and appreciation to anyone who joined prayers on the soul of our son, in his own house or at mosques; to those who prayed to God or read verses of the Koran; to anyone who eulogized or wrote a line in any cable or letter of condolences; to those who took to the streets and courtyards in our towns and villages, raising slogans of sincerity; to those who participated in any form in expression of sorrow over our loss, the national loss, the demise of the late Basil. What I have seen over the past days is bright proof that in this country we are one big family. What saddens one, saddens all; what is glad, gladdens all of us. Hearts are one and arms are held together. The national fabric is as firm as steel. Brother citizens, my permanent concern and sole ambition is that God may grant me the ability and strength to serve the homeland and the people and to carry out what we believe is for the good of the homeland and the nation. While increasing my sense of responsibility, these generous sentiments you expressed to me grant me further ability to exert my efforts and to continue work at full capacity for the sake of construction and liberation; constructing a decent life for the sons of our people, and working seriously to liberate the occupied Arab territories. We have a lot to accomplish and immense responsibilities to carry out. Let us continue our march, armed with faith in God, and let us redouble our efforts. The people who believed in God, unified themselves, and resolved to regain their rights will surely regain them. Beloved citizens. Words cannot express the feelings I have for you, feelings of love, appreciation, and pride. I am certain that we will continue our march on the path of dignity and serious work. I pray God to lend me his support in order to continue my efforts to build the homeland and its strength and to defend our national and pan-Arab causes. I send my thanks and appreciation to the Arab kings, presidents, officials, and citizens who offered condolences either personally, by sending representatives, by telephone, or by sending cables and letters. I send thanks to all heads of state, governments, officials, and figures from all over the world who sent delegates, telephoned, or cabled condolences. I repeat my thanks, love, and appreciation for you. I press your hands, beloved citizens. May God have mercy on Basil and may God make paradise his abode. Peace and blessings of God be upon you.
