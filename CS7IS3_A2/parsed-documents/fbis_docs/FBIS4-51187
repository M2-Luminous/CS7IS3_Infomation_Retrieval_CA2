This is a major move to suit the new situation in state and army reform and construction, to further improve the command and management systems of our Army, and to strengthen the ranks of officers in the new situation. It is bound to exercise a positive, far-reaching influence in promoting the drive to revolutionize, modernize, and standardized the Army. The "Regulations on the Military Ranks of Officers" and the "Active Service Regulations Governing Active Duty Officers" were implemented as of 1 July 1988 and 1 January 1989 respectively. Since their implementation, they have played a positive role in straightening out the work relationship of cadres and in improving the quality and maintaining the stability of cadre ranks. On the whole, they have been applicable. With the development in state and army reform and construction, there have been many new developments in cadre work and the building of cadre ranks, and there have been considerable changes in the composition and structure of officer ranks. For this reason, some provisions in the two "Regulations" can no longer completely suit the needs of the new situation and tasks. In the past two years, the Central Military Commission has reaffirmed and formulated many important policies and provisions on cadre work, and some of them need to be defined in the "Regulations." Under the direct leadership of the military commission, by extensively listening to the views of leaders at all levels and all kinds of cadres, conducting full investigation and appraisal, and properly drawing on the experience of foreign armies and local authorities, we have adjusted and supplemented some articles in the two "Regulations." The two amended "Regulations" are more compatible with the objective law governing the building of officer ranks in peace time and the need of our Army building in the new period. In amending the two "Regulations," we have persisted in taking Comrade Deng Xiaoping's idea on army building in the new period and the relevant instructions of the party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission as the basis, proceeded from the actual situation in our Army, and set our eyes on further advancing the cause of making our ranks of officers more revolutionary, younger in average age, better educated, and more professionally competent. The two "Regulations" have the following features: First, they conscientiously carry out the series of instructions of the party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission on cadre work in the new period and reflect the fine traditions of our party and our Army in cadre work. Before and after the 14th CPC National Congress, Comrade Deng Xiaoping made a lot of brilliant expositions on Army cadre work and the building of Army cadre ranks. In line with the needs of the situation and tasks and the reality of the building of Army leading bodies, the party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core have further defined many important principles of cadre work in the new period and adopted a series of practical measures. As a result, acute problems in cadre work that have existed for some time have been satisfactorily solved and new achievements and progress have been made in the building of our cadre ranks. These have been fully reflected in the two amended "Regulations" and made the basic principles in the "Regulations" which must be observed in cadre work more complete. Second, we set our eyes on improving the age pattern of cadre ranks and thus provide an institutional guarantee for the normal replacement of old cadres by the new in leading bodies. The work of selecting and promoting outstanding young cadres and solving the question of successors has a bearing on the long-term construction of the Army and the lasting political stability of the country. The amended "Regulations" have made proper adjustments to the tenure of some officers and the maximum age of active duty officers. Thus, conditions are created for the smooth growth of outstanding young cadres and the echelon formation of leading body members. Third, the two "Regulations" have further defined the post duties of officers and straightened out the chain of command. In line with the post duties of officers, the amended "Regulations on the Military Ranks of Officers" have laid emphasis on revising the table of organization [T/O] ranks for various posts, changing the T/O ranks for the posts of military commission member, chief of staff, and director of the General Political Department from two to one, the T/O ranks for regular military region posts down to deputy division-level posts from three to two, and abolishing the base military ranks [ji zhun jun xian 1015 0402 6511 6902]. Fourth, the two "Regulations" have, as far as possible, taken into account the immediate interests of officers, which is conductive to increasing the cohesiveness of the troops. In recent years, the party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission have adopted a series of measures to solve some practical problems among military cadres. While retaining the previously stipulated benefits, the amended "Regulations" have added some new content. The readjustments of T/O ranks for some professional and technical officers, in particular, have further demonstrated the principle of "respecting knowledge and talents." The "Active Service Regulations Governing Active Duty Officers" and the "Regulations on the Military Ranks of Officers" are two basic rules governing the cadre work of our Army. All cadres should grasp their implementation with a positive, conscientious attitude. It is necessary to take the two "Regulations" as basic teaching materials and conduct restudy of and reeducation in cadre policies and regulations so that the vast numbers of cadres can gain a profound understanding of the great significance of amending and implementing the "Regulations," master the basic content, and bring their ideas into line with the policy decisions of the military commission and the spirit of the "Regulations." It is necessary to conscientiously subordinate ourselves to the overall interest and correctly approach individual interest. The amendment of the two "Regulations" shows that we have not only proceeded from the overall interest of the state and army building, but also taken into account the immediate interests of officers. Due to the constraints of many factors, some individual desires cannot be satisfied. Through propaganda, education, and thoroughgoing and painstaking ideological work, the vast numbers of cadres should be made to correctly understand the rationality and scientific nature of the "Regulations" from the needs of the overall situation, to have a stronger sense of dedication and responsibility, and to mobilize their work zeal. In the course of implementation, party committees at all levels should, in line with the requirements of the "Regulations" and in conjunction with the actual situations of their own units, make overall plans and consider the building of cadre ranks in their own units. Attention should be paid to an overall understanding and correct implementation of all policies and provisions in the "Regulations"; we should not oversimplify them nor should we attend to too many things at the same time, or stress one aspect but neglect another. Since the two "Regulations" are legislated and promulgated by the state's highest organ of power, they should be implemented resolutely. Party committees and political organs at all levels must further enhance their awareness of the need to observe the rules, act in strict accordance with the "Regulations," safeguard the inviolability and authority of the "Regulations," and ensure their smooth implementation. In short, we must study, publicize, and implement well the two amended "Regulations," constantly raise military competence, political quality, and scientific and educational levels of the ranks of officers, and push ahead the drive to revolutionize, modernize, and standardize our Army.
