FBIS4-60216 "drnes099_j_94044" FBIS-NES-94-099 Daily Report 22 May 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen Al-Bid Addresses Citizens on 'Id al-Adha Al-Bid Addresses Citizens on 'Id al-Adha EA2205160594 Aden Yemeni Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0330 GMT 22 May 94 EA2205160594 Aden Yemeni Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Text] The brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party's [YSP] Central Committee, addressed a speech to the masses of the Yemeni people on the occasion of the blessed 'Id al-Adha in which he stressed that Yemen was facing oppression, tyranny, and an unjust war. He said that a catastrophe has befallen Yemen and we have done everything we could to avoid it, but the tyrants have decided to impose it on us. If they have succeeded in imposing the war on us, they will not, and they cannot, impose surrender on us by their whims, desires, and shortsightedness. The brother 'Ali Salih al-Bid pointed out that on the occasion of the blessed 'Id al-Adha, on the day when the pilgrims stand on Mount Arafat, we appeal to God, the Great and Almighty. We stand with our heads held high. We refuse tyranny and oppression and we refuse to surrender. He said that nothing other than what God has ordained would befall us. We would face the injustice, irrespective of the hands. [sentence as heard] Our belief would increase and we would overstep this ordeal and show resistance similar to that shown on the battlefield. Though the criminal gang has dispatched all its forces to destroy the towns and besiege Aden, it did not succeed in achieving anything. If they managed to enter some areas, they have entered them as invaders and occupiers. The brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid expressed his confidence that the masses of our people could respond to the occupation and invasion, in the same manner as they confronted the Middle East base before independence in Aden. He called upon our courageous soldiers and brave strugglers to make a single stance and to adhere closely to God and the homeland and to the principles of the September and October revolutions which we have absorbed. May God, the Great and Almighty, enforce the right and defeat the rabble tyrants who refuse to accept a cease-fire even during these sacred days and on the day of the standing on Mount Arafat.
