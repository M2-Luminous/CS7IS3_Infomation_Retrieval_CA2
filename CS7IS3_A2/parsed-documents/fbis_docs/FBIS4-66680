There just was no question of its sticking on Gandhi. However, even Kanshi Ram could not understand what happened to this muck that was flung around after a lot of planning. Now he is going around telling people that if the BSP government is formed, he will remove the Rashtrapita [Father of the Nation] title used for Gandhi. If Kanshi Ram does not know, we must tell him, that calling Gandhi Rashtrapita has nothing to do with any government. No Congress government has given this title to Gandhi. There is no law which says that Gandhi should be known as the Rashtrapita. In the constitution written by Baba Saheb Ambedkar, there is no article about "Rashtrapita." There is a position of president in the Constitution. The Sangh family people who consider it inappropriate to call Gandhi the Rashtrapita should ask themselves why should the nation called India have a "pati" [husband] when it does not have a "pita" [father]? Similarly, is the army a woman that it should have a pati? I know that "pati" in "senapati"[military commander] does not mean husband. However, the "pita" in rashtrapita does not imply a father, either. Neither the Sangh family nor Kanshi Ram is doing any favor to poor Bapu [father] Gandhi. Neither the Congress Party nor the Congress government made him the father of the nation. It was Subhash Chandra Bose who first called him the father of the nation, and just like Ambedekar, he disagreed with Mr. Gandhi on several issues. Many people admit that Bose was not treated fairly similar to the treatment of Ambedekar. It is popular practice to call Gandhi the father of the nation and this appellation materialized during our independence struggle. As long as the people respect him, it does not matter whether there is a BSP government or a BJP [government]. They may have a huge majority in the Parliament but this image just cannot be removed from people's minds. No government can remove popular beliefs by issuing edicts. Even dictators like Hitler and Mussolini could not change the people. Autocratic communist governments could not make such changes. The power of the government is limited when dealing with the populace. If Kanshi Ram cannot understand this truth about human society, it is not just because like Mayavati, he is a political illiterate (as Chandra Shekhar put it). Kanshi Ram and Mayavati both consider themselves representatives of the lower castes. They distort history while speaking the language and cliches of the people around them. That is why the talks of Manyavar [respected one] (as Mayavati calls him) are saidto be some kind of epigram language in the Hindi-speaking areas. One epigram popular around here is, "The new mullah [Muslim priest] chants Allah-Allah all the time." We do not have to explain it since no one can understand it. The 'Respected One', Kanshi Ram, is the newest mullah in the government. He is a junior partner in Mulayam Singh's minority government in Uttar Pradesh. However, he is crying "power" as if he is a political Allah. However, this is not the only proverb that fits him. There is another axiom that the Hindi region has for people like him. I know that people will say that I am using this proverb because of my Brahmanic arrogant mentality. Let them say that. However, just like there is no proof that the word 'Harijan' was coined by Mahatma Gandhi, there is no proof that this proverb was originated by a Brahman or the Brahman caste. You all know this proverb and it is popular in different regions in different formats: If a mouse finds a rag, it considers itself a cloth merchant. In some places, they say: If a mouse finds a rag, it considers itself a king. Now, there are at least 25 states in India that is Bharat. Uttar Pradesh is one of these states. It is the largest state if you consider population, however, it is still only one of 25 states. Its vidhan sabha has 421 seats and there were elections for these 421 seats last November. The Bahujan Samaj Party which supposedly represents bahujans (the masses) won only 68 seats out of the total of 421 seats. It had this success only because it ran for elections in cooperation with Mulayam Singh Yadav's Samajwadi Party. Manyavar Kanshi Ram's BSP could not even win one-sixth of the total U.P. Vidhan Sabha seats. If we count all the seats in state vidhan sabhas in the nation, these 68 seats looklike a small rag cut out of the huge bolt of cloth. However, Kanshi Ram is using these seats to announce that his party will form governments in several states during the next two years, and the BSP will form the government at the Center [national government] after the '96 election. We do not have to go very far [for proof]. BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] claimed that a larger number of people participated in the Rama temple campaign than in the independence struggle and considered itself to be the only representative of Hindus who constitute 82 percent of the nation. BJP had established its governments in four states--Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Himachal--in December 1992. It also had 119 seats in the Parliament. Its Rama disciples did not care for anyone else and destroyed the Babri Masjid while celebrating a "Hindu victory day." The BJP was fully confident that the injustice done to the one of the holiest Hindu shrine was vindicated, therefore, the whole Hindu world would be ecstatic and the BJP would win any election from there on. Its slogan during the election held a year later was, "Now five states, tomorrow the whole nation." What did the Hindus of these five states do to the BJP? We do not need to tell you that. Compared to Manyavar Kanshi Ram's BSP getting 68 seats, right here in Uttar Pradesh the BJP won 2.75 times more seats during this very election! If we look at the percentage of votes, the BJP received six times more votes than did the BSP. Kanshi Ram calls his BSP the party of the masses because if the scheduled castes and tribes, backward castes, and Dalits are combined, his party would have the majority of people in this country behind it. The BJP arithmetic was much simpler that this. It did not have to combine several castes. More than 82 percent people in this country are Hindus. There is only one party of the Hindus--BJP. Hindutva [Hinduness] is its only philosophy. Kanshi Ram considers the higher castes separate from himself while the BJP considers all Hindus to be one. If we use Kanshi Ram's reasoning, the BJP should have the right to form the government all over India permanently since the Hindus have the majority vote in India. That fact that the Hindus in the nation are not with the BJP was proved not only during the November elections but during all the elections that were held in the past. How can we accept Kanshi Ram's claim that the Dalits, semi-Dalits, and all backward castes are with him? In any society, the majority never works together, however, the minorities have the tendency to unite in every part of the world. Jinnah had claimed that the Muslims in the whole country were with him and his Muslim League was the only party representing the Muslims. Only the English who wanted to divided India into several countries endorsed Jinnah's claim. The minority Muslims in India did not accept that. When Pakistan was established, and even now, there were and are more Muslims in India than in Pakistan. No one has forced them to live in India. Most of the Muslims in undivided India preferred to stay in secular India rather that going to Islamic Pakistan. What better example can there be to show the hollowness of the claims made by the sole representatives of a caste or religious group? Kanshi Ram, who has the rag of 68 seats and is in the government for a short time, is challenging everyone in the nation on behalf of the BSP. If he does not understand the reality of BJP, we will present him with the example of Devi Lal. Devi Lal had won 86 of the 90 seats in the Haryana vidhan sabha. At that time, he was considered the most powerful leader using caste as an issue. He not only considered himself the leader of the Jats in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan, but also wanted to become the leader of farmers all over the country. The BJP was confident that all Hindus were with it. If they were not, they were going to be. Kanshi Ram believes that all Dalits and semi-Dalits are with him. Since the Hindus and the Dalits and semi-Dalits are the majority, both the BJP and the BSP claim that they can form a government over the whole nation. Devi Lal also had the same confidence in the majority. He knew, and said openly, that there are no Jats [farming caste] south of the Vindhya mountains. Therefore, he considered himself the leader of the majority because he was a farmer and not because of the power he got as leader of the Jats. He said that farmers were all over the country and, therefore, farmers were the majority in an agricultural nation. If all farmers united, he would be ruling the whole country. Devi Lal wanted to rule the nation as the leader of the farmers. He used to openly ridicule the Indian Farmers Union. His simple argument was that a union is formed by a weak and minority group to fight against the powerful majority. What need did the farmers have to form a union? They have the majority in the nation, and votes. Devi Lal wanted to form the government of farmers just like Kanshi Ram wants the government of Dalits. Devi Lal ridiculed the farmers union because he believed that the farmers made up the majority in the nation, and they should form the government. The rest of the people should be at their mercy. Similarly, Kanshi Ram ridicules reservation quotas. The majority in the nation are the Dalits and they should have the government. When they form the government, the minority Brahmans, Kshatariyas, and other castes will have reserved quotas. Devi Lal believed that all the problems the farmers have will be resolved once they have their own government. Therefore, he asked the farmers to unite and help him form the government with their votes. Kanshi Ram also says that if the Dalits win the government, all their problems will be resolved. Thus, he is going around telling the Dalits that he will help them form their own government. Just like providing government to the farmers meant Devi Lal being in the government himself, Dalits being in the government means Kanshi Ram being in the government. When being in power becomes the means and end to one's being, then the result usually is what happened when Devi Lal took power or what happened to Indira Gandhi and the country when she became all powerful in the government. The same is happening to Laloo Prasad Yadav in Bihar. Kanshi does not appear to understand that Devi Lal had a broader and more powerful support base, however, he used it to gain a powerful position in the government for himself. How is Devi Lal doing now and what happened to Indira Gandhi? Whichever leader tells the people that his or her becoming the head of the government is the panacea for their ills, is only looking for power for him or herself. Such leaders do not help the people. Instead, just like Bhasmasur [a mythological character] they destroy themselves. What happened to Devi Lal will happen to Kanshi Ram soon. You will see! I am saying this not just because when the goal is only to gain power and position, it is self-destructive. The other reason is that the government of religious groups or a narrow-minded government of small factions just can not succeed in this country. Only a government with popular support can be stable. A government based on confrontation and dissension collapses like a sand castle in no time. The Marxists said, "Laborers of India, unite! You have nothing to lose except your chains." The Indian workers never united to form a government. The farmers were later told to unite and make a government. The farmers have not yet formed their government. The farmers and the laborers were asked to unite and make their own government. They neither united nor did they form a government of their own. Later, in the seventies, all non-Congress parties succeeded in forming their own government. It did not last two and a half years. After 12 years, a government representing the lower and middle castes was formed. It did not last even one year. Then, they tried to unite the people over religion to form a government. By inciting caste-related memories and religious emotions, they created a paralyzing atmosphere. Even religion could not provide stability to the leaders in the government. Now Kanshi Ram is pitting the Dalits, backward castes, and minorities against the high caste people and other exploiters in order to win himself a government position. He is having various castes fighting with each other at different places. He has only 68 seats and is just a junior partner in the government. He has no clout in any other state or the Parliament. What will happen to him in the next election? Now, he is stating; You will see us in 10 states next year and at the Center the year after that! We have many or rather innumerable castes. None of these castes is spread through the whole nation. Those castes that are in every region are not equally powerful in these regions. Any caste that is powerful in one state could be very weak in another. A caste could be able to rule in one place and could be just a server in another. Neither Brahmans nor Rajputs ever ruled the whole nation. Not only have middle and backward castes ruled at one time, but even aborigine groups like Gond, Bhil, Bhilale, Muiya and Santals have also ruled. A caste, a coalition of castes, groups or an organized group cannot rule the whole nation. Those who know their religion and know the caste system of their society did not try to rule the whole nation in the name of religion or caste. If a religion or caste did gain power, however, their government was stable because they cooperated with other religions and castes and had a broad social base for supporting their government. The country has functioned well by the cooperation of opposing forces and not by creating tension and confrontations among groups. When Chandra Shekhar said that many politically illiterate people like Mayavati have emerged, he did not mean that these upstarts have read neither Gandhi nor Ambedekar. He means that these people do not understand the government of this country or the disposition and character of the social, economic, and moral bases that give it stability. One can seize power for the sake of gaining power, however, one cannot maintain it without giving cohesion to the broad political, social, economic, and moral missions. Kanshi Ram does not have such a broad mission. The pathetic man thinks that he will get into government by having the lower castes fight with the so-called high castes. He will have the Indian society bathe in the blood of caste friction. The political parties are not exposing his deceitful ploys because they are afraid of losing Dalit votes. Who is afraid of Kanshi Ram? Only those who have become shallow because of their involvement in corruption. A small rag does not a cloth market fill. What happens when one keeps repeating Allah, Allah? If you do not know, go ask Kabir [poet who ridiculed dogmatism].
