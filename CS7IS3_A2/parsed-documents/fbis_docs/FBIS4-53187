Security Council. Han, here on his second stop of Southeast Asian tour, meets Prime Minister Chuan Likphai and calls on King Adunyadet Phumiphon before centerpiece talks with Thai Foreign Minister Sunsiri Prasong in the evening. On the economic front, Thai leaders are expected to ask active advancement by South Korean businesses and more investment. They are likely to point out the trade imbalance between the two countries. Two-way trade totaled 2.3 billion U.S. dollars last year with Seoul taking 1.2 billion dollars in profits. Han's aides said much of the meetings here will deal with regional rather than bilateral issues, especially with Thailand chairing this year's Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) post-ministerial conference. Agendas include exchange of opinions on latest political developments, the future of ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) which opens for the first time this year, and the future of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and its relationship with ASEAN, the aides said. Han's key points will include briefings on North Korea's nuclear issue and getting Bangkok's support form Seoul's non-permanent membership in the U.N. security Council for 1996-1997.
