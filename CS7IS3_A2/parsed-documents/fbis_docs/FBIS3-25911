This is the most extensive tax law propagation activity in Fujian since the founding of the PRC. Recently the State Taxation Administration decided to conduct a month-long nationwide taxation propagation activity from 23 January to 23 February. This activity had previously been scheduled for April this year. They also decided that 23 January would be the first day of enforcement for the new Tax Law throughout the country. Giving up their holidays yesterday, all taxation cadres set up more than 1,000 propagation centers throughout the province and also went to factories, mines, and enterprises, thus starting the month- long province-wide taxation propagation activity. Wang Jianshuang, a member of the provincial party committee's Standing Committee and vice governor, took part in the propagation activity held in the [word indistinct] center in Fuzhou City.
