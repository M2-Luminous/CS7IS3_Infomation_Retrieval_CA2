A local leader of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) had asked the Colombo government last week to "create conditions to establishing peace" in the embattled northeast where the rebels are fighting for a separate state. In the first reaction to the offer made by an LTTE functionary known as Karikalan, the prime minister said that rebel supremo Velupillai Prabhakaran, 39, must be directly involved in any new peace effort. "Any response from the LTTE must come from Prabhakaran. We have not closed the door for peace. But Prabhakaran is silent," Wickremasinghe told a public rally in central Kotmale region Sunday. He said 14 months of talks with the LTTE ended in failure in June 1990, leading to more bloodshed, and he added that after that debacle all political parties agreed that Prabhakaran must be directly involved with any talks. "No political party has changed that position. We do not want to discourage anyone from talking. But any serious move must come from Prabhakaran himself and no one else in the LTTE," Wickremasinghe told AFP Monday. The latest LTTE peace bid was conveyed to the government by A.T. Ariyaratna, a leader of a non-governmental organisation, who visited LTTE-held Jaffna Peninsula. "I met the (LTTE's Jaffna political leader) Karikalan who expressed their desire to bring about peace. I have conveyed their message to the president," said Ariyaratna who heads the voluntary organisation called Sarvodaya. He said Karikalan's message in Tamil was tape recorded and a transcript was given to President Dingiri Banda Wijetunga who has often repeated that there was no ethnic conflict but a problem of terrorism in the island's north. "I only conveyed to the president (this message) and he said he will give very serious thought to all that and for me to continue what ever confidence building measures," Ariyaratna said. The Tigers had asked the government to create conditions conducive to peace by dismantling a limited economic blockade on the peninsula. There have been no concrete proposals from the Tigers themselves. Ariyaratna, a member of the majority Sinhalese community, said he was planning several more visits to the Jaffna peninsula to "build confidence" between Sinhalese and the minority Tamils concentrated in the northeast. The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Colombo Nicholas Marcus Fernando and the Anglican Bishop of Colombo Kenneth Fernando made separate visits to Jaffna recently and reiterated the need for ending the 22-year-old war. The two clergymen also met with several LTTE leaders, although the Tiger supremo Velupillai Prabakaran did not make an appearance. Wickremasinghe also said the government hoped that the LTTE's political wing, known as the People's Front of Liberation Tigers (PFLT), would contest local council elections in parts of the embattled northeast. "We wanted to give them a chance to test their popularity and then come for talks. But they have not responded," Wickremasinghe said. The elections are scheduled for March 1. Security forces, who have been acquiring more hardware and men in recent months, are currently conducting limited operations against LTTE positions in the island's east ahead of the local election.
