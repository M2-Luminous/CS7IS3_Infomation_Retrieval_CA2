Vengerov, chairman of the Court of Appeal for Information Disputes: "Court of Appeal for Information Disputes Under the Russian Federation President Ruling No. 15 `On the Violation of Legal and Ethical Norms in ZAVTRA Articles,' dated 2 June 1994, Moscow"] [Text] The Court of Appeal for Information Disputes under the Russian Federation President, after examining the contents of a ZAVTRA article entitled "World Roguery" (Nos. 15-16, 1994), and having heard the expert conclusions of M.A. Melnikov and S.A. Modestov, the statement by the Russian Federation Ministry of Justice, the warning to the newspaper ZAVTRA from the Russian Federation Committee for Printed Materials [Roskompechat], the speech by S.P. Gryzunov, deputy chairman of the Russian Federation Committee for Printed Materials, and explanations from ZAVTRA's Deputy Chief Editor V.G. Bondarenko, has established: That the Court of Appeal has already issued a statement on articles in ZAVTRA which violate legal and ethical norms, particularly the item by I. Andronov entitled "Secrets of the Kremlin" in which the chamber noted an abuse by the ZAVTRA editorial team of the freedom of mass information, and a violation of Paragraph 4 of the Russian Federation Law "On the Mass Media." (See Court of Appeal Statement No. 1 of 4 April 1994, published in ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, 13 April, 1994....) ZAVTRA's editorial team ignored the Court of Appeal's statement of 4 April 1994 and it continues the publication of materials consituting a gross violation of legal and ethical norms. The interview with A. Zinovyev, carried under the heading "World Roguery" (Nos. 15 and 16, 1994), contains direct calls for unleashing war, the violent overthrow of constitutional order, the inflamation of social and national intolerance and hostility.... An analysis conducted by the Court of Appeal into the item "World Roguery" concludes that ZAVTRA violated a number of legal and ethical norms: "The Declaration of Human Rights and Freedoms" (Article 4), the Russian Federaion Constitution (Article 29), the Russian Federation Law "On the Mass Media" (Article 4). The application for ZAVTRA's registration is at notable variance with the actual content of many of the newspaper's items. Considering the aforestated, and guided by Articles 4, 9, and 20 of the Statute on the Court of Appeal, the Court of Appeal has decided: 1. To recognize that the article "World Roguery" published in the newspaper ZAVTRA constitutes an abuse of the freedom of mass information: It contains calls for the physical removal of a number of state figures, advocates war, inflames social and ethnic enmity, insults the Russian Federation president, and denigrates and humiliates persons mentioned in the article, which constitutes a gross violation of Article 4 of the Russian Federation Law "On the Mass Media." 2. To take cognizance of the fact that the Russian Federation Committee for Printed Matter has submitted an official warning to ZAVTRA in respect of the article "World Roguery," while the Russian Federation General Prosecutor's Office has instigated criminal proceedings pertaining to evidence of crimes which entail liability for calls for the forcible alteration of the constitutional order and for the propaganda of war. 3. To recommend that the Russian Federation Committee for Printed Matter return to the question of adopting measures provided for by law in respect of the article by I. Andronov entitled "Secrets of the Kremlin" in the newspaper ZAVTRA (No. 11). 4. To propose that the Russian Federation Committee for Printed Matter review the correlation between the application by the newspaper's founder for its registration and the actual content of the articles in line with Article 15 of the Russian Federation Law "On the Mass Media." [Signed] A.B. Vengerov, Chairman of the Court of Appeal.
