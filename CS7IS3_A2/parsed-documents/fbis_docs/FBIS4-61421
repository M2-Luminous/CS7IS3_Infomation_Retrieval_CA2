Sergey Stepashin, director of the Russian Federal Counterintelligence Service, said this at a meeting on Thursday evening with members of the parliament and government of Kabarda-Balkaria in Nalchik. He expressed the view that Viktor Chernomyrdin is most likely to hold a dialogue with the Chechen leader since economic talks are the main way of resolving relations between Moscow and Groznyy. Regarding the situation in the northern Caucasus, the director of the Federal Counterintelligence Service noted that one cannot speak of stabilization in the region without a settlement of relations with Chechnya. Stepashin said that, in its present form this republic represents a threat to the stability of the Russian Federation. In the view of the head of Russian counterintelligence, dialogue with Dudayev should be conducted in a tough manner and the primary task is normalization of the situation on the railroads crossing Chechnya.
