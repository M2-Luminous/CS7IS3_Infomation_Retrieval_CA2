Rytik, Belarussian Scientific Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology; UDC 616.981:612.017.1] [Abstract] WHO's HIV diagnostic recommendations whereby the incidence of infection is established using two-stage screening for detecting antibodies to the virus in the blood serum based on the outcome of an ELISA (enzyme immuno assay) test are discussed and it is noted that HIV have been detected in cultivated lymphocytes isolated from seronegative patients. This factor calls for direct detection of the virus components in the lymphocyte cultures of the patients. The findings of such attempts are presented. The blood of married couple S was examined for three years whereby enzyme immuno assay study to determine HIV antibodies was carried out using Antigen, Vektor, and Epitop commercial test systems. The study confirms the need for an extremely cautious approach to the false-positive results of serological tests, especially in the cases where antibodies to the p24 and p55 HIV-1 proteins are determined in the immunoblot assay since they indicate fresh infection. Moreover, the case of patient Sf from whose blood antibodies to HIV-1 proteins disappeared with time confirms known data on the possibility of silent HIV infection when only the polymerase chain reaction and/or virus isolation are capable of correctly to diagnosing HIV infection. Thus, an uncertain outcome of serological analysis calls for a comprehensive virological and molecular biological study so as to avoid misidentifying infected persons with false-negative serological test results.
