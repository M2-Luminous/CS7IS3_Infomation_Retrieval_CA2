Ishida said that of 60 related laws that are required to be amended to implement a deregulation program covering 875 products in the stimulus measures, the government plans to amend 40 laws in a single package and the remaining 20 separately. Under the government-announced deregulation program, which covers 875 items, a total of 1,591 licensing and approval systems will be deregulated. Director General Ishida said: "People may think it is easy to deregulate current systems. But, actually, carrying out deregulation is very hard work because it requires the amendment of laws. Although we want, as much as possible, to amend those laws in a single package, the more difficult ones have to be amended separately." His remarks explained the government's approach to tackling deregulation.
