Dr Shankar Dyal Sharma, and later by the country's Minister of State for External Affairs, Salman Khurshid. And rightly so. The remarks focussed on the person of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, which apart from violating established norms of diplomacy, reflect poorly on India's case on Kashmir. What has actually agitated the minds of the Indian leadership, causing the kind of outbursts as have more come out of Delhi, is the Pakistani PM's expose of Indian atrocities in Kashmir before the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva Even if President Sharma's attack on Ms Bhutto's family problems is accepted at face value. where is the connection between the PM's differences with her brother and the Indian troops's gross human rights violation against the people of Kashmir? if anything. Dr Sharman's words are of an oppressor desperate to deflect world opinion from the real issue. Salman Khurshid's diatribe against the PM in which he likened her to a hot air balloon about to seem to come from considerations of a different nature -- that of a minority community member trying to prove his credetials in the Congress which has brought him in primarily as a showpiece of the so-called Indian secularism. Hence it is understandable to see a carerist like him repeating parrot-like what his benefactors want him to say. But then he he is not the only Muslim who is willing to do the dirty work for his masters. farooq Abdullah before him had taken upon himself to do the same, though only to be humbled and chased out of the Valley by the power of Kashmiri people's urge for freedom. A test case for the Sheikh's position having any relevance to the concerns of his people would be for him to go back and try living in the Valley. Such a venture on his part can easily demonstrate who the hot air balloons really are. It is sad that toadies and frontmen of New Delhi have no sense of shame in pleading a case that stands widely condemned not only by Muslim nations but several of those countries as well which had traditionally been supportive of India's stand vis-a-vis Kashmir. People like the Sheikh and Khurshid may have an uncontroliable desire to get public positions at any cost from their paymasters but inpursaing these goals they can sve themselves from a great deal of embarassment -- that is, if they are capble of feeling embarassed -- by asking themselves if they are capable of feeling embarassed -- by asking themselves if they should be doing all this at the expense of the blood of their fellow Muslims.
