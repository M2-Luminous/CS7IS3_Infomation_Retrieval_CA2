Fidel met Colombian businessmen from the financial and investment sectors hours before returning to Havana. Fidel also held a comprehensive meeting with those expressing Colombia's solidarity with Cuban organizations. During the 16 June meeting with those expressing solidarity with Cuban organizations, Castro stressed that Latin America still lacks a true sense of integration, although the summits help this. He added that the main obstacle to Latin American integration is the United States, which wants to divide the continent and limit its independence. Fidel pointed out that this is why Washington advocates bilateral accords, just as it did regarding the foreign debt which it negotiated one on one because it does not want to face a united Latin America. Fidel also stated that the Ibero-American summits are so important that the enemy to the north was envious and called another summit in Miami, a city which it hopes to turn into the Latin American capital. As in his Cartagena address, Fidel reiterated that Cuba is not opposed to that summit even though Cuba believes it was cowardly to exclude Cuba since U.S. leaders are afraid of words, ideas, and the truth. He added that this shows political weakness. Fidel pointed out that he would attend if he were invited, even to Miami. The organizers, however, have already said that this will not happen. He explained that he is not opposed to the summit because he expects the Latin American countries to firmly defend the region's interests in that forum.
