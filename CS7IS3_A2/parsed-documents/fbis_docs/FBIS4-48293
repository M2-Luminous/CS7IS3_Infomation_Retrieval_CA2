However, church commissioners said in London that the decision was unlikely to mean an immediate movement of substantial sums into South African companies. They said that proper research and monitoring would continue to ensure that potential investment conformed with ethical guidelines. Observers at the conference said South Africa would gain from acting as a conduit to the rest of Africa with better transport links, while its skilled technicians and engineers would be cheaper than their counterparts from Europe and the United States.
