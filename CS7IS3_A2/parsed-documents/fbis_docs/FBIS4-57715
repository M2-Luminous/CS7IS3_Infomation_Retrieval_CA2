[Reporter Cecilia Cayone] The only thing pending now is for the executive to adopt the necessary procedures to implement this so that public employees may receive the salary increase ordered by former President Ramon Jose Velasquez. Gustavo Tarre Briceno, chairman of the Chamber of Deputies' Finance Committee, said that the National Congress made only a small change to the law submitted by the executive. [Begin Tarre recording] The only modification made by the National Congress to the executive's request was to grant 300 million bolivares to programs for Lake Maracaibo's eastern coast bearing on the (?survival) of that area. Some 60,000 people, living with the danger that the dike could break, have to be relocated. Although that program requires a lot more money than that, the Congress made this contribution. This decision, in conjunction with assistance already rendered and that was budgeted for next year, should resolve once and for all the problems affecting a region whose petroleum riches contribute the largest percentage of Venezuela's budget. [end recording] [Cayone] By the end of this month or during the first quarter in June, public employees will be able to begin collecting their salary increase.
