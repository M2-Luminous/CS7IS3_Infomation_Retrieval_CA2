Now it is no longer just a matter of concern to us, who feel discriminated against and endangered in our own country, a fact to which we have been drawing attention, so far in vain, in our earlier memorandums from 1990-93. The appeal, issued by the so-called Association of Zitny Ostrov Towns and Villages and that which is planned for Komarno on 8 January 1994, is an obvious anticonstitutional attempt to subvert the state. Therefore, we appeal: 1. To the supreme state bodies of the Slovak Republic not to permit anticonstitutional goings-on in that assembly, and their consequences. 2. To the National Council of the Slovak Republic [NRSR] to revise its resolution of 23 June 1993 (concerning Council of Europe recommendation Number 1201) in accordance with the Constitution and the legal system of the Slovak Republic. 3. To the NRSR to pass a law on the protection of the state language. 4. To ensure that at least one Slovak school or class be functioning in every community of the Slovak Republic. 5. To ensure that, in the bilingual designation of towns and communities, the transcription of their present Slovak names into the language of the minority be used. 6. To the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to advise European structures, and the Council of Europe in particular, that the recognition of above-standard rights for the Hungarian minority sets a dangerous precedent that might lead to destabilization in other European countries as well. 7. To the church authorities to ensure that religious services in the Slovak language be held in every town and village. 8. To the NRSR to pass a law on the protection of the Republic, in the spirit of the "Second Memorandum." To Citizens of Hungarian Nationality Esteemed fellow citizens of Hungarian nationality! At the threshold of the second year of our common republic, we appeal to you, in the interest of continued peaceful coexistence, not to yield to political pressures undermining our stability and, thereby, head off the creation of any social conflicts. The Slovak Republic is our common homeland and belongs to all of us. Let us therefore, as citizens, seek common ground; let us seek the path toward unity and toward the stability and enhancement of our common homeland. Accept this new year's message as a call for further peaceful and virtuous coexistence in the common homeland.
