Mr Han, prevented from returning to China last year after being released from jail and allowed to go to the United States for medical treatment, sat in a sea of swaying lights to address up to 12,000 people. "The memory of flesh and the broken bones under the tanks still awakens me from my dreams," said Han, who was later mobbed by autograph hunters. "It is the first time that I have joined this function, and it is the first time I can talk about my feelings for June 4 in public. The memory of the tanks are still painful. "I will always remember that I am a survivor, and a survivor has his own dreams." Organisers of the vigil, who claimed that up to 45,000 people attended, strode solemnly through the crowd to lay a wreath at the feet of a replica of the Goddess of Democracy statue that had been the focus of the student protests in Beijing. Legislator and chairman of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of the Patriotic Democratic Movement in China, Szeto Wah, discounted rumours that his organisation was about to fold. "The struggle must continue, especially on a piece of land which will return to China so soon," he said. Local trade unionist, Lee Cheuk-yan, said Hong Kong people would always remember the dead of Tiananmen even if Beijing a put a stop to open protests after the handover. "We are very sure people will continue to support democracy in China even after 1997," he said. "After five years they have not a forgotten. They will not forget after 1997, even if the authorities at that time do not allow us to hold this sort of activity," he said. A small band of protesters later moved on to the Happy Valley headquarters of Xinhua (the New China News Agency), setting up an altar to democracy. Police were reported to have ordered several people to move on. In Beijing, the heavy security seen all last week was still apparent, but the mood in the capital appeared more relaxed as it became clear that the fifth anniversary of the massacre would pass without any major incident. Uniformed and plain-clothes police were again out in force in Tiananmen Square and the northwestern university district, but life in the city carried on much as it would on any other Saturday. Most of the more than 100 police officers stationed in and around Tiananmen Square were content to sit and watch tourists pose for photographs. The Monument to the People's Heroes in the centre of the square where students made their last stand five years ago was securely roped off to everybody, except a group of primary school children in pristine red and white young pioneers uniforms who formed a guard of honour on the uppermost level. Many of the tourists from outside Beijing who visited the square seemed unaware of the significance of the day. All the major universities in Beijing were again closed off to unauthorised visitors and police maintained road blocks at key intersections around the campus of Beijing University. But the police seemed relatively relaxed, allowing several foreign journalists into the university district but making sure no one went on campus. The residents of the university district, which includes Beijing's so-called Silicon Valley, did not appear bothered. "It's nothing to do with me, why should I care if there are police outside my door," an employee of one computer firm said. "It's like this every year; you get used to it after a while."
