The Guangzhou fair, which opened on the morning of April 15, is held biannually, in spring and autumn. This is the 75th session. Some 2,800 enterprises on the Chinese Mainland have brought products to the fair. Trade delegation from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region made successful deals worth 39 million U.S. dollars in the first five days of the fair, accounting for 80 percent of the delegation's early-set target. The trade mission from the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is making full use of the autonomous region's advantages to actively open up markets in Muslim countries, while maintaining its existing markets in Hong Kong and the United States. Xinjiang chalked up a business volume of 16.48 million U.S. dollars in the first five days alone, with its local products such as Hami melons showing sharp increases compared with corresponding figures of previous spring sessions. Chinese caterpillar fungus, which is a local product found only in Tibet, has won favor from businessmen from Singapore, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan. Besides these, Tibetan carpets and highland barley juice from Tibet are also in great demand at the fair. Trading officials from Tibet told reporters that they could not only do businesses at the fair, but also make new friends through the fair. Also, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region would not like to be left behind. Trading officials from the autonomous region have made active efforts to sell local products, such as rosin and talcum. In the first five days, the trading delegation clinched a business volume of 74 million U.S. dollars.
