[Begin "Nzuma" recording] We are aware that UNITA is assembling forces in the north, in the (Giata) area, across the Lombe River. They have also been gathering forces in the south, slightly north of Cagandala. We believe those units will be carrying out attacks within the next 24 to 48 hours. We are waiting for them. We are vigilant, and we are following these developments closely. We are taking measures so that the fighting will occur well away from Malange, so that the people are left alone. The only reason the enemy has not attacked yet is because it has suffered many losses. Nonetheless, [UNITA] General Chimuco has issued specific orders. Only yesterday, three UNITA soldiers turned themselves over. They were wearing their uniforms and had guns. They came from the area of Quissolo, and they confirmed that Gen. Chimuco ordered a new attack by the same military unit that was repelled on 23 January. [end recording]
