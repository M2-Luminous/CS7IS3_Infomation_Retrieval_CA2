Three months from now, the press, radio, and television are expected finally to get legal protections appropriate for contemporary media. But much remains to be done in the economic, social, and professional domains.... Three months from now, if all goes as expected, Morocco's parliament will be asked to put an end to an anomaly that has persisted for half a century. More specifically, in April the very obsolete "dahir" [statue] that has regulated journalists' status and governed their professional conduct since the era of the French protectorate is to be abrogated and replaced. For the thousand or so Moroccan journalists working at the two television stations, two national radio stations, and some 400 newspapers and periodicals, the end of prehistory is thus in sight, since their status will be fully recognized in the law, if not fully in practice. Over the last year, the commission established in March 1993 to follow up on the National Colloquium on Information and Communication has elaborated a series of legislative bills to be submitted to the deputies for approval. Among the bills (none has yet been made public) is the new statute on professional journalists, destined to replace the 1942 "dahir." A boiler-plate statute, it extends freedom of information protection to professional journalists who have been issued a special card by the joint commission. Most importantly, it stipulates in Article 2 that "journalists have right of access to sources of information," a provision that thus formulated almost amounts to a small revolution: Investigative journalism traditionally has been considered tantamount to espionage. Another bill is supposed to replace the "dahir" decreed in 1940 "in the French zone of the Moroccan empire" limiting activities of film crews and photographers. Under the new bill, "taking of photographs is not regulated or subject to any prior administrative formalities." No more police interference or confiscation of film on the pretext the subject being photographed was of "strategic significance." With respect to film takes for television, the obligation to submit beforehand a detailed description of each shot and afterward allow authorities to view the footage is replaced by simple prior accreditation. In addition to creation of a National Media Observatory (to be responsible among other things for public opinion polls), changes are expected to include appointment of press attaches in each ministry, restructuring of the Advanced Institute of Journalism in Rabat, and establishment of a High Council on Information--a body of "wise men" with advisory powers. The only point of contention: its composition. It is not yet clear whether the final make-up of the Council will be very restricted (10 to 15 members, jurists and academics) or enlarged to include representatives of journalists' unions and newspaper management. Social Malaise But important as it is, this updating and modernization of the laws should not obscure the fact that taken as a whole Morocco's media establishment--especially the written press--is far from flourishing. Out of 406 registered publications--two-thirds of them in the Arabic language, mostly specialized and trade journals--very few pay their employees adequately or regularly. The malaise is thus first of all social in nature, and the scope of the problem went unrecognized until three well-known journalists died in abject poverty in 1993. But there are also structural problems. In a document prepared for the National Colloquium on Information, Jamal Eddine Naji, a journalism teacher and member of the Moroccan Human Rights Organization, drew up a list of these dysfunctions: the precarious financial condition of newspapers, the small size of the advertising market, the weakness of editorial staffs, absence of training, total lack of knowledge about the readership.... The absence of any means of monitoring sales and circulation only adds to the impression of disorder. Of course, we know that during the Gulf war and the rape trial of commissioner Tabet, the dailies had record press runs--up to 200,000 copies. But do the figures announced in normal times (100,000 for LE MATIN, 80,000 for AL-ITTIHAD AL-ICHTIRAKI, 50,000 for L'OPINION and AL-ALAM, 30,000 for AL-BAYANE) really correspond to circulation? And what are actual sales? Another problem: the poor distribution of Moroccan news publications outside Morocco. Whereas LE FIGARO, FRANCE SOIR, L'EQUIPE, and ACHARQ AL-AWSAT are printed locally in facsimile, and proceeds from sales of foreign newspapers in Morocco amount (after conversion and transfer) to $10 million per year, the local press is still unable--or barely able--to find readership abroad. "The French, Tunisian, and Egyptian markets are much more protectionist in this area than our own," newspaper executives complain. "In Algeria, it is impossible even to find a distributor. In late 1991, one small entrepreneur tried his hand at it: The experiment lasted all of three months." One of the most important questions is not even addressed: Is the Moroccan press able to offer a product sufficiently generalized and informative to attract non-Moroccans outside the country? Alas, for now the answer must be no. The goodly number of party newspapers, including some of real quality, the existence of a respectable economic and commercial press, and the recent appearance of more hard-hitting weeklies cannot hide the lack of a single really independent daily newspaper. The readership exists, and so does the investment capital, but no one has done more than toy with the possibility. The broadcasting sector, although greatly modernized since creation of the encrypted 2-M station and radio station Medi-1, seems paralyzed by the old taboos whenever it reports on internal politics. The result: Events as important as the legislative elections of June 1993 and the failed governmental alternation have been covered only from a partisan and thus selective slant in the press, radio, and television. This lack of objectivity ultimately penalizes the newspapers and lays bare their often archaic operating structures. Disappointed and weary readers are turning increasingly toward journals that offer a greater variety of news and do not shrink from scandal; such journals have had unprecedented growth in recent years. The pioneers in this domain, Mustapha Alaoui and "Ousbou' Assahafi Wa Assiyassi," have been overtaken by former cartoonist Mohamed Filali, who today heads a small group of three periodicals with press runs totaling close to 700,000. What is distinctive about these journals is that they cover everything, address interests of all readers (including Islamists), and blithely commingle little "scoops" and gross rumors. "The government has done much to help the press," says the Ministry of Information--"help it become more professional, and if necessary help it cope with the chores of management." Communist Ali Yata, political party leader and newspaper publisher, enthusiastically confirms that "never has the Moroccan press made such important advances as those of the last few years." That much is probably true. Journalists are getting a variety of benefits, newspapers are getting subsidies, and even the National Press Syndicate, headed by the able Mohamed Larbi Messari, is getting assistance. Hassan II dips regularly into palace coffers to support dailies regardless of political affiliation. Since 1987, the "annual royal gift" of about 20 million dirhams ($2 million) has been divided into checks distributed in a televised ceremony to managing editors of the various newspapers. Admittedly, no one exactly knows what happens to the money, and journalists, who are asking for a little more transparency, would like to see training programs get the lion's share. All the same, the gesture is far from negligible, and neither are the efforts made by the Ministry of Information to improve the circulation of the big national dailies. Vast `Uplift' Perceived as an anomaly, even an archaism, the lumping together of the Information and Interior portfolios--for the last eight years both have been under the wing of the same bicephalous minister, Driss Basri--has been from one standpoint paradoxically helpful. A strategic sector, information has been beefed up with material and human resources it previously lacked, and the minister--who has been quite careful, apart from a couple of gaffes, not to be accused of "controlling" the journalists--has in general tried to discourage filings of numerous court actions against the press by the state or private individuals. Everyone agrees, however, that the current arrangement is outdated. If the opposition had been included in the government that issued from the last legislative elections, the two ministries were to have been delinked. For the moment, the vast task of "lifting up" the Moroccan media still falls on the shoulders of Driss Basri--a man who fervently believes in that mission. As for the future of the Information Ministry, almost anything is possible: a complete and autonomous ministry, a state secretariat, a directorate under the prime minister? Increasingly, however, voices are being raised calling for it to abolished outright and replaced by a communication agency. That would be a proud milestone in the "new deal" for Moroccan journalism.
