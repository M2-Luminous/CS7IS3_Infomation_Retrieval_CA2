[Darawshah] First of all I object to such description. We are not Israeli Arabs. We are Palestinians and are citizens of the State of Israel. We are part of the Arab nation. Therefore, I hope Arab reporters and media would not use such an appellation. [passage omitted] [Al-Imam] Nayif Hawatimah, leader of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] has said you are very displeased with the Cairo agreement and that you will demand that the Israeli Government cancel it. [Darawshah] We used the phrase "having reservations." This is the ?(view) of Palestinians inside Israel. The majority of the political forces, including the Arab Democratic Party, welcomed the Oslo agreement as an agreement of principle, hoping that this would be (?followed) by a detailed agreement ensuring Palestinian rights. However, Israel's attempt to obtain big gains from the Palestinian side without offering real concessions made us express reservations over the Cairo agreement, without expressing opposition. We have reservations. [passage omitted]
