He told the Tunisian newspaper AL-SABAH today that the United States remains an obstacle in the way of such a resolution. Washington is asking the PLO to resume negotiations with Israel, although it knows that this is impossible without a Security Council resolution. Qaddumi accused the current team at the U.S. State Department of being biased and sympathetic toward Israel and trying to extort the Palestinian people, as he put it.
