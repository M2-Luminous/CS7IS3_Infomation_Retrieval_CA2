The collected sulphur dioxide can be recycled. A membrane absorber is a device which brings gas in contact with fluid. It consists of a series of hollow fiber membranes, through which a fluid passes. The noxious fumes flow on the surface of the fibers, with some being absorbed by the fluid. In the membrane absorber, the stream of fumes is crosswise to the stream of fluid. The advantage of this is that the reduction of pressure is small and the unwanted oxidation of sulphite to sulphate is low.
