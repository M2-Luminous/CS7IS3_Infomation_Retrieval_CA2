The unexpected movements of such high-ranking personalities give rise to the usual flurry of speculation and conjecture of all kinds, especially as there have been rumors recently that the president's health has deteriorated seriously. Rather than indulge in unproductive speculation, we telephoned the head of the president's press service, Anatoliy Krasikov. Here is what he said: [Begin Krasikov recording] It had long been planned that they would see each other at some stage. After all, the government has prepared the draft budget for them to look at. This draft has been forwarded to the president, on the one hand, and to the Duma on the other. The Duma is starting to debate the draft. In other words, these issues have to be discussed. There are also a number of other practical questions. Right from the outset we said that the president was going there not just for a vacation but also to do some work. He is sending us documents. He is relaxing too. The other day he took a trip outside Sochi. So, he has done a little travelling in the North Caucasus. But he cannot cut himself off completely from political life in the country. So, he has to hold consultations with people here on the issues that the government is examining. This led to rumors that the president had returned to Moscow. He hasn't been in Moscow at all. Instead, he will meet Chernomyrdin there, on the spot, and discuss these things with him. So, it's nothing to do with his health, or -- there have also been other rumors about some kind of coup and God knows what else. This is all a strategy aimed at whipping up tension, which suits certain people. [end recording]
