National Mission To Vote Against the PRD" -- capitalization as published] [Text] The videos aired by the Presidency showed in a straightforward fashion how the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party] used the money of the Panamanian people. THEY TOOK IT AS IF IT BELONGED TO THEM while lying and deceiving the people. They played with a matter as important as NATIONALISM for their personal gain. For 22 years, they made a mockery of the nationalist struggle of more than six generations just to remain in power and carve out the PIE. How many dead, how many students who gave their lives for this nationalist struggle were sacrificed by these men for the sake of stealing the people's money! They paid off union leaders and then poked fun at them during their Cabinet Councils! That is why the national mission of all Panamanians without regard for political parties MUST BE TO VOTE AGAINST THE PRD. THE PRD IS THE COMMON ENEMY. This is no new PRD. It is the same thieving, criminal, embezzling PRD that made a mockery of the people, with a false spirit of nationalism and which is corrupt to the bone. They are the same ones: ERNESTO PEREZ BALLADARES, RIGOBERTO PAREDES, ALFREDO ORANGES, CARLOS DUQUE, MARIO ROGNONI, RODOLFO CHIARI, THE DIGNITY BATTALION MEMBERS, AND THE CODEPADI [Committee for the Defense of the Fatherland and Dignity]. It shamed the people that presidential candidate Perez Balladares admitted going to the military's meetings at the TINAJITAS garrison to behead presidents. As Targidio Bernal [former justice and government minister] brazenly stated in the video: "We changed two presidents with one crushing blow to the balls." The theft at the Fortuna Dam, one of the hundreds that they carried out, raised the project's cost from 250 million balboas to 500 million balboas. ALL THAT FILTH AND IMMORALITY regarding sinecures, mistresses, and sinecure jobs for $3,000 and $3,500, as that creature called MANUEL SOLIS PALMA AND OTHER PRD MEMBERS admitted. The people of Panama must respond to that. VOTING AGAINST THE PRD IS THE NATIONAL MISSION. WE WILL VOTE AGAINST CORRUPTION, THEFT, AND CRIME. [Signed] Panamanians for Democracy, Honesty, and Civilian Rule.
