One of the many advantages offered by the funds is that they channel their money into portfolios of securities such as treasury notes, bonds, bank certificates, and stocks in order to spread risk and guarantee suitable returns for investment fund stockholders. The success of the funds depends primarily on being managed efficiently and on the soundness of the economic climate as well as on the availability of the "goods" in which these funds trade--i.e., stocks, bonds, treasury notes, etc. They are limited by the availability of securities in the market. In other words, the supply of these "goods" should be increased in order to help mobilize savings and channel them into this new vehicle, just introduced to the Egyptian market, in a manner consistent with Egyptian economic conditions at this stage of economic liberalization. An Effective Tool of Prosperity and Affluence Mahmud 'Abd-al-'Aziz, president of the Federation of Egyptian Banks and chairman of the National Bank, sees investment funds as new mobilization vehicles that address small investors who lack experience or who are averse to risk and who are unable to keep track of the capital market. Furthermore, such funds are suitable for our conditions in Egypt because they allow their investors to liquidate them when they wish. Investors are able in the early stages to redeem their investment certificates at their true value. The funds are managed by experts who are fully knowledgeable of market conditions. A fund, in return for investor money, would issue financial papers in the form of investment certificates of equal par value which may range from 10 to 1,000 pounds. The banks, by creating such funds, play an important role in attracting small savers to a new type of investment and in preparing them to tolerate risk and invest in the capital market. Mahmud 'Abd-al-'Aziz believes that the funds would be able to increase the supply of goods in the market by purchasing the stock of companies being privatized by the government, and thereby broaden the trading base and help expedite the drive towards privatization. At this point in time, investment funds could effectively help create a state of boom and prosperity by mobilizing small savings and channeling them into the purchase of diversified portfolios of stocks, bonds, and treasury notes, etc. That would create a state of affluence within the framework of an integrated banking strategy to invigorate the capital market. The banks, in turn, would guarantee the securities, publicize companies wishing to issue financial papers, and assure the liquidity of those papers to the extent of 80 percent of their value. That would create conditions of prosperity and would make direct investment attractive to small savers, thereby boosting the capital market which is an important bulwark of any economic liberalization policy. Investing With Calculated Risk Dr. Hamid al-Sayih, former economic minister and chairman of Egyptian-British Bank, said: "The essence of investment funds is that they invest in a variety of financial papers. Let us consider the capital market in Egypt. Despite vigorous attempts at stimulation, it remains practically barren of an adequate mix of financial papers such as stocks, bonds, etc. "That is caused by several factors such as compounded factors of the past, closed-door policies, and forbidding stock companies to issue financial papers. Furthermore, the capital market was closed for a long time before it re-opened. The end result was not simply the loss of the capital, or investment, market. We also lost the expertise needed to operate such a market. "But the open-door policy was officially inaugurated 20 years ago with the promulgation of Law No. 43 of 1943 and it follows that the capital market should have grown and prospered over those 20 years, resulting in an expanding supply of financial papers and other instruments. The capital market is concerned not only with securities but also with numerous other activities, such as financial leasing that could provide an appropriate capital market for Egyptian securities. "The concept of investment funds...funds are created because a large segment of investors lacks the expertise to trade on the exchange and to evaluate financial papers. A fund therefore issues a single certificate that represents a portfolio of financial papers that investors can then acquire. "To do so, a fund must have access to large quantities of various financial papers in order to allow it to spread its risk. "Funds may deal in foreign financial papers but this calls for a great deal of expertise and requires domestic licensing, monitoring, and oversight. That is why the Capital Market Law has closely regulated the funds wherever they may be created." Providing an Appropriate Investment Climate Dr. Hamid al-Sayih added: "The question now is whether the time has come to create effectual investment funds. We must realize that few corporations offer securities in the capital market and that most stock companies are closed. This problem may ease in the future as the propensity to invest picks up momentum. "Secondly, the government should issue bonds rather than treasury notes. Interest on the bonds could be either fixed or variable. The bonds could be of medium term (three to five years) or long-term of up to 10 years. The supply of goods on the capital market would therefore increase whenever the government acts but the options would still be limited, making it difficult for the funds to find an appropriate mix of financial papers in which to invest." Dr. al-Sayih explained that the issue at hand is to create a suitable investment climate, especially since the advanced nations are competing for investments and since the countries of Eastern Europe are considered advanced because of their ample supplies of scientific and technical labor. The developing countries and those of the Third World therefore face intense competition in their efforts to attract foreign investments. Funds Offer Several Benefits Misr Bank chairman 'Isam al-Ahmadi said: "Many benefits and objectives may be realized through the creation of investment funds. These benefits extend to the sponsoring bank as well as to investors, to the capital market, and to the national economy as a whole. The experiences of the Americans, the British, and the French have proved the efficacy of those instruments in helping create strong and vigorous capital markets as well as in boosting individual wealth and quality of life. "But such funds can exist only in an appropriate investment climate and that requires legislative and taxation groundwork as well as capital market regulations. Steps in that direction have already been taken and we are hopeful for even more streamlining. This also requires public awareness and confidence in the banking system and in the instruments it creates. "Numerous benefits will accrue to those in dealings with investment funds. We, on our part, will launch educational campaigns to explain the relationship between fund and client; how to purchase fund shares and how to sell them and redeem them; how the return on investment will be computed; and the manner in which the value of the financial paper is to be calculated. This would help us attract clients to this new investment vehicle by building their confidence in its quality." 'Isam al-Ahmadi added: "We would like to note that investment certificates primarily target small savers since the certificates are issued in increments of 1,000 pounds, allowing any small saver or small investor to tap them rather than turn to savings accounts, bank certificates, and other instruments of bank deposits. Savers whose only choice has heretofore been bank deposits would have available several investment options. Expanding the Trading Base "A most important advantage of mutual funds is that they make it possible for small savers to enter the capital market which has so far been a monopoly of large investors and the wealthy. Investment certificates would reduce and spread investment risk through diversification and through timing by investors. Investor desires will determine which financial papers are to be held by the fund. The higher the return investors seek the more risk they would be willing to assume. Risk may be minimized to the extent of diversification among corporate stocks, treasury bonds and notes, and bank certificates. Investment in stock usually involves higher risk. "Investment funds provide other benefits and help achieve other objectives, such as helping the Egyptian economy achieve the important goal of privatization. By expanding and invigorating the capital market and increasing its efficacy, it would be possible to expand the ownership base for companies whose shares are offered through investment funds. Companies targeted for privatization will therefore find strong demand for the shares they offer as well as a real market that would absorb those shares at fair prices. "As to the capital market--and this is another benefit of mutual funds--invigorating the securities market is both an objective in itself as well as a means. A strong capital market would make it possible for the economic reform program to achieve its objectives, particularly in the areas of privatization, expanding the ownership base, and getting the citizenry involved in the economic activities of the state. "With that in mind, Misr Bank has created a mutual fund capitalized at 25 million pounds and whose investments amount to 500 million pounds. Its investment certificates will be offered to the public over time and it will maintain enough cash on hand to cover redemption demands. As stipulated by law, the fund will not put more than 10 percent of its investments in any one company nor will it acquire more than 15 percent of any one company's shares outstanding." Creating New Instruments Dr. Midhat Hasanayn, professor of Economics and Banking at American University in Cairo, opined that "mutual funds are nothing new but go back at least 15 years. They are a risk-reducing instrument. While more risky than bank certificates of deposit, they offer the least risk of investment instruments because they guarantee a return in addition to the original capital. "Mutual funds were conceived as a middle ground between bank deposits and investments in equity and debt securities. Ranked by degree of risk, bank deposits provide the least risk, followed by treasury notes that guarantee investors a return in addition to the principal but are illiquid and must be held to maturity. In that sense, bank deposits are less risky. "The third investment rank is stock company bonds that pay fixed or variable interest but one must wait for that interest a quarter to a year. Bonds attain liquidity through the stock exchange. "The fourth investment instrument, which entails the highest risk, is company stock. "Mutual funds were therefore conceived as a middle ground between bank deposits and stock exchange securities. The clientele of mutual funds are primarily small savers who may lack expertise. Funds collect investor savings and thereby accumulate the cash they need to assemble a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, treasury notes, and bank deposits. Funds provide their shareholders with liquidity but at net asset value at time of redemption." Restructuring the Capital Market Economist Dr. Muhsin al-Khudari said that "mutual funds are one of the main tools of creating new securities in an operation called "papering." This takes the form of bonds underlying various types of revenue-producing assets whose returns accumulate automatically or are paid out in fixed or variable sums depending on the fund manager's orientation. "Funds are attempts by financial systems to create comprehensive and integrated service portfolios. Their returns are higher than those offered by banks, but they are associated with a degree of calculated risk managed with instruments and techniques that are well-known to fund managers. Funds have therefore been created to meet the needs of risk-taking individuals who seek high returns and who are willing to accept risks in the process." Dr. Muhsin al-Khudari points out certain caveats that must be kept in mind when selecting fund managers. Above all else, they should possess a high degree of skill and expertise, even preceded by loyalty and esprit de corps. This would presuppose scrutiny by various law and order apparats since these fund managers will have access to great amounts of cash with which they can manipulate the markets or do harm to them. This may be averted by not allowing any individual to have single control of a fund but to vest such control in operating teams with highly developed patriotism, sincerity, and technical expertise." Diversified Portfolios Banking expert Nazir Yusif said: "Investment funds are a financial amalgam whose investors are issued shares or certificates, as defined by law, that are valued at no more than 1,000 pounds each. There is no limit to the number of certificates that may be acquired. "A fund's management may invest its cash in a portfolio composed of the stocks of existing companies or of those that are being privatized. It may also buy bonds or treasury notes to diversity the portfolio and therefore spread the risk since stocks that appreciate will cushion the price declines of others in the portfolio. "Funds also maintain enough cash on hand in order to meet redemption requests for the certificates they issue in case investors want their money back. This is called open-investment funds. "Shares in other types of funds, the closed-end kind, are traded on the stock exchange. This is the main difference between the two. "Funds were born in the Gulf countries despite their small market size and their countries' lack of regulatory controls such as those promulgated by the Capital Markets Law No.95 of 1992. However, there are attempts to regulate the Saudi market against broker speculation and manipulation. It is imperative, therefore, to begin monitoring the market and not to hesitate to introduce adjustments or additional regulations in order to control the capital market in Egypt and help it grow. Guarantees to Safeguard Fund Monies Dr. Hasan 'Abbas Zaki, former economic minister and chairman of International Arab Banking Corporation, said that "investment funds are a new activity in Egyptian markets and play a tangible role in energizing financial paper transactions and in attracting small investors to participate in financial activity by subscribing to the certificates issued by the funds. The funds relieve small investors of effort and worry resulting from the lack of know-how or financial expertise to invest their savings in financial markets. Fund managements will assume, on behalf of their shareholders, the tasks of purchasing, diversifying, and maintaining their portfolios as well as distributing the quarterly or annual dividend, as the case may be, in accordance with their holdings in their fund. "Numerous controls have been promulgated by Capital Markets Law No. 95 of 1992 in order to safeguard depositor monies. For example, the Mutual Fund Creation Law stipulates that establishers of a fund are prohibited from managing that fund. The law also stipulates that the investment company investors are the ones to create the fund. Certificate holders are the ones to finance the fund. A fund owner, while buying securities for other certificate holders, would probably buy certain securities for himself. Therefore, the end-result would favor the interest of fund owners. "The law has devised a solution to this so-called conflict of interest between fund investors and fund depositors or certificate holders. That solution is to prohibit investment funds from managing the portfolios of fund subscribers. That is the purpose of the law that regulates fund management companies. "Banks that created investment funds have simultaneously created companies to manage those funds. A company that manages a fund is totally separate from it. An investment fund owns but does not manage, whereas a management company only manages and does not own." Creating New Financial Papers Dr. Hasan 'Abbas Zaki added: "Furthermore, investment funds, by their nature, have the advantage of dealing in large assortments of financial papers in order to spread risk. They buy financial papers in various sectors such as agriculture, industry, tourism, shipping, and other activities. "In addition, the Egyptian capital market still enjoys an advantage, in that it is, by its composition, free of speculation in the sense that the so-called buy-and-sell capability neither rests on the investor nor is a function of future markets. That is an on-going external operation. The reasons for security market collapses on international exchanges, such as Black Monday and subsequent events, is attributed to this type of trading activity. It is preferable not to introduce this type of trading into the Egyptian market in the future. I am constantly warning against copycatting others in violation of our own nature, customs, and traditions. This is the way to avoid creating elements that could cause market turbulence or collapse. "Several factors can shield the market against such risks and they constitute safeguards to protect the fortunes of those who trade in the market." Dr. Hasan 'Abbas Zaki moved on to another point dealing with the natural structure of the market. He said that the Egyptian market is still limited in the quantity of papers in circulation and that, of course, is a burden on the banks. By contrast, bonds constitute a major segment of international markets. In the United States, for instance, we find bonds of various types and maturities ranging from six months to 30 years.
