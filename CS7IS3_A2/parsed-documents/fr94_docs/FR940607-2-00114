FR940607-2-00114 FR940607-2-00069 5. Applicants seek a conditional order permitting the Funds to deposit their daily uninvested cash balances into a single joint account, the daily balance of which would be used to enter into one or more overnight (or weekend or holiday) repurchase agreements. The requested order will maximize the return by minimizing economic and administrative efficiencies by allowing the Funds to enter into large repurchase agreements. 6. Each repurchase agreement will be made by calling a government securities dealer and indicating the rate of interest and size of the desired repurchase agreement. Particular securities to be held as collateral will then be identified and the Fund's custodian bank will be notified. The securities will be wired to the account of the custodian bank at the proper Federal Reserve Bank, transferred to a sub-custodian account of the Funds at another qualified bank, or redesignated and segregated on the records of the custodian bank if the custodian bank is already the record holder of the collateral for the repurchase agreement. The Funds will not enter into repurchase agreements with the custodian bank, except where cash is received very late in the business day and otherwise would be unavailable for investment at all. 7. Each of the Funds has established the same systems and standards, including quality standards for issuers of repurchase agreements and for collateral, and requirements that the repurchase agreements will be ``collateralized fully,'' as that term is defined in rule 2a&hyph;7 under the Act. Identical systems and standards will be adopted by any Future Funds which invest in the proposed joint account. Applicants' Legal Analysis 1. Section 17(d) makes it unlawful for any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such person, acting as principal, to effect any transaction in which such registered investment company is a joint or a joint and several participant with such person in contravention of rules and regulations which the Commission prescribes for the purpose of preventing participation by such company on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants. 2. Rule 17d&hyph;1 provide that no affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such person, acting as principal, shall participate in, or effect any transaction in connection with, any joint enterprise or other joint arrangement in which such registered investment company is a participant unless an application regarding such joint arrangement has been filed with the Commission and has been granted an order. In passing upon such applications, the Commission will consider whether the investment company's participation in the proposed joint enterprise or arrangement is consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act, and the extent to which such participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants.
