The Whole Question Is How, Where, When?"] [Text] The International Conference on Chemical Disarmament is winding up its work in Moscow today. Its organizers are the Committee for Conventional Problems of Chemical and Biological Weapons under the Russian Federation president, and the Russian Academy of Sciences. This is the second such international meeting since Russia signed the convention banning chemical weapons in Paris a little more than a year ago. As of today the convention has been ratified by five states -- Sweden, Norway, Fiji, Mauritius, and the Seychelles. In order to go into effect the convention should be ratified by at least 65 states (this is expected to happen this summer). In the words of Academician Anatoliy Kuntsevich, who spoke at the conference and who until recently chaired the Committee for Conventional Problems, it was clear right from the start that implementation of the convention posed Russia a number of difficulties, primarily economic ones. Russia, nevertheless, intends precisely to act on its obligations. Our country's withdrawal from the convention would in fact mean scrapping the convention, with tragic consequences for all humanity. Academician Kuntsevich also stated for the first time that Russia, without waiting for the convention to go into force, had already started unilaterally converting to other uses the available technical potential for the production of chemical weapons (this in particular true about the facilities in Volgograd Oblast). The equipment has been partially destroyed and scrapped at factories producing the saman and sorin toxic agents. The keynote of many reports at the conference was the need to reach a public and federal accord on the destruction of chemical weapons in Russia.
