Directly or implicitly threaten government intervention if individuals or businesses do not voluntarily comply with a social engineering objective and hope the threat alone is sufficient to get compliance. Companies often give in, but grudgingly and with little commitment to a strategy that might be necessary for the national good. So, when ANC economic adviser Don Mkhwanazi (speaking, of course, in his personal capacity) threatened dire legislative action unless business tackled the issue of affirmative action within 18 months and when the Black Management Forum's Lovemore Mbigi threatens that an ANC government will enforce racial employment quotas, the ground is not being laid for a cooperative approach to addressing the country's skills shortages. Well before the election, ANC loose cannons threatened or promised all manner of things. The result was an understandable confusion among businessmen trying to discern an ANC party line. One point remains clear, however: coercion or its threat do not work. Tangible incentives that benefit companies operating in a bustling economy succeed more often than not. Affirmative action is obviously needed if South Africa's full human potential is to be realised. But it cannot be achieved by edict. Affirmative action in the business sector has to be based on training appropriate, though less-privileged, people in the skills needed by individual companies. The main anecdotal drawback for many businessmen is that trained people are readily lured away from their jobs by other firms whose affirmative action training programmes have been inadequate. An easy counter is to compete by paying more. But when businesses have to comply with racial employment quotas or under the threat of them, the cost of adding to black employee numbers is often not of overriding importance. The application of quotas becomes a certain route to tokenism. And tokenism is the first step towards endemic inefficiency. As a matter of urgency Labour Minister Tito Mboweni must establish affirmative action principles or guidelines in discussion with industry and labour. Incentives for training should be based on appropriate tax breaks even if that gives rise to bleats from those who believe corporate South Africa is paying too little tax. Incentives cannot be based on government hand-outs, but must be designed to take into account the needs of the individual firms involved in affirmative action programmes. Affirmative action, though, will be of little value if closed shot arrangements persist. Delivering appropriate training and jobs to everyone will call for flexibility from unions to allow jobs seekers to bid wages up or down to their appropriate levels.
