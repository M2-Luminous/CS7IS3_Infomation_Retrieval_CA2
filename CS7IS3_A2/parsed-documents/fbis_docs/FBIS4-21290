This statement was made today by the commander of the 13th Infantry Battalion Garrison, General Fernan Perez Casanova. He explained that, for four months, from November to March, a contingent of 300 members of that battalion, headquartered in this port, backed the action to combat marijuana and poppy growing. He added that, as a result, 2,073 marijuana plantations, covering an area of 2,128 square meters, were destroyed. He also reported the destruction of 5,109 poppy plantations covering 5,446 square meters, and of another 2,907 kg of marijuana, as well as the incineration of 30 kg of the same grass already packed. Moreover, he cited the incineration of 152.45 kg of marijuana seed, and 140.61 kg of poppy seed. Perez Casanova remarked that, during these same operations, 11 persons illegally carrying firearms for the exclusive use of the Mexican Army and Air Force were captured. He specified that seven long-range and 10 short-range weapons were seized in the activities. In conclusion, he commented that, although the incidence of marijuana and poppy growing in Veracruz State is low, reconnaissance and inspection flights are nevertheless being made constantly to establish the sites for destructive operations when plantations of these drugs are detected.
