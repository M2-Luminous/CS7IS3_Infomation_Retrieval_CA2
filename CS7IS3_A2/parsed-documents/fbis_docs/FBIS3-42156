"Possibility is not that high at this moment," said Kim Sok-kyu, South Korean Ambassador to Moscow, "but we are studying these ideas because of the precedent of being repaid in aluminum." Kim temporarily returned to Seoul last week to brief the government on recent developments in Russia and to coordinate Seoul's policy toward Moscow. The Paris Club will provide a rough guideline on repayment schedule for South Korea, Kim told a press conference, and an inter- ministerial discussion with Finance and Trade, Industry and Resources Ministries will find various alternatives. Seoul promised 3 billion U.S. dollars in financial aid to the former communist country but delivered only 1.47 billion dollars and suspended the rest at the collapse of the Soviet Union. Seoul has received a list of arms Russia offered for joint development and production, another alternative to loan repayment, but the government will need prudent review before making any decision, said Kim. On North Korea-Russia relations, the envoy said Moscow proposed vice minister-level talks to North Korea from this year but is yet to receive a reply. "North Korea and Russia are gradually restoring their relations of dialogue," he told reporters. Moscow has not abandoned human rights issue with Pyongyang and is determined to insert the rights clause for the workers in a new agreement on operating North Korean lumber yard, he said. President Boris Yeltsin said he wants his South Korean counterpart Kim Yong-sam to make certain to visit Russia this year, and the two countries will consult on this issue, he said.
