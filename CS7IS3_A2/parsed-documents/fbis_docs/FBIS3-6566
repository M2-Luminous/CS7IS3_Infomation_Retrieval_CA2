Japanese Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii offered the triple-dose prescription for economic growth at the first finance ministers' meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Honolulu. "With a sound macroeconomic policy, it is important to strengthen domestic savings, strengthen the private sector and improve human resources," Fujii told his APEC colleagues. Fujii also promised Japan's financial support, both through bilateral and multilateral channels, to help the developing nations in the APEC group. Japanese officials said there was strong interest among APEC ministers in the Japanese model of economic development. "We are pleased that we got this kind of attention from our APEC partners," one Japanese official said. Fujii said Japan's high rate of capital formation has been backed by a high rate of savings among the Japanese people. Research and development done by the private sector has also contributed to the success of product development among Japanese firms, he said.
