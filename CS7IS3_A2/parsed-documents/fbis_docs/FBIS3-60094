In 1993, police mobilized all their personnel resources to fight drug trafficking. The 1993 internal report by the police drug section is devastating. This is an exclusive report by DIE PRESSE: "We are losing track of the overall picture," the report says. The number of police arrests rose from 849 in 1992 to 1,370 in 1993; there was a record number of official investigations [Amtshandlungen] leading to over 100 arrests; and a spate of suspected offenses was reported to the police. "The former Eastern Bloc countries are now being used as caches by the producer countries. Large amounts of drugs are smuggled into Austria by all means imaginable and sold here," a police official said. The dealers have organized themselves into groups and are working in a very professional way. "We have begun to sense this in 1993 for the first time." The dealers work in complete isolation. Third countries build up huge caches in Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic. The local drug scenes in these countries have gotten completely out of hand. Then smugglers are hired. "Eighty percent of drug dealing is controlled by Turks and Yugoslavs," the investigating authorities say. The "stuff" is brought into Austria in cars, buses, or aboard ships; yet the quantities are always less than 1 kg. [passage omitted].
