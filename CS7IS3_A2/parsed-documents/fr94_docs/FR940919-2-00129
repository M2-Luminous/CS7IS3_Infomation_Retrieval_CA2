The parties expected to consummate the transaction on or after September 6, 1994. 1 1 CBEC had filed a notice of exemption under 49 CFR 1150.31 for the acquisition of this segment of rail line. See CBEC Railway, Inc._Acquisition and Operation Exemption_Great Western Railway Company of Iowa, Inc., Finance Docket No. 32453 (ICC served Mar. 18, 1994). GWRI states that the Trackage Rights Agreement was entered into on April 29, 1994, but it was only recently that CBEC acquired the involved line from GWRI. It states that as a condition of the Purchase Agreement, CBEC agreed to grant GWRI trackage rights over the line once the sale was consummated. This notice is filed under 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(7). If the notice contains false or misleading information the exemption is void ab initio . Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke will not stay the transaction. Pleadings must be filed with the Commission and served on: Karl Morell, 1101 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., suite 1035, Washington, DC 20004. As a condition to the use of this exemption, any employees affected by the trackage rights will be protected under Norfolk and Western Ry.
