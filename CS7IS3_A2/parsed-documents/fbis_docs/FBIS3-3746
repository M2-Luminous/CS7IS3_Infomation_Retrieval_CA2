At that time, he said that if China strengthened legislation work from then on, she would surely become a country with a sound legal system within 50 years. Ye Jianying nodded knowingly. When he was elected member of the NPC Standing Committee, China's supreme legislative body, today, he deeply felt that he was shouldering heavy responsibilities. Unlike some other Hong Kong magnates, Tsang Hin-chi graduated from Zhongshan University's Biological Department in 1961 and went abroad to seek his fortune after working in the Biological Chemistry Laboratory of the Guangdong Academy of Sciences for two years. This enabled him to have a better understanding of mainland politics and economics and China's national condition. He said: In the past China was deeply influenced by the Soviet planned economic model. Since the drive of reform and opening up began, it has gradually freed itself from this influence. China, which is establishing a socialist market economic structure, is developing and forging ahead. This has been recognized by the world community. Of course, China has shortcomings. For example, the fact that there is corruption among some officials should not be denied. The problem is how we should approach these shortcomings. An individual or a family inevitably has one inadequacy or another. Ours is a big country. While making achievements, it still suffers some unsatisfactory phenomena. This is quite normal, and, moreover, the government is working to develop strong points and correct shortcomings. To many people, the name of Tsang Hin-chi is synonymous with the title of "Tie King." In fact, the social activities in which he gets involved are so numerous that they far exceed all expectations. In addition to national deputy to the Seventh and Eighth NPC, he is vice chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, member of the Preliminary Work Committee of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Hong Kong Affairs adviser, vice president of the Hong Kong Chinese Chamber of Commerce, professor of Beijing University's Business Administration College, vice chairman of Jinan University's Board of Directors, and vice chairman of Jianying University's Board of Directors. His current election as a Standing Committee member of the NPC serves as a new starting point in the journey of his career and life. Regarding the new role as a mission, Tsang Hin-chi told reporters that the Standing Committee has done a great deal of work on legislation. He noted that the legal system is being gradually instituted and improved, and instituting a legal system from scratch and proceeding from legal construction to legal improvement is a relatively long process. This has also been the case with some Western countries. As the only NPC Standing Committee member from the Hong Kong region, Tsang Hin-chi is faced with the complex reality of Hong Kong being in the last three years of its transition and the historical trend of the Chinese recovery of sovereignty over Hong Kong. One may well say that the matter is complicated and the burden is heavy.
