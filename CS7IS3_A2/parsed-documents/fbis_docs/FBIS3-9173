In these battles, one combatant of the Bosnian Serb Army was killed, and two others were lightly wounded. The Kupres plateau is militarily very important, because strategically important roads go from the Adriatic coast towards central and western Bosnia via this plateau. The issued statement says Serb defenders have so far re-gained about 80 percent of the territory which Moslem extremists from Bugojno seized few days ago. The Moslem forces on Monday attacked the Serb positions between Cajnice, Foca and Gorazde (southeast Bosnia) but all attacks have been repelled with no losses among the Serb troops, these sources said on Monday. The Moslems continued attempting infiltrating terrorist and sabotage groups behind the Serb lines. One such group was detected Sunday afternoon in the area between Cajnice and Gorazde and their attempt was thwarted on time. Another terrorist and sabotage group suffered the same fate near Teslic (northern Bosnia). In the wider region of Doboj (northern Bosnia), the Moslem forces continued with usual provocations. The strongest provocations by the Moslem forces were reported near Mt Ozren, whereas re-grouping of Moslem forces was observed in the valleys of the Rivers Bosna and Spreca.
