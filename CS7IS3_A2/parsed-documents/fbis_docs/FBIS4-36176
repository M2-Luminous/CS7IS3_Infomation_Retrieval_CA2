'Abdallah al-Asnaj, foreign minister of the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY] government that was formed in southern Yemen, said in a telephone interview we held with him this evening from Cairo that Aden will deal positively with the cease-fire decision. [Begin recording] [Al-Asnaj] The DRY -- government, people, and presidency -- repeats its concern for halting the fighting in Yemen. It is only natural that we should welcome Sanaa's decision on the cease-fire, which will begin at midnight tonight. We hope that this decision will not be violated. On our part, we have released an official statement saying that the DRY welcomes this decision and will comply with the time proposed. [Correspondent] Is the cease-fire decision linked to Sanaa's statement that it has tightened its control around Aden? [Al-Asnaj] There is nothing to justify saying that control of Aden was, is, or will be tightened, God willing. Aden and the other governorates in the DRY and the nature of Yemen's sons will not surrender to invasion or occupation. Aden has well-known experience in rejecting and repulsing occupation.
