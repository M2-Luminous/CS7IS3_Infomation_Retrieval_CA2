General Requirements for Grant Recipients The following general grant program requirements should be considered by each applicant in developing both its project timeline and budget. Successful applicants must adhere to all conditions as specified; any deviation from the requirements in this section must be negotiated with DOJ. Grantee Orientation and Coordination. Grantees are expected to coordinate their project activities, where appropriate, with other Federally sponsored ADA technical assistance activities, including those of the Department of Justice (DOJ), the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR), the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (ATBCB), the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and their grantees. The purpose of this coordination is to avoid duplication of effort, to utilize materials already developed by Federal agencies and grant recipients, and to otherwise refer to and take advantage of ADA resources that have already been developed. Additionally, successful applicants will receive an orientation that will familiarize them with projects being undertaken by other successful applicants. Thereafter, 1994 grantees will be expected to exchange information and provide support to each other where appropriate. Evaluation. One goal of this grant program is to determine which education, information dissemination, and compliance assistance strategies are most effective in reaching as many persons as possible in the targeted population with information that serves their particular needs. It is therefore essential that each project describe reliable and objective criteria to evaluate the effectiveness of the project at the conclusion of the period of performance and to provide this information to the Department. Post-Award Monitoring. The Department intends to provide grant recipients with the maximum amount of post-award guidance and technical assistance possible within budget and staff constraints. Within approximately one month of the grant award, the Department will conduct a one-day training session on the ADA and grant management procedures. Each grant recipient will be invited to send two staff persons to this training session. Funds for travel to Washington, D.C. for this training should be included in the proposed grant budget. Applicants are also advised that DOJ staff will make periodic site visits to provide grant recipients with guidance and technical assistance and to monitor the progress of the grant. The Office of Justice Programs (OJP), a component of the Department of Justice, will provide financial management and other services in support of the Public Access Section in the administration of this program. Applicants are advised that copies of the quarterly progress reports sent to OJP must also be sent to the Public Access Section. DOJ Review of Grantee Materials. All materials used or developed by grant recipients must be approved by DOJ in advance of use. Applicants should anticipate careful review of any newly developed materials by the Department to ensure that the materials are legally accurate and should allow ample time in their proposed project schedules for this review. Particular attention should be paid to budgetary and staffing needs to ensure that materials to be disseminated will reach the targeted population in a timely manner during the grant period. Availability of Existing DOJ Materials. Publications that are currently available free of charge from the Department of Justice (DOJ) will be provided to the grantee as resources permit. If an applicant intends to disseminate materials of a nature similar to materials produced by previous DOJ grant recipients or recipients of grants from other Federal agencies, including the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research, it should coordinate such requests with the Department. In general, funds for the reproduction of such materials should be included in the proposed grant budget. Copyrights. Grant recipients are free to copyright any materials they develop, if they so choose, and may continue to reproduce and distribute such materials after the grant period is over. Applicants should be aware that DOJ retains the right to reproduce their materials and to disseminate them to the public at its will, without payment of royalties to the grantee.
