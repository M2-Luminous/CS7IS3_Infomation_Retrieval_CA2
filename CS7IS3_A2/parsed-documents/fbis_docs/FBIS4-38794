Thus, it has become possible to purchase 12 million tonnes of crude oil, mainly from Russia, at $60 per tonne. This is the lowest price at which Ukraine has ever managed to import oil after the prices of energy sources within the former USSR were raised to those prevailing in the world. Petroleum products from this oil will, primarily, be channeled for satisfying the needs of the country's agriculture. Owing to this contract, the problem of fuel for agricultural needs has largely been resolved. This will make it possible to conduct the entire necessary cycle of agricultural work in full and in good time.
