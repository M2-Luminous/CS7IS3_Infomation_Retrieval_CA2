It recognizes the expediency of speeding up the start of talks with Azerbaijan to maintain and develop traditional ties between the residents of border areas of southern Dagestan and the north of Azerbaijan and their freedom of contact. Until agreement is reached on these matters it has been decided, in particular, to establish a border and customs regime that facilitates as far as possible contact between ethnic Dagestanis living on both sides of the Samur River. The protocol was signed, on the Russian side, by Sergey Stepashin, director of the Russian Federal Counterintelligence Service and member of the Russian Federation Security Council, and other members of an important delegation from Moscow. The delegation discussed the sociopolitical situation in Dagestan, problems on the border between Dagestan and Azerbaijan, and the crime situation in the republic. On the Dagestani side, the protocol was signed by Magomed-Ali Magomedov, chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Dagestan, and Abdurazak Mirzabekov, chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Dagestan. Today the Russian Federation delegation met with staff of the Federal Counterintelligence Service of Dagestan and held talks and consultations at the state nationalities committee of the Republic of Dagestan, where discussion of the problem of the Lezgin people was continued. The visiters and hosts noted with satisfaction the fruitfulness of talks with the Azerbaijani delegation on the border yesterday, at which an initial understanding was reached on the Russian and Azerbaijani sides reaching agreement as soon as possible on the establishment of a "transparent" border for Dagestanis living in both states. [passage omitted] Summing up the results of the stay in Dagestan by the delegation of representatives of the federal authorities in a conversation with an ITAR-TASS correspondent, the delegation's head, Sergey Stepashin, director of the Russian Federal Counterintelligence Service said: "We fulfilled the main points of our program and have outlined specific proposals to improve the sociopolitical situation in the republic, particularly in the south. These will be taken to the president of the Russian Federation and to members of the state council [as received], and of the appropriate ministries and departments. "During yesterday's talks with the Azerbaijani side, members of its delegation promised to take our proposals on the border to Geydar Aliyev and other state leaders. And I believe that talks with them on this matter will begin within the next month. "As for the issues of terrorism, the rise in crime in the republic in general, and the Derbent tragedy in particular, I am sure that these problems will be solved. A special group of top professionals -- investigators, lawyers, and others -- will come to Dagestan from Moscow to help with this. I have already issued the relevant instructions. "I would like to wish the Dagestani people continued patience and wisdom so as to improve the situation through joint efforts."
