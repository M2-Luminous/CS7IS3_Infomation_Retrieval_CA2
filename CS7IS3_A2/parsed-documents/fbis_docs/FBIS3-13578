['Abd-Rabbuh] In fact, these meetings have not achieved any positive results. We have not achieved progress on the issues we discussed. The U.S. side still seeks to link the issuance of a Security Council resolution to an agreement on a date to resume the talks. We reiterated that the Security Council resolution will only be of value if it ensures practical steps on the ground to guarantee international protection for the Palestinian people. The issuance of such a resolution is a responsibility shouldered by the international community, not a bargaining card to resume the talks. Therefore, I can say that no progress was achieved in the talks with the United States. Anyhow, the ball now is in the U.S. court. The Americans are required to give answers regarding the Security Council resolution, which should be issued immediately after a delay of approximately three weeks, as well as regarding their stand vis- a-vis the provision of international protection for the Palestinian people. We believe that the issue of negotiations is not a procedural matter. We believe that the objective of the talks, in fact the whole peace process, is to provide security for the Palestinian people and to guarantee their rights. If the security of the Palestinian people will continue to be endangered -- as was proven by the massacre of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque -- what then is the value of the talks and their resumption in this case? Regarding the talks with the Israeli delegation, the delegation that came [to Tunis] was not authorized to hold any serious discussion. What was conveyed to us was no more than formal and secondary decisions issued by Israeli Government and about which we heard. Such decisions will not change the situation on the ground. The settlements and settlers continued to be a source of continuous and daily danger to the life of the Palestinian people as well as a source of threat to the peace process and to any agreement that might be reached regarding the transitional period. The Israelis now know our position very well. The peace process is linked with effective measures on the ground, foremost of which is ending the settlers' presence in the heart of Hebron and in a number of settler centers that represent permanent hotbeds of tension and explosion. Measures include tackling the issue of the presence of armed settlers, especially in Palestinian towns and villages, and providing international protection, especially in Hebron where Palestinian security is exposed to permanent threats. [Al-Shubashi] Has the Palestinian leadership succeeded in presenting all these issues to the U.S. side? Is the U.S. side still insisting that the Palestinians are the ones who should offer concessions? ['Abd-Rabbuh] The U.S. side expressed understanding of Palestinian demands, but wants talks to resume and wants a date for this to be fixed. For our part, we said the Palestinian people and all the forces that want the peace process to succeed in the region hold the view that the success of any negotiations is now linked with practical measures on the ground, sponsored by the international community. On the one hand, this is international protection, and on the other hand, this is Israel shouldering the responsibility to end the armed settler presence and the activities of the settlers. Therefore, the the United States is looking for formal measures. We are looking for substance, so these measures can lead to the successful conclusion of resuming negotiations. [Al-Shubashi] Perhaps the United States has monitored the overwhelming popular anger in the Arab and Islamic worlds. There is also the suspension of talks by Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan pending the resolution of this issue, or until the Security Council issues a resolution on the Hebron massacre. Do you think these factors have had any effect on the developing U.S. position? ['Abd-Rabbuh] In fact, the United States is now facing Arab, Islamic, and even Christian indignation on a very large scale in our region and the world. The United States is hindering the UN Security Council resolution and is trying to use this resolution as a bargaining chip for the sake of resuming negotiations. The United States does not take the dire conditions in the Palestinian territory with any seriousness -- conditions liable to explode at any moment. Therefore, the U.S. reaction is not commensurate or in line with the serious implications of the current situation. Therefore, we hold the United States basically responsible for any negative developments that might appear in the phase. On the other hand, we now welcome the call to hold a meeting of the foreign ministers of the five Arab states concerned with the peace process. We hope it will be held within the next few days to implement stands among us, especially in light of the results of the U.S. position and Israeli intransigence. [Al-Shubashi] Thank you, Mr. Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh. ['Abd-Rabbuh] Thank you.
