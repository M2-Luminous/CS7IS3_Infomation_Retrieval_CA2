This airworthiness directive (AD) applies to the above affected propellers when installed on any agricultural aircraft with any engine, or installed on any aircraft utilizing Textron Lycoming TIO&hyph;540 or LTIO&hyph;540 series reciprocating engines, or IO&hyph;540 series reciprocating engines that have a turbocharger added by the airframe manufacturer or have been modified by a Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) to incorporate a turbocharger, or a turbocharger retrofitted to an IO&hyph;540 engine by any other means. The known affected propellers are generally installed on, but not limited to, the following aircraft: Agricultural Aircraft Fletcher FU24&hyph;950 Cessna A188 Agwagon modified by STC SA895SO Piper PA&hyph;36&hyph;285 and PA&hyph;36&hyph;300 (three-bladed propellers only) Piper PA&hyph;36&hyph;375 Piper PA&hyph;36 Pawnee modified by STC SA3952WE Transavia Airtruk Models and PL&hyph;12/T&hyph;300 Skyfarmer Aircraft With Textron Lycoming TIO&hyph;540, LTIO&hyph;540, and Turbocharged IO&hyph;540 Series Engines Cessna 310 and 320 modified by Riley STC SA2082WE Gulfstream 700 (formerly Rockwell 700, Fuji FA&hyph;300&hyph;12) Helio H&hyph;700 Piper PA&hyph;23&hyph;250 and PA&hyph;E23&hyph;250 (with TIO&hyph;540 only) Piper PA&hyph;31 Navajo (with TIO&hyph;540 only) Piper PA&hyph;31&hyph;325 Navajo C/R Piper PA&hyph;31&hyph;350 Navajo ``Chieftain'' Piper PA&hyph;31P&hyph;350 Mohave Piper T&hyph;1020 (same as PA&hyph;31&hyph;350) Piper PA&hyph;32(R)&hyph;301T Turbo Saratoga Aerostar PA&hyph;60&hyph;600, PA&hyph;60&hyph;601, PA&hyph;60&hyph;601P, PA&hyph;60&hyph;602P, and PA&hyph;60&hyph;700P. Propellers with model designations and serial number ranges listed above and installed on non-agricultural aircraft, which do not utilize Textron Lycoming TIO&hyph;540, LTIO&hyph;540, or turbocharged IO&hyph;540 series engines are exempt from this AD. Propellers with new post-1983 hub configurations, i.e., which have the relocated grease fitting holes near the hub parting line as shown in Figure 1, page 9, of Hartzell Propeller, Inc., Service Bulletin (SB) No. 165E, dated January 21, 1994, even though the propeller model and serial number are listed above, are exempt from this AD. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent possible propeller hub failure due to cracks that originate in the grease fitting holes on the side of the hub, which could result in propeller blade separation and loss of the aircraft, accomplish the following: (a) For propellers installed on Textron Lycoming TIO&hyph;540 or LTIO&hyph;540 series reciprocating engines or turbocharged IO&hyph;540 series reciprocating engines which are installed on Piper PA&hyph;31&hyph;325 Navajo C/R, PA&hyph;31&hyph;350 Navajo ``Chieftain,'' T&hyph;1020 (same as PA&hyph;31&hyph;350), PA&hyph;60&hyph;700P, Aerostar 700P aircraft, or propellers installed on any agricultural aircraft with any engine, accomplish the following: (1) Within 10 hours time in service (TIS) after the effective date of this AD, but not to exceed 25 hours TIS since the last inspection, whichever occurs first, and thereafter at intervals of 10 hours TIS, perform a visual inspection for presence of grease on the propeller and determine the source of this grease leakage prior to further flight. Following the visual inspection, perform an eddy current inspection (ECI) or fluorescent penetrant inspection (FPI) for cracks in accordance with Hartzell Propeller, Inc. SB No. 165E, dated January 21, 1994. Note: Use of a black light to inspect the suspect area can aid in determining the source of grease leakage because authorized grease contains fluorescent properties. (i) If grease is leaking from the hub arm or wall, replace the propeller with a serviceable propeller prior to further flight.
