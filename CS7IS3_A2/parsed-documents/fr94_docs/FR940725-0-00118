Inseason Action 1994 Halibut Landing Report No. 10 Area 4B to Close July 9 The IPHC estimates that 15 percent (315,000 lb (142.9 mt)) of the catch limit in Area 4B (Aleutian Islands) will be taken by the end of the July 9 fishing period. As it was decided at the 1994 Annual Meeting to reserve 85 percent of the Area 4B catch for the August 15 fishery, the IPHC is canceling fishing periods scheduled from July 11 through August 14. Therefore, Area 4B will close on July 9 at 8:00 p.m. Alaska Daylight Time and reopen on August 15 to take the remaining catch limit. Dated: July 18, 1994. David S. Crestin, Acting Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service.
