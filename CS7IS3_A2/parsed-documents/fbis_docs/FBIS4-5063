Mieno pointed to a slight increase in exports against the backdrop of a strong U.S. economy and progress in reducing corporate inventories and corporate restructuring, according to Kenji Kawakatsu, vice chairman of the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren). Kawakatsu cited Mieno as saying that was clearly not the picture a year ago. But Mieno reportedly added he will continue to watch those bright signs to determine whether they will lead to a full-fledged economic recovery. Mieno also said the strength of the yen in currency markets continues to put pressure on the economy and stressed the importance of private business vigor to ensure economic recovery, according to Kawakatsu.
