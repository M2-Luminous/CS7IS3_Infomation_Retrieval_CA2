Grachev is still prepared to threaten to send additional troops to Estonia very quickly if "the situation changes." By a change in the situation Grachev apparently means a possible worsening of the status of Russians living in Estonia if the negotiations between the two countries end in a deadlock. The threat of sending more troops may be intended as a last resort. The chief way of stepping up the pressure appears to be keeping the slightly less than 2,500 Russian soldiers who are still in Estonia in that country until the problem of the status of the retired Soviet Army officers is resolved. Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev has made an effort to appear to be more conciliatory and denies that the two issues are officially linked with one another. All the same, an unofficial connection does exist. Nor is this the first time either that Grachev has given voice to more hawklike interpretations of Russian policy than Kozyrev or President Boris Yeltsin. Unfortunately, in light of past experience, this does not give us the right to underestimate the importance of the content of the defense minister's statements. Grachev's stance just seems to be getting firmer. The threat Grachev leveled against Estonia "in passing" got President Lennart Meri to cut short his trip abroad. Outwardly, this seems to be an undue overdramatization of the situation, but it also reflects the increasingly more tense atmosphere of the negotiations between Estonia and Russia. The Estonians are indignant with the West because it, along with the leaders of the United States, Germany, Great Britain, and Sweden, strongly pressured Latvia into accepting an agreement negotiated with Russia, an agreement the signing of which had been postponed on several occasions. The agreement ensures that those Russian soldiers remaining in Latvia will be repatriated by the end of August, but, in the opinion of the Estonians, it contains completely unreasonable concessions to Russia. Latvia agreed to guarantee residence permits to over 20,000 retired former Soviet Army officers. They may also retain their homes, but Russia will pay their pensions. For perfectly good reasons, Estonia fears that Russia will demand that it consent to a similar agreement. And worse yet, Estonia fears that the West will assume the same position. In Estonia's opinion, this is an impossible demand. At least at this point, Estonia appears to be sticking to its guns. The negotiations have become practically deadlocked. Estonia is relying on the fact that pressure from the West will in any case force Russia to repatriate the remaining soldiers by the target deadline, the end of August. Estonia is, of course, right in maintaining that concessions cannot be required of it to remove foreign troops from the country. However, it may be assumed that Estonia takes a serious view of the problems arising with regard to the status of the Russian population residing in the country. Among them is the dispute over the status of retired Russian officers. Russia must make compromises with its demands, but Estonia too is going to have to be willing to make some concessions. Inflexibility will only stir up Moscow's hawks.
