The most important news is that last night chetniks withdrew all their artillery pieces to the left bank of the Bosna River, to the positions on Mount Crni Vrh, near Teslic, where they were deployed before 24 June 1993, thus opening the Maglaj-Zepce-Zenica road, and a 15-kilometer frontline around Maglaj by which they kept this town under siege for more than nine months. UN troops are already being deployed along the former chetnik positions. A pontoon bridge on the Bosna River near [name indistinct] was also dismantled last night. The Serb aggressor used the bridge for the transit of weapons and manpower between Mount Ozren and Teslic. The Croatian Defense Council has taken over the checkpoint on the Maglaj-Zepce road near [name indistinct) and UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]-mediated negotiations on the joint control of the road by the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the Croatian Defense Council are in progress. It should also be said that the Zepce Croatian Defense Council has secured the return of 200 inhabitants of this town to their homes, from where they were evicted to Maglaj four months ago.
