The Impact of China's Macroeconomic Climate On Our 1994 Consumer Goods Market The rapid growth of China's national economy and our improved macroeconomic climate in 1993 added to our overall national might and stamina, laying a solid foundation for economic development and market prosperity in 1994. We are here presenting a detailed analysis of the impact of our macroeconomic climate on our 1994 consumer goods market. 1. Our Demand Climate 1. Investor demand. Investor demand has always played a decisive role in China's economic development, with the years of larger investment bringing faster economic growth rates. While our rapid economic growth in the first half of 1993 was driven largely by investment-adjusted growth, too rapid investment growth with too much construction also causes many problems, particularly a decline in investment efficiency. In light of this, the state will base its actions in 1994 on maintaining an appropriate growth of investment scale, by tightening its regulation, control, and management of overall investment and credit. Meanwhile, it will speed up investment reform and strengthen investment restraint forces, so that investment subjects can make their own decisions, be liable for their own risks, and act less blindly. So in 1994, our investment demand will grow slower than in 1993, with funding sources invariably somewhat tighter than in 1993, arbitrary exceeding of investment plans down sharply, and overall investment growth clearly lower than in 1993. We project our 1994 investment growth at about 20 percent. 2. Consumer demand. Since the 1980s, China's consumer demand has increased yearly, with steadily upgraded consumer concepts and more stable, higher consumption quality. Our overall consumption level is now in a transition stage from "having enough food and clothing" to "being comparatively well-off." In which case, will consumer demand decline in this stage? And will our consumer goods markets "slump"? First, we will briefly analyze the causes of our two most-recent economic "overheatings" and market "slumps." At the end of 1988, in order to control economic overheating and inflation, the state took "brake-slamming" steps, such as cutting back capital construction and tightening credit, as well as ones, such as raising savings interest rates and adding a new color-TV consumption tax, which lowered the average increase in incomes from 1988's 22.2 percent to 12.6 percent by 1989 for city dwellers, and from 1988's 17.8 percent to 10.4 percent by 1989 for rural residents. In addition, price increases gradually receded, increasing the wait-and-see consumer mindset of holding onto money, which resulted in a national market slump. Our wave of market panic-buying in 1988 and our exceptionally brisk market sales in the first half of 1993 were caused mainly by the above abnormal factors, resulting in consumer-mindset anxiety. There were two particular points: 1) as investment and currency put into circulation grew too quickly, causing waves of price increases, residents were clearly affected by inflation; 2) interest rates were lower than price rises, with declining exchange rates and negative growth in savings efficiency, so that the awareness of coming inflation strengthened in advance. This resulted in a large-scale phenomenon of purchasing and advance consumption as a hedge against inflation. It is thus obvious that both our economic "overheatings" and market "slumps" were caused mainly by either too lax management or too tight regulation and control of our macroeconomic climate by the state, causing too much investment, price, interest rate, and exchange rate volatility. But once effective steps were taken to return these factors to normal, our consumer goods market stabilized quickly. Second, consumer confidence is up. The "Resolution on Certain Issues Involved in Establishing a Socialist Market-Economy System" passed by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Congress set our basic direction of developing a socialist market economy, sharply raising the enthusiasm of the people throughout China to intensify reform and speed up development, and enhancing consumer confidence at all levels. An example of this was the bottoming out and pickup in rolled steel futures trading in Suzhou in late November 1993, showing that consumers had seen the coming good trend. Meanwhile, the center has taken a series of regulation and control steps to ease inflation and stabilize the RMB value and exchange rate, which will promote stable market-economy development, stabilize consumer confidence, and eliminate the phenomena of advance purchasing or holding onto money with a wait-and-see approach. China's overall consumption is now in a transition stage from "having enough food and clothing" to "being comparatively well-off." In the world's developed countries, this stage was one of consumption expansion, in which markets could not "contract" sharply without special circumstances. So in 1994, China's market-economy establishment will be even more full of vitality, with consumption standards and quality developing to higher levels. Third, purchasing power is growing quickly. Beginning in 1993, the state raised the wages of employees in administrative organs, for a projected annual increase of more than 28 billion yuan, which will correspondingly drive up wages for employees in enterprises and institutions. Meanwhile, 1994's tax-sharing system and internal enterprise reforms will help to arouse enterprise and individual initiative, correspondingly raising employee and individual income. This, in addition, the normal capital-increase factor, means that our employee incomes will grow more in 1994. In the fall of 1993, we had a better harvest, with farm and sideline industries growing very quickly, purchasing-fund payments better than in previous years, and peasant income rising steadily, which brought the beginnings of a rural market pickup. In 1994, the state is going to sharply raise purchasing prices for farm products, such as grain and cotton, as well as improving fund-payments in one step, so that peasant income will continue to grow steadily. In addition, peasant income from business, such as township, construction, and tertiary industries, will rise sharply. It is projected that overall cash incomes will grow a record of more than 20 percent in 1994. Fourth, we have a huge market-consumption potential. China's major consumer-goods market is our rural market, which accounted for 51.9 percent of our retail commodity sales in 1992. While this rural-market ratio has been declining in recent years, its consumer potential of 800 million peasants is enormous. For instance, our rural household power-usage rate is very low which, in addition to lower purchasing power, is due to the following two factors: 1) water and power are in short supply at high prices; 2) highway construction, communications and transportation, and after-sales service are lagging. But as peasant income rises and rural infrastructures are improved, peasant consumer demand, including that for large durable consumer goods, is bound to take a quantitative leap. So our 1994 consumer-goods market demand will not "shrink," but rather will tend to grow. 2. Our Supply Climate 1. Industrial production. Through some decades of development, China has established a quite complete industrial system, with a strong manufactured-goods production capability. In recent years, our industrial production has continued to advance at a higher rate. Meanwhile, through several years of structural adjustment and market-oriented reform, enterprises are more able to change track and retool, with a faster rate of product renewal and exchange, and additional effective supply of manufactured goods. An analytical ranking of the supply and demand of over 530 manufactured goods in recent years shows that the varieties in short supply are declining yearly, with their ratio down from 1991's 6 percent to 4 percent by 1993, while commodities in long supply or where supply and demand are basically balanced are increasing steadily. Our markets essentially no longer suffer from commodity shortages due to production-capability problems, so that our market goods supply is fully ensured. 2. Agricultural production. As our output of farm products, such as grain, cotton, and edible oil, has been fluctuating for two consecutive years, their 1994 production and market condition remains not optimistic. This is due mainly to: 1) The price scissors between industrial goods and agricultural products have grown steadily in the last two years, dampening peasant cultivation initiative. In addition, all sorts of development zones and urban construction projects have been crowding out cultivated land, so that our area sown to farm products is in a declining trend. 2) Our 1994 yields of grain, cotton, edible oil, meat, and sugar are all down to varying degrees, which will have a sharp impact on 1994 market supplies. The center is paying great attention to this, having taken a series of steps to expand agricultural production, and going to sharply raise purchasing prices for staple farm products, which will certainly increase peasant income. These steps will arouse peasant initiative to a certain extent, promoting agricultural-production growth. In short, while 1994 will bring slighter tighter supplies of staple farm and sideline products, with higher prices, it will not see large-scale shortages. 3. Communications and transportation. In 1994, as no new railway arteries are being put into operation, our transport capacity will not be clearly higher, with communications and transportation remaining a sharp "bottleneck," and our transport shortage being about the same as 1993's at over 20 million tons, continuing to limit our national economic development. In summary, analyzed from areas such as our 1994 macroeconomic climate, our market supply and demand state, and our consumer mindset, our 1995 [sic] consumer goods market will grow steadily, with no recurrence of sharp slides or market slumps. II. The Impact of Economic Reform on Our 1994 Consumer Goods Market In 1994, the state is going to conduct significant tax, banking, investment, and foreign trade reforms, which will be a major step in speeding up the establishment of our new socialist market economic system, and will be of key significance in making our national macroeconomic regulation and control system sounder, and in promoting sustained and steady national economic growth. These significant reform steps will also have a positive impact on our consumer goods market. 1. Tax-revenue system-reform. Our most important 1994 reform will be the implementation of a tax-sharing system, in which our current local revenue package [lump-sum] system will be changed to separate collection for each taxable item based on clarifying central and local tax categories and administrative jurisdiction, with the establishment of separate central and local tax systems, to change the current steady drop in central revenues and weakening macroeconomic regulation and control capability, in order to ensure a steady increase in central financial might. This tax-sharing system will have positive impacts on markets. A. It will help to reduce fiscal deficits and ease inflationary pressures. In recent years, the "separate revenue systems" have caused a steady drop in central revenues, with the central ratio of all national revenue down from 1981's 57 percent to 38 percent by 1992. These yearly growing central fiscal deficits and annual revenue overdrafts from the central bank have sharpened inflationary pressures. State-planned priority construction projects are often not completed on schedule due to limited financial might and funding shortages. Statistics show that the fund-shortage rate for China's priority construction projects is now about 30 percent, leaving the construction of key domestic infrastructures lagging far behind our national economic development needs, with sharper "bottleneck" limitations, and blocked commodity circulation. So the tax-sharing reform will gradually increase central financial might, reducing deficits and easing inflationary pressures. B. It will help to weaken local protectionism, to speed up commodity-circulation development and the formation of a nationally uniform market. One of the defects of the separate revenue systems is that they reinforce local protectionism. Duplicate construction by all areas makes economic structures too similar, and rampant local protectionism obstructs commodity-circulation development. So tax sharing will strengthen central regulation and control capability, while weakening local protectionism, as well as strengthening local concepts about the overall situation, while ensuring the implementation of national industrial-development policy. C. The imposition of a uniform tax rate will contribute to equal competition among state, collective, and individual commerce. As to state-owned commerce, the new tax system will lower the overall tax rate for state-owned commercial enterprises from the current rate and somewhat reduce aftertax profit payments to the state, playing a positive role in lightening the burden on state commerce, adding accumulation, increasing sales, improving the state of unequal competition with private and collective commerce, and gradually reversing longstanding losses. 2. Financial-system reform. This reform's priorities will be to ensure that the central bank exercises an independent monetary policy, by strengthening its overall regulation and control of the money supply, in order to maintain currency stability; to separate policy banking from commercial banking, in order to overcome the current financial chaos caused by specialized banks being responsible for both functions; to develop plural-equity nonbank financial institutions, credit agencies, and all sorts of investment, insurance, and securities companies, in order to gradually set up an open and orderly money-market system. These financial reforms will contribute as follows. A) They will help to stabilize the value of the currency. Our overall money-supply damper will use the method prevalent in developed Western countries of independent central-bank regulation and control, which will help to change our past state of repeated credit expansion due to the policy factor, elminate the system factors that induce inflation, stabilize our inflation rate at a lower level, and thus preserve stability of consumer mindset over a longer term. B) They will help the banking sector to clarify obligations, by separating policy from business. The policy bank will aim at breaking even or earning tiny profits, to exercise state policy operations, while commercial banks will be liable for their own profits, losses, and risks, to prevent unchecked credit activities. C) They will contribute to the establishment of a developed money market. Through valid forms such as financing and borrowing, enterprises will expand their funding sources, which will ease the longstanding fund shortages of circulation enterprises, to enhance enterprise operating flexibility. 3. Investment-system reform. This will be mainly the establishment of investment-restraint mechanisms for enterprise corporations, so that investment subjects make their own decisions and are liable for their own risks. This will help to change the past situation of disregard for qualifications, competition to start projects, and unchecked expansion of the investment scale, to put enterprise investment scale and structure on a scientific and feasible basis, as well as ensuring that investment subjects and commercial banks are each liable for their respective risks, in order to ensure investment economic efficiency. As these investment-restraint forces are gradually established, there will be no recurrence of the real national investment scale exceeding plans to reach 350 billion yuan as in 1993, with elimination of the vicious system-cycle of investment impulse and expansion--leading to a sharp rise in investment-product prices--causing consumption expansion and price rises--resulting in retrenchment, to maintain stable market development. 4. Foreign trade system-reform. This will involve mainly putting the official exchange rate on track with the market-conversion rate, expanding enterprise foreign-trade operating authority, eliminating the method of foreign trade enterprises turning over foreign exchange to the state either with or without compensation, abolishing import licensing, reducing quota restrictions, and gradually lowering tariffs. These reform steps will contribute as follows: A) They will help to further speed up our opening to the outside world, expanding our foreign trade, and bringing into full play the supplementation and regulation role of international and domestic markets. B) They will help to promote the merging of international and domestic markets, improving the current isolation of domestic-trade enterprises from the international market, helping to resolve the current conflict of manufactured goods being in long supply with some products being slow-selling, and helping domestic-trade enterprises to understand international trends to reduce import costs, in order to make domestic markets more prosperous and brisk. Market-converted foreign exchance now accounts for 80 percent of our foreign-exchange usage. As this has become the key means of foreign-trade operation for domestic enterprises, the merging of foreign exchange onto a single track will not have a sharp impact on ordinary consumer goods prices. Rather, as tariffs will be lower, it will help to lower imported-commodity prices to promote consumption. III. A Consumer Goods Market Projection for 1994 Based on this overall analysis of our 1994 macroeconomic climate and our economic-system development, China's consumer goods market will maintain a stable-growth trend, neither "slumping" nor "overheating." 1. Commodity sales will remain overall stable. We project 1994 retail commodity sales of 1.6 trillion yuan, up 20 percent from 1993 and, adjusted for inflation, up a real approximately 7 percent. This includes retail sales for consumer goods of 1.455 trillion yuan, up 21.5 percent, and for agricultural capital goods of 145 billion yuan, up 10 percent. Our rural markets will continue in a rebound trend, with some briskness in the midst of general stability. 2. Prices will rise considerably. The rapid rise in prices in 1993 will have a considerable lagging impact on 1994 prices. Meanwhile, there will be more upward price adjustments in 1994, with more force, in addition to spontaneous price-rise factors, so that we project that our 1994 retail commodity prices will rise less [sic] than in 1993. 3. By commodity category: a) Food commodities. Overall sales will be more stable. Staple farm products, such as grain, cotton, edible oil, meat, and sugar, will be in general short supply, with prices up considerably. Sales will be increasingly brisk for new foods that suit comtemporary lifestyles, characterized by convenience, fast, nutritional, and health foods. b) Clothing commodities. All clothing sales will be brisk, mostly of medium grade, with sales of expensive clothing growing steadily, but markets for cheap clothing increasingly narrow. Sales will remain brisk for all sorts of Western clothing, T-shirts, jackets, wool, and woolen textiles, with better sales of new and distinctive styles. Outer-clothing sales will be comparatively stable. Sales of knitted cotton goods will gradually improve due to low prices, practicality, and higher demand by low- and middle-income consumers. c) Daily-use commodities. Sales will be stable but slack at lower prices for expensive large durable consumer goods, such as color TVs, refrigerators, and washing machines, due to a high urban-household use rate, more production than demand, lower import tariffs, and sharp market competition, while air conditioner sales will be stable but rising, with consumers choosing more brand-name household appliances. Sales will be brisk for smaller household-appliance market goods, such as humidifiers, electric heaters, water heaters, oil and smoke intake fans, microwave ovens, and home computers. Sales will continue to flourish for interior-decoration items due to commercial-housing development. Cosmetics and detergents will see quite brisk sales, with volume stable but rising. 4. Income levels will widen, with consumer pluralization tending to grow clearer. In recent years, income levels have been increasingly widening. Statistics show that there are now over 2 million high-income families throughout China with incomes of more than 100,000 yuan a year. This disparity is predicted to grow somewhat in the short-term. Urban consumers will continue to seek out brand-name, excellent, new, and specialty commodities, with a prominence of one-step consumer behavior, commodity consumption fields expanding, and no recurrence of the phenomenon of rivalry to buy a few commodities. Rural consumers will generally seek out mostly cheap and practical goods, with their consumption ratio continuing to rise for clothing and daily-use commodities, and consumption levels and structures for families in developed regions increasingly approaching those of urban residents. 5. Purchasing power diversification will continue to grow. Spending in 1994 will continue to grow for noncommodity items, such as housing, health care, insurance, education, tourism, and recreation; the steady growth of stock and bond markets will absorb a lot of money; banks' high-interest-rate policy will make savings continue to rise steadily. The pluralization trend in the consumer spending structure will grow more conspicuous.
