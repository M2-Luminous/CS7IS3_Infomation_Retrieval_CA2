However, things calmed down and the crisis seems to be heading toward a solution. What exactly happened on the borders with Greece and why did your reactions vary with the passage of time? [Berisha] I do not think that we acted angrily. If you read our first message to the Greek Government in the wake of the massacre you would see that we expressed the conviction that the terrorists came from Greek territory and returned to it after executing the operation. In the same message we asked the Greek Government to identify the culprits and condemn the attack. Therefore, I don't think that this was evidence of anger. But the Greek reaction was weird. They failed to express regret or convey condolences to the families of the victims. This made us believe they were gloating over the crime. It was, therefore, natural for us to believe that the Greek Government supports such deeds. We had information last year that a number of elements were trained in Greece and then Prime Minister Konstandinos Mitsotakis was informed of the matter. ['Abdallah] But did the Greek Government supervise the training? [Berisha] Yes, the government did supervise the training at that time. But later we received information that the government had ended the training. At any rate, the culprits came from Greek territory. The Greek Government did not respond to our demands at the beginning, but later it responded. Consequently, we decided to postpone any downsizing of the staffs at the embassies until the problem is discussed by the two countries' foreign ministers during their upcoming meeting. This is what happened, but the Greeks might have a different viewpoint of the incident. ['Abdallah] Are you sure that the culprits came from Greece? [Berisha] Certainly. We identified their tracks, which showed that the culprits came from Greece and later returned there. ['Abdallah] But why are the Greeks trying to foment trouble on their border with Albania? [Berisha] Since the beginning of the century and for the past 50 years, the Greeks have been pursuing a policy based on using terrorism and terrorists against southern Albania. But I don't believe that the Greek Government was behind this specific incident; otherwise we would have asked them to punish the culprits. However, we do not believe that the incident was an isolated one, because the Greek Army has in the past provoked us by firing at our boats sailing in our territorial waters. ['Abdallah] When did this happen? [Berisha] Two months ago. But they denied it. I don't think this is the right way to create a good atmosphere to promote bilateral relations. ['Abdallah] But why are they doing this? What is their objective? [Berisha] The Greeks are afflicted with nationalistic fervor. They have ties with the Serbs, and through this alliance they think that they can make gains toward reconstructing the Balkan area. ['Abdallah] Do they have any regional claims in Albania? [Berisha] Greece has not yet signed the Florence protocol, which is quite important in the border issue. ['Abdallah] Does this mean that they do not recognize the present borders with Albania? [Berisha] They recognize the borders, but they have not signed yet. ['Abdallah] What about the internal secessionist movements in southern Albania? [Berisha] There are no such movements. But there are signs. ['Abdallah] Do you recognize the Greek minority in southern Albania? [Berisha] There is a Greek minority in the south. I am pleased to say that Albania guarantees all rights, including human rights, to this minority. ['Abdallah] Are they entitled to learn the Greek language and do they have their own press? [Berisha] They have three newspapers and well over 88 schools, which cover all stages of elementary and higher education. They have their own parties and establishments. They have ministers and judges. They will continue to enjoy these rights; these events will not affect our policies toward the minorities. They are Albanian citizens and we respect their rights. ['Abdallah] Mr. President, do you have a specific stand on the conflict between Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] and Greece? [Berisha] Yes. We have no particular stand regarding the name, but Macedonia has to accept a compromise regarding the issue of their flag and some other matters. In my opinion, Greece is taking a mistaken approach regarding the name and the economic boycott. However, a dialogue is necessary between the two countries. ['Abdallah] Do you have any problems with Macedonia regarding the Albanian minority residing there? [Berisha] Yes. There is a human rights problem that must be resolved. There is some progress, however, and we expect further progress in the future. ['Abdallah] What are your specific demands? [Berisha] There should be a census to determine the number of Albanians; schools should be opened at all levels. Albanians should have the right to use their language and they should be allowed to enter all the Macedonian state's institutions. ['Abdallah] Is this the same requirement as for Kosovo province? [Berisha] The situation is different in Kosovo. The Albanians there constitute 95 percent of the population. One has to establish whole institutions for them; and agreement should be reached through dialogue and through agreements between the various parties on the special status of the region. ['Abdallah] Do you believe that the situation in the region is quiet now? [Berisha] No, there is great oppression. ['Abdallah] What is your opinion on current events in Bosnia? [Berisha] The situation there is very difficult and the peace process seriously fails to meet the requirements. ['Abdallah] What mistakes are the international community making in its efforts to resolve the conflict? [Berisha] The international community must treat the Serbs and Milosevic more forcefully. The aggressors must be punished. ['Abdallah] How can they be punished? Militarily? [Berisha] That is a naive question. Of course, militarily. ['Abdallah] Aren't the air strikes NATO is carrying out against the Serbian positions enough? [Berisha] These air strikes are merely symbolic. They should take place on a much larger scale. ['Abdallah] What would be the objective of such large-scale strikes? [Berisha] The objective is to prove that Bosnia must continue to exist as a state, either within a federal or a confederal framework. Bosnia must remain united. ['Abdallah] Do you not see the agreement between the Muslims and the Croats that was signed recently in Washington as an introduction of partitioning? [Berisha] No, I see the result as an agreement between two sides; and the third side, the Bosnian Serbs, must respond. ['Abdallah] But Mr. President, the agreement speaks of a confederation with Croatia. [Berisha] This will take place at a later stage. The international community must not accept the status quo imposed by the Serbian occupation. That would be the first step toward many problems in the Balkan. There would be a series of wars in the Balkans and many countries would take part in them. The only way to avoid all of this is to punish the aggressor. ['Abdallah] Mr. President, there is a famous principle in the OAU Charter that stipulates that countries should adhere to the borders defined by colonialism on the continent, despite the numerous problems these borders create. Do you not believe that the Balkan countries, with all the problems they have among themselves, should agree on something similar to this? [Berisha] It is vital that borders in the Balkans should not be changed by force. ['Abdallah] Why can't the borders stay as they are and each state keep the minorities it has within its borders? [Berisha] Yes, that is what is required. ['Abdallah] But this will mean that Kosovo will stay with the Serbs, Albania will keep the Greek minority, just as Bulgaria will keep the Turkish minority, and so on. [Berisha] (Interrupting) No, you are comparing two different situations. How can you compare a situation where you have 40,000-60,000 Greeks in southern Albania and 2 million Albanians in Kosovo? ['Abdallah] Why is Fatos Nano, the leader of the Albanian opposition, in prison now? Are the reasons political, or does it have to do with financial improprieties, as has been announced? [Berisha] Why do you not ask the same question of the Italian authorities to find out why de Michelis and some other Italian politicians are being tried? The reasons are the same. They, together with Fatos Nano, committed crimes of corruption pertaining to the aid given by Italy to Albania (when Nano was prime minister of Albania). There was embezzlement in an amount of $9 million. Had the reasons been political, there would have been others the government could have taken to court. ['Abdallah] How far has your reform program gone after two years in power? [Berisha] I believe that in those two years we have made great progress in this regard. Inflation has dropped from 400 percent to 30 percent. Last year we had the highest rate of development in the whole of Europe--11 percent, according to the IMF evaluations. Our currency is stable. In addition, we have freed all our prices. This puts us at a difficult stage, but this is the only thing we can do to encourage production. We have also privatized all agricultural land, homes, services, and transport. ['Abdallah] What about foreign aid? [Berisha] We are grateful to all those who have helped us. This aid has been used as best as possible. Now, we do not need urgent aid; we need economic cooperation. ['Abdallah] Do you cooperate with any Arab or Islamic countries? [Berisha] We cooperate with Egypt, Kuwait, Turkey, Malaysia, and Saudi Arabia. Cooperation with these and other countries is constantly increasing. ['Abdallah] What about your work agenda for Albania in the coming stage? [Berisha] Increasing cooperation with the countries in the region and merging the state with the European institutions are our two major goals for the next stage. In addition, we are trying to prevent conflicts in the region and to liberate and strengthen the economy. ['Abdallah] What do you expect from the meeting between the Greek and Albanian foreign ministers? Do you have some sort of prescription to prevent a repetition of such border incidents? [Berisha] The Greeks have to stop those activities that negatively affect bilateral relations. That is the first thing. Albania has tried to be friends with Greece, but the Greeks were not happy with our friendship. We will continue our attempts to have good neighborly relations, especially since there are many factors that encourage such relations. I believe they also want that, not only for the sake of our two countries, but for the sake of the whole region.
