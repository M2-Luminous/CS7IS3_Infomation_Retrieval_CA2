The prime minister "has failed" and "disappointed society," Aznar stated. He added that he will not give up the task of opposition, although the party will act "responsibly" with respect to the crisis. He asserted that there is no other meeting with Felipe Gonzalez on his agenda. At a news conference in Salamanca, Aznar took stock of the six months that have elapsed since the election, and noted that the main conclusion is that Felipe Gonzalez "has failed" both in his attempt to bring the nationalists into the government and in efforts to secure a social pact, and has shown that he does not know how to govern in a minority. Unemployment and Recession The result of these six months from the economic viewpoint is more unemployment and recession; from the political viewpoint, the People's Party's consolidation as an alternative and the demonstration that the "change of change" proposed by the PSOE was an electoral alibi. In this context, the People's Party leader demanded that the government correct its policy as a way to surmount Spain's "weakness," although he added that he does not expect this to happen and stressed that his party will act responsibly "so as not to exacerbate the crisis." That responsibility does not imply relinquishing the task of opposition to a government lacking ideas in which Felipe Gonzalez "has disappointed society," he said. Regarding the prime minister, Aznar stated that the possibility of another meeting, following the meeting held two months ago which cleared the way for meetings between delegations of the two political forces, is not on his agenda. He stated that these dialogues, "whether wanted or not, are constitutionally obligatory" for matters such as the choice of the ombudsman and the renewal of the General Council of the Judiciary, since "the qualified majorities are laid down in order to force agreements." After emphasizing that the aim of any contact with the PSOE is to improve Spain's situation, Aznar ruled out the possibility of a government coalition and the imminence of another election. He recalled that the Socialists rejected the agreement on economic policy proposed by the People's Party several months ago, and added that the presentation of recovery measures by his group is due to the fact that the government itself is presenting none.
