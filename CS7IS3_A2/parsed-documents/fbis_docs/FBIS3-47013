The LDP decided Friday morning to submit the motions Friday evening, party officials said. The party decided to exclude Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa from the motions, saying including him would have a "serious affect," the officials said. The party officials said they decided to submit the censure motions because the two ministers violated Diet resolutions calling for a ban on foreign rice imports. The two ministers gave deceptive answers to the Diet and failed to exert enough diplomatic effort, they said. The government decided in December to end its decades-long ban on rice imports as part of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks and agreed to give foreign growers minimum access to Japan's rice market, importing 4 to 8 percent of its annual rice consumption over a six-year moratorium, starting in fiscal 1995. Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news conference the two Hatas fulfilled their duties as ministers in charge of the Uruguay Round and therefore need not take the blame. "Under the leadership of the prime minister, the government dealt with the issue, and both of the ministers also devoted all their energy to tackling the years-old formidable task," the top government spokesman said. "In this regard, I see no reason for them to be censured," he noted.
