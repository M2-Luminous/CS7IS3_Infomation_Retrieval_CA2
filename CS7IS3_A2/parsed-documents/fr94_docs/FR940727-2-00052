Respondent shall divest, absolutely and in good faith, within twelve (12) months of the date this Order becomes final, the Assets To Be Divested. B. Respondent shall divest the Assets To Be Divested only to an acquirer or acquirers that receive the prior approval of the Commission and only in a manner that receives the prior approval of the Commission. The purpose of the divestiture of the Assets To Be Divested is to ensure the continued use of the Assets To Be Divested as ongoing viable pharmacies engaged in the same businesses in which the Assets To Be Divested are presently employed and to remedy the lessening of competition resulting from the acquisition as alleged in the Commission's complaint. C. Pending divestiture of the Assets To Be Divested, Respondent shall take such actions as are necessary to maintain the competitiveness, viability and marketability of the Assets To Be Divested and to prevent the destruction, removal, wasting, deterioration, or impairment of any Assets To Be Divested except for ordinary wear and tear. D. If a divestiture includes a lease of physical space, and if pursuant to that lease Respondent through default of the lease or otherwise regains possession of the space, Respondent must notify the Commission of such repossession within thirty (30) days and must redivest such assets or interest pursuant to Paragraph II of this Order within six (6) months of such repossession. If Respondent has not redivested such assets or interest pursuant to Paragraph II of this Order within six (6) months of such repossession, the provisions of Paragraph III shall apply to these assets. III It is further ordered That: A. If Respondent has not divested, absolutely and in good faith and with the Commission's prior approval, the Assets To Be Divested within twelve (12) months of the date this Order becomes final, the Commission may appoint a trustee to divest the Assets To Be Divested. In the event the Commission or the Attorney General brings an action pursuant to ยง5(l) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง45(l), or any other statute enforced by the Commission, Respondent shall consent to the appointment of a trustee in such action. Neither the appointment of a trustee nor a decision not to appoint a trustee under this Paragraph shall preclude the Commission or the Attorney General from seeking civil penalties or any other relief available to it, including a court-appointed trustee, pursuant to ยง5(l) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, or any other statute enforced by the Commission, for any failure by Respondent to comply with this Order. B. If a trustee is appointed by the Commission or a court pursuant to Paragraph III.A. of this Order, Respondent shall consent to the following terms and conditions regarding the trustee's powers, duties, authority, and responsibilities: 1. The Commission shall select the trustee, subject to the consent of Respondent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The trustee shall be a person with experience and expertise in acquisitions and divestitures. If Respondent has not opposed, in writing, including the reasons for opposing, the selection of any proposed trustee within ten (10) days after notice by the staff of the Commission to Respondent of the identity of any proposed trustee, Respondent shall be deemed to have consented to the selection of the proposed trustee. 2. Subject to the prior approval of the Commission, the trustee shall have the exclusive power and authority to divest the Assets To Be Divested. 3. Within ten (10) days after appointment of the trustee, Respondent shall execute a trust agreement that, subject to the prior approval of the Commission and, in the case of a court-appointed trustee, of the court, transfers to the trustee all rights and powers necessary to permit the trustee to effect the divestiture required by this Order.
