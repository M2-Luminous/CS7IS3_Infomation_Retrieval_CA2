The Proposal The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish a new independent Class D airspace at Robins AFB, Georgia. Additionally, the FAA is proposing to amend Class D airspace and establish Class E airspace at Middle Georgia Regional Airport, Macon, Georgia. Prior to Airspace Reclassification an Airport Traffic Area (ATA) and a control zone existed at these airports. However, Airspace Reclassification, effective September 16, 1993, discontinued the use of the terms ``airport traffic area'' and ``control zones,'' replacing them with the designation ``Class D airspace''. Robins AFB was incorporated in the Class D airspace for Middle Georgia Regional Airport, Macon, Georgia. Robins AFB has a full time control tower. However, the Macon Radar Approach Control/Tower, which controls aircraft for the Middle Georgia Regional Airport, is part-time. The intended effect of this proposal is to amend the Class D airspace at Middle Georgia Regional Airport by removing Robins AFB from the Macon, Georgia Class D Airspace and designation. This notice also proposes to establish Class E surface airspace at the Middle Georgia Regional Airport, Macon, Georgia, to provide adequate controlled airspace for instrument approach procedures when the Macon Radar Approach Control/Tower is closed.
