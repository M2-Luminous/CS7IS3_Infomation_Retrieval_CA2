[passage omitted] We have to try to maintain a dialogue, but not for the sake of being somewhat closer to the spheres of power; with great responsibility, we are simply considering the current situation of our country and of our people. There are social segments that are facing such difficulties that they are no longer interested in political issues. We cannot come out of this impasse unless all responsible political forces unite. Only in this way will we be able to relaunch the economy and the reform process. [passage omitted] In connection with the recent government reshuffle, I would like to specify that two PDSR figures, Mr. Ioan Solcanu and Oliviu Gherman, affirmed that this reshuffle had taken place by consulting the opposition. There was no such thing; these affirmations were made only to fool people. [passage omitted] This goes to show how confusing, if not immoral, the involvement in the dialogue by the majority formation is, and it also shows how difficult it is for us to discuss things under such conditions. Despite all this, we will continue along the same road. [passage omitted] First I want to clarify whether the negotiations begun by our party with the PDSR representatives mean a change in our policy. The answer is no. [passage omitted] These negotiations are nothing but a resumption, under more dramatic circumstances, of the negotiations that we conducted in November 1992 before the formation of the Vacaroiu government. [passage omitted] From this point of view, there is no change in our policy. It is, however, the dramatic situation in our country that has caused these negotiations to resume. With what thoughts each side comes to these negotiations remains to be seen. We can talk only about ourselves. Within this context, I want to say that when we started negotiations with the PDSR we affirmed three things: "We have not come to judge you, we have not come to be judged -- because nothing gives you the right to be our judges -- and we have not come to change your views or to change our views -- because we are not your teachers just as you cannot be our teachers. [passage omitted] What we want to do is to see what measures we can find to seek joint objectives and the means of cooperation to implement them. [passage omitted] Second, what are our objectives? [passage omitted] Or rather, what are not our objectives? It is not our objective to form an alliance with the PDSR. Such an alliance is ruled out. We are trying to achieve an alliance with genuinely social-democratic parties. [passage omitted] I am not talking of a political alliance. [passage omitted] It is our objective -- and we have affirmed this from the very beginning in these discussions -- to restructure the parliamentary majority. [passage omitted] Third, what alternatives do we have at our disposal? The first one would be that this new majority generate a new government made up of the three reunited groups, the second alternative would be a government made up of the PDSR and the CDR [Democratic Convention of Romania] supported in parliament by the PD(FSN) proving that we do not want to be an obstacle in the formation of a better government than the current one and that we do not want to lay our hands, at all costs, on any of the portfolios. All we desire is to replace a government that is dangerous for the country. And the third alternative is a PDSR monochrome minority government supported in parliament by the current opposition. This third alternative -- which was rapidly taken up by the PDSR -- led to a number of discussions, controversies, and confusion in public opinion. [passage omitted] When we said that the third alternative would be to support a PDSR minority government, we did not say that this government was the Vacaroiu government -- against which we have launched four motions. [passage omitted] It goes without saying that we do not support this government. Not because of a narrow- minded position, but because in two years of governing it has demonstrated that this government neither knows, wants, nor is able to do anything for the benefit of this country. When I said that we will support a PDSR government, I said that we will support any government other than the Vacaroiu government, and that we will not support the government without conditions. In order to support such a government, we have to agree on three aspects. First, on a reformist government program; second, on isolating extremist, intolerant, chauvinist, and anti-Semitic forces preventing such forces from being in power, and third, to guarantee that commitments will be respected and that the democratic process in Romania will continue. [passage omitted] Fourth, this is a question I was asked in connection with the formula that was launched, which was not the most fortunate: Namely a nonaggression Pact. [passage omitted] This is what we proposed. [passage omitted] From our point of view, it is much easier for us to respect such an accord because our attitude already abides by it and because we do not put pressure on local administration nor on the other party's members, and so forth. It is clear that the PDSR has to assume serious responsibility in this respect. This is what we discussed. Another question was raised in connection with possible negotiations with a view to obtaining certain advantages regarding the famous penal files, which have been opened or are to be opened by the control corps of the prime minister led and guided by the Romania Mare Party. Here, before you, I want to fully deny the following hypothesis: We have by no means started from the idea that, by conducting such discussions, we will be able to close some files. On the contrary. In our proposal regarding the way of action, we asked the ruling party to take steps so that the procedures of pursuit and investigation will be completed, no matter the results. We should not bargain on such things and I personally, as our party's vice president and leader of this delegation, will not let myself be blackmailed into such negotiations. It will not be possible to put pressure on us by manipulating these files, although we know -- and you should know, too -- that for a few days now, further pressure has been put on the Prosecutor's to reactivate the operations on the respective files; thus, additional arguments will probably be brought to the negotiating table. The last question is linked to reactions and prospects. There are several kinds of reactions to these negotiations: On the one hand there were reactions in support. Unfortunately, to all our arguments there were signs of interest only when it came to party interests and not national ones. [passage omitted] There were also negative reactions. I had the opportunity to read an article in a local newspaper in Prahova County, which was unsigned, but betrayed the "vigorous" verbs of Mr. N. Ilie Nica, and which accused the Democratic Party. It is clear-cut that Mr. N. Ilie Nica does not want the negotiations to succeed. We also have information that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has instructed our ambassadors, particularly in countries with powerful social-democratic parties, to make it known there that the PD(FSN) has ceased to exist, that there is dissension in its leadership, that Petre Roman and other leaders will soon be replaced, and other such things. We have absolutely factual information in this respect. It is a recent action. I am sure that those who have desired that this government reshuffle take place the way it did also include people who believe that such methods will stop the negotiations or make us much more rigid. As you see, there have been a whole number of reactions to these negotiations. Everybody favors reform, democracy, and national consensus; in actual fact, however, it seems that the moment opportunities emerge for all this to be built, there are certain people who create obstacles for such a process. I want to conclude with a sentence I heard recently at the Council of Europe uttered by Thorvald Stoltenberg, one of the two negotiators on former Yugoslavia. Asked whether he was optimistic about the results of the negotiations, he said he was, but when asked what reasons there were to be optimistic, he said there were none. I will tell you the same thing. We do not have special reasons to be optimistic. Despite this, we will remain optimistic, no matter what obstacles may arise; we will prove that we stay optimistic to the very end, even risking being considered naive; we will prove our goodwill even if we risk being called foolish. We will do all we can, to the very end, so that no one can say that we have not made all possible efforts to achieve a positive result, and so that we cannot be blamed should these negotiations fail.
