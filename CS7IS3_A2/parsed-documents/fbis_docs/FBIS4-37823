[Al-Asnaj] The meetings held in Cairo, especially those concerning the mission of the UN secretary general's special envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, were separate meetings with a southern delegation that had powers to discuss details of the stages of implementing Security Council Resolution 924, and a northern delegation that did not have sufficient powers or no powers at all. Because the delegation did not represent the authorities or the state. It was a partisan delegation from the alliance of the General People's Congress and the Reform Grouping. We considered this an attempt by Sanaa to gain time by extending Brahimi's mission in the region without achieving any progress with regard to a halt to the ongoing war. We informed Brahimi of our view and willingness to meet with him at the United Nations if the northern side expresses similar willingness to engage in serious commitments aimed primarily at securing a cease-fire and hence searching for a suitable mechanism to ascertain the warring parties' compliance with the cease-fire arrangements. We proposed a mechanism whereby a body would supervise the cease-fire, in addition to an implementing body to operate on the ground and include northern and southern elements together with Omani and Jordanian representatives, that is after the approval of the two countries' governments. And then work later to broaden the scale of Arab participation and form two African and Asian groups to work under UN auspices and the supervision of its secretary general. I believe that from his visits to Sanaa and al-Mukalla Brahimi gathered specific ideas and sufficient information to include in the report he is going to submit to the secretary general. We will read this report when we go to the United Nations at the end of the week, where we will meet with [Butrus-] Ghali. [AL-HAYAH] Assuming that Brahimi's report points to Sanaa's intransigence, what will the next possible step be? [Al-Asnaj] The war issue in Yemen no longer concerns the Yemenis alone. It is a disaster for the Yemenis first. We are not a state, nor do we enjoy full rights at the United Nations. But there are states concerned with what is happening in Yemen and which could -- in the immediate term -- pose a threat to the region's security and stability. Ssnaa has on numerous occasions announced a date for a cease-fire, but it failed to observe it. We had hoped that it would prove its seriousness, specify what it wants, and present its view of how the cease-fire can be consolidated to enable Brahimi to compare and define common denominators. But Sanaa has not specified what it wants or how it understands the Security Council resolution. So it is now futile to continue a dialogue of the deaf while the fighting continues to escalate, especially in Aden, where missiles are being fired at civilian targets and causing painful human losses. [AL-HAYAH] What are your expectations as regards future events in Yemen? [Al-Asnaj] The northern war machine will reach the point of exhaustion by attrition. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has deployed his forces over a vast area of land. And most of these forces are suffering a great deal, especially as they were stationed originally on southern territory. The al-'Amaliqah brigade has been in Abyan for four years and has made its arrangements for a long stay and adopted the human shield method along Iraqi lines. These forces are no longer in a comfortable situation, and I believe that they will retreat when they realize that they are exhausted -- which will open the door to new Arab and international mediations and endeavors to reconcile the two parts of Yemen. As for the unity issue, it is settled. We cannot preserve unity on the basis of pools of blood and the Yemeni people's skulls. A unity that began through dialogue and amicably must end through dialogue and amicably, because Sanaa is not far from Aden, and vice versa. The possibility of establishing relations within another framework, as was the case four years ago, can be considered. The brothers in Syria agreed to separate from Iraq and later agreed not to establish unity with Iraq for regional reasons, so why insist on Yemeni unity? Arab unity has gone through numerous experiences, and maybe there was negligence in how to establish it, because it is more emotional than practical. [AL-HAYAH] Do you not fear the country's fragmentation? [Al-Asnaj] The war is consolidating the position of resistance and steadfastness, and if there were any political collapses inside the country, the situation would have been different.
