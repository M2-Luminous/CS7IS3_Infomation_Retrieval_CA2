The decision was made in Geneva during a plenary session when the Group of 21 submitted Cuba's candidacy, which was approved by all members of the conference. Cuban Ambassador Jose Perez Novoa will head the committee which last year was chaired by the German representative to the Disarmament Conference. The developing nations have traditionally paid special attention to this organization, which will now be chaired by our country, taking into consideration the impact the prevention of the arms race and the outer space program will have on the Third World.
