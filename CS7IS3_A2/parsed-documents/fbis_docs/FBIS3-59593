Already, three ultramodern fiber optic nets are being built by Italy and Turkey for the purpose of linking the European Economic Community to the Balkan countries and to the former Soviet republics on the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. The central point of these nets, that have major economic significance, will be Istanbul. According to the plans, not one of these nets will pass through Greece. As experts explain, the result will be Greece's being cut off economically from these regions--and, in fact, from the Balkans--since it is evident that ultramodern telecommunications constitute a prerequisite for every form of economic and social development in modern societies. More specifically, one of the three nets, that is expected to be put into service in about a year, will link Bari, Italy, with Tirana, Skopje, Sofia and Istanbul, leaving Greece completely out of the planning. Prof. Kostas Makropoulos, former OTE [Greek Telecommunications Organization] and community specialist on telecommunications issues, was the one who revealed the details of the plan and the dangers posed for Greece from a telecommunications blockade. He attributed responsibility to the previous government since the agreements involved were signed in December 1992 and the technical projects inaugurated in May 1993. Mr. Akis Tsokhatzopoulos, PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] secretary general, has already been informed on the matter, while a relevant file will probably be given to Minister of National Defense Yerasimos Arsenis today. The Plans Specifically, from the relevant documents and maps, it appears that on 2 December 1992 contracts were signed for the implementation of the three plans to set up a telecommunications infrastructure lasting 25 years. The ITUR links Italy with Turkey and Ukraine with Russia. This net starts out in Palermo, goes to Istanbul and from there, via Ankara, heads for Odessa (and Novorossiisk, Russia). Its length is 3,500 kilometers, while it is expected to go into service at the end of 1995. The technical meeting took place on 25-28 May 1993 and the second that took place a month ago concerned the building of five pairs of fiber optics at 565 MB/sec with 38,400 circuits. The second plan that is called DOKAR concerns the linking of Istanbul and Ankara with the eastern shores of the Black Sea. Its two other big stations are Tbilisi and Baku.It also has the same huge capacity of 565 MB that, however, abruptly drops to 34 MB when the net reaches Georgia. It has been planned to go into operation sometime in 1994. The third (and best) net is the Trans-Balkan Link. It begins in Bari and goes to Durres, Tirana, Skopje, Sofia, Sliven and Istanbul that is the central city station for all three nets. The relevant agreement was signed five months later, on 6 May 1993. We have here 1,920 140 MB circuits and 7,650 622 MB circuits. Beginning of service is also planned for sometime in 1994. Finally, there are also plans for linking the Black Sea shores that include Romania. Northern Cyprus Besides the Balkan telecommunications arc that is being promoted, the Turks have also included another fiber optic net that will link up with Turkish-held northern Cyprus. As Mr. Makropoulos explained, the Turkish plan constitutes one of the most developed forms of an exercise of political and economic pressure that is founded on the development of new technologies. The country that will constitute the central telecommunications junction of a major geographic region not only will earn billions of dollars from the use of this net by third parties but it will automatically acquire a privileged entry into the countries that will be linked with Europe. Mr. Makropoulos further explained, "Fiber optics today constitute the linchpin of the community's telecommunications policy for the coming decades. This is so because they are much cheaper than satellites and have much greater capacities. In other words, they are able to send to another given region images, sound and information in the shortest possible time. I will cite as an example that a 140 MB net can send information on 7,500 typed pages in the space of one second!" As Mr. Makropoulos said, all the added value services are based on these nets as are the rapid development of activities such as tourism, trade, technical projects, cultural relations and, finally, privileged entry of a given country into third countries since the latter depend on--in this case--Turkey. The cost of the investment is big but for this too, according to Mr. Makropoulos, there is expectation for community subsidies! Mr. Makropoulos added, "Unfortunately, these facts reveal how the New Democracy party exercised such an unrealistic and nationally dangerous policy in a field like telecommunications."
