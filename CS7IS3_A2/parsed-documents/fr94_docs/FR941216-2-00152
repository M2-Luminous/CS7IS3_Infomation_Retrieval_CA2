L. 92&hyph;463), notice is hereby given that meetings of the Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee will be held on_ Thursday, January 5, 1995 Thursday, January 19, 1995 Thursday, February 2, 1995 Thursday, February 16, 1995 Thursday, March 2, 1995 Thursday, March 30, 1995. The meetings will start at 10:45 a.m. and will be held in Room 5A06A, Office of Personnel Management Building, 1900 E Street, NW., Washington, DC. The Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee is composed of a Chairman, five representatives from labor unions holding exclusive bargaining rights for Federal blue-collar employees, and five representatives from Federal agencies. Entitlement to membership on the Committee is provided for in 5 U.S.C. 5347. The Committee's primary responsibility is to review the Prevailing Rate System and other matters pertinent to establishing prevailing rates under subchapter IV, chapter 53, 5 U.S.C., as amended, and from time to time advise the Office of Personnel Management. These scheduled meetings will start in open session with both labor and management representatives attending. During the meeting either the labor members or the management members may caucus separately with the Chairman to devise strategy and formulate positions. Premature disclosure of the matter discussed in these caucuses would unacceptably impair the ability of the Committee to reach a consensus on the matter being considered and would disrupt substantially the disposition of its business. Therefore, these caucuses will be closed to the public because of a determination made by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management under the provisions of section 10(d) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (Pub. L. 92&hyph;463) and 5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(9)(B). These caucuses may, depending on the issues involved, constitute a substantial portion of the meeting. Annually, the Committee publishes for the Office of Personnel Management, the President, and Congress a comprehensive report of pay issues discussed, concluded recommendations, and related activities. These reports are available to the public, upon written request to the Committee's Secretary. The public is invited to submit material in writing to the Chairman on Federal Wage System pay matters felt to be deserving of the Committee's attention. Additional information on these meetings may be obtained by contacting the Committee's Secretary, Office of Personnel Management, Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee, Room 1340, 1900 E Street, NW., Washington, DC 20415 (202) 606&hyph;1500. Dated: December 8, 1994. Anthony F. Ingrassia, Chairman, Advisory Committee. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;30886 Filed 12&hyph;15&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6325&hyph;01&hyph;M
