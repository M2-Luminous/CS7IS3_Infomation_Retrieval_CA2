Such a move would be in response to a ruling by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) that the Japanese steelmakers are selling certain steel products in the U.S. at unfairly low prices. A Nippon Steel official said, "Our company has shipped only special steel which is not manufactured by U.S. makers. The ITC's final decision is beyond our understanding." Kawasaki Steel said ITC's decision will damage U.S. companies which have steadily imported steel products from Japan. The company commented that if such unreasonable antidumping actions are frequently taken, it will damage the mutual goal of maintaining long-term global stability in steel trade.
