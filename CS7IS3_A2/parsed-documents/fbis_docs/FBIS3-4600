Earlier this year in its report, the National Unification Board [NUB] envisaged that a breakthrough would be made into the nuclear issue sometime this year and, in turn, North-South relations would reach a turning point. Do you think such prospect has hit the target? [Yi] I think it is fortunate that the North Korean nuclear issue is taking the road to peaceful settlement through dialogue and negotiation. However, this is only a first step and, depending on North Korea's attitude, there are various obstacles we have to overcome. Accordingly, the time is not ripe to have an upbeat view. Furthermore, we should remember that North Korea, in the New York contact, opposed until the end to committing itself in writing to the issue of realizing an exchange of special envoys. [Yu] In a news conference marking his one year in office, President Kim Yong-sam said that he will push for an inter-Korean summit. Could you tell us about the background behind his proposal and do you think it is likely to come true? [Yi] I think President Kim's recent proposal goes one step further from his previous stance that the summit would only be possible after the nuclear problem was solved. In other words, he showed a flexible and converted view on the issue. This reflects his will to promote North-South relations more positively on his own initiative at a time when the international efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue are heading toward a positive direction. Nonetheless, this has a condition that "only if it would help deter North Korea's nuclear development program." So, there is not a fundamental change in the government's stance stressing the solution of the nuclear problem above anything else. [Yu] Sparked by the president's proposal on the summit, will there be a change in the special envoys' duties and the purpose of their exchange? There is speculation that the duties of special envoys will be detached from the nuclear issue and that they will only discuss the issue regarding preparations for the summit. Could you tell us more about this? [Yi] As I have mentioned earlier, the government's stance stressing the solution of the nuclear problem above anything else has not changed. The president's will to go to a summit does not necessarily mean that the duties and tasks of special envoys would change. Accordingly, the nuclear issue should be dealt as a priority if the exchange of special envoys was realized before the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks. Along with this, I expect that the issues for promoting North-South relations, including the high-level talks and the operation of joint committee of each field, and the holding of summit will be discussed. [Yu] Do you think there will be visible results in improving South-North relations during the exchange of South and North special envoys? [Yi] We hope that discussions on ways to solve the issue of separated families can be held first. At the recent U.S.-North Korea contact, both sides agreed to hold the third round of high- level talks on 21 March. I believe that the exchange of South and North special envoys must be achieved before 21 March. It will take two to three weeks for the IAEA inspection team to finish the inspections, and another two to three weeks for it to analyze the results. I believe that a state of flux may continue even when the third round of talks is in progress. I hope that during this process both sides will want to meet with each other and reach an agreement on the issue of holding the summit talks. [Yu] In what form do you plan to propose to the North Korean side regarding the separated families issue, which is one of the most important tasks the government is promoting? [Yi] In connection with this issue, authorities in the past have repeated revealed that "it will be promoted first of all," and that "it will be promoted actively." No one said that the separated families issue will "be linked with other pending issues." There must be concrete and visible results regarding the separated families issue in the process of exchanging South and North special envoys I believe that reunion of separated families will be the first step in South-North reconciliation and exchange. However, we do not want to put a heavy burden on the North Korean side. I believe we can wait somewhat on the issue of exchanging visits between the South and North. Nevertheless, I hope that we will be able to at least confirm the life or death of our families, establish an office to exchange letters and a reunion office in Panmunjom, and work so that a limited number of people can meet with each other. This has already been proposed to the North Korean side. [Yu] What other visible measures are there for us to take, other than the issue of separated families, in trying to induce North Korea to open up and show change? [Yi] It can be human exchanges such as exchange of religious organizations and cultural organizations. If meetings between authorities such as the exchange of special envoys of the South and North start sometime in March, I believe that the exchange of people in the social and cultural fields will begin. The government has received applications for exchange between religious organizations such as the Chondoist in March and for the exchange between women organizations sometime in April. [Yu] Some people point out that inflexible principles that linked the nuclear issue with economic cooperation have to be reconsidered. [Yi] We are of the principle to flexibly deal with the economic cooperation issue in accordance with the progress in the North Korea's nuclear issue. The stage-by-stage scenario on economic cooperation is achieved by three stages taking into consideration the overall situation of the South-North relations. If we reach the third stage, I believe that the atmosphere will be that we will be able to solve all South-North issues. The success or failure regarding this matter is wholly dependent on the attitude of North Korea. [Yu] Was there a concrete message indicating that North Korea wanted our economic cooperation? [Yi] Up until now invitations sent by North Korea's responsible people to our businesses amount to 40 cases. Proposals came from North Korea to our prominent businesses to establish plants in such and such a place, and to take part in investment in infrastructure in the Najin-Sonbong area. [Yu] Can you tell me your ambition and plan during your term of office? [Yi] Economist Max Singer wrote in his book entitled, "Passage to a Human World," that Korea will have the second largest gross national product in the world in the year 2064, under the condition that reunification is achieved. I believe in this. I will work so that all the people can restore moral health, and persistently make efforts to foster democracy. Also, I will sincerely work so that the we can welcome with emotion the opening of the "era of putting into practice the joint declaration on denuclearization."
