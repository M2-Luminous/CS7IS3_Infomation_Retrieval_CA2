Andrejs Rucs, the former head of the Riga Vidzeme district municipality, was prompted by his "impulsive disposition to join in the incident but he was unconscious of the actual goals of its organizers," said Kostanda. The Homeland and Freedom faction does not support methods used by Rucs during the incident because, currently, Latvia is unable to turn out the occupation army by force, said faction head Maris Grinblats. The faction calls for more composure in similar situations, said Grinblats. Simultaneously, Grinblats criticized the government for "overdramatizing" the occurrence and being too submissive to Russia's interests. "Russian militarists quite often take the liberty to treat Latvia's citizens in a criminal way," noted Kostanda. Russia's military planes cross the Latvian airspace without any permission almost daily but the Latvian Government has notified Russia on none of these occassions, Kostanda said. Kostanda reminded the participants of the press conference that one of the detainees, Maj. Gen. Anatoly Vodopyanov, conducted actions against the Latvian state in January and August, 1991. The other officer, Maj. Gen. Nikolay Tailokov, has unlawfully settled in a summer house of a Latvian citizen and refuses to move out, said Kostanda. Kostanda characterized the government's apology to Russia as "irresponsible and corresponding to its disloyal policies." The Cabinet used the incident to extend its authority by unlawful means, said Grinblats, pointing at the amendments to the law on municipalities. The amended law allowed for the immediate dismissal of Rucs. The amendments are inconsistent with the 81st paragraph of the Latvian Constitution, said Grinblats. The new rules also increased the dependence of municipal officials from the government, he added. At the same time, speakers of the Homeland and Freedom faction pledged to pay more attention to issues related to the procedure of Russian troops' withdrawal and the takeover of the military property.
