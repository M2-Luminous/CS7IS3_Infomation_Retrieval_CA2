Spisarenko: "The Governor Is Certain of One Thing: Self-Reliance Is the Key, Because It Is Impossible To Rely on `Uncle,' and He Objects Vehemently to Politicization...." [Text] On 11 April L. Roketskiy had another of his now traditional, semi-official meetings with representatives of the news media. Although he began with the equally traditional mounting of his "peasant" hobbyhorse, the range of topics discussed at the conference was nevertheless quite broad. As far as rural issues are concerned, the oblast administration is adhering to the principle of maximum support. Everything possible has been done to secure a good supply of seeds, including outside purchases of corn and sunflower seeds. Credits have been obtained for purchases of new equipment, which the farmers themselves are not in any hurry to buy--it costs too much. As for performance indicators for the first quarter, they are not that encouraging. Industrial production is declining, and this automatically reduces the income portion of the budget and, consequently, the amount of tax collected. This will affect people directly because the payment of wages will be delayed, although the administration is "able and willing" to minimize the negative consequences. The RF Ministry of Finance now owes the oblast around 13 billion.... Despite all obstacles, the governor has also remained committed to his plan to build highways, and I think that there will be no objections to this. In particular, the RF Ministry of Highway Construction has offered its guarantees and support, all necessary repairs will be made on the road linking Tyumen with Yuzhnyy Balyk and Tobolsk, and the Yekaterinburg-Tyumen-Omsk highway now has federal status. This was followed by a discussion of higher academic institutions and their students: They are experiencing difficulties, and the problem is not the administration, but the flawed mechanism of the federal system, which is responsible for "science," but has not taken this responsibility seriously enough. When I asked whether the State Duma and RF Federation Council would be able to whip the system of federal agencies--not only higher academic institutions, but also state inspectorates, the police force, and other "budget dependents"--into shape before the 1996 deadline, the governor replied, in a dejected tone: "Not likely! So far, we have been able to rely only on ourselves...." A paradoxical situation has taken shape in the oil and gas complex: It appears that our "black gold" is losing its competitive edge in the market, and many of yesterday's most steadfast clients now prefer other suppliers. L. Roketskiy blamed this on the oil producers and their lack of a complete system of production and refinery units, leading to a situation in which the fuel for the Tyumen enterprises' own gas stations frequently has to be purchased from...dealers in Tyumen. I asked the governor a "probing" question: "Is this a result of the oblast's loss of administrative functions in the oil and gas complex?" He avoided a direct response by saying that these functions had been under the control of federal officials for a long time. It is true that this control is rather weak, but the administration itself is still doing something. In particular, Academician Aganbegyan spent days analyzing the situation as part of a field study in Tyumen Oblast and concluded that numerous violations had been committed in the privatization of the oil and gas complex. Besides this, the oblast did manage, even if only after some delay, to acquire an additional share of the oil dividends through the property fund headed by V. Zagvyazinskiy. The loss of competitiveness was mentioned again during a discussion of the products of agricultural processing: Although our cheese and sausage are considered to be ecologically clean and absolutely delicious, they are too expensive to compete with products from Kogalym. The administration wants to allow our competitor-neighbors into our market to protect consumer interests, but L. Roketskiy did not answer my question about the intention of the executive branch to cooperate with the union of local entrepreneurs and commercial producers in this sphere: I suggested the need for a jointly developed and centralized system of interaction. The administration plans to cut its committee staff positions by 20 percent and to demand the same from federal agencies. The governor had some words to say about the anti-monopoly directorate headed by V. Samoylik, which has "sheltered" the Republic Party within its walls and communications network. He was equally blunt in his statement that the commotion over the municipal committee on ecology was dictated precisely by "political elements": In this case, however, it is one of the subspecies of the communist movement instead of the Republic Party. Anyway, this will not make the streets of Tyumen any cleaner. In short, the head of the oblast administration, without any reservations, reaffirmed his commitment to the edict on the need to depoliticize the work of government agencies. He has advised local politicians and the leaders of peasant unions and movements to avoid fueling political passions and to unite within the framework of the general accord around the shovel and rake, directing all of their democratic-revolutionary fervor into clearing all of the winter debris out of the city: "Total concentration on Environmental Cleanup Day!" Roketskiy explained that the budget--in the oblast and in the Russian Federation as a whole--would have to be broken down into quarters because of all the present difficulties. No annual plan could withstand the current rate of inflation. The conference ended with a discussion of...the Turks. It appears that the Russian common man thinks too much of himself and is too fastidious to do wet and dirty work like plastering, and prefers dryer and higher-paying jobs. The Turks, on the other hand, will do anything. They take care of each and every stage of a construction project, and they do the work quite well besides. This is one of the grim realities of market competition. Eventually, Russian builders will be forced out of the market by the Turks. All of this was also discussed at the press conference in the governor's residence. Once again, Roketskiy repeated his fervent hope for the cooperation and constructive support of the new oblast duma, underscoring the high caliber of its membership, during the resolution of the whole mountain of current problems.
