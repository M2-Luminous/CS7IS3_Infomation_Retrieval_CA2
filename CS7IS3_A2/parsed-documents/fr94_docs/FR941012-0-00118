FR941012-0-00118 FR941012-0-00011 At paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that no machine be operated on any slope that is greater than the maximum slope recommended by the manufacturer. In the proposed standard, this requirement was implied in the provision that operators comply with operating manuals or instructions. The pulpwood logging standard had specified that operators be advised of the stability limitations of the machine. As with the requirement on rated capacity, OSHA believes this provision is necessary to reduce the potential for machine rollover and tipover accidents. Therefore, the Agency has explicitly stated this requirement in the final standard. At paragraph (f)(2)(v) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring the operator to determine that no employee is in the path of the machine before starting or moving the machine. This provision parallels the proposed rule. In the pulpwood logging standard, the operator was required to walk completely around the machine before start up to ensure no employee was in the area. There were no comments on the proposed requirement. OSHA believes this provision is necessary to reduce the number of accidents when employees are struck by machines. According to the State of Washington study, 10 percent of all logging fatalities occurred when employees were struck by machines (Ex. 4&hyph;129). The OSHA FCI report indicated similar results. Eight percent of the employees killed were struck by a logging machine (Ex. 4&hyph;61). Therefore, this requirement has been retained in the final rule. At paragraph (f)(2)(vi) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the machine be started and operated only from the operator's station or as otherwise recommended by the manufacturer. This requirement adopts the provision contained in the proposed rule. Again, there were no comments opposing this provision. Under normal conditions, the only safe place for an operator to be during the use of a machine is at the operator's station. However, some types of material handling equipment have more than one operator's station. In those situations, the operator may choose which available operator's station to use when operating the machine. At paragraph (f)(2)(vii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the machine be operated at such a distance from other employees and machines that a hazard is not created for any employee. This requirement parallels provisions contained in both the proposed standard and the pulpwood logging standard. OSHA did not receive any comment on the proposed requirement. The reasoning and explanation for checking the area before starting or moving a machine applies to this provision as well. The record shows that many employees are injured and killed when they are hit by logging machines (Ex. 2&hyph;1, 4&hyph;61, 4&hyph;129). Therefore, OSHA has adopted the provision as proposed.
