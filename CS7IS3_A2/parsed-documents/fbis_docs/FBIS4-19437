Gardenias and geraniums are the hobby of the National Alliance's secretary, who was roaming the lower house yesterday with Rudolf Borchardt's book, The Enthusiastic Gardener, under his arm. [Bianchessi] The Senate to Forza Italia, the Lower House to the League. Where are your roses going to bloom, Fini, in the government? [Fini] We did not propose any candidates for the speakerships because we wanted to make it easy for the majority to reach agreement right from the outset, not as a give-and-take tactic for the government. I give my word of honor that we have not yet even begun to discuss this with [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi. Nevertheless, National Alliance will undoubtedly have a high profile in the government. [Bianchessi] Rather than smoothing the way for the majority, one gets the impression that, once again, you wanted to leave Berlusconi and [League leader] Bossi alone on stage to quarrel with one another over appointments. Political astuteness? [Fini] Well, I have been in politics for a long time.... [Bianchessi] But are you satisfied with the outcome? [Fini] Entirely. Carlo Scognamiglio [Senate Speakership candidate] has the right degree of authoritativeness to head the Senate; he comes from the ranks of the Liberals and he has experience. Irene Pivetti [Lower house speakership candidate] is first and foremost a woman, and that counters the Right's reputation for male chauvinism, and she is also the League exponent closest to the world of Catholicism. Last but not least, she is young. [Bianchessi] Is youth a virtue? [Fini] It has its importance. Moreover, this is Pivetti's second term, and she is one of the few League deputies to make a mark during the previous parliamentary term. [Bianchessi] But do you not find this reversion to the Cencelli handbook [power-distribution system] irritating? [Fini] That is not how things stand. The Cencelli handbook included the Senate and Lower House speakerships in the count along with the ministries, and this has not happened: There has been no parceling out of posts. [Bianchessi] Leaving Cencelli aside, which for ministries will you be going? [Fini] The issues closest to our hearts are social and welfare matters, but we shall not be making it a question of portfolios. We regard all the ministries as being of equal value. Labor and Public Works are interesting, but we have no requests. [Bianchessi] [Outgoing Senate speaker] Spadolini is still in the running as speaker of the Senate. What if he wins? [Fini] I do not think he will have sufficient votes. He has sunk his own ship by presenting himself as the expression of the old clubby ways. [Bianchessi] Will you be celebrating 25 April [Liberation Day] and 1 May [Labor Day]? [Fini] Yes. I will celebrate 25 April giving it the meaning indicated by [President] Scalfaro. The Left would be wrong to get its own back for 27 March [general election]. It will be nobody's revenge, not even ours. We have always celebrated 1 May. The trade union negotiation system is not open to question. What matters is that the settlements should not lay a burden on the taxpayer, as they have done in the past. [Bianchessi] If the Left takes to the streets, what will happen? [Fini] If it is only the apparat, nothing, but if people follow it, it will mean that the government is getting something wrong, and we shall see if we can set it right. We shall certainly not be setting up a police state. Street demonstrations will only worry us if they are the sign of discontent. [Bianchessi] When will the government be finalized? [Fini] I have no idea. It will certainly take longer than the two weeks that some people have mentioned. It is best to avoid undue haste.
