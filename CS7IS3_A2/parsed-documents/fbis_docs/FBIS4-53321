The committee, comprised of representatives from all upper house parliamentary groups, will complete the plan by May 24 and draft a bill by the end of the month, they said. Under the scheme, 150 upper house members would be elected from prefectural constituencies and 100 through a proportional representation system, sources said. Currently, 152 are chosen from constituencies. The panel has discussed reform in line with electoral system changes made law in January, in which House of Representatives seats would be reduced from the current 511 to 500. The number of upper house seats was designed to be a half of those in the lower house, the sources said. The House of Councillors reform program also aims to level the value of votes that differs from constituency to constituency through readjusting the numbers of seats in eight electoral districts, they said. After readjustment, the maximum vote value disparity stands at 4.81 to 1, compared with 6.48 to 1 as of 1990, they said. Two seats would be added each in Gifu, Kanagawa, Miyagi and Saitama prefectures, four seats would be reduced in Hokkaido and two would be reduced each in Fukuoka, Hyogo and Kagoshima prefectures, they said. The new system also allows voters to vote for individual candidates, and not only for political parties as in proportional representation polling, they said.
