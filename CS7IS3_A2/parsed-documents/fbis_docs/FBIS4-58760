Commenting on Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's remark yesterday that 'Arafat has asked for a period of four weeks until the withdrawal and the deployment of the Palestinian police force take place, Sha'th said that President 'Arafat asked Rabin for the withdrawal to first be effected on time in accordance with the Gaza-Jericho agreement and according to the designated timetable to avoid any gap in time between the Israeli withdrawal and the entry of the Palestinian police force. In his statement, Dr. Sha'th said that the period requested by 'Arafat is the same period specified in the Gaza-Jericho agreement. He said there are rumors that the withdrawal might be implemented within a day or two from the signing of the agreement. But 'Arafat asked that the withdrawal be effected according to the specified timetable so that they would be no time gap between the withdrawal and the entry of the Palestinian police force. Dr. Sha'th's remarks were made during a news conference held by representatives of countries giving donations to the Palestinian police force following their meeting in Cairo today. To a question about the funds to be given to the Palestinian police force in the self-rule regions by the donor countries, the Palestinian president's adviser said these funds will come from the European countries through a coordination institution. All these funds will be deposited in a private account in support of the Palestinian police, Dr. Sha'th added. He affirmed that there will be no custodianship on such funds. Continuing, Dr. Sha'th noted that the PLO will be in complete control of these funds, adding that the PLO undertook to present clear accounts to the donor countries through an international institution in Cairo which will audit the accounts according to the international regulations. Dr. Sha'th said that Saudi Arabia has indeed declared that it will pay US$20 million through the United Nations Relief and Works Agency [UNRWA] for economic development projects in Gaza and Jericho. Saudi aircraft will transport the Palestinian police force from six Arab countries to Gaza and Jericho, he added. Dr. Sha'th said that the PLO will submit a list to Israeli Prime Minister Rabin containing the names of officials who will be in charge of various administrations in Gaza and Jericho in accordance with the agreement, which also notes that the names should be submitted a week after the signing of the agreement yesterday. Dr. Sha'th pointed out that there are 6,000 Palestinian employees currently working in the civil administration [al-idarah al-madaniyah] in the Gaza Strip and these will become part of the self-administration [idarat al-hukm al-dhati]. Therefore, the self-administration will not start from a vacuum. The Palestinian president's adviser said that negotiations will be held in Cairo within a week over certain points which were not resolved during the 'Arafat-Rabin meeting. He said that a round of negotiations will also be held for the election of the Palestinian National Authority. As regards the negotiations over the transition period, Dr. Sha'th said these are slated to be held in Washington. However, he said that if the Arab-Israeli bilateral talks are not resumed in Washington soon, then the negotiations for the transition period will be held in Cairo. Dr. Sha'th noted that the first Egyptian-Palestinian-Jordanian-Israeli meeting will be held within a month to discuss the return of refugees to Gaza and Jericho according to the agreement. Terry Larsen, Norwegian deputy foreign minister and chairman of the donor countries coordination committee, said that the United States, Japan, and the EU have donated $20 million to cover the expenses of the Palestinian police for six months and that Saudi Arabia has promised to provide the Palestinian police with electronic equipment worth $1 million. He said that a number of Palestinian detainees will be freed from Israeli prisons today and more will be released next week. Larsen said at the start of the conference that today's meeting discussed what has been achieved and the outcome of the tours made by delegations from the committee member countries to a number of donor countries last month. He added that a large number of countries have decided to extend financial support to the Palestinian police to help it carry out its duties. Edmond Hal, U.S. charge d'affaires in Cairo and his country's representative on the committee, said that the United States believes that the Palestinian police force will be an element of support in the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. He called on all the donor countries to honor their pledges so that the Palestinian police can preform their duties. The Russian Federation representative said that the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreements is the important thing now so that it will have a practical and positive effect on the entire peace process. He added that one of the coordination committee's objectives is to help the Palestinian police perform their duties and control the situation in Gaza and Jericho, stressing that his country is ready to help these forces. On his part, Egypt's representative, Ambassador Husayn Darar, said that Egypt helped prepare the Palestinian police while participating in the negotiations process so that these forces would be ready to enter the self-rule area. He expressed pleasure at hosting the committee's work in Cairo, stressing that Egypt provided all the facilities for ensuring the success of its work. It is recalled that Norway, the United States and Russia -- the co-sponsors of the peace conference -- and Egypt chair the committee coordinating international aid to the Palestinian police. The committee also includes Japan, the EU countries, and a number of financial insitutions.
