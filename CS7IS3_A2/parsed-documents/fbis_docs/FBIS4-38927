A correspondent of the agency ANS-PRESS reports that Abil Guseynov, member of the Bureau of the SDPA Central Committee who opened the press conference, expressed dissatisfaction with the work of the CPB Coordinating Council and with the frivolous attitude displayed by certain bloc members towards the work done in commissions. He informed journalists that beginning next week, chairmanship of the bloc will go to the party Ana Veten for a month. Virtually all representatives of the Centrist Party Bloc, with the exception of the Social-Democrats, have supported the signing of the Bishkek Protocol. They have not explained the reasons for their attitude towards the document, however. Nizami Suleymanov, chairman of the party Independent Azerbaijan and a supporter of the Bishkek Protocol, condemned the fact that it was not discussed by the National Assembly. Fakhraddin Aydayev, leader of the party Equality of the Peoples of Azerbaijan, stated that Azerbaijan had no alternative to the Bishkek Protocol. Abil Guseynov, SDPA representative to the CPB, stated in turn that the Social-Democrats did not agree with certain points of the Bishkek Protocol. He stated that Karen Baburyan was a citizen of Azerbaijan and had no right to sign any international documents on behalf of the self-proclaimed NKR [Nagorno-Karabakh Republic]. In his view, Azerbaijan authorities should therefore not have sat down at the negotiating table with Baburyan. Guseynov noted that the SDPA was supporting the protocol because it provides for a cease-fire, which will provide the opportunity to gain time, especially since this document represents simply a protocol of intentions. A. Guseynov noted that his party was opposed to the introduction of Russian troops into Azerbaijan, and even if they were stationed in the republic as international peacekeeping forces, such forces must include Turkish troops.
