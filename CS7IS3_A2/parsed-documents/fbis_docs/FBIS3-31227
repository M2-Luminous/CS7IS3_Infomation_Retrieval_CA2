The meeting was attended by Romanian Ambassador in Chisinau Marian Enache. During the meeting the two sides briefed each other on the development of the transition process in the two countries and on the specific difficulties of the current period, which are being complicated by the energy crisis. The two sides also discussed tangible problems pertaining to bilateral relations by emphasizing the importance of economic integration both for Moldova and Romania. It was stressed that the documents that have been signed and those that are to be signed in the coming days will represent genuine support for trading companies in the two countries, as well as for expanding direct relations between economic units on the two banks of the Prut River. Within this context, the two sides noted that relations between companies and even between ministries have exceeded cooperation at the summit. They agreed that more frequent contacts are necessary between the heads of the two governments. Vacaroiu proposed that unsolved problems in economic cooperation be checked and examined to identify the best solutions swiftly. He assured the high-ranking guests that the Romanian Government will continue to support -- economically and financially, including through the 1994 budget -- the economy of the Republic of Moldova, as well as the economic integration process, a press release received from a government spokesman points out.
