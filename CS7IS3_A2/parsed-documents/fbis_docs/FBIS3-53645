[Netanyahu] We all want to attain real peace with Syria, a peace that contains security, and we started this process in Madrid. However, beyond the words that were said by al-Asad today, I must point to those that were not said. Assuming that those words are squeezed out of him in the next meeting, just as the words normalization and peace were squeezed out of 'Arafat, the question is what kind of peace it will be. What I know is that the prime minister visited the Golan Heights 12 hours before the elections, and said there must be no withdrawal from the Golan. He said that anybody withdrawing from the Golan would be abandoning security. I know, and I believe most Israelis know, that the intention of this government is to give the entire Golan Heights to al-Asad, to step down from the Golan Heights. That will not bring peace. All that remains to be seen now is not what Israel will give, since that as already been said: The depth of withdrawal will be tantamount to the depth of peace. If peace is interpreted as a mere piece of paper that Hafiz al-Asad has to give us, a peace agreement with two embassies and temporarily open borders -- the next day he may close them again and tear the paper to pieces, as has happened so many times among Arabs. Therefore, it is as simple as this: There can be peace only if we stay on the Golan. Peace without the Golan will not be peace. I am telling you: We will oppose it most vigorously and, I believe, with the full support of most Israelis. [passage omitted] [Yavin] Sir, what do you propose to tell the U.S. envoys, President Clinton, and Secretary Christopher when they tell us: Al- Asad has taken a step forward. What would be your contribution? [Netanyahu] I would tell them plain and simple: Syria attacked Israel from the Golan Heights, and the aggressor has no right whatsoever to demand back the area from which it attacked us. I would tell Hafiz al-Asad: You demand the entire Golan? I, too, demand the entire Golan. I would tell the Americans: Al-Asad wants other things. First of all, he wants peace with you, not with us, and he definitely wants the Golan back. He needs this peace to modernize his army, which has Soviet weapons and no spare parts; he wants money and technology; he wants to solve his water problems because of the dam the Turks have built on the Euphrates. If he wants all these things, I would make our position regarding the Golan more rigid. However, this government is apparently incapable of doing that and does not know how to negotiate. A peace whereby we withdraw from the Golan in exchange for a piece of paper and embassies is no peace. During the seven-year war in which 1 million people were killed, Iran and Iraq held embassies in each other's country. Therefore, our demand is simple: If the government and the prime minister who declared that he would not withdraw from the Golan wants to renege on his promise to the voter, I demand that he go back to the voter now and call new elections, before he concocts the details with Clinton and al-Asad. [Yavin] Mr. Netanyahu, thank you very much.
