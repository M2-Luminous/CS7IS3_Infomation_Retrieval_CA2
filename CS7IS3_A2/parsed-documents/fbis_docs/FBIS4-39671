"The policy pursued by Russia has absolutely no prospects and can lead to a global military confrontation between Russia and the Caucasus which can finally develop into a new Russian-Caucasian war," Dudayev declared in his interview with Interfax. As Dudayev asserts, young people from other North Caucasian republic who are concerned over the worsening situation around Chechnya are coming to Groznyy. In Dudayev's words, they express their wish to serve in the armed forces of the Chechen republic. Being interviewed by Interfax the day before, Sergey Filatov, head of the president's administration, accused Dudayev, who has repeatedly voiced sharp anti-Russian statements, of actual disruption of the negotiating process between Moscow and Groznyy. Having recognized that Dudayev possesses the real power in Chechnya, Filatov expressed his hope that the Russian-Chechen dialogue would be resumed in the near term.
