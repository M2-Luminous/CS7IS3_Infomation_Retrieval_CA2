What can you say regarding his statement? [Patsatsia] Unfortunately, it has become a tradition here for young people to try to acquire high positions by using the most unacceptable methods. Kardava's statement testifies to this. I am sure that, if I were to offer Kardava the post of, say, procurator in Zugdidi, he would not dare say those things. I consider the statement to be wholly without foundation and not supported by any kind of proof. Perhaps I am being reproached for the fact that, in my time, I conducted a conciliatory policy in Zugdidi. However, even today, I adhere to the same view: There are not so many of us that we should kill one another and that brother should wage war against brother. This does not signify in any way my alliance with the Zviadists. Incidentally, I agree that Zviadism is a problem that has been artificially implanted in western Georgia. Throughout my life, I have proceeded from the belief that I should serve my people and not certain individuals. I would like to ask my opponents this question: What have they themselves done for Georgia? Apart from fighting fiercely and without scruples for the top position, forgetting that there is only one such position. Are there not more important problems facing Georgia such as economic and social problems? [Ambrosova]In this respect, as far as we know, has Russia not granted Georgia 10 billion rubles credit? How will this money be spent? [Patsatsia] Some of this money has already been used to pay our debts. We have also bought gas and fuel oil. We assume that the credit will be spent on paying for fuel and energy resources that are essential so as finally to activate industry and, at the same time, revive the economy. The means for this will be drawn in general from official long-term credits and not only those from Russia. This will enable us to implement work at the Tbilisi State Rayon Power Station that will be able to produce an additional 300 megawatts of electric power and, after putting into operation a new power bloc, to regulate the functioning of the network of Ingurskiy power stations. [Ambrosova]The oil-prospecting work that is already in progress in Georgia should certainly be a boost to the economy. [Patsatsia] Yes, you are right. In this respect, contacts have been established with Britain and Australia. In July, we are planning to install processing units at the sites. Of course, the initial extractions will be insufficient for Georgia's needs but there are great prospects for the future. In addition, exploration work is going on into new deposits in which Georgia is undoubtedly rich. [Ambrosova]Batono Otari, you are often called an opponent of the market economy. With what is this connected? [Patsatsia] This is connected with the fact that people here have a false understanding of many things, including the market economy. I am an advocate of the so-called Korean model of a state-controlled market economy. According to this model, a number of branches, those that are strategically important, should be controlled by the state. After all, if the state loses its monopoly on, for example, the food industry, how are we to exist? General privatization or rather misappropriation [prikhvatizatsiya] is taking place here, which will not bring the state anything; it is only being robbed. Ten percent of the population, in whose hands state property has been concentrated as a result of this misappropriation, has brought the entire nation to a state of impoverishment. The mafia rules here, if only as far as those coupon credits are concerned. As a result of the policy conducted by the previous government, huge sums of coupons, most of which were issued to private firms and individuals, have not brought the state a single kopeck and, what is more, most of these sums have not been returned. [Ambrosova]Do you think that we will be faced with the threat of total collapse if Georgia does not join the ruble zone? [Patsatsia] In principle, entry into the ruble zone is necessary. However, this remains just one question connected with the multitude of problems both here and in Russia. Economic relations between the countries of the former Soviet Union have changed radically. If, up to now, we have been living on subsidies, we can expect no one to feed us for free both in the CIS and the ruble zone. Yes, we will receive help with material and technical supplies. However, we will have to conduct financial policy ourselves. In order to do this, the economy has to be put back on its feet. [Ambrosova]For how long will our government function without being approved? [Patsatsia] I hope that the government will be approved within a month. I do not rule out changes in its composition. One can expect anything nowadays.
