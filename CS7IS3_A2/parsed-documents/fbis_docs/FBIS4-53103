This statement from Vietnam came after King Norodom Sihanouk was quoted by the FAR EASTERN ECONOMIC REVIEW from an interview he gave to the magazine on 11 May as accusing Vietnam of moving the border postings deep inside Cambodia and digging canals inside the country. Cambodia and Vietnam share a common terrestrial border of 1,130 kilometers and the border problem has been a bone of contention between the two countries since the French colonialists left Indochina in the 1950's. The border disputes between the two countries have remained outstanding. Moreover, there have been rumors that Vietnam has moved border markers into Cambodian territory in the Cambodian provinces bordering Vietnam on the west. It should be recalled that during Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet's official visit to Cambodia last April, the two countries agreed to create an expert team to discuss and solve their land border conflict. Vietnam, like Thailand, is a signatory to the Paris 23 October 1991 accord. According to the accord's provisions, the two countries should respect Cambodia's territorial integrity and national unity and restrain themselves from interfering in the country's internal affairs. Following the establishment of the National Assembly and the formation of the Royal Government of Cambodia through the elections organized by the United Nations in May 1993, the Cambodian Constitution defined Cambodia's border in accordance with the 1/100,000 map of the 1960's. Nevertheless, border issues in the eastern and western parts of Cambodia remain unsettled, resulting in endless conflicts and accusations. With goodwill to achieve peace, security, and have good neighborliness, which contributes to restoring peace and security and promoting cooperation in the region as well as reinforcing world peace, the Cambodian people wish to enthusiastically welcome the aforementioned stance of the SRV Government and call on other neighbors of Cambodia to follow the fine example. Moreover, words and actions should move concurrently.
