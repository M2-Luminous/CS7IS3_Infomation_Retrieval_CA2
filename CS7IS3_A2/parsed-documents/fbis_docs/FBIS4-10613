He appeared before Congress as a witness rather than defendant in a case investigating possible links between the MIR [Leftist Revolutionary Movement] and drug trafficking. This is what the Constituent Commission must determine, and this is why the former president of the Republic was summoned to testify. The following is Amalia Pando's report: [Begin recording] [Pando] The information that former President Jaime Paz Zamora today gave the Constituent Commission confirms his close friendship with Isaac Chavarria, who has been arrested under charges of drug trafficking. Paz Zamora, however, repeatedly denied having been aware or even suspected that his friend was linked to drug trafficking. [Paz] As I have already stated, it started off as a political relationship. He wanted to work, from the political viewpoint, with the MIR and for the candidacy of Jaime Paz Zamora. But this relationship turned into a friendship in view of his moving background, which he himself disclosed, and the work and personal contacts he maintained. This is why if you were to ask me how many times I met with Isaac Chavarria, I would not be able to answer you. It is the same as if I were to ask you about any of your friends, and you started telling him how many times you saw him, where you saw him, how many times you met with him, etc. It should be pointed out that this friendship grew stronger, especially in 1987, and declined a little in 1988. But we hardly saw each other in 1989, and almost never during my four years as president of the Republic. This relationship, through me, spread to my family. Well, not all my family, but to my two sisters. I want to point out that this relationship never involved any type of crime. I also want to point out that Mr. Chavarria was always willing to work, to undertake projects. He always showed a great civic and patriotic spirit. I think he longed for his years in the Army. [passage omitted] If my great friend Isaac Chavarria now has the misfortune of being involved in drug trafficking, I deeply regret it. But this fact by no means can stain the spotless relationship I maintained with him in the past. [Pando] When the so-called narco-photo [showing Paz Zamora with Chavarria] was published, Chavarria was identified as a drug trafficker, but not even on that occasion did Paz Zamora suspect anything. He said that the reason was that on that occasion Chavarria disclosed his address, but that the Special Antinarcotics Force [FELCN] did not visit him. He also referred to the position of his social defense secretary at that time, Alderete. [Paz] The interesting thing is that on 11 June, I think, the media reported Alderete's answer to Deputy Gonzalez Quintanilla. As a result of the anonymous photograph attached to a letter sent to Congress, Alderete, the social defense secretary in Paz Estenssoro's government, promised Quintanilla, Congress, and the Bolivian people that within a week he would have a list of Isaac Chavarria's crimes, which he would send to all FELCN offices throughout the country. The country is still waiting for this information, which he had said would be ready within one week. [Pando] MIR Deputy Luis Vasquez asked Paz Zamora whether the MIR leaders had ever warned him about the risks his friendship with Chavarria entailed. [Paz] I want to reiterate what I have already said. I never suspected that Isaac Chavarria was involved in any crime. What fellow partisan Susana Seleme [Paz Zamora's private secretary] disclosed here before Congress does not belong to a specific meeting in Santa Cruz. I was never told: Fellow partisan Jaime Paz, come, sit down, we want to talk to you about this problem. What I did notice was that some [MIR] members did not like him. That is a fact. But MIR leader Guillermo Capobianco and other high-ranking members, for example, didn't have this problem. [Pando] In 1990 Chavarria's home in La Paz was raided. Jaime Paz Zamora heard about this, and ordered his private secretary to find out about it at the FELCN. [Paz] It was not a precise order. What I did do was to ask her to find out what had happened because, as I have already stated, the private secretary never gave instructions; in this case, she only asked for information on what had happened to determine whether there was anything illegal about the charges. That is what happened. Susana Seleme, as [name indistinct] mentioned and also reminded me, informed me that she had phoned (General Anez) who told her it was a routine operation among the hundreds and hundreds of routine operations the FELCN carries out. I think they call them warning operations. And that was the end of that. After receiving that information I forgot the issue but now, after years, I realize through some documents mentioned here in Congress that the operation was not directed against Isaac Chavarria. [Unidentified legislator] Didn't this information about the FELCN operation against Chavarria's home, linked to a recent event, arise any suspicions? We are talking about something that happened in 1989 or 1990, when you said called outrageous the charges that Chavarria was involved in drug trafficking. Didn't the information on the FELCN operation against Chavarria's home cause you to suspect something? [Paz] The truth is that I accepted the explanation I was given, because in my capacity as president I had a thousand and one other things to think about, and forgot the issue. As I have already stated, my contacts with Chavarria had become very sporadic. At that time it had been almost a year since I had last seen him. [Pando] After Chavarria's home in Irpavi was raided by the FELCN, Paz Zamora met with Chavarria at Edith Paz Zamora's home. He was asked whether on that occasion Chavarria ever mentioned the FELCN raid on his home in Irpavi. [Paz] I do not remember. I am afraid I do not remember. Aside from our talks on the railroad ties -- because he explained the problem, and I told him I would learn more about it before I decided what should be done -- the meeting lasted longer than ever because we discussed politics. Chavarria is very interested in politics. [Pando] Paz Zamora definitely did not find out before, during, or after his government that Chavarria was a drug trafficker. He also said that neither social defense under secretary (Gonzalo Torricos) nor the FELCN had warned him that Chavarria was involved in illegal activities. At this point Deputy Juan del Granado read 13 press reports from PRESENCIA, HOY, and other newspapers published in 1991, accusing Chavarrias of drug trafficking. [Del Granado] ...PRESENCIA reports that Isaac Chavarria -- I mean Isaac Etcheverria -- heads a list of the nine most sought-after drug traffickers by Bolivian courts and anti-drug agents the United States had stationed in Bolivia. Didn't you read this information? [Paz] No, I didn't. Well, there was another drug trafficker called Etcheverria who I believe was taken to the United States, but I think it was before then. I think he was the one who produced the evidence against [name indistinct]. But, well, in any case it does not refer to that Etcheverria. I did not learn about this, but what I wonder is, if it is true, why was I not informed directly? The FELCN is semi-autonomous. Why was there so much noise and no action? Alderete announced something in 1988, but never did anything about it. I think that worse than the fact that I did not read that press report, is that if the information was true nothing was done about it. [Pando] But there were 13, not only one, press reports published around the same time mentioning Isaac Etcheverria and Isaac Chavarria as two of the most important Bolivian drug traffickers. Why didn't the FELCN arrest Chavarria during Paz Zamora's government? Paz Zamora himself asked this question which, some way or another, the Constituent Commission must answer. The second important aspect of Paz Zamora's statements to the commission were his charges, sometimes in a direct and sometimes in an indirect manner, against the U.S. Embassy and the FELCN of having orchestrated this plot to destroy the MIR, his family, and him. [passage omitted] [Paz] I want to fully reiterate what I said in my message to the Bolivian people on 26 March. I reiterate my intention to withdraw from politics. I have realized there is a plan, through me, to damage the country, its image. There is a plan to harm the Republic, to harm values for which all Bolivians have worked hard, such as the values of democracy, national coexistence, national unity. I have also realized that there is not only a plan to harm our country, through me, but also my party. [Pando] On this occasion Paz Zamora tried to change from playing defendant to plaintiff, and for this he railed against the FELCN, which is not very popular and on many occasions has been repudiated by the people. We will have to await the Constituent Commission's final report to know whether Jaime Paz' charges against dubious FELCN procedures will clear all that has been said about the connection he, his family, and the MIR reportedly maintained with drug trafficker Isaac Chavarria.
