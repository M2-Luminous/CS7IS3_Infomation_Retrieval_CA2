Velasquez to irrevocably accept his retirement from the national Armed Forces. Along with members of the military High Command, Munoz placed his post at the president's disposal. The defense minister adopted this stand because President-elect Rafael Caldera decided to reorganize the military High Command. Meanwhile, President Ramon J. Velasquez said that the work done by these soldiers over the past months was decisive in preserving democracy. He added that President Caldera is fully empowered to make the changes he deems necessary. [Begin Velasquez recording] I wish to say that the military High Command and the defense minister have been key collaborators in the process that led to the 5 December elections. For seven months, months which were filled with difficulties, the presence of the military High Command meant support and strong stability for the government I headed. Holding elections in December was also the High Command's main goal. I hold you in high esteem for the work you did, the way you have maintained discipline within the military institution, and your high sense of patriotism which guides each one of you as members of a key team within the national Armed Forces.
