Ivan Rybkin, Speaker of the Federal Assembly's lower chamber, expressed this position at his first press conference on Friday. He said he "opposes any coercive methods to solve problems." When asked about his party activity in Volgograd, he recalled that 4 out of the 30 years of his service was spent engaged in party work and before that he headed a chair at the institute. In his opinion, the State Duma must focus its attention on a package of economic decrees because legislative activity in this sphere "is far behind the real life." He believes that "there is much of value" in the plan of legislative activity prepared by the presidential commission on legislative proposals. The State Duma speaker must, to quote Rybkin, cooperate with all public organizations and parties, including those which have appeared outside the parliament. At the same time he stressed the necessity to cooperate with the president and government. Rybkin expressed hope that along with extreme factions "a center will inevitably appear" in the parliament on the basis of the greater part of the Agrarian party faction, deputies of the Civic Union who were elected in one-mandate districts, and representatives of industrial regions and districts. At the same time analysis of pre-election programs demonstrates that representatives of all blocs understand "the price of reforms" which the citizens have to pay, that "this should be lowered and we must look for cleverer decisions." Responding to a question regarding his bad habits, the 47- year old speaker reported that he gave up smoking in 1975, although "he started to smoke earlier than he began to walk." In his words, he is almost a tee-totaller, enjoying just a glass of champagne at New Year. He likes to be busy with his car as he knows it very well as an engineer-mechanic. He has driven for 30 years and prefers a "fast ride with a tail wind."
