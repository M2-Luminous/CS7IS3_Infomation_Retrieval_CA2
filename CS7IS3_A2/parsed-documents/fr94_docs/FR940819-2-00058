Take notice that on July 29, 1994, Columbia Gulf Transmission Company (Applicant), P.O. Box 683, Houston, Texas 77001, filed an application, as modified on August 10, 1994, pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act and Part 157 of the Commission's Regulations for an order authorizing the abandonment and sale of natural gas facilities constructed pursuant to authorization granted in Docket No. CP84&hyph;551&hyph;000. 1 1 See, 30 FERC Â¶ 62,082 (1985). Applicant seeks authorization for the abandonment of certain compression facilities and appurtenances purchased to facilitate the transportation of gas produced from the Eugene Island Block 309 G Platform, under terms of gas purchase contracts between Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia Transmission), Applicant's affiliate, and Forest Oil Corporation (Forest Oil) and Columbia Gas Development Corporation (Columbia Development). Applicant states that Columbia Transmission has ceased purchasing from both companies and the facilities are no longer needed for system supply. Therefore, Applicant, Forest Oil and Columbia Development have entered into an agreement dated January 24, 1994, for the purchase and sale of Applicant's 50% interest in the facilities for the sum of $29,375. Forest Oil and Columbia Development would assume all responsibilities and liability for the future operation, maintenance and retirement of the facilities. Applicant states that none of its transportation in Eugene Island Block 309 would be affected. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before September 6, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214) and the regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party in any proceeding herein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's rules. Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the Commission by Sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter finds that permission and approval for the proposed abandonment are required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given. Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for Applicant to appear or to be represented at the hearing. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
