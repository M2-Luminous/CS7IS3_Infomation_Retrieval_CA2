The command of the Herzegovina Corps stresses that the units of the Srpska army are successfully carrying out their duties with the aim of enabling the expelled Serbian population from the right bank of the Drina River to return home and to save around 1,000 Serbs trapped in Gorazde itself. In fighting yesterday and overnight, the troops of the Herzegovina Corps have captured two important peaks -- Gradina and Jartiste, located some five kilometers east of Gorazde. These are the positions from which all Muslim attacks toward Cajnice were launched in the past 18 days. NATO planes are today again overflying the positions of the Serb troops between Gorazde and Cajnice. True, they are flying at an altitude over three kilometers, but an air raid alarm has been in effect in Cajnice since yesterday. The local population is observing the alarm. There have been no losses in the ranks of the Herzegovina Corps in the past 24 hours.
