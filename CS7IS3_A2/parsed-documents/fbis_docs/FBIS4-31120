This morning Andov held talks for one hour with Pjeter Arbnori, president of the Albanian assembly. They exchanged views on the cooperation between the two assemblies and states and on the situation in the Balkans. Arbnori said that Macedonia and Albania "cooperate well in many domains," and that "they are very good neighbors." The cooperation would be even better if the Albanians in Macedonia were granted "all rights," Arbnori said. Andov said that there were "many problems" between the two states, but, he stressed, "a way of solving them has been found." According to him, the problems connected with the rights of the Albanians in Macedonia are dealt with in the institutions of the system in line with the highest European standards on minority rights, or even better. He expressed the hope that the Macedonians in Albania would be granted the same rights and freedoms. The president of the assembly of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia today also had a meeting with Albanian President Sali Berisha. Berisha said that he expected this visit to contribute to the further development of cooperation between the two countries and that he was happy that what he had agreed on with President Gligorov during their meeting last month in Pogradec was being realized. The Albanian president welcomed the adoption of the law on the population census in Macedonia and noted the need to develop traffic links between the two countries, including the links with the port of Durres, which should serve the Macedonian economy as well. During the talks, Berisha also mentioned the position of the Albanian minority in Kosovo-Metohija and spoke against forcible changes to the border. Berisha thanked Gligorov for his invitation to visit Macedonia and announced his visit to Skopje in the near future. During his talks with Berisha, Andov said that "essential steps forward have been taken" in the cooperation between Macedonia and Albania and that "there are no obstacles to the development and strengthening of cooperation." According to Andov, Macedonia and Albania are "linked in terms of their fate and oriented toward one other."
