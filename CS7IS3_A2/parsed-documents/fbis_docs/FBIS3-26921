The authoritative source quoted the central policy decisionmaking body as saying that the central authorities, which have drawn a lesson from last November's sharp increase in grain prices, maintained that the retail prices of grain can be freed in the future. The grain sources, however, must be controlled by the state rather than by small tradespeople and peddlers, because China's is a big socialist market, and the normal market order will be easily jeopardized by small tradespeople and peddlers if they are allowed to purchase grain. The central authorities made it clear that, in order to carry out the state policy for keeping grain prices stable, the state grain departments will in the future be in charge of policy-related grain purchases while joining businessmen in selling grain at retail prices. To carry out the above policy, the State Council called a national conference on matters related to the "shopping basket" and grain, cotton, and oil. Vice Premier Zhu Rongji presided over the conference. Premier Li Peng said at the meeting: The present situation with agricultural production and market supply is good in general. There have been bumper harvests for years running, and the "shopping basket" project has achieved remarkable results. The total supply of farm produce -- foodstuffs in particular -- which had fallen short for quite some time, is comparatively ample now. Under such a good situation, however, fluctuations in the prices of grain, oil, and non-staple foods were seen in certain regions for a period following last November. The fluctuations were caused by many factors. But the most important factor, in my view, was that we lacked an adequate understanding of the need to exercise macrocontrol over the market under the new situation of lifting price controls. The current meeting is designed to seek unity in thinking, sum up positive and negative experiences, and find ways for our work on the "shopping basket" project and on grain, cotton, and oil to meet the demands of the socialist market economy. He pointed out: China will make major strides in reform by introducing important reform measures this year. Whether we can smoothly carry out these major reform measures will have a bearing on the success or failure of the reform and a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy. To carry out reform successfully, it is necessary to maintain social stability and reassure the people. We must make great efforts to keep prices relatively stable, especially the prices of grain, oil, meat, vegetables, and eggs. He continued: We must take into account the interests of people of all social strata in deepening reform. China's reform accords with the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people. In the course of reform, however, it is unlikely that each stratum or each person will gain the same interests and same substantial profits at the same time. Therefore, in doing our work we must take special care of the people who are not well off for the time being, especially those who are still leading a rather difficult life. Li Peng said: At present, to control the farm produce market, we should do a good job in three respects. First, we should be careful to establish a system of reserves to regulate the prices of staple agricultural products, including grain, cotton, oil, meat, vegetables, and sugar; second, we should establish a system of market risk funds for grain and non-staple foods; and third, we should establish a system for supervising and controlling farm produce markets and strengthen the construction of a network providing information on farm produce. Li Peng added: I have repeatedly stressed that governments in various localities, especially governments of large and medium cities, must be put in charge of the "shopping basket" project and that a responsibility system should be introduced under which mayors are held responsible for the project. The mayor must regard making adequate arrangements for the people's daily life his priority task, because this is a matter of prime importance for maintaining overall stability. This should be made a requirement of the mayors' responsibility system. The mayors' performance should be appraised every year, and the results should be reported to the relevant city people's congresses and all citizens.
