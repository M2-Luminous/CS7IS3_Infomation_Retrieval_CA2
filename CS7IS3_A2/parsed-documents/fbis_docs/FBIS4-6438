The spokesman for North Sumatra's Police Headquarters, Lt. Col. Leo Sukardi, said in Medan, 1400 kilometers northwest of Jakarta, that shops and supermarkets closed during the riots have reopened, and no further protests have occurred. The situation is calm and residents are not afraid to go out any more, Leo said. Students have already gone back to school, although many rumors have been spread by parties that there will be other protest rallies. Meanwhile in Jakarta, rumors have spread that there were demonstrations, following those in Medan, in some areas of Jakarta such as Glodok, Tanjung Priok, Pasar Baru and Tomang, where many Chinese descendants live. But Jakarta's military commander, Maj. Gen. Hendro Priyono, called on Jakarta's residents to remain calm and not react to mere rumors. "Jakarta is safe," Hendro told reporters.
