FR940328-1-00026 FR940328-1-00011 48 CFR Parts 9 and 52 [FAR Case 91&hyph;105] Federal Acquisition Regulation; First Article Testing and Approval AGENCIES: Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council are proposing a change to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) which adds language to the existing first article clauses and adds a new solicitation provision, Waiver of First Article Testing and Approval. This regulatory action was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review pursuant to Executive Order No. 12866 dated September 30, 1993. DATES: Comments should be submitted on or before May 27, 1994, to be considered in the formulation of a final rule. ADDRESSES: Interested parties should submit written comments to: General Services Administration, FAR Secretariat (VRS), 18th & F Streets, NW., room 4037, Washington, DC 20405. Please cite FAR case 91&hyph;105 in all correspondence related to this case. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Ralph De Stefano at (202) 501&hyph;1758 in reference to this FAR case. For general information, contact the FAR Secretariat, Room 4037, GS Building, Washington, DC 20405, (202) 501&hyph;4755. Please cite FAR case 91&hyph;105. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background The existing first article clauses at FAR 52.209&hyph;3, First Article Approval-Contractor Testing, and 52.209&hyph;4, First Article Approval-Government Testing, do not cover all the requirements of FAR 9.306, Solicitation requirements. The proposed language will cover the main requirements in this section and will reduce the number of non-standard provisions and clauses on this subject. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. , because the changes will standardize the FAR coverage addressed under FAR 9.306, Solicitation requirements. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments are invited from small businesses and other interested parties. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will also be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610. Such comments must be submitted separately and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. (FAR case 91&hyph;105), in correspondence. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;511) is deemed to apply because the proposed rule contains information collection requirements. Accordingly, a request for approval of a new information collection requirement concerning the Waiver of First Article Testing and Approval Requirements solicitation provision is being submitted to the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq. Public comments concerning this request will be invited through a Federal Register notice appearing in this same issue. List of Subjects in 48 CFR Parts 9 and 52 Government procurement. Dated: March 18, 1994. Albert A. Vicchiolla, Director, Office of Federal Acquisition Policy.
