[passage omitted] In the first round 68.9 percent of the electorate voted. A news conference for the international press ended not long ago at the National Election Center, where they primarily wanted to inform the foreign journalists about the overall preliminary results. [passage omitted] They have now also announced the distribution of seats on the regional party lists. According to this, the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] will receive another 53 seats, with 32.9 percent of the votes; the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] has 28 seats with 19.7 percent; the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] has 18 seats with 11.7 percent; the Independent Smallholders Party [FKGP] has 14 seats with not quite 9 percent of the votes; and the Christian Democrats [KDNP] -- although they gained a few votes more than Fidesz [Federation of Young Democrats] -- the latter received seven seats but the KDNP received only five. This is because of the different numbers of voters in the regions. A total of 27 seats passed from the regional lists to the national lists [to be decided in the second round]. Zoltan Toth, head of the national election office, said that of approximately 22,000 ballot papers they are unable to account for a total of 18, but they hope that by 1500 this afternoon, the time of the briefing in parliament, the premliminary results of the first round will be complete including these.
