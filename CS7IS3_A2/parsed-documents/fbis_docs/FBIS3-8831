We are therefore repeating some of the more important parts of his interview. [Begin recording] [Moravcik] I am now faced with the most important step, and that is to form the new government. I am fully concentrating on this task. [Unidentified reporter] Do you already have a concept concerning the composition of the new government? [Moravcik] Such a concept has been taking shape for some time. I cannot say more about it right now because negotiations with representatives of the parliamentary parties concerned are still going on. The composition of the new government should be completed tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. [Reporter] When do you want to submit the composition of the government for the president's approval? [Moravcik] I think this could happen on Wednesday [16 March]. [Reporter] Does it mean that you want the 27th parliamentary session to continue with the new government? [Moravcik] It would be desirable. [Reporter] Are you working on your policy statement? [Moravcik] I will submit the policy statement at the next National Council session. [Reporter] As a former foreign minister, how do you visualize the person of the future foreign minister? [Moravcik] I think it should be a career diplomat. I am approaching the issue from this starting point at the moment. [Reporter] Do you have anyone tipped for this post? [Moravcik] Naturally, I do. [Reporter] In your interview for Slobodny Piatok [Free Friday], you said that you were close to the ideas of the Alliance of Democrats of the Slovak Republic. Does that mean that their ideas will determine your course and that you will work with this party? [Moravcik] We want to create a joint political party. [Reporter] Does it mean that the party being called the Democratic Union, whose creation has been proposed by Roman Kovac, is going to be the joint party with the Alliance of Democrats? Or are these parties going to be two different political parties and you, in that case, will choose just one of them? [Moravcik] It is possible that another party will be involved. That means that three or possibly four parties will merge. [Reporter] Which three or four parties of those you have just mentioned might participate in such a merger? [Moravcik] Perhaps you should add Cernak [former chairman of the Slovak National Party and founder of the National Democratic parliamentary club] and maybe another body, although that is no more than an idea at the moment.
