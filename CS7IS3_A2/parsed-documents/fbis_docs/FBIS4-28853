"The Super Article 301 which the United States has revived through an administrative order does not go compatible with the principle of the new World Trade Organization (WTO)," Kim said. Speaking at the seventh Korea-U.S. business conference held at the Hotel Intercontinental, Minister Kim said the United States should not arbitrarily invoke the Super Article 301. He stressed that any inter-country trade disputes should be resolved under procedures duly laid down by the World Trade Organization. Kim also said he expects the United States' investment in South Korea would be further spurred in the days ahead. "American investors should know we have such merits as an extensive market, able work force, ability to digest high-tech projects and political stability," he said. Meanwhile, U.S. Ambassador James Laney said at the conference that South Korea should ease imports control of consumption goods such as automobiles and cable television programs. He said a serious imbalance is shown between the two countries in the exports and imports of automobile, which he said is due to South Korea's "unreasonable tariffs policy and complex imports permit regulations." Laney also expressed the hope that South Korea will further ease regulations in the broad areas of cable TV programs or software designs. This will be helpful to strengthening South Korea's own international competitiveness, he said. The American ambassador said that South Korea's consumption goods market, which he said was closed in the past, is getting opened step by step. Still, he said, South Korean bureaucrats have the means of making imports difficult and imports are still regarded by many people as something immoral. Consumption goods imports will give an opportunity for Korean consumers to conserve goods and will lead Korean industries to increase productivity, Laney said. Prevention of consumption goods imports was taken as the manifestation of patriotism in the past, but this is a time for the South Korean Government to switch to a new stance, Ambassador Laney said.
