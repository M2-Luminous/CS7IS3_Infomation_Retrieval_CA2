The course of the election campaign has revealed an unconcealed antistate, anti-Ukrainian, and chauvinist orientation of programs adhered to by many presidential candidates. The mass media are full of malice against Ukraine and call for restoring the USSR and going under Russia's flag. The Crimean Ukrainian public and political organizations came out decisively against the introduction of the institution of presidency in the Crimea, since this may lead to the obstruction of the central presidential power, strengthening of separatism and confrontation, and is, possibly, the last attempt to sever the Crimea from Ukraine, something which threatens its territorial integrity, peace, and quiet. In addition, during this time of crisis, the holding of Crimean presidential elections will be an additional material burden upon the electorate and will later lead to an expansion of the bureaucratic apparatus, which is too inflated even now. The Crimean Ukrainian Civic Congress, whose constituent congress was held on 28 November 1993, has employed the tactics of active political and legal counteraction to the illegal Crimean presidential elections and has, for this purpose, enlisted the services of state and public structures. However, we are extremely surprised and alarmed by your inert and reticent position regarding the events in the Crimea. Nor do the Crimean Tatar people, who have been constantly supporting Ukraine's state-building policy, but have encountered an indifferent attitude toward their problems, understand the silence of official Kiev. The actions by Ivan Yermakov, Ukrainian presidential representative in Sevastopol, are disloyal with regard to the Ukrainian state. He has recently taken a direct part in procommunist and chauvinist gatherings and expressed support for anti-Ukrainian circles. The fact that he decided to nominate himself as a Crimean presidential candidate shows his contempt for the Ukrainian legislature, the fulfillment of which he was supposed to guarantee. Ivan Yermakov's 11 December 1993 appeal, full of groundless and contemptuous criticism of Ukrainian leadership, marks his transition to an open opposition to the Ukrainian president, Supreme Council, and government. At a conference of leaders of Sevastopol enterprises and organizations on 13 December 1993, he stated that he considered the institution of Ukrainian presidential representatives inexpedient. Does such a representative of the Ukrainian president have the right to occupy this position? The Ukrainian Civic Congress demands that Ukraine's Supreme Council and president do the following: 1. Consider the question of the systematic violation of the Ukrainian Constitution and current legislation in the Crimea. 2. Condemn the attempt by the Communist Party nomenklatura to introduce the institution of presidency and to cancel the Crimean presidential elections as being at variance with Ukraine's current legislation. 3. To implement Ukraine's law "On the Ukrainian Presidential Representation in the Crimea." 4. To remove Ivan Yermakov from his post as Ukrainian presidential representative in the Crimea. 5. In carrying out the Ukrainian state-building policy in the Crimea, to rely upon patriotic political and public organizations.
