From President Jiang Zemin's meeting with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in Seattle to Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata's visit to China last January, and from Vice Premier Zhu Rongji's visit to Japan at the beginning of spring to Prime Minister Hosokawa's current visit to China, frequent high-level Sino-Japanese contacts have left a profound mark on the history of friendly relations between the two countries. If Vice Premier Zhu Rongji's visit to Japan induced the emergence of a "China craze" in the Japanese archipelago and the willingness to forge further cooperation with China, Prime Minister Hosokawa's official visit to China has heated up the "Sino-Japanese cooperation craze." Prime Minister Hosokawa stressed: Japanese-Chinese ties are "one of the most important pillars" in the foundation of Japan's foreign affairs, and Japan will actively support China's modernization. The increasing warmth of Sino-Japanese relations has erased certain doubts in Japanese business circles, further enhancing their confidence toward investment in China. The Japanese side felt that more Japanese capital and technology will enter China in the next five years. People here feel that the "Sino-Japanese cooperation craze" is an important legacy of the overall change in post-Cold War international relations, China's rapid economic growth, and Japan's domestic economic readjustment. In the process wherein the current international order is changing from polarization to multipolarization, it is of great benefit for the Chinese and Japanese economies, the stability and development of the Asia-Pacific region, as well as for establishing a new international political and economic order, for China and Japan, two important countries in Asia and the world, to develop friendly and cooperative relations. The frequent contacts of Chinese and Japanese leaders have shown that the two countries have reached common understanding in this aspect, symbolizing a new era of mature and comprehensive development in Sino-Japanese relations. People have noticed that high-level contacts between the two countries are biased toward economic issues. Economic and trade cooperation has taken the "leading role" in Sino-Japanese relations. Last year, economic and trade relations between the two countries created three "firsts": Sino-Japanese trade volume reached a record $39 billion and Japan became China's largest trading partner; Japan's technology exports to China constituted the largest portion of China's technology imports; and Japanese enterprises led the rest in investing capital in China. These three "firsts" have not only favored China's economic construction, but have also injected new vitality into the Japanese economy, which is now in recession. However, speaking on the potential of Sino-Japanese economic and trade cooperation, the level of these three "firsts" is still not high. Since the Chinese and Japanese economies strongly supplement each other, there is wide scope for further development. China's major development areas involve transportation, energy, and communications fields, in which Japan is strong. It can be foreseen that once Japan's technology and capital continue to increasingly integrate with China's market and resources on a wider scope, it will definitely become a reality in the near future for the annual trade volume of the two countries to reach $390 billion, an amount predicted by Vice Premier Zhu Rongji when he visited Japan. Of course, Sino-Japanese relations are not limited to economic and trade cooperation. The similarity of viewpoints of the two sides on many major international issues is clear proof of this. Following continued deepening of mutual understanding, the two countries have bright prospects for cooperation in political, cultural, and environmental protection areas. In a few more years, mankind will move into the 21st century. Despite the turmoil in much of today's world, Asia is experiencing a general trend of rapid economic development and relative stability. Just as President Jiang Zemin pointed out when he met Prime Minister Hosokawa, this is Asia's "rare development opportunity in history." China and Japan have clearly expressed that the two countries should seize opportunities, join hands, as well as establish a long and stable relationship involving mutually beneficial cooperation to jointly meet the challenge of the new century. Frequent contacts between high-level Sino-Japanese officials are a visible sign of efforts made toward achieving this goal.
