FBIS3-25858 "drchi021_b_94001" FBIS-CHI-94-021 Document Type:Daily Report 1 Feb 1994 United States & Canada Government Fines, Detains `Golden Venture' Returnees HK3001022894 Hong Kong SOUTH CHINA SUNDAY MORNING POST in English 30 Jan 94 p 1, 13 HK3001022894 Hong Kong SOUTH CHINA SUNDAY MORNING POST Language: English Article Type:BFN ["SUNDAY POST exclusive"] [Text] Mainlanders who gave up everything for a place on the ill-fated freighter Golden Venture and a new life in the United States seem certain to end their journey inside Chinese detention centres, the SUNDAY MORNING POST has discovered. The 118 Golden Venture illegal immigrants [IIs] deported to China nine days ago are being held in Public Security Bureau (PSB) offices in Fuzhou city. If their families cannot pay fines of up to 20,000 yuan (HK$17,760 [Hong Kong dollars])--a massive sum by normal mainland standards--they will be sent to re-education centres. Receipts obtained by the SUNDAY MORNING POST bear the stamps of the Fujian Provincial Government and the Frontier Armed Police Force of Changle County, a small administrative area 40 kilometres from Fuzhou. They show that the authorities fined the illegal immigrants separately and a senior re-education centre official in the Fujian capital admitted they would be jailed if the cash was not paid. The Golden Venture, with 286 illegal immigrants on board, ran aground off New York last June. Six mainlanders died when they jumped from the ship in a desperate bid to escape from U.S. officials. Many claimed they were refugees escaping the strictures of China's one-child-per-family policy, a plea backed by a U.S. federal judge last week when he ruled it provided sufficient grounds for asylum in the U.S.. But his decision came too late for the first batch of Golden Venture illegal immigrants, and news of their harsh treatment seems certain to fuel the heated debate on human rights abuses on the mainland, and heighten demands for the U.S. not to renew China's Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status. Raising cash to pay the fines demanded by the authorities has already taken a high toll on some families. The wife of one illegal immigrant said they raised the 20,000 yuan for the fine by borrowing from a loan-shark--but the PSB refused to accept it because her husband, Cheng Yiulin, was a second offender, and said he must spend a year in a re-education centre. Mrs Cheng, 26, said her husband had now been detained for a week by the PSB. "They beat him up and now he has a stomach illness," she said. "They also said he would be sent to the re-education centre for a year." Pausing to light a candle--their old, brick-built house has no electricity--she continued: "My mother was very upset after hearing the news. She hanged herself on Monday." The family tragedy has spread even further--her mother-in-law has suffered a nervous breakdown. Cheng Yiulin's journey on the Golden Venture was the second time he had made an illegal bid to get to the United States. His first attempt was last January with another in-famous II ship, the East Wood. More than 524 Chinese were on the East Wood when food and water supplies ran out in mid-Pacific. The U.S. coast guard stopped the vessel as it neared Hawaii last February and the Chinese were eventually sent home. Mr Cheng was then fined 20,000 yuan, a sum which equalled the total family income for five years. He received a similar fine when he was deported by the U.S.. Mrs Cheng said they had paid the first penalty by borrowing money from loan-sharks, but when it became obvious that they would never clear the debt her husband decided to make a second bid to reach the U.S. and make his fortune. "We could not go on repaying the loan for the rest of our lives," she said. "The only way out was for him to go to America." With three children aged seven, six and four, his distraught wife said all she was praying for now was a family reunion. Even the children understood what was happening in the family. Asked where her "Daddy" was, seven-year-old Dingshui said: "He is now in jail. I miss him." Mrs Cheng cannot even see her husband because she does not have the cash--"The PSB charges 30 yuan for each visit," she said. The Chinese Government promised before the illegal immigrants were sent home that they would not be imprisoned or harshly punished. Fines would be no more than 5,000 yuan, they said, adding the returnees would be lectured and released. But receipts shown to the SUNDAY MORNING POST and issued by Fujian Provincial Government and the Fujian Frontier Armed Police Force, reveal that at least one mainlander was charged 11,000 yuan. The director of Rujiang Re-education Centre, Mr Liu, makes no secret of the fact the immigrants are jailed. "They (IIs) have to do some work, there is no reason to lock them up everyday," Mr Liu said. "The time spent in re-education is not fixed, it depends mainly on their performance." It is believed most returning boat people are held in the high-walled Rujiang camp, which is in a remote area about 20 kilometres from Fuzhou. And it is expected those from the Golden Venture will end up at the camp as well. Mr Liu refused to say how many boat people were in the jail and how they fared once inside. However, it was learned that about 1,000 IIs are being held in the centre and that they have to work on construction, farming and the production of shoes. The SUNDAY MORNING POST witnessed some inmates working on the roof of a building, and Fuzhou Labour and Education Bureau lorries carrying footwear material into the camp. Sources say the camp's main output is shoe soles which goes to Taiwanese enterprises. Families of the illegal immigrants say they can only visit their relatives once a month. Some of the IIs will be sent to the Shui Tao re-education centre in Fuzhou. Camp director, Mr Wang said: "It is normal that they have to work."
