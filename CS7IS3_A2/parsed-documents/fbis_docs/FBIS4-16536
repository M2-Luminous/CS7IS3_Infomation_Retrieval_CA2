In an interview with INTERFAX he said that he would sign documents on an associated membership. Kravchuk believes that now the difference between full and associated membership in the economic union is only relative. "I have looked through economic documents prepared for the Moscow CIS summit. We shall sign them. Like full members, we shall put our signatures under the documents on the economic cooperation among the CIS members," said Kravchuk. Asked to express his attitude to the initiative by Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev on the creation of a Euro-Asian union, Kravchuk said that today the integration in such a scope, proposed by some politicians, following the example of the European Union, has no basis. For a Euro-Asian union to work, conditions should be prepared gradually, said Kravchuk. It is no secret that it took European countries 35 years to form the European Union. The CIS has existed only several years and we did not yet form many mechanisms for the Commonwealth to work. There are also other problems which are not solved, not for a lack of will. The conditions are not ripe for a Euro-Asian union, said Kravchuk. Kravchuk said that he was not against the idea of a Euro-Asian union. He said he did not want the idea to materialize now, because, he believes, it would lead nowhere.
