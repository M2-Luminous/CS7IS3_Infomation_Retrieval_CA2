ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: On December 29, 1992, the EPA promulgated final regulations implementing the Early Reductions Program under section 112(i)(5) of the Clean Air Act, as amended (CAA). As part of that rulemaking, EPA designated a list of high-risk hazardous air pollutants and limited the use of offsetting reductions in other hazardous air pollutants as counting towards the required reductions in high-risk pollutants. An amendment to the high-risk list which would delete acrylic acid because of EPA's analysis of new toxicological data was proposed in the Federal Register on June 22, 1994. This final action promulgates this amendment and deletes acrylic acid from the list of high-risk pollutants as designated by the Early Reductions Program. This final action also removes methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) (CAS No. 101688) from the list of high-risk pollutants. The EPA's listing of MDI as a high-risk pollutant was vacated by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on July 19, 1994. DATES: Effective Date. October 21, 1994. Judicial Review. Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, judicial review of the actions taken by this final rule is available only by the filing of a petition for review in the U.S. District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit within 60 days of publication of this rule. Under section 307(b)(2) of the CAA, the requirements that are the subject of this action may not be challenged later in civil or criminal proceedings brought by the EPA to enforce these requirements. ADDRESSES: Docket. Docket No. A&hyph;94&hyph;29, containing supporting information used in developing the promulgated standards, is available for public inspection and copying between 8:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, at EPA's Air Docket Section, Waterside Mall, room 1500, 1st floor, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460.
