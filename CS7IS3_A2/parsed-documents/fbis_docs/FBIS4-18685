The escudo was under pressure from speculators when Portuguese banks sold so much currency that they ended up without escudos. The Bank of Portugal was forced to intervene with over 1 billion escudos to be able to control the situation. It was a nerve-racking day on the markets. More details from Paulo Fidalgo: [Fidalgo] The financial markets were surprised today when banks started running out of escudos and short-term interest rates rocketed to figures 10 times above the average of about one week ago. For you to have an idea about the chaos reigning in the markets, it is enough for me to tell you that rates for 24-hour interbank loans reached 100 percent as opposed to 10-12 percent rates charged one week ago. Following intervention by the Bank of Portugal, the situation was more under control, and the overnight rate settled at 40 percent. But to stabilize the situation, the Central Bank had to make available to banks over 1 billion escudos, twice the amount used yesterday. Speculators started selling escudos about one week ago and forced the devaluation of the Portuguese currency against almost every single currency within the European Monetary System [EMS]. National banks that played an intermediate role in the operations have now run out of escudos and will have to buy them before Monday [11 April], the date when the Central Bank will verify whether the compulsory reserves are within the established boundaries. Miguel Beleza, governor of Bank of Portugal, is imposing the present interest rates as a means of punishing speculators and thus charging a very high price for the availability of the currency. This is a way of controlling the game of purchase and sale of the escudo and maintaining its value on the international market. From this speculative movement against the escudo, the banks are trying to draw the conclusion that interest rates have already reached their lowest limit -- around 9 percent -- and that they cannot drop any further unless the government gives up the present value of the escudo within the EMS. Therefore, the market is now waiting for clearer signs: A strong escudo or low interest rates. But it looks difficult to have these two together.
