It is reported here that Russia has decided to send troops to Sarajevo to help enforce a ceasefire and persuade the Serbs to withdraw heavy weapons by next Monday [21 February], as demanded under a U.N. ultimatum backed by NATO. Hurd said the Russian move fitted "admirably" with the NATO initiative. "If this works on the ground, there is now a much better chance than before of avoiding air strikes," he added. But he warned that the air strikes would go ahead if the U.N. conditions were not met. Meanwhile, the U.N. confirmed today that the Bosnian Serbs have started a major withdrawal of heavy guns around Sarajevo, press reports said here. U.N. Bosnia Commander Lt-Gen. Sir Michael Rose is reported to have said that he was confident that the U.N. ultimatum would be observed. Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic announced that the siege of Sarajevo was "over." "We do think that war in Sarajevo is finally over," he said after talks with Russian special envoy Vitaliy Churkin. As part of the Moscow plan, 400 Russian soldiers would be moved to the Bosnian capital from Croatia. And another significant contingent would be deployed once Russia has settled "legal requirement." But Bosnian Government Vice-President Ejup Ganic rejected the deployment of Russian U.N. troops to control Bosnian Serb heavy weapons. He held that Russia is not neutral in the case of Bosnia-Herzegovina and it didn't go along with the NATO peace process. "We are certainly not welcoming Russians to guard Serbian weapons," and "we would rather let them keep our weapons than Serb weapons," he said.
