FR940404-0-00022 FR940404-0-00011 21 CFR Part 558 New Animal Drugs for Use in Animal Feeds; Bambermycins AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the animal drug regulations to reflect approval of a new animal drug application (NADA) filed by Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet Co. The NADA provides for expanding the use of currently approved bambermycins-containing Type A medicated articles to make Type C medicated feeds for increased rate of weight gain in pasture cattle. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 4, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Warner J. Caldwell, Center for Veterinary Medicine (HFV&hyph;126), Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855, 301&hyph;594&hyph;1638. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet Co., Rt. 202&hyph;206 North, P.O. Box 2500, Somerville, NJ 08876&hyph;1258, has filed NADA 141&hyph;034. The NADA provides for expanding the use of currently approved 2-, 4-, and 10-gram-per-pound bambermycins-containing Type A medicated articles to make Type C medicated feeds for increased rate of weight gain in pasture cattle (as in related NADA 44&hyph;759 which covers broiler chickens, growing-finishing swine, growing turkeys, and cattle fed in confinement for slaughter). The NADA is approved as of March 4, 1994, and the regulations are amended in §558.95(b) (21 CFR 558.95(b)) to reflect the approval. As provided in 21 CFR 558.4(a) and (d), bambermycins are Category I drugs, which as the sole drug ingredient, do not require an approved Form FDA 1900 for making Type C medicated feeds as in approved NADA 141&hyph;034 and in §558.95, as amended herein. In accordance with the freedom of information provisions of part 20 (21 CFR part 20) and §514.11(e)(2)(ii) (21 CFR 514.11(e)(2)(ii)), a summary of safety and effectiveness data and information submitted to support approval of this application may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(ii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b(c)(2)(F)(ii)), this approval for food-producing animals qualifies for 3 years of marketing exclusivity beginning March 4, 1994, because the application contains reports of new clinical or field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) and, in the case of food-producing animals, human food safety studies (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) essential to the approval of the application and conducted or sponsored by the applicant. The 3 years of marketing exclusivity applies only to the claim of increased rate of weight gain in pasture cattle for which the application is being approved. The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. List of Subjects in 21 CFR Part 558 Animal drugs, Animal feeds. Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs and redelegated to the Center for Veterinary Medicine, 21 CFR part 558 is amended as follows: PART 558_NEW ANIMAL DRUGS FOR USE IN ANIMAL FEEDS 1. The authority citation for 21 CFR part 558 continues to read as follows: Authority: Secs. 512, 701 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b, 371). 2.
