The province has registered 6,200 agro-technical societies with 240,000 members since farmers voluntarily set up the first one in 1980. These societies are involved in more than 100 specialties covering plantation, breeding, gardening, sideline processing and rural enterprises. Of the societies, about 1,000 focus on the study of technology, economic development and new products for rural industries. Founded in 1985, the Nanfeng township-run Station Wagon Body Society in Zhangjiagang city, Jiangsu Province, has imported 12 items of advanced technology and developed 18 new products. As a result, it generated more than 80 million yuan in taxes and profits last year. The province has formed a number of large special production bases and markets with the help of rural societies. The Changzhang Vegetable Society in Tongshan county has set up a vegetable consultancy department, a seedling department and a production and marketing department to offer a package of related services. Its vegetables sell well across the country. According to the provincial society of sciences and technology, Jiangsu will set up a provincial level federation of rural professional technology to better guide farmers to contribute in the market economy.
