FR941206-0-00092 FR941206-0-00012 (a) Ensuring agencywide awareness and compliance with the mail management standards set forth by the U.S. Postal Service in the Domestic Mail Manual, the International Mail Manual, the Memo to Mailers, and the Postal Bulletin, as well as GSA standards and guidelines. (b) Negotiating on behalf of the agency with the U.S. Postal Service for mail related services and implementing operational procedures for services acquired from private delivery vendors and couriers. (c) Developing and distributing throughout the agency an agency mail cost control program. The agency cost control program must include, in addition to written policies regarding actions and procedures necessary to provide timely and cost-effective dispatch and delivery of mail, a plan for transition to automated mailing procedures, including: automated addressing, address list management, and electronic mail. This program must include: (1) Developing and issuing on an agencywide basis program directives, guidance, and policies for timely and cost-effective mail management. Copies of program directives, policies, and guidance must be available for inspection by GSA. This includes at a minimum: (i) Instructing mailers to use expedited mail only when required. Mail managers should require that mailers avoid excessive use of expedited mail services. Generally, expedited mail should not be used on Fridays, weekends, or the day before a holiday. When expedited mail is needed on Fridays, weekends, or the day before a holiday, the mail manager must coordinate with the mailer to ensure delivery to the addressee. For example, if the addressee's building will not be opened consider other delivery arrangements. The mail manager must establish control procedures including written instructions on cost-effective use of expedited mail and must review scheduled expedited mail dispatches to determine if expedited service is necessary. If expedited mail is not necessary, alternatives to be considered include, but are not limited to: First-Class and Priority Mail, from the U.S. Postal Service and package delivery services from other vendors, if the agency has the authority to contract for or enter into agreements with such vendors and in accordance with any existing contracts or agreements for such services to which the agency is a party. (ii) Maximizing agency cost-effective participation in worksharing programs. This includes proper address list management, compliance with automation addressing standards, presorting, and barcoding. (2) Monitoring through the agency's local mail managers at all mail facilities, mailings, and other mail management activities using onsite inspections, checklists, or other inspection/review methods. (3) Developing and directing agency programs and plans for proper use of transportation, equipment, and supply vendors, relative to mail management.
