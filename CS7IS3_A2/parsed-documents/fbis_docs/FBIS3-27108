With the arrival of the Spring Festival, the flow of workers from rural areas has come to an upsurge. According to reports from various localities, after the Spring Festival, more than 1 million rural workers will leave home for the first time to join the ranks of workers working away from their hometowns. The flow of rural workers during this period has coincided with the busy "Spring Festival travel." As many as 10 million workers from rural areas are returning home for the Spring Festival, and then they will join the streams of people returning to cities after visiting their families, thus putting huge pressure on the transportation sector. In the early 1980's, the saying that "to make a fortune, people from the east, west, south, north, and middle should go to Guangdong" began to spread. In mid-1980's, several million peasants in the hinterland came down to the Zhujiang Delta to work, thus creating a fairly big impact on local development. After this area was saturated with rural workers from other parts of China, job seekers from the hinterland went to Fujian, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and other coastal provinces and cities. While tens of thousands of peasants from Sichuan, Hunan, Anhui, Henan, Guangxi, and Hubei have moved to the south or east to work, several million skilled craftsmen from coastal rural areas have moved to the north and west. The scale and the scope of the tides of rural workers continued to broaden, causing positive effects for urban economic and social development in addition to having some impact on society. What worries people most is those roving peasants who cannot find jobs after experiencing many frustrations. In recent years, there invariably have been many peasants who have had to linger at train stations, ports, or other public places after the Spring Festival, thus having a negative impact on normal social life. This reporter has interviewed some jobless peasants at the Guangzhou Train Station. They did not have any idea about who would need them or where to go after they left home. Their experiences are really sad. Last spring, over 200,000 peasants in Sichuan alone became vagrants. II. The "tides of rural workers" are not accidental. China has a huge population, little farmland, and a poor foundation to start with. The goal of 900 million peasants is to develop the economy and have better lives. The implementation of the household contract responsibility system with remuneration linked to output has greatly liberated the productive forces in rural society and has pushed agriculture to higher levels. At the same time, the problem of surplus laborers caused by insufficient farmland -- a problem that was formerly addressed by the system of "eating from the same big pot" -- was exposed right away. This problem became more acute because of higher labor efficiency. According to some people's estimates, more than 100 million surplus laborers emerged in China's rural areas in the early 1980's. Reform and opening up broke the old, state-planned economic pattern and changed the situation in which urban and rural areas were separated. Many peasants changed their old thinking of "growing old and dying where they were born and brought up." The space for developing production was also expanded from 1.5 mu acreage per capita to the entire village, thus creating a new situation in which "agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries are launched at the same time and all businesses -- industrial, construction, transportation, services, and commercial undertakings -- thrive together." Peasants widened and extended farmland by developing barren mountains, unused bodies of water, deserted beaches, and wasteland. They developed "blue farmland" in the sea and promoted farming, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries in an all-around way. The comprehensive development of agricultural resources has created both wealth and new job opportunities for numerous workers in the agricultural sector. The appearance of township and town enterprises has provided hundreds of millions of peasants with a new area of development besides agricultural production. At present, country folks are active in all sectors of the national economy. In 1993, total sales of the nation's township and town enterprises reached 2,600 billion yuan, their net profits reached 160 billion yuan, the taxes they delivered to the state totaled 95 billion yuan, the total value of goods they delivered for export reached 190 billion yuan, the value of new fixed assets reached 150 billion yuan, the amount of funds they contributed for supporting rural construction projects reached 29 billion yuan, the amounts of funds they contributed for subsidizing agricultural production and construction reached 13 million yuan, and at least 60 percent of the increase in peasants' net per capita income came from township and town enterprises. What merits mention is that more than 3 million urban residents are applying their skills in enterprises in rural areas. The development of industrial production and commodity circulation in rural areas has given rise to the appearance of some 10,000 small towns along with the vigorous development of tertiary industry in rural areas. In rural areas there are now more than 12 million tertiary industrial enterprises providing all forms of services relevant to people's needs in terms of clothing, food, housing, transportation, cultural activities, and recreation, as well as services needed before, during, and after production, and these enterprises employ more than 40 million workers. The number of people in rural areas working part time in tertiary industrial enterprises is even higher. While some 100 million rural laborers have changed jobs and work in factories without leaving their hometowns in rural China, over 10 million peasants in the country have moved into cities to live and work. Each year the number of peasants coming to cities to work and do business exceeds 20 million. In doing the kinds of jobs that city people are unwilling to do or for which the latter consider the pay to be unattractive, these laborers are providing urban residents with inexpensive and fast services. Today rural workers can be seen working hard in places where large developmental projects are being constructed. During the course of reform and opening up, Chinese peasants are exploring new job opportunities for rural laborers. By the end of 1993, the total number of workers working for township and town enterprises in the country had reached 112 million. These workers, as well as the 40 million rural laborers who spent most of their time in the distribution sector and service trade even though they did not work for township and town enterprises, show that at least 110 million farmers have "washed their feet" and moved into nonagricultural sectors in the last decade, thus causing a massive transfer of the labor force from rural areas unprecedented in world history. The development of township and town enterprises and the establishment of new towns are Chinese peasants' innovations, because of which China does not have to force large numbers of bankrupt persons to flow into the cities, which is not the case in some countries; and the state does not have finance all by itself the investment needed for industrial development and turning peasants into workers. According to estimates, approximately 80 million surplus laborers in rural areas have found jobs in township and town enterprises since 1980, and if the state had to build factories to place many of these people, 1.6 trillion yuan would be needed. This is tantamount to several years of the nation's revenues, and if surplus laborers in rural China have to be placed in cities by the end of this century, the scale of newly built cities must be at least double that of the total number of cities today [as received]. This is simply impossible, no matter how we look at this issue. China has a very large population, anyway, and regional development is uneven. For various reasons, the level of economic development in rural areas in central and western China and some underdeveloped areas along the coast is low, the increase in peasants' income has been slow, and problems of surplus laborers are conspicuous. This is why many peasants have left home to look for opportunities to become rich in coastal areas, cities, and economically developed areas. Nevertheless, job opportunities are not limitless in certain periods, even in coastal and economically developed urban areas. As a result, the rural workers who move from place to place to find jobs have caused this widespread "tide of rural workers." III. Of the 1.1 billion people in China, 900 million are peasants. All the people of the nation cannot lead a fairly comfortable life unless peasants are able to live comfortably. Whether we can attain a relatively comfortable standard of living in rural areas depends on whether we can successfully transfer hundreds of millions of surplus rural workers to other fields by the end of the century. Therefore, to understand and solve the issue of "flows of rural workers," we should take developing productive forces, optimizing the allocation of resources, and maintaining social stability into full consideration. Rural workers moving from place to place are faced with the need to improve their lives, and some regions and enterprises do need rural workers for their own development. Therefore, we need to provide correct guidance to flowing rural workers instead of simply imposing restrictions on them. On the other hand, current conditions such as transportation can hardly accommodate large-scale flows of rural workers. The need for rural workers is limited in coastal and economically developed urban areas. In addition, our big cities and super-big cities are already "too big." If we do nothing to persuade the rural workers pouring into big cities to do otherwise, the existing urban problems are bound to worsen and will shake our society. Therefore, only by transferring surplus rural workers through multiple levels and channels and guiding the flows of rural workers in an orderly way can we ease the "tide of rural workers" fundamentally. By making an objective analysis of the characteristics and pattern of the flows of rural workers, we will find out that existing channels for transferring rural labor are very broad. First, the flow of rural workers from central and western regions to the east is a general pattern at present because of the disparity existing between different regional economic levels. In 1992, the total output value of village and town enterprises nationwide reached 1,758.4 billion yuan, two-thirds of which were from 10 provinces in the east and only one-third from 20 provinces in the western and central regions. In that year, the proportion of output of village and town enterprises in the gross social product in rural areas accounted for 76.91 percent in the eastern region, 63.48 percent in the central region, and 38.2 percent in the western region. The huge disparity between the central and western regions, and the eastern region is the motive force compelling peasants in the central and western regions to leave home and also where the huge potential for solving the issue of transferring surplus labor from rural areas lies. If the central and western regions and underdeveloped areas -- where the tides of rural workers originate -- are able to quicken the development of village and town enterprises in light of actual conditions by beginning with projects that require less input, yield greater economic results, and promise quick returns, they can improve local economies and create tens of millions of job opportunities. Bashan, which was a poor and backward mountain village in central Shandong only a dozen years ago, has struggled hard to develop secondary and tertiary industries and has become a very rich "star village." The collective assets owned by the entire village are as great as "1 million yuan" for each family. Zhangjin village, of Qianjiang city on the Jianghan Plain, started with the garment industry and established the "Xingfu Group," whose annual output value exceeds more than 100 million yuan. They changed the name of their rundown village to "Xingfu [Happy] village." Dongzhou village, of Sanyuan County on the dry land north of Weihe, became an "industrial village" on the loess plain after developing village and town enterprises..... Villages like these have emerged in batches across the country. The thing they have in common is that they not only solve the problem of the local surplus of labor but also absorb tens of thousands of laborers from surrounding areas and other provinces by developing their own economies. In those eastern coastal and economically developed regions to which the tides of rural worker flow, we can promote cooperation between the east and the west to transfer labor-intensive industries to underdeveloped regions, thus enabling surplus rural laborers in underdeveloped regions to find jobs without having to go far away from home. Second, another special feature of the flows of rural workers at present is that they flow to nonagricultural areas from rural areas. One reason is that peasants in rural areas seem to feel that it is hard to lead a comfortable life by working in the fields. In fact, if we lead peasants to broaden their outlook, steer them toward the market, and comprehensively develop agricultural resources in breadth and in depth by relying on agrotechnology to promote farming, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries in an all-around way, while at the same time combining the planting, breeding, and processing of agricultural products into a coordinated process in production and operations, we can increase agricultural efficiency by a large margin and create several million job opportunities. In addition, rural areas also have conditions for developing village and town enterprises. Many examples of developing industry and agriculture side by side have come up in many traditional rural areas. Third, one more pattern of the flows of rural workers is that they all want to swarm into cities and towns of economically developed areas. This shows that the industrialization and construction of small towns in the central and western regions lag behind those of the eastern region. If the central and western regions can connect the development of village and town enterprises with the development of farm and sideline products markets and the construction of small towns, as well as encourage and support local peasants and businessmen from other regions in investing, setting up factories, and opening shops in their regions, a great number of rural workers who leave home and look for jobs in other cities will be able to find jobs near their homes. In recent years, a group of towns and villages rejuvenated by developing secondary and tertiary industries have appeared in central, western, and underdeveloped areas, thus becoming the "sparks" for developing local economies. Fourth, at present, the flows of rural workers are unchecked and are without order. An important reason for this is that they lack information about the supply of and demand for laborers. Moreover, because of the lack of intermediate service agencies in the labor market, some peasants just go out blindly and try their luck without possessing any information. Therefore, the key to making rural workers' flows orderly lies in accelerating the cultivation and perfection of the labor market system in urban and rural areas. In recent years, on the one hand, Guangdong Province established regular ties with the other provinces concerned and developed comparatively permanent labor import bases; on the other hand, Guangdong avoided importing labor during "Spring Festival travel" to gradually make the flows of rural workers into this province stable and orderly. This experience merits attention. Fifth, it will take some time before the state of development of various trades and professions permits them to employ more surplus rural workers. A certain number of surplus rural workers will continue to exist in rural areas for quite a long time. Furthermore, the transfer of surplus rural workers and the flows of rural workers from place to place involve all sectors of society, including rural and urban areas, labor-export and labor-import areas, as well as employment departments, transportation departments, and other service organizations. Joint efforts by various departments and areas are objectively necessary. Therefore, governments in all localities at all levels must strengthen their overall planning, management, regulation, and control to do a good job of developing labor markets and relevant services, in giving advice to rural workers, and in promoting the development, utilization, and rational allocation of rural labor resources. Under the premise of ensuring agricultural development, localities should guide surplus rural workers to flow gradually and in an orderly manner to nonagricultural enterprises and areas to thus maintain a fine social and economic order. To encourage and guide surplus rural workers to flow gradually and in an orderly manner to nonagricultural enterprises and areas are important events vital to the overall state of national economic development. We should adopt the appropriate policies and measures to promote the quality of agriculture, the development of village and town enterprises, and the construction of small towns in an effort to transfer more surplus rural workers to or near their homes. At the same time, we must keep abreast of the information about the supply of and demand for labor and the flows of rural workers, vigorously and smoothly develop cooperation in labor affairs according to the demands of areas, and promptly sum up and popularize successful experiences in this field. With the development of the economy, all trades need more workers and also require a higher quality of labor. After we analyzed the rural workers who have found that finding jobs is difficult, we learned that most of them are peasants who do not possess any skills and who have a low level of education. If we train surplus rural workers in various ways to improve their quality and certain of their skills, we will broaden their job flexibility, improve their money-earning skills, raise society's spiritual level, and promote social stability. Hundreds of millions of surplus rural workers are an asset of our society. The development of the entire national economy will provide broader and wider job opportunities for surplus rural workers. As long as we continue to follow the existing road in transferring rural workers, promote the transfer of surplus rural workers through multiple levels and channels, and rationalize and optimize the allocation of rural labor resources by cultivating labor markets, we will be able to bring order to the transfer and flows of surplus rural workers.
