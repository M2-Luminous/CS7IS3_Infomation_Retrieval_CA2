Officially known as the Asean Economic Ministers (AEM) meeting, the forum represents an unprecedented attempt by Asean to determine its role in the fast changing global trade environment. Participants at the meeting outlined three principal goals: First, Asean members are to seek a framework on which to develop Asean cooperation in the service sector. Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak, said Asean is working toward greater cooperation among members in the finance, insurance and telecommunications sectors, primarily as a safeguard; against pressure from industrialized countries. Second, Asean will have to play an important role in the World Trade Organization (WTO), a body created at the Gatt ratification, so that Asean members have a forum for preserving their interests and resisting domination by economic powers like the United States or Japan. Asean ministers see the linking of labour laws with trading privileges as a way of creating trade advantages in favour of developed countries. Asean has called for labour issues to be addressed by the International Labour Organization, and not included on the WTO agenda. Lastly, the ministers have decided on a long-term course, envisaging trade competition among trade organizations like Nafta and the European Community (EC), and taking into account the economic adjustment of such major countries as Japan, India and China. In the wake of increasing trade liberalization with Nafta extending into South America and the EC transforming its organisation into a transcontinental body and still growing, Asean cannot stay complacent. It must adapt itself to the new global arena. Afta, Asean feels, will have to accelerate its efforts to lower tariffs among Asean members ahead of the 15 year time frame, (while complying with the Gatt requirement that members must lower tariffs within 10 years after 1996), to create a stronger Afta capable of competing with other free trade organizations. Asean ministers also agreed to slate agricultural products for Afta tariff reduction in order to increase the trading volume within the group and to keep in line with the Gatt tariff reduction conditions for agriculture products. Asean, the ministers recommended, should look to expanding its transactions with other trade organizations like Nafta to augment the volume of trade, and to create a broader product mix as most of Asean's members share the same commodities. This, the minister reasoned, would strengthen and upgrade the Asean economy. The Asean ministers also acknowledged the necessity to erect a police exchange mechanism (PEM) as part of its effort to reduce unnecessary competition among Asean members to obtain foreign investment. The ministers will assign senior Asean officials to study and work out plans to be presented at a meeting in September in Chiang Mai, before a normal ratification at the next Asean Summit in Bangkok the following year.
