According to the latest news, a massacre of Vietnamese residents was carried out at 1815 on 9 April at Hamlet No. 8, Troeuy Sla commune, S'ang district, Kandal Province in Cambodia. A total of 13 Vietnamese were killed and 27 others were injured. Among those killed were nine children and a women who had recently given birth. The mother was killed, while her baby's arm was amputated. Public opinion in the locality held that the massacre was conducted by the Khmer Rouge in the area. 2. After a series of brutal massacres of Vietnamese residents in Cambodia in the past, this act once again seriously threatens mankind's conscience and boldly tramples on human rights recognized by international conventions. This serious brutal act is obviously aimed at inciting national hatred and damaging the fine tradition of friendship and good-neighborly relations between the Vietnamese and Cambodian peoples. 3. The SRV Government resolutely condemns this new hostile act. It urgently asks King Sihanouk and the Royal Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia to take prompt and effective measures to ensure the safety of the Vietnamese residents in Cambodia so that they may live a peaceful life as citizens of other nations in Cambodia, thereby meeting the spirit and letter of the 3 April 1994 [year as heard] joint communique. The SRV Government urgently asks the United Nations and signatory countries to the Paris Accord on Cambodia, and justice-loving people in the region and the world to seriously denounce and take resolute actions to stop this brutal act against Vietnamese residents in Cambodia, thereby helping to ensure a peaceful life for them in accordance with the spirit of the Paris Accord and other international documents on human rights. The SRV Government expresses its profound concern that if the Royal Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia does not take resolute actions against this brutal and barbarous act of the Khmer Rouge, a series of massacres may recur in Cambodia, thereby bringing about unpredicted consequences. Dated 11 April 1994
