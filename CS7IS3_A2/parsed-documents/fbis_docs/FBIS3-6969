In addition, large-scale construction of public projects -- such as a new airport based in the southwestern area of the country, an international exhibition hall in Taegu Airport, a direct Kyongju-Chonju railway, a new port in Yongil Straits of Pohang, and new state bypasses -- will begin on a full scale next year. At the same time, Kimpo Airport will be enlarged. The International Vaccine Institute of the Seoul National University and a management organization for practicing employment insurance system will also be established next year. The Economic Planning Board's report "Status of Major New and Ongoing Projects for 1995," reports that government offices are planning the above projects for next year. According to this report, the National Unification Board plans to build a large government building in which to hold South-North dialogue in Ilsan with a total fund of 80.2 billion won in preparation for future activated South-North dialogue because the existing South-North dialogue office located in Samchong-tong, Seoul is too small and on lease. The Ministry of Transportation will survey the propriety of building a new airport in the southwestern area with the people of Muan, South Cholla Province, where it will likely be built. Next year it will also begin full-scale construction of various public projects, including state bypasses, which will be completed by 2000 and for which a total fund of 6,509 billion won will be invested.
