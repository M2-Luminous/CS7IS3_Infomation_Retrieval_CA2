Or is it? Kok reproaches Van Mierlo for having made concessions to the VVD too early on. It is no secret that the D66 [Democrats 66] will go far to ensure that a coalition is formed without the CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal]. [Van Mierlo] Wim, never again may you say that I am starting to embrace the minisystem. It is simply not true! We are virtually the first people in the country to have rejected the minisystem. [Kok] There is an ugly discrepancy between what you say one day and what you say the next. First I hear you say to the VVD that you want a purple coalition, but that there can be no minisystem. That is hard talk, words after my own heart. Then, two days later I hear you say to Bolkestein: "Naturally we fulfill a bridging function; it is a matter for discussion." In actual fact what you are saying is that there can be no minisystem, but that you will have to talk about it. That is making too major a concession to Bolkestein on a subject that is very close to my heart. [Van Mierlo] How can you listen to someone so maliciously? Our election platform clearly states that we reject the minisystem. That is it. Then I said to the VVD: "You are the only ones who want such a system." To the PvdA [Labor Party] I said: "You are the only people in the country who are telling me that nothing has to be changed in the social security sector. My conclusion is that you will both have to shift your opinion, and I expect that you will end up somewhere in the neighborhood of our ideas. And naturally I intend to make concessions. In this country you cannot make coalitions without making concessions." [passage omitted] [Kok] This is an historic moment in Netherlands relations. The CDA's position of power is being considerably limited. Also by the fact that the major parties are no longer excluding each other. The CDA can therefore no longer divide and rule and manipulate things so that it remains at the center of power after all. We are all going into these elections without partners. Hans, you have no partner nor do I. We have shaken off our chains. [Van Mierlo] And arms. How long ago was it that you said that the government must be the stake of this election? [Kok] I am still the only person to defend this government policy. Our partner has turned his back on us. The CDA is so confused and embarrassed that it is common knowledge that the party needs to create a kind of image of the enemy just outside the door for the sake of restoring harmony within itself. I am going openly into the elections, with an open mind regarding the coalition possibilities thereafter. Personally, the preference for a purple coalition does not rank in first place. For me, the most important question is this: How can we secure the best platform outcome for a government in which the PvdA and D66 can lay a firm, progressive foundation? I am quite clear about its contents, less clear about the color. Hans is quite clear about the color, and less clear about the contents. [Van Mierlo] Mind what you say. The content is plain to see in our election platform. I remember when we were reproached for never making any choices in advance. Now we are the only ones to do so. And with good reason. I believe that there really is a need for change in this country. Nothing is working any more. No. You have been busy for four years and not one single major operation has taken off. Do you know what has taken off? The mobile air brigade. Provided that you at least throw Ter Beek the pennies he needs to set it up. Our first option is a purple coalition. That is what we are betting on. And I shall not say what our second option is. My lips are sealed. Because then you would know exactly what and whom you have to sabotage. I am not going to play right into your hands. [Kok] Are you thinking of a government including the CDA, VVD, and D66? [Van Mierlo] I am not thinking of that in particular at the moment. [Kok] But you are not ruling it out either? [Van Mierlo] I have not ruled out any government configuration whatsoever. [Kok] Interesting. [Van Mierlo] Come now! Do stop that nonsense! I have been saying that for a full year! [Kok] Extremely interesting. For it is well-known that you are entertaining the possibility of proceeding to form a government with two right-wing parties. [Van Mierlo] I want that particular purple coalition, and I am fighting to obtain it. So I am not going to answer your question, because that would mean me losing my opportunity for such a coalition. [Kok] And yet you did give your answer, because you did not rule it out. [end Kok] Whichever coalition comes about, it will have to place employment at the top of the agenda, definitely now that unemployment is rising at such an alarming rate. Is full employment still a feasible objective? PvdA leaders like Van Dam and Kalma, two of the authors of the election platform, have their doubts. Neither Kok nor Van Mierlo wants to lay claim to that analysis. [passage omitted] [Kok] Will it be possible to achieve full employment in the medium term? The answer is "no." That is clear, but do not forget that despite the very high unemployment figures we are seeing an annual flow of some 400,000 unemployed people. So there are still prospects for many of them. The real problem lies in long-term unemployment. That is why two weeks ago I launched a new social norm for the upcoming government term: Long-term unemployment must be brought back down to two percent. [Van Mierlo] I do not think that anyone can predict what effect technological processes have in terms of unemployment in West Europe. Moreover, no one knows whether we will succeed in reforming the Netherlands economy. Nevertheless, I do not think that you must assume that full employment is no longer possible. Even if there were talk of jobless growth (economic growth without growth in jobs), it is still important for social and psychological reasons to strive for full employment, because the effort you deploy to combat unemployment will be all the greater if you assume that full employment is still possible. [Kok] The idea of economic growth without growth in jobs only applies for part of the economy. In major industry, and in the banking and insurance sectors, the developments are indeed such that in the medium term we will not see much growth in employment. In addition, the possibilities of what was previously called redistribution of work often remain underexposed. That is a bit of an old-fashioned concept, too much of a "macro term," but individual decisions to make work shorter hours and in a different manner have a place in the pattern for new generations on the labor market. Lastly, I think that we must create new opportunities for the large group of long-term unemployed people, who have no prospects at all. In a future government term a minister or state secretary should be able to make an innovative, unorthodox project of this -- reforging benefit payments to help the long-term unemployed find a job. D66 also wants to create "cheap" work, but Van Mierlo is afraid that the PvdA will place the burden of creating it on those in the middle income bracket. On balance, that could be counterproductive. [Van Mierlo] If you want to improve the structure of the economy -- telematics, environmental technology, biotechnology -- then you must not levy unnecessarily heavy taxes on the work that must be carried out to do this. According to the PvdA platform, of each extra guilder earned by the middle income groups (43 to 90 thousand guilders), 66 cents will go to the collective tax burden, whereas with us the figure is 55 cents. In the long term, that will create better conditions for growth in employment in those sectors where the people on the underside [of society] can also benefit by being pushed through. [end Van Mierlo] Nevertheless, the fight against unemployment will not become a breaking point between the PvdA and D66. Things are more difficult with social security. Is not the PvdA making the same mistake as at the last elections. Is it not once again making promises it cannot keep? Van Mierlo points ironically to the WAO (Occupational Disability Insurance Act) debacle. "I will never accuse you of social betrayal. However, the way in which you attacked occupational disability has ruined the whole climate." Wim Kok admitted that mistakes have been made regarding presentation, but he said that he still stands behind the content of the new WAO. "Indeed, the results are beginning to show. I have trouble understanding how someone who now says that things cannot go on like this with social security can at the same time think that in 1991 and 1992 we just let the WAO take its course. On one occasion we should have started earlier, while on the other we should just wait." The question was whether the PvdA had not once again promised too much. Are the voters to be surprised once again with unannounced interventions in social security? Kok responded with irritation: "If the use of a social law increases to the extent that we saw in the early 1990's with the WAO, then that creates new circumstances. If the call for help grows because the application of a law can no longer be controlled, then that can force adjustments. If the economy stagnates, as it has done over the past two years, then that has drastic consequences for everything. And if new circumstances arise following the appearance of a electoral platform, then it is a question of logic and purity for the leadership to talk about the consequences of this with the people." [Van Mierlo] What you are now saying is not in your platform. It suggests that enough has been done, and that further intervention would not be necessary. In your last platform you came up with the link. [Kok] Hans, you must not caricature this. That so-called link was never an objective, merely a means to an end. An instrument -- and here we have a difference of opinion -- for ensuring that the people on the underside of society are looked after somewhat more than people with higher incomes. [Van Mierlo] Yet nothing has come of this over the past four years. Benefits have fallen in terms of buying power. I do not want to blame this on you. All I am saying is that your platform is not a reliable policy indicator for the next four years. [Kok] We are simply not living in a command economy. In some companies, where things are going somewhat better, people are receiving pay raises that are higher than we would have actually wanted. The market that we are so fervently wishing upon other countries has an influence of its own on the development of wages. [Van Mierlo] So that means that you can allow yourselves the illusion of an electoral platform as long as the practical aspects do not get in the way. [Kok] That is true for all parties, including yours. [Van Mierlo] With the difference that we make less promises.
