The Liquors and Beverages Union will produce 33 million liters of rum in 1994, a volume slightly higher than in 1993. This was announced by union director Jose Manuel de la Osa. The Sugar Industry Ministry and people's government productions will allow the supply to reach 41 million liters in 1994. This does not mean, however, that rum sales can be deregulated, like what happened with cigarettes. The industry has the capacity to increase its volume of production, but does not have enough molasses and alcohols to satisfy the rum demand in the retail chain. De la Osa pointed out that increases in those essential raw materials will make it possible to increase rum production in the future. For the present, ration quotas per family unit, as well as the levels of distribution to the retail food chain, will continue in Havana and the rest of Cuba.
