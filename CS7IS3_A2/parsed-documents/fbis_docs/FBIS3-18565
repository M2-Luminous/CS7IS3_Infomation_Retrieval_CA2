He met with his French counterpart Edmond Alphandery. France is not renewing the aid it gave last year for the immediate future, but it has reaffirmed its support for the Algerian authorities. Jerome Bastion: [Bastion] There is support in principle, but financial commitment only behind the IMF [as heard]. This is basically Paris's response to the visit by the Algerian economy minister, as France has made the continuation of its aid -- 6.3 billion francs in 1993 -- conditional on an agreement for the rescheduling of the crushing Algerian debt to the IMF. The Algerian economy minister must have been disappointed at a time when the Malek government is regularly calling for more sympathy and understanding from the French. It should be said that Paris's response is somewhat brusque; France, which is Algeria's main creditor and is owed more than 18 percent of its debt, has already, for example, wiped out Egypt's debt. However, France's caution is explained by the reticence of its partners in the Paris Club over becoming too involved with an unsteady government which is dragging its feet over liberalizing its economy. However, on the internal front the Algerian authorities have a twofold problem -- finding fresh money to avoid bankruptcy and also avoiding the social upheaval which the measures to clean up the economy could bring about. Leaving Paris the Algerian minister headed for Washington, where he could finalize the stopgap loan announced by the IMF head in Algiers a week ago.
