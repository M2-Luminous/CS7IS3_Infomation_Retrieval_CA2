Does Seimas [parliament] Economic Committee Chairman Vytautas Zimnickas intend to follow his example? The chairman has explained this in his interview with TIESA. [Svirbutaviciute] You, as well as Minister J. Veselka, voted against the law on litas reliability in the Seimas. Do you also intend to resign? [Zimnickas] This law was submitted to the Seimas by the government. I think that the Cabinet of Ministers had to be of a unanimous opinion. This law was supervised by the Seimas Budget and the Finance Committee rather than the Economic Committee. Certainly, we also discussed and analyzed it. I may have had to resign in line with political etiquette, because my opinion differed from that of the government and the Seimas majority. In general, resigning is no problem. [Svirbutaviciute] Were there any people in the majority [Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party] faction who shared your opinion that the litas should not be pegged to any currency? [Zimnickas] I suppose that the position of economists in our faction is unanimous. None of us approved of this move, and we expressed that by voting against or abstaining. We believed that currently there was no immediate necessity to adopt such a law. The bank performs its functions entrusted to it with success. The litas has become stable against other currencies for over half a year. It is backed either by gold reserves or other convertible currencies. I know that some people are going to appeal this law to the Constitutional Court because it contains certain contradictions. [Svirbutaviciute] So, the law has been adopted and it must now be enacted. [Zimnickas] Of course. Moreover, I voted for separate articles of this law and submitted proposals so as to adopt optimal decisions. We will have to enact it. That is that! [Svirbutaviciute] Was it really necessary to adopt this law now? [Zimnickas] We began to talk about its advantage and necessity when the situation was unstable. Certainly, the law was essential last fall. However, the discussion has become protracted, while the situation in the bank has stabilized. [Svirbutaviciute] How do you imagine Deputy J. Veselka's role in the Seimas? [Zimnickas] I think that it will be beneficial for Lithuania's economy. I wish an opposition emerged in our faction. [Svirbutaviciute] You, as well as J. Veselka, came to the Seimas as members of the Forum of Lithuania's Future. Some hopes concerning more radical moves in the legislature and the Democratic Labor Party faction itself are pinned on J. Veselka's return to the Seimas. [Zimnickas] I am for constructive work. There are almost no politics in our Economic Committee; nor does the opposition submit politically biased proposals. We engage in essential discussions and often forget about our party membership. We argue about cardinal matters. I am pleased that we work in this way. I suppose that J. Veselka will also manage to successfully join our work and convey his knowledge and experience for the benefit of Lithuania's economy.
