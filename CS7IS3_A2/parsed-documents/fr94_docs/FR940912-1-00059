FR940912-1-00059 FR940912-1-00013 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Administration for Children and Families 45 CFR PART 1307 RIN 0970&hyph;AB04 Program Performance Standards for Head Start Programs Serving Infants, Toddlers, and Pregnant Women AGENCY: Administration on Children, Youth and Families, Administration for Children and Families, HHS. ACTION: Withdrawal of Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document announces the withdrawal of an NPRM published on June 19, 1990 (55 FR 24899), on Program Performance Standards for Head Start Programs Serving Infants, Toddlers and Pregnant Women. A new NPRM will be published in the near future on the same subject matter in response to recent reauthorization legislation which amended the Head Start Act. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Denice Glover, (202) 205&hyph;8552. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On June 19, 1990, the Administration on Children, Youth and Families published an NPRM (55 FR 24899) requesting comments from the public on proposed requirements governing the operation of Head Start programs serving infants, toddlers and pregnant women. That action was taken to provide standards so that Head Start programs which serve the target population could ensure the provision of quality service. We are hereby withdrawing that NPRM. Recent Head Start reauthorization legislation, included in Public Law 103&hyph;252, the Human Services Amendments of 1994 (enacted, May 18, 1994) amends the Head Start Act to require, among other things, promulgation of new standards for services to infants and toddlers and their families under the Head Start program. Specifically, the Human Services Amendments of 1994 add to the Head Start Act a new section 645A on ``Programs for Families with Infants and Toddlers'', which includes a requirement for the development and publication of standards on the new section by December 30, 1994. In order to comply with this provision in the Act, we must develop new proposed requirements on which the public must have an opportunity to comment. Therefore, it is necessary to withdraw the previous NPRM. (Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program Number 13.600, Project Head Start) Dated: August 4, 1994. Mary Jo Bane, Assistant Secretary for Children and Families. Approved: August 3, 1994. Donna E. Shalala, Secretary.
