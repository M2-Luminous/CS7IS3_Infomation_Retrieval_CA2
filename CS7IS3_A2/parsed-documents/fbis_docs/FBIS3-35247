According to the prime minister, the Syrians have again failed to show even one percent of the goodwill shown by Anwar al-Sadat when he proved he was ready for peace. Speaking to Spanish and Portuguese reporters today before his visit to the Iberian Peninsula next week, the prime minister revealed that Damascus insisted that the Israeli Arab delegation travel without their Israeli passports. [Jerusalem New Channel 2 Television Network in Hebrew at 1800 GMT on 18 February reports that "Our political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen adds that sources in Jerusalem claimed that the initiative for the trip came from the prime minister. Knesset Member 'Abd-al-Wahab Darawshah, the head of the delegation, denied this claim, asserting that the initiative was completely his."]
