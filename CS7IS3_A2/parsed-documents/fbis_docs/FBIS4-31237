But, for six weeks now, the issue continues to be deleted from the agenda. The new statute is the first step in the reforms of the ministry proposed by Minister Andrzej Olechowski. If the government does not adopt a new MSZ statute within two weeks, Minister Andrzej Olechowski could resign in protest, the minister's associates say. The draft of the reform was prepared by Jerzy Kozminski, who has been brought into the MSZ by Olechowski to take the post of secretary of state. Kozminski was regarded as an excellent organizer and was Leszek Balcerowicz's closest aide in 1989-91 and then an adviser to Prime Minister Hanna Suchocka. To Wait Through Kozminski Stage After completing work on the reform, he was nominated Poland's ambassador to the United States and was supposed to leave for Washington as soon as the changes in the ministry took place, and, most importantly, only when an appropriate candidate had been found to replace him as the future secretary general, the second post in the MSZ after the minister. It seems that was precisely one of the reasons for procrastinating with the reform. The Office of the Council of Ministers [URM] decided to "wait through the Kozminski stage"--Kozminski cannot procrastinate too much in his departure for Washington--and only then to begin negotiations concerning the filling of the post. In a desperate defense move, Olechowski decided that Jerzy Kozminski would retain for the moment the post of secretary of state apart from the ambassadorial post (according to diplomatic protocol experts, such things are practiced around the world). Such a solution gives Olechowski plenty of time for coming to an agreement with Prime Minister Pawlak. Apart from Andrzej Wieczorkiewicz, the prime minister's adviser, Kozminski's place could be taken over by Marek Siwiec, who is being promoted by the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]. Siwiec Worse Than Konarski However, according to our information, Pawlak does not like Siwiec's candidacy. Siwiec is politically associated with SLD leader Aleksander Kwasniewski, and he will not be very useful to URM. That is why the prime minister would prefer another SLD member, Sejm Deputy Wlodzimierz Konarski, who, by the way, is supported by part of the SLD leadership and who was mentioned earlier as the SLD's candidate for deputy foreign minister. Konarski, a longstanding diplomat in Jaruzelski's and Rakowski's times, was a representative of the Polish People's Republic [PRL] in the CSCE during the martial law period. Skubiszewski's entry in 1989 ended his diplomatic career. In the Sejm of this term, he is one of the main forces behind the famous subcommission for personnel review in the MSZ, in which he cooperates with Tadeusz Samborski of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] (also a former MSZ man). Samborski is regarded by URM as the person who "incites" Pawlak against the MSZ and Olechowski. Who Will Be Shot Down? The subcommission accuses Skubiszewski of "deprofessionalization" of the foreign service, meaning getting rid of PRL experts of the Konarski kind, and demands that the qualifications of all of the "new" ones be verified. On 25 May, ZYCIE WARSZAWY revealed a letter from Tadeusz Iwinski of the SLD and Tadeusz Samborski of the PSL addressed to the director of the MSZ's personnel department, on behalf of the Sejm subcommission for MSZ personnel issues. The authors of the 13 May letter demand "information on the qualifications, the course of professional career, and the fulfillment of requirements defined in specific provisions concerning diplomatic and consular service" regarding 23 persons, among them two deputy ministers, directors of key departments, and some ambassadors and consuls. Neither Pawlak, who is chief of his party's parliamentary club, nor (which is strange) SLD leader Aleksander Kwasniewski has distanced himself from the list. Thus, it is beginning to function within the MSZ as a list of people whom the coalition wants to "shoot down." This situation causes a feeling of insecurity and danger among the MSZ cadre. There are plenty of forecasts that a "crisis is approaching" and that an exodus of the best diplomats will begin. Every one of them will easily find a job in both Poland and in international institutions for salaries that would be several times higher. Salaries in the MSZ continue to be one of the lowest in the central administration, an official said. In addition, neither the PSL nor the SLD has any personnel reserves whatsoever with whom it could replace the 23 diplomats questioned by the subcommission.
