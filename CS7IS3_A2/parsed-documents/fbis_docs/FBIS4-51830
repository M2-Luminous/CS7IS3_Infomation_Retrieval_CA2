Kenji Miyamoto, chairman of the JCP Central Committee, said, "The Hata cabinet must tap the will of voters since the government has fallen to a minority government." Speaking at the party-sponsored Red Flag Festival, Miyamoto said the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ] quit the coalition after its partners made light of it. JCP Chairman Tetsuzo Fuwa, who also spoke at the event, accused the United States of provoking war against North Korea. Fuwa said, "The U.S. is the world's largest nuclear power. The U.S. is provoking war and punishing another country if it is trying to obtain nuclear arms." He also accused the U.S. of threatening the peace in Asia and rest of the world. Fuwa said Japan must never join the U.S. if it imposes sanctions against North Korea.
