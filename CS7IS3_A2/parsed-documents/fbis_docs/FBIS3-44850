During the two-day meeting, the members of the panel discussed the legal condition for the question of "Taking Hong Kong as a Permanent Residential Place" and the question of Hong Kong residents' freedom in entering and leaving Hong Kong. According to the stipulation of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, non-Chinese persons must meet the following three conditions for their becoming permanent residents in Hong Kong: that is, they must have valid travel visas upon entering Hong Kong, normally they should stay in Hong Kong for seven years or more and they should take Hong Kong as their permanent residence. The members of the panel insisted that there should be objective and subjective requirements for non-Chinese people who will "take Hong Kong as their permanent residence" and the requirements should be clearly defined in some related laws. They held that in principle, non-Chinese people should be permitted to adopt convenient and simple methods to recognize the requirement of "taking Hong Kong as permanent residence." The members of the panel held that the stipulations of the Basic Law on Hong Kong residents' freedom in entering and leaving the region after 1997 are quite broad either in contents or in extent in comparison with the constitutions of some countries. These stipulations should be further publicized so that the Hong Kong residents really understand them, they said. The panel decided to meet again in Beijing from February 28 to March 1.
