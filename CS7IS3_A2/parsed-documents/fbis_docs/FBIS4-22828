Shmyreva, A.G. Nizhnikovskiy, A.V. Potapova, and V.I. Ibatullin; UDC 669.14.018.8:621.791.72] [Abstract] Specimens of 30Kh13 steel measuring 2 mm in thickness were subjected to the following finishing heat treatment used to harden medical tools: hardening in oil from 1,000�C and tempering at 150�C for 1 hour. After this treatment the steel's microstructure consisted of martensite with a uniformly distributed carbide phase. Next the specimens were subjected to pulse laser treatment in an argon atmosphere with a Kvant-16 pulse laser unit (W[.sub]E[/] = 0.5-3.65 J/mm[.sup]2[/]). The focal spot measured 4.0 mm in diameter. Polished microsections made perpendicular to the irradiated surface were used to study the specimens' microstructure on a DRON-2.0 diffractometer. The specimens were also subjected to x-ray phase analysis. Irradiation of the laser-treated specimens at W[.sub]E[/] = 0.5 J/mm[.sup]2[/] did not result in any noticeable change in the appearance of their anode potentiodynamic curves as compared with those of the starting steel. After irradiation at W[.sub]E[/] = 2.5-2.95 J/mm[.sup]2[/], the carbide peak shifted to the left, and after irradiation at W[.sub]E[/] = 3.25-3.50 J/mm[.sup]2[/], the ``classic'' form of anode potentiodynamic curve similar to the ideal curve of _a_-iron was observed. The unevenness of the distribution of the energy of the laser irradiation throughout the area of the focal spot and the superimposition of heat-affected zones on one another (resulting in repeated irradiation of selected sections of the steel surface) had a significant effect on the structure and phase composition of the irradiated surface. In addition, metallographic analysis confirmed the definite electrochemical effect of the dissolution of the carbide phase: After irradiation at W[.sub]E[/] = 3.25 J/mm[.sup]2[/], no carbide phase was detected in the surface layer, and after irradiation at W[.sub]E[/] = 3.65 J/mm[.sup]2[/], the surface was observed to have vitrified (thus indicating that such a laser treatment regimen is unacceptable for treating finished instruments). The biggest increase in hardness of the steel's surface layer (to 800 H) was achieved upon total dissolution of the carbide phase. Analysis of the change in the width of the diffraction peaks recorded for the study specimens indicated that as W[.sub]E[/] increases, the width of B[.sub](110)_a_[/] remains virtually unchanged whereas that of B[.sub](220)_a_[/] increases. This increase in microstresses was hypothesized to be at least partly due to the presence of the chemical inhomogeneity of the solid solution that develops during the process of dissolution of the carbide phase. The studies performed thus established the possibility of controlling the regimens used to treat medical instruments so as to increase their microhardness to 800 H without changing the geometry of their cutting edges.
