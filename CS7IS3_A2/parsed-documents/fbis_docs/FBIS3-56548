According to him, the first deputy premier's decision not to join the reorganized government was not unexpected. "Evidently it's extremely hard, and maybe politically illogical, to be the leader of a parliamentary faction and serve as first deputy prime minister at the same time," Sergeyev said. "The issue of whether Gaydar should be the leader of parliamentary faction or first deputy premier has been raised more than once, and now Gaydar made his choice." Chernomyrdin did nothing to nudge Gaydar toward taking this decision, Sergeyev stressed, because Gaydar was appointed first deputy premier several months ago at Chernomyrdin's initiative. As Sergeyev said, Gaydar's leaving the government will not alter the policy of reforms pursued by the Cabinet led by Chernomyrdin. "The government has been, and will be, reformist. The course of reforms underlies the government's program for 1994- 1995 approved by President Yeltsin," he said. In answer to Interfax's question as to who may replace Gaydar in the government, Sergeyev said with reference to Viktor Chernomyrdin that "this complicated question will be resolved by the president together with the government's leadership".
