FR940721-1-00070 FR940721-1-00014 (a) Comments Critical of the Disclosure Statement. A majority of the commenters expressing dissatisfaction with one or more features of the 1992 final rule's employer payments provisions also objected to the Controlled Business Arrangement Disclosure Statement set out in Appendix D to part 3500. Generally, these objections were twofold. First, commenters argued that even the best and most complete form of disclosure imaginable was not an effective means of coping with what the commenters perceived as anticonsumer aspects of controlled business arrangements. Second, opposition commenters urged that if, against their advice, HUD continued to sanction referral payments by employers to employees, the form of disclosure required should be strengthened substantially, and the timing of the required disclosure should be pinpointed for maximum effect in affording consumers a realistic opportunity to choose alternative settlement service providers. More than 800 comments from lenders and settlement attorneys urged expansion of the controlled business disclosure to assure that borrowers understand that the referral ``will provide a financial benefit to the related parties.'' 4 4 HUD notes that the Appendix D disclosure format already requires: (1) Disclosure of the nature of the relationship between the referring party and the prospective provider of the service, including ownership or other financial interests; (2) estimates of the charges for the service or services; and (3) a statement that the consumer ``may be able to get these services at a lower rate by shopping with other settlement service providers.'' (57 FR 49600, 49622; November 2, 1992.) Perhaps the most comprehensive criticism of the disclosure policy was expressed by the 16 State Attorneys General in their comments. After criticizing both the referral payments provision and the CLO exemption, the Attorneys General said that they were skeptical that disclosures can remedy the inherent dangers to consumers when there are financial incentives for referrals of business. Conceding that the 1983 RESPA amendments expressly permitted controlled business arrangements, the Attorneys General urged that the disclosure contemplated by the regulatory amendment ``be as clear and explicit as possible to alert consumers to the potential for harm.'' The comment advocated that the disclosure form state with greater clarity the purpose for which a disclosure is made and the harm against which it is aimed. Specifically, the State Attorneys General criticized as vague the form's reference to a ``business relationship'' and advocated the inclusion of a statement that, in making the referral to the controlled business, the referring company or agent (to be identified by name) would benefit ``financially or otherwise.'' The State Attorneys General wanted the form to indicate that, in addition to lower rates, consumers might receive ``better services'' by shopping around. ``Indeed, consumers must be affirmatively encouraged to shop around *␣*␣* consumers should be warned in clear, unambiguous language of the pitfalls of relying on a controlled business referral and encouraged to make intelligent choices among settlement service providers.'' Consumers should also be told in explicit terms, the comment continued, that they are ``free to choose [their] own settlement service provider and will not be denied any services or loan for exercising this choice.'' Finally, the State Attorneys General favored disclosure of the ``existence of and amounts of'' any fees or kickbacks paid, directly or indirectly, to the real estate broker or another referring party, or to an affiliated provider, for the performance of settlement services. A large number of individual commenters and the Coalition to Retain Independent Services in Settlements (CRISIS) echoed this position. The CFA disparaged disclosure, by itself, as being an ``inadequate remedy for the market risks that consumers are exposed to in the purchase of real estate'': The Department's rule has placed before the consumer a new array of fees for which the delivery of the equivalent of a tollgate ticket is hardly ample protection. One of the central problems of controlled business arrangements is that the underlying purchase is carried out under conditions of urgency and stress that will always overwhelm a captive consumer. The ability to distinguish between what must be done_and purchased_and what is optional, is limited. The MBA advocated elimination of the employer-employee referral fee exception, but urged that, at least, the disclosure form should be expanded to include the existence and amount of the referral fee. Similar advice was received from Consumers Union and from individual commenters. The FDIC also expressed some doubt about the efficacy of written disclosure, calling the disclosure form ``just one of dozens of confusing papers handed to [consumers] over the course of a real estate transaction.'' FDIC nevertheless advocated strengthening the form by requiring the disclosing entity to meet specific content guidelines and to use layman's language, ``*␣*␣* so less opportunity [is] given for `creative writing'.'' The FDIC also advocated the use of an acknowledgement line or box on the form, to show that the consumer had read and understood the controlled business arrangement disclosure. The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), while expressing concern about employer-employee referral fees and the efficacy of CLO disclosures, commented that the content and timing requirements for controlled business disclosures, as set out in the final rule, seemed adequate to protect consumers. Departing from the recommendations of other commenters to the effect that the disclosure form should be expanded to highlight the presence of referral fees and other relationships between the referrer and the service provider, ALTA's spokesman called the disclosure process ``worthless as a consumer protection measure in the settlement services arena.'' The ALTA claimed that the consumer is likely to rely upon the recommendation of a trusted professional, ``even where a personal financial inducement is disclosed.'' ALTA's spokesman advocated legislative solutions, including amendment of RESPA to permit a competitor's right of action and the institution of blanket prohibitions on controlled businesses.
