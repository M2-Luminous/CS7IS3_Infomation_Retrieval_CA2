These words begin a statement sent to our paper by the Union of Officers of Ukraine [SOU], which has been signed by SOU Chairman Major General Oleksandr Rol. The statement points out that although concerns over strengthening the defense system of our country are voiced in the media, they are not followed up with practical activities. Offshoots of democratic and national traditions are being squandered; the Ukrainian language is being introduced in the Army very slowly. Again, as it was in the former Soviet Army, "officers' meetings" are being reintroduced, which have always served for the reactionary army leadership as an element of pressuring its subordinates. Responsible military leaders want to drag the Ukrainian Armed Forces into the CIS Joint Forces. Dismissals of servicemen who refuse to serve Ukraine and want to go abroad are being stalled. The implementation of a program for national, military-patriotic education of servicemen and youth is being delayed. The SOU, reads the statement, is against the unilateral nuclear disarmament of Ukraine, the transfer of Black Sea Fleet vessels to Russia, the lease of the city of Sevastopol and its onshore infrastructure, and deployment of foreign troops on our country's territory. The SOU considers prolonged delays in payments to contract servicemen and the failure to provide housing for them, which deteriorates their living conditions, as a dangerous action which provokes destabilization in certain military units and generates an unwillingness to serve in the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The statement concludes with an appeal to the Ukrainian president to immediately resolve the social and legal problems of servicemen, which are destabilizing the situation in the Armed forces, and which are a consequence of pressure on our state and its internal affairs.
