FR940318-2-00044 FR940318-2-00035 [Docket No. CP94&hyph;272&hyph;000] Colorado Interstate Gas Company; Application March 14, 1994. Take notice that on March 8, 1994, Colorado Interstate Gas Company (CIG), Post Office Box 1087, Colorado Springs, Colorado 80944 filed an application pursuant to section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act for an order granting permission and approval to abandon by sale to Snyder Oil Corporation (SOCO) certain certificated natural gas facilities known as the Blue Gap Gathering System, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. CIG states that the facilities are located in Carbon County, Wyoming and consist of approximately 13.5 miles of 6-inch and 2.3 miles of 4-inch lines two taps and side valves and a meter station. CIG states that the facilities will be sold at their net book value at the time of the sale. It is stated that the net book value of the facilities on January 31, 1994 was $182,372. CIG states that the Blue Gap Gathering System is remotely located from CIG's other facilities and this, coupled with the system's small size, causes CIG to incur relatively high operating costs. It is stated that most of the volumes flowing through the Blue Gap Gathering System are SOCO volumes and are transported into SOCO's Western Transmission Corporation's system, an interstate pipeline. CIG further states that SOCO has other facilities in the area and for this reason, SOCO is able to operate this system more efficiently than CIG. With regard to the Gas Transportation Agreement between CIG and Sinclair Oil Corporation (Sinclair) which provides for transportation from the Blue Gas Gathering System (CIG's Rate Schedule X&hyph;41), CIG states that it was advised that Sinclair has sold its properties from which it has in the past several years transported gas to CIG under the referenced rate schedule. CIG states that on January 14, 1994 it filed to abandon this service in Docket No. CP94&hyph;186&hyph;000. CIG states that it was advised that Sinclair shall use its existing interruptible agreement (see Docket No. ST94&hyph;412&hyph;000) to transport its gas needs on CIG's transmission system to Sinclair's refineries. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before April 4, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by Sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter finds that permission and approval for the proposed abandonment are required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given. Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for CIG to appear or be represented at the hearing. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
