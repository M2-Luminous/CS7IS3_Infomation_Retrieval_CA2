ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: EPA is conditionally approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

The intended effect of this action is to conditionally approve the Pennsylvania enhanced motor vehicle I/M program. This action is being taken under Section 110 of the Clean Air Act. EFFECTIVE DATE: This rule will become effective on September 30, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of the documents relevant to this action are available for public inspection during normal business hours at the Air, Radiation, and Toxics Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region III, 841 Chestnut Building, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107; and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources, Bureau of Air Quality Control, P.O. Box 8468, 400 Market Street, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania 17105. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mrs. Kelly L. Bunker, (215) 597&hyph;4554. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On June 30, 1994 (59 FR 33709), EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The NPR proposed conditional approval of an enhanced I/M program based upon certain contingencies. The formal SIP revision was submitted by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on November 5, 1993. Specific requirements of the Pennsylvania enhanced I/M program and the rationale for EPA's proposed actions are explained in the NPR and will not be restated here. No adverse public comments were received on the NPR. Final Action EPA is conditionally approving the enhanced I/M program as a revision to the Pennsylvania SIP based on certain contingencies. The conditions for approvability are as follows: (1) By December 31, 1994 a notice must be published in the Pennsylvania Bulletin by the Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PADOT) which certifies that the enhanced I/M program is required in order to comply with federal law, certifies the geographic areas which are subject to the enhanced I/M program (the geographic coverage must be identical to that listed in Appendix A&hyph;1 of the November 5, 1993 SIP submittal), and certifies the commencement date of the enhanced I/M program. This notice must be submitted to EPA as an amendment to the SIP by December 31, 1994; (2) By December 31, 1994 the Commonwealth must submit to EPA as a SIP amendment, the amendments to the Pennsylvania I/M regulation, 67 Pa Code ยง178.202&hyph;205, which require EPA approval prior to implementation of any alternate purge test procedure and incorporate the transient emission standards for Tier 1 vehicles, the Phase 2 standards for all vehicle types and model years, and the transient and evaporative purge test procedures found in the final version of the EPA document entitled ``High-Tech I/M Test Procedures, Emission Standards, Quality Control Requirements, and Equipment Specifications'', EPA&hyph;AA&hyph;EPSD&hyph;IM&hyph;93&hyph;1, April 1994, (3) Within one year from September 30, 1994, the Commonwealth must submit the PADOT procedures manual for motorist compliance enforcement program oversight as an amendment to the SIP and (4) Within one year from September 30, 1994, the Commonwealth must submit the PADOT procedures manual for quality assurance as an amendment to the SIP. The contingencies for approvability are as follows: (1) If penalties are assessed against the contractor under the Contractor Responsibility Program in lieu of the penalties in 67 Pa Code ยง178.602(b) of the Pennsylvania I/M regulation, the penalties must be equal to or more stringent than those in the Commonwealth's I/M regulation and (2) The present contractor or any future contractors for the Pennsylvania I/M program may not have any business interest in a vehicle repair facility anywhere in the continental United States. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. This action makes final the action proposed at 59 FR 33709. As noted elsewhere in this notice, EPA received no adverse public comment on the proposed action. As a direct result, the Regional Administrator has reclassified this action from a Table 1 to a Table 3 under the processing procedures established at 54 FR 2214, January 19, 1989. This action has been classified as a Table 3 action for signature by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from E.O. 12866 review. Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by October 31, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule for the Pennsylvania enhanced I/M SIP revision does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)
