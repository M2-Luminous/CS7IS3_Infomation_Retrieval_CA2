The Palestine Liberation Organization has asked the Republic of Cyprus officially, through diplomatic channels, whether it is possible for the Police Academy to train 500 Palestinian citizens every year as police constables or officers. According to our information, the Ministry of Justice and Public Order is considering the issue but has not given any answer. The Palestinian State will cover in full the cost for the training and maintenance of the Palestinian cadets at the Police Academy. The PLO has also submitted a similar request for the training of policemen to Greece, where there is also a school for police inspectors. The request by foreigners to attend the Cyprus Police Academy proves that the level of the academy's three-year educational and professional training is very high and recognized internationally.
