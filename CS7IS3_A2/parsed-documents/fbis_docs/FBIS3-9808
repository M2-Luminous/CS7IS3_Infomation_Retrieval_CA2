The Ministry believes even a 4- to 5-percent growth possible in 1994, but the experts of the Economic Research Inc. [GKI] only expect 2 to 3 percent at the most. In 1993, industrial output exceeded the 1992 level by 4 percent, the Central Statistical Office's report says. Within this, the output of manufacturing industry increased by 3.3 percent, mining by 1 percent, while 2.2 percent less was produced in electric energy, gas, heating, and water supplies than a year before. Within manufacturing, the output of metallurgy and metal processing increased by 14 percent and the 10.3 percent increase in engineering industry was also significant. Within this, the output of office machines and computers increased by more than two and a half fold and the production of public vehicles increased by about one-third. At the same time, sales did not keep pace with the increased production, they exceeded the 1992 level by 2.9 percent. This mostly came from the growth of domestic sales because exports only increased by 0.2 percent compared to the year before. The exports of textiles, and leather and fur products were exceptions where, mainly as a result of work performed under commission agreements, exports increased by 11.9 percent. The chemical industry also achieved a relatively large export growth with 6.1 percent. At the same time, engineering industry mainly produced for the domestic market. For example, public vehicle production increased its sales by some 87 percent and the sales of light sources and lighting equipment increased one and a half times. As we learned it from various sources, the Industry Ministry expects the continuation of the favorable tendencies of 1993, perhaps as much as a 4 to 5 percent growth. The experts of the Economic Research Inc. predict a somewhat lower growth, namely 2 to 3 percent. They said that this is based on the presumption that those industrial branches that started to grow in 1993 will continue to develop in 1994. On one hand, they are predicting a 6 to 7 percent growth of national invesetments, which means a good market for the enterprises interested in this area. On the other hand, the apparent upswing in Western Europe increases the export possibilities. It is a different matter that the 5 to 6 percent export growth forecast by the government is considered to be excessive by economic researchers. The export possibilities are hampered by the decrease of work performed under commission agreements because the low Ukrainian, Slovak, Romanian, and Polish wages are now strong competitors of the low Hungarian wages. However, forint devaluations can improve the export positions. The GKI expects a 17 percent devaluation throughout the year, some of which has already been implemented. Further devaluations might give an impetus to exports after the elections, however, according to their forecast, all in all, this will only be enough to keep exports on the 1993 level. Therefore, although at different levels in the various branches of industry, industrial output will also continue to grow in 1994.
