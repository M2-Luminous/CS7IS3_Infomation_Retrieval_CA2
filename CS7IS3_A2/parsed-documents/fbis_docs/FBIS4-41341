In the Bashkortostan prime minister's view, the main thing today is to devise a mechanism for putting the agreements into practice. The 10 agreements that deal mostly with economic matters are the result of two years' hard work. The documents cover environmental protection, power-sharing with regard to state-owned property, customs matters, and international and economic relations. From now on the republic will take over control of the activity of the fuel and energy sector on its territory and will form its currency and gold reserves on its own. However, agreements on the budget and relations with the Russian Central Bank have yet to be signed. A group of officials from the Russian Finance Ministry currently visiting Ufa is studying the problem.
