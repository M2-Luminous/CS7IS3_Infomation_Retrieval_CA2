They operate under the slogan "members only." Surprisingly, the use of this slogan has damaged the "self-esteem" of many, leading them to ask themselves the question: "Why am I left out?" As a consequence, "pseudo-aristocrats" of every kind have emerged. As the name implies, a "pseudo-aristocrat" is not a true aristocrat. Rather, he is one who makes a grand entrance in those places frequented by aristocrats. There are, roughly speaking, three kinds of "pseudo-aristocrats." The first kind is known as the "person with contacts." This type is comprised of mainly executive department personnel who use their official duties to inspect management operations and maintain public order as a springboard to gain entry into the establishments frequented by aristocrats. Or course, the managers and owners of the establishments catering to aristocrats cannot treat these people rudely, and so they give them indefinite "entrance passes" which are "tickets" that would otherwise cost several thousand yuan or even over ten thousand yuan to buy. These persons with "contacts" are thereby allowed to fully enjoy the perks of the aristocrat lifestyle. The second kind is known as a "wanna-be." These persons cannot resist the enormous lure of the "aristocrat lifestyle," and the burning desires in their hearts lead them to gather up all of their savings so that they may make loans to aristocrat establishments and thereby enjoy the perks of the same. This type of "pseudo-aristocrat" is the most dangerous. The third kind is known as the "momentarily flush." This kind of person acts in a fairly reasonable manner. When he is flush with money he goes out and "lives it up," and when he is broke he will restrain himself so that he does not get in over his head. This group is made up of poor people who enthusiastically pursue wealth and a quick improvement in lifestyle. Some say that the social phenomenon of the "pseudo-aristocrat" will, like that of drug use, be difficult to reverse once the people get a taste of what they are craving. If drug use is harmful to the physical and mental health of individuals, then "pseudo-aristocracy" is a chronic spiritual disease that is tough to cure. It is not hard to see that the ranks of the "pseudo-aristocrats" continue to swell as people hanker after greater luxury and enjoyment. How ought we regard this phenomenon of the "pseudo-aristocrat?" One executive branch cadre with years of party experience says that the "pseudo-aristocrat" phenomenon certainly does exist among executive branch cadres. Once people take the bait, party status and principles are pushed to the back of their minds. As a result, certain high-class establishments emerge, devoted to such things as illegal activities and sex services, and this happens because law enforcement is lax. This seriously disrupts the socio-economic order and should be a matter of concern for our whole society. A propaganda cadre says passionately that China's public opinion and propaganda organs must take a certain amount of responsibility for the emergence and spread of the "pseudo-aristocrat." In earlier days, the public opinion organs went overboard against things like "big money," "big operators," and "abnormal consumption," while exercising very little tact. As a result, certain weak-willed individuals reacted just the opposite and began joining the ranks of the "pseudo-aristocrats." Conversely, it is clear that not enough propaganda has been done about correct consumption, and in the future, improvements must be made in our guidance of public opinion. Without discussing how "abnormal consumption" momentarily expands the ranks of the aristocrats, we can say that the "pseudo-aristocrat" phenomenon has led certain law enforcement personnel to fail in vigorously enforcing the law, to abandon principles, and even to adopt criminal ways.
