Upon meeting them, Yi In-mo recalled the days right after the liberation of the country when he was making strenuous efforts to rouse people of broad strata to the struggle for democratic reforms including the agrarian reform, upholding the line of nation building set forth by the great leader President Kim Il-song. He said he told his comrades who were with him in South Korea and visitors that his birthday is October 10, the founding anniversary of the Workers' Party of Korea. "I did so," he went on, "not because I forgot my birthday, but because I wanted to celebrate the party founding anniversary together with the people of the homeland, remembering at any time and in any place that I am a member of the Workers' Party of Korea, and always thinking of the party." He said each time the enemy tried to force him to write a "paper of ideological conversion" he tore it to pieces and threw them at their faces, his mind crowded with thought of our general and consciousness of being a party member. Noting that the great leader and the dear leader are the greatest in the world, he asked the party cell secretaries to do a lot of more work, remaining loyal subjects who uphold Comrade Kim Chong-il with unquestioned worship. The visitors vowed to hold President Kim Il-song and Comrade Kim Chong-il in high esteem and follow them, build their party cells well and constantly strengthen and develop them, as Yi In-mo asked them to.
