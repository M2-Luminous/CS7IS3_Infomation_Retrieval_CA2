The three other parties involved are Vietnam's public oil company PetroVietnam, British Gas PLC and TransCanada Pipelines Ltd., the official said. Depending on the result of a feasibility study to be conducted soon, the parties involved in the project will set up a joint concern as early as this year to explore natural gas flowing out of an oil field off the southern Vietnamese coast. The project calls for laying a 130-kilometer pipeline linking the oil field with an LPG plant in Vung Tau, southeast of Ho Chi Minh City. Production is slated to begin in the latter half of 1996 at the earliest, with annual production of some 260,000 tons intended for export to Japan, China and Southeast Asia as well as for use at local power plants, the official added.
