The Land Office for the Protection of the Constitution said that the potential for extreme-right violence is "alarmingly high" in Saxony-Anhalt. Last year, there were 328 violent acts with an extreme-right connection, Interior Minister Walter Remmers (Christian Democratic Union) said when he presented the 1993 report of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution in Magdeburg. The centers of extreme-right activity are above all the big cities of Halle and Magdeburg. According to the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, the violent confrontations between right-wing and left-wing extremists have assumed a new dimension. The threshold for brutal violence has been lowered on both sides. With 70 violent acts against leftists motivated by right-wing extremism in 1993, the number of these offenses has doubled. [passage omitted] Right-wing extremism did not come to the old FRG from the former GDR only after unification. With this opinion, Saxony Interior Minister Heinz Eggert (CDU) contradicted statements to this effect made by Federal Prosecutor General Nehm. It is true that the propensity for violence has increased significantly in the east, "but this is connected with the police's inability to act at this stage," Eggert told DIE WELT. Criminal offenses by the extreme-left (57) in the Free State of Saxony remained constant compared with 1992.
