FRAPH Organization Secretary Emmanuel Constant considers this decision a complement to the international embargo imposed on Haiti. Constant denounces this decision which he labels political thoughtlessness that will have bad consequences on the lives of the middle classes and the urban and rural masses. According to the FRAPH organization secretary, the businessmen, wealthy shopkeepers, have decided to close the country of Dessalines [Haitian liberator]: [Begin recording] Today, the situation is grave because enemies of the nation, businessmen, wealthy shopkeepers have decided to block the evolution of the national majority. In fact, they adopted a unilateral measure. They have decided to shut down the country of Dessalines. What about the poor negroes whose fathers are still in Africa? They will get nothing. FRAPH is asking questions about this stand by the Haitian employers, and demands explanations as to the ambiguity of such behavior and the gravity of its consequences. FRAPH considers this measure a supplement to the international embargo enforced by President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, whereas the businessmen, the mainspring of the Haitian economy, should direct their efforts -- in a joint nationalistic spirit of patriotic concern, with the courageous Haitian people, the vital forces of the country -- to the application of a war economy in order to alleviate the sufferings of the nation. No, gentlemen shopkeepers: Together with the Haitian people, the middle classes, the soldiers, the peasant class, we in FRAPH say no. No, gentlemen shopkeepers: The Haitian people have been misled too often, have been humiliated too often. We must... [changes thought] it is not our responsibility to inflict this on them. FRAPH therefore launches a call for calm among all sectors of the nation, but especially invites the low-wage earners, the small merchants, the worthy elements of the middle class, the lucid elements, the class... [changes thought] the employees of the public administration, and the Haitian people to keep cool. [end recording]
