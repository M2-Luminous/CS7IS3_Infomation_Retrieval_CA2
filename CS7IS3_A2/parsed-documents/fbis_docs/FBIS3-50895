FBIS3-50895 "drlat006_c_94020" FBIS-LAT-94-006 Document Type:Daily Report 10 Jan 1994 MEXICO Chiapas Crisis Official Cites Identity of Rebel Leaders PA0801165794 Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 1300 GMT 8 Jan 94 PA0801165794 Mexico City XEW Television Network Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [Report by Saul Sanchez; from the "Upon Awakening" newscast; passages within quotation marks recorded] [Text] Socorro Diaz Palacios, deputy government secretary, stated yesterday the government has information on the identity of the individuals leading the armed group operating in Chiapas State. [Diaz] "Concerning the Mexicans, some are activists connected to guerrilla groups dismantled in the 1970's." Commenting on leaders who are foreigners, she said they may have gotten experience on guerrilla warfare in countries south of Mexico. Diaz said the capture of individuals who come from that region and their level of training lead to that suggestion, saying that a Nicaraguan and, apparently, a Guatemalan are under arrest. [Diaz] "The aggressor armed group has received the support of certain ideologues and clergymen from different denominations that act on their own. They have organized cadres and the interiors of their villages, allowing them to go from convincing rural residents to recruiting and training them subsequently in subversive and terrorist practices." Diaz reported that summoning orders are being issued for people allegedly tied to these criminal activities. She added that the armed group has 15 training centers; six of them are located in Las Margaritas, five in Ocosingo, two in Sabanilla, one in Altamirano, and one in Chanal. [Diaz] "They have regulations and internal discipline, as well as different instruction handbooks covering the use of weapons, planning of attacks, combat strategies, security and communications systems, and disciplinary measures. Procup [Revolutionary Workers Clandestine People's Union Party] literature was found in their camps, which they support by distributing its publications." The rebels accompany their methods to recruit personnel with threats to the effect that they will take away properties or expel from the community those who are reluctant to join criminal activities. The official said there were instances in which children were kidnapped to induce their parents to join the guerrillas. [Diaz] "Co-opted or pressured groups devote their efforts to the building of training centers. These families prepare food to meet the needs of this radical and violent group." She added that, based on the information that exists, it is believed there are three kinds of operation bases. [Diaz] "They are located in inaccessible terrain, hidden by foliage. Reaching those sites requires walking three or four hours on partly exposed paths in areas densely vegetated." Militants have been strategically deployed to penetrate all of southern Chiapas. When they take control over a region, municipal, productive, and educational activities are neglected. [Diaz] "The so-called militia or militant squads operate as a paramilitary apparatus. Each squad consists of one sergeant, one corporal, one radio operator, one health provider, and 20 militants." These rebels possess .22-caliber rifles, 5.56-mm AR-15 rifles, .30-caliber M-1 carbines, and different kinds of shotguns, pistols, and revolvers. These weapons are manufactured in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Russia, and especially used by guerrilla units. Diaz said they are operating with sophisticated radio communications equipments. [Diaz] "Their radio communications equipment has between 23 to 40 transceiver channels, and they operate from 2400 to 0600." The official said it has been possible to detect part of their key code and record transmissions. [Diaz] "The transmissions base station from the subversive general garrison goes by the identification code name of Cicara, which apparently stands for the so-called El Caracol Instruction Center [Centro de Instruccion El Caracol], located in the town by that same name of Las Margaritas." The deputy government secretary said although social demands have been met, the subversive groups' operations have increased, adding that last year on three occasions Mexican authorities learned that aggressor groups were preparing violent actions. She acknowledged that authorities acted with unusual calm and flexibility. Diaz read a 28-page report prepared with information supplied by the National Defense Secretariat and the Attorney General's Office. [Diaz] "The so-called Zapatist National Liberation Army is an extremist, violent, professional, and well-trained organization; its profile is highly ideological and uses a language that is characteristic of extremist guidelines."
