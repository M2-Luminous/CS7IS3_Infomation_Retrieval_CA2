The source states that this legalization is in line with the provisions of the new Mauritanian constitution which recognizes labor union pluralism. The source adds that the recognition has occurred after more than a year of legal battles. The CGTM is based on the unique labor union movement that has existed in the country since its independence, that is, the government-backed Mauritania Labor Union. The leaders of the new labor union movement are mainly close to the opposition. They are suggesting immediately undertaking a large-scale campaign to install their sections in all the country's socioeconomic and administrative sectors.
