The rise in temperature due to a discharge to Class SB waters shall not exceed 1.5 ○F (0.8 ○C) during the summer months (July through September) nor 4 ○F (2.2 ○C) during the winter months (October through June); and natural seasonal and daily variations shall be maintained 314 CMR 4.05(4)(b)2. f. This permit prohibits the addition of any water treatment chemical for any purpose to the non-contact cooling water system. g. There shall be no discharge of floating solids or visible foam in other than trace amounts. h. Samples taken in compliance with the monitoring requirements specified above shall be taken at the point of discharge. i. The pH of the effluent for discharges to Class A and Class B waters shall be in the range of 6.5&hyph;8.3 standard units and not more than 0.5 units outside of the background range. There shall be no change from background conditions that would impair any uses assigned to the receiving water Class. j. The pH of the effluent for discharges to Class SA and Class SB waters shall be in the range of 6.5&hyph;8.5 standard units and not more than 0.2 units outside of the normally occurring range. There shall be no change from background conditions that would impair any uses assigned to the receiving water Class. k. One chronic (and modified acute) toxicity test shall be performed on the non-contact cooling water discharge by the permittee upon request by EPA and/or MADEP. Testing shall be performed in accordance with EPA toxicity protocol to be provided at the time of the request. The test shall be performed on a 24-hour composite sample to be taken during normal facility operation. The results of the test (C&hyph;NOEC and LC 50 ) shall be forwarded to State and EPA within 30 days after completion. The test methods to follow are those recommended by EPA for the particular discharge in: Weber, C. I. et al., 1989.
