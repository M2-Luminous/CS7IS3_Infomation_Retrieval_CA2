A refusal from the government would prompt the holding of "much tougher" actions in June, the secretaries general of the metalworkers, Manuel Fernandez "Lito" and Ignacio Fernandez Toxo, said yesterday. In order to secure negotiations on industrial policy, the trade unions have drawn up a strategy for exerting pressure that will begin 17 May with a large rally in Madrid, which they forecast will be attended by 10,000 trade union delegates from all over Spain. At the same time they will draw up a document setting out what form industrial policy should take, which will be presented to trade union officials at the rally and which will subsequently be submitted to Industry Minister Juan Manuel Eguiagaray. Warnings If, after these two actions, the government does not pledge to conduct negotiations on the future of industry, the major trade unions will organize "much tougher" actions in June, the secretaries general of the UGT and CCOO metalworkers, Manuel Fernandez "Lito" and Ignacio Fernandez Toxo, announced yesterday.
