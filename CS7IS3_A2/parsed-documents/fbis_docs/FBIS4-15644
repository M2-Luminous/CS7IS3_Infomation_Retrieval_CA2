During a coffee-break he beat up lawmaker Vladimir Borzyuk who, earlier this week, had quit Zhirinovskiy's faction in protest against his extremist policies. Alla Gerber of Russia's Choice told TASS she saw "Zhirinovskiy striking Borzyuk's head against the wall." Then, according to the eyewitness, Vladimir Volfovich turned his anger against a passing journalist, seized his tape-recorder and broke the journalist's glasses. The Russia's Choice faction proposed to set up a special commission to investigate the incident, but the Duma turned the proposal down, saying the case was within the competence of the Duma's procedural committee. Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin told reporters he would file public prosecutor a report on the incident by Zhirinovskiy's victim, journalist Andrey Pyatkovskiy of the "STOLITSA" magazine.
