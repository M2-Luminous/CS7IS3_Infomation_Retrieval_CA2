"We share France's view that an agreement must be reached with the Serbs," Granic said after a meeting with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe. Croats will suggest "the Serbs join this federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina on the same conditions which have been accepted by the other two parties (Croats and Moslems), and the negotiations which are going to start" in the wake of the federation agreement signed Tuesday in Washington. However Croatia would seek "the support of France and the European Union to get back" land captured by Serbs in Croatia, he said. "Of course we want to normalize relations with Belgrade, but this can only be done with reintegration, through peaceful means, of (Serb-) occupied territories in Croatia, as is provided for in the plan signed in Washington." Granic also said he "agreed the humanitarian situation should improve as quickly as possible" in Bosnia. Humanitarian convoys must be allowed to travel unhindered through central Bosnia and "all prisoners" of war should be freed. Juppe for his part said France believed "there could be no stable settlement unless the Serb community were associated" with the federation agreement. He stressed the "situation on the ground must improve" and noted the "air network" set up by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the United Nations to discourage renewed hostilities remained "in effect." Juppe said a "global settlement" of the almost two-year-old Bosnian conflict meant "active participation by the Americans, Russians, and Europeans" and that the European Union "will participate in the region's reconstruction" once peace has returned.
