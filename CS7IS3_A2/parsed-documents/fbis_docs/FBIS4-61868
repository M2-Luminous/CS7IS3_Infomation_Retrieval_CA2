At today's Duma plenary session, Sergey Baburin proposed adding to the agenda Ivan Rybkin's performance as chairman, but he failed to attract the necessary number of votes. In a brief speech from the floor, Sergey Baburin told his fellow deputies that the Duma chairman's act of signing the Treaty on Social Accord represents a distortion of the chamber's opinion.
