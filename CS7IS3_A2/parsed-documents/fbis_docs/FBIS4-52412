According to the information, the Kim Yong-sam group sent combat police to a rally of workers observing May Day to block up streets and square. They also kicked up a row of search for the leading forces after the rally and arrested scores of people in a few days. "This suppression followed the instructions of traitor Kim Yong-sam, who said he would make this year `a year with no dispute between labour and management', to take a `strong counteraction' by `law' against the workers' strikes, legal or illegal, small or big," the information notes, and goes on: The Kim Yong-sam group's clamour for "building of a society for workers in a sweat" or "triunity" is a sheer deceptive propaganda. South Korean workers, expecting nothing from the Kim Yong-sam "government", should more vigorously turn out in the struggle against the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime to retake the right to existence and establish a true democratic government, strengthening regional and sectional relations, firmly united around an independent, democratic trade union.
