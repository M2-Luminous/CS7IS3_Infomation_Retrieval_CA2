Virgil Magureanu, director of SRI, has ordered a full investigation of the activity of Major General Gheorghe Diaconescu. Sources from the SRI leadership have told us that the cause that led to the demotion of the counterespionage division head is "a complicated one." Despite the fact that one of the rumors that are circulating claimed that Major General Diaconescu had been placed under arrest, our own investigations have proved that this was a false report.
