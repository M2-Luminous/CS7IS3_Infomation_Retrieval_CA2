FR940721-0-00051 FR940721-0-00014 Section 210 expressly states that carline determinations are to be made based on degree of commonality in construction. Basing carline determinations on country of assembly would be a very different method for making carline determinations, and one that is inconsistent with the method specified in the statute. Moreover, NHTSA disagrees with those commenters which argued that carline determinations which exclude considerations of country of assembly are inconsistent with the purpose of the Labeling Act. First, the concept of ``carline'' is well understood by Congress, given its use in the CAFE program. Since Congress decided to use this well-known concept as the basis for making vehicle groupings under the Labeling Act, it is reasonable to assume that the concept is consistent with the purpose of Congress. The agency observes that while many foreign vehicle manufacturers argued that basing carline determinations solely on commonality of construction is inconsistent with the purpose of Congress, this view was not shared by GM, Ford, Chrysler, or the UAW. The agency specifically rejects Toyota's argument that the treatment of carline under CAFE is irrelevant to Labeling Act issues. Since Congress decided to adopt the same concept and definition for grouping vehicles as used in CAFE, the treatment under CAFE is highly relevant. The agency notes that Toyota's objection and the objections of many of the foreign vehicle manufacturers are ultimately with the statute rather than the agency's proposed regulations. Toyota suggests that ``(i)t may be appropriate under CAFE to average fuel economy data, because fuel economy of a carline is determined by vehicle design,'' but argues that ``(t)he opposite is the case for sourcing patterns, which typically differ greatly by country of manufacture.'' However, the Labeling Act expressly requires carline determinations to be determined based on ``commonality of construction,'' i.e., vehicle design. Second, the mere fact that the exclusion of country of assembly from carline determinations can result in overstated domestic content on imported vehicles and an understated one on domestically produced vehicles does not mean that the results are misleading. Any approach in which U.S./Canadian parts content is determined based on groups of vehicles will result in situations where the content is overstated or understated for individual vehicles within the group. However, prospective purchasers will know the U.S./Canadian parts content for the group as a whole. For example, if a particular make/model is assembled in both the U.S./Canada and another country, consumers will know the average U.S./Canadian content for that make/model. The agency believes that this is relevant information for consumers which wish to buy a vehicle made in the U.S. or Canada. Moreover, the carline information is not the only information that Congress decided to require on the label. Consumers will also know where the individual vehicle is assembled, and the countries of origin of the engine and transmission for that individual vehicle. NHTSA disagrees with several of the statutory arguments made by commenters favoring determination of carlines based on country of assembly. As discussed above, Toyota argued that section 210(b)(1)(A)'s requirement that the label indicate the percentage U.S./Canadian equipment ``installed on such vehicle within a carline'' amounts to a requirement that the carline percentage must ``approximate the level of content'' on each individual vehicle. However, the quoted language of section 210(b)(1)(A) simply means that the percentage to be provided on the label is for the carline of which the individual vehicle is a part, as is made clear by section 210(b). There is no basis to read section 210(b)(1)(A) as requiring the percentage to apply to both the individual vehicle and the carline. If content is determined for a group of vehicles, it necessarily follows that the content of each individual vehicle may vary from that of the group as a whole. The agency also disagrees with BMW's argument that the statutory definition of carline is merely intended to define the largest grouping by which a manufacturer is permitted to divide its vehicles but not preclude further divisions in making carline determinations. NHTSA notes that in addition to specifying ``commonality in construction'' as the basis for making carline determinations, the section 210 definition provides that even some attributes that are part of ``commonality in construction,'' e.g., level of decor, are not to be considered in making carline determinations. Moreover, manufacturers are not permitted to make unlimited divisions for purposes of CAFE. NHTSA also disagrees with BMW's suggestion that the agency should essentially permit manufacturers to interpret the term ``carline'' in any way they choose. In addition to being concerned that the implementing regulations ensure results that are consistent with the statutory requirements, NHTSA also believes it is important that consumers be provided with information that is consistent among manufacturers. It would be very confusing to consumers if they were provided with content information determined on a carline basis by each manufacturer, but the meaning of ``carline'' varied substantially among manufacturers. While NHTSA has concluded, for the reasons stated above, that carline determinations may not be based on country of assembly, it recognizes that additional subdivision of carlines by country of manufacture would result in content labeling information that is more representative of the individually labeled vehicles. NHTSA does not believe it would be appropriate to permit unlimited additional information to be provided on the label, since such additional information could result in an ``overload'' to consumers and dilute the impact of the required information. However, given the potential significance of the impact that assembly of a carline in both the U.S./Canada and other countries may have on the representativeness of the carline information provided on the label, NHTSA has decided to permit, but not require, the following additional statement to be provided on the label: This carline is assembled in the U.S. and/or Canada, and in [insert name of each other country]. The U.S./Canadian parts content for the portion of the carline assembled in [insert name of country, treating the U.S. and Canada together, i.e., U.S./Canada] is [ XX ]%. The agency is specifying specific language for the optional information to ensure that it is both brief and easily understood, as well as to maintain consistency among manufacturers. If a manufacturer chooses to provide this optional information, the information must be provided at the end of the label, as part of the explanatory note. Moreover, if the additional information is provided for some vehicles within a carline, it must be provided for all vehicles within the carline. Otherwise, a manufacturer might provide the additional information only for the portion of the carline which has higher U.S./Canadian parts content. NHTSA believes that permitting but not requiring manufacturers to provide this additional information is appropriate in light of the statutory requirement that the implementing regulation ``provide to the ultimate purchaser the best and most understandable information possible about the foreign and U.S./Canada origin of the equipment of such vehicles without imposing costly and unnecessary burdens on the manufacturers.'' The agency believes that the usefulness of the additional information to consumers is not of a level that justifies requiring it, but is sufficiently useful that manufacturers should be permitted to provide it if they so choose.
