FR940505-0-00028 FR940505-0-00006 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;ANE&hyph;80; Amendment 39&hyph;8897; AD 94&hyph;09&hyph;08] Airworthiness Directives; Allied-Signal Inc., Garrett Engine Division, TPE331 Series Turboprop and Model TSE331&hyph;3U Turboshaft Engines AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule, request for comments. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Allied-Signal Inc., Garrett Engine Division, TPE331 series turboprop and Model TSE331&hyph;3U turboshaft engines. This action requires inspection of certain third stage turbine stator assemblies, and replacement, if necessary, with serviceable assemblies. This amendment is prompted by reports of six third stage turbine stator assemblies assembled with inner seal supports made of incorrect material that results in a significantly reduced cyclic life. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent an uncontained failure of the third stage turbine wheel. DATES: May 20, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of May 20, 1994. Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before July 5, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), New England Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;ANE&hyph;80, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299. The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from AlliedSignal, Inc., Aviation Services Division, Data Distribution Dept. 64&hyph;3/2102&hyph;IM, P.O. Box 29003, Phoenix, AZ 85038&hyph;9003. This information may be examined at the FAA, New England Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Burlington, MA; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Joseph Costa, Aerospace Engineer, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 3229 East Spring Street, Long Beach, CA 90806&hyph;2425; telephone (310) 988&hyph;5246, fax (310) 988&hyph;5210. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has received reports of six third stage turbine stator assemblies assembled with inner seal supports made of incorrect material that significantly reduces the cyclic life of the assembly. The manufacturer has identified part serial numbers of 150 third stage turbine stator assemblies that may contain the inner seal supports made of Hastelloy S material. These assemblies were repaired at the Garrett General Aviation Service Division (GGASD) facility in Phoenix, Arizona between November 1988 and May 1991. Fatigue failure of the inner seal support has resulted in the seal support moving aft and contacting the third stage turbine wheel. This condition, if not corrected, can result in an uncontained failure of the third stage turbine wheel. The FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of AlliedSignal Aerospace Alert Service Bulletin (ASB) No. TPE331&hyph;A72&hyph;0906, dated October 15, 1993, that describes procedures for inspecting the third stage turbine stator assemblies, and replacing, if necessary, with serviceable assemblies. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other engines of this same type design, this AD is being issued to prevent an uncontained failure of the third stage turbine wheel. This AD requires inspection of third stage turbine stator assemblies to determine the acceptability of the inner seal supports, and replacement, if necessary, with serviceable assemblies. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days. Comments Invited Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption ADDRESSES . All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would be needed.
