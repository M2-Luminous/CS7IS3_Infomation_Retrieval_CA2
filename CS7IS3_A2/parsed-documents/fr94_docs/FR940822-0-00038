FR940822-0-00038 FR940822-0-00012 40 CFR Part 372 [OPPTS&hyph;400088; FRL&hyph;4904&hyph;6] Hydrogen Sulfide; Methyl Mercaptan; Toxic Chemicals Release Reporting; Community Right-to-Know; Stay of Reporting Requirements AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Administrative stay. SUMMARY: EPA is today announcing an Administrative Stay of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know (EPCRA) section 313 toxic chemical release reporting requirements for hydrogen sulfide (CAS No. 7783&hyph;06&hyph;4) and methyl mercaptan (CAS No. 74&hyph;93&hyph;1). These two chemicals were added to the 40 CFR part 372 Subpart D list of toxic chemicals in a final rule published in the Federal Register of December 1, 1993. The effect of this stay is to defer reporting on these two chemicals while the Agency reviews new data and information made available subsequent to the promulgation of the final rule. The Agency will make this information available for public comment, in a forthcoming Federal Register notice and will also at that time seek public comment on whether the Agency should propose to delete one or both of these chemicals from the EPCRA section 313 list of toxic chemicals. After evaluating the information and public comments the Agency will either propose to delete one or both of these chemicals or will reaffirm its original findings and dissolve this Administrative Stay. Today's action has no effect on any aspect of EPCRA section 313 toxic chemical release reporting other than hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 22, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT : Maria J. Doa, Project Manager, 202&hyph;260&hyph;9592, for specific information on this action.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Introduction Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986, 42 U.S.C. 11023 (EPCRA) requires certain facilities manufacturing, processing, or otherwise using listed toxic chemicals to report their environmental releases of such chemicals annually. Beginning with the 1991 reporting year, such facilities also must report pollution prevention and recycling data for such chemicals, pursuant to section 6607 of the Pollution Prevention Act (42 U.S.C. 13106). Section 313 established an initial list of toxic chemicals that was comprised of more than 300 chemicals and 20 chemical categories. Section 313(d) authorizes EPA to add or delete chemicals from the list, and sets forth criteria for these actions. Under section 313(e), any person may petition EPA to add chemicals to or delete chemicals from the list. EPA has added and deleted chemicals from the original statutory list. II. Background In the Federal Register of December 1, 1993 (58 FR 63500), the Agency published a final rule adding 21 chemicals and 2 chemical categories to the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) section 313 list of toxic chemicals. The December 1993 Federal Register document was a result of a petition submitted to the Agency by the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Governor of New York. The petition asked the Agency to add 80 chemicals and 2 chemical categories to the EPCRA section 313 list of toxic chemicals. EPA proposed to grant this petition in part in a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) published in the Federal Register of September 8, 1992 (57 FR 41020). In the final rule, EPA added to the EPCRA section 313 list of toxic chemicals 21 chemicals and 2 chemical categories. Included among the 21 chemicals and 2 chemical categories in the December 1993 final rule were hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan. The Agency found that hydrogen sulfide met the section 313(d)(2)(B) criteria for cancer or other chronic human toxicity and the section 313(d)(2)(C) criteria for environmental toxicity. EPA found that methyl mercaptan met the section 313(d)(2)(B) criteria for cancer or other chronic human toxicity. III. Basis for Administrative Stay A. Overview Since the promulgation of the final rule adding hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan to the list of toxic chemicals, additional information concerning these chemicals has been brought to the Agency's attention. The Agency has also learned that some members of the regulated community are concerned that the basis for the Agency's final action on these chemicals was inadequately described in the rulemaking record. Furthermore, these members of the regulated community have charged that the Agency violated various requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act in promulgating the final listings of hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan. These issues are summarized below. The Agency feels that it is important and appropriate to administratively stay the effectiveness of the listing of these two chemicals while giving the public an opportunity to comment on these issues and the additional information, as well as to comment on whether the Agency's initial determination that both hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan satisfy the section 313(d) criteria for addition to the list of toxic chemicals. To that end, in conjunction with this Administrative Stay, the Agency will be issuing a forthcoming Federal Register notice which will seek comment on the Agency's initial determination for these two chemicals, the additional information which has been brought to the Agency's attention, procedural issues concerning the initial final rule, and generally, comments (and any supporting data) on whether the Agency should either propose to delete one or both of the chemicals or affirm its initial determination and dissolve today's Administrative Stay. Under the final rule, reporting for hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan are required beginning with activities during the 1994 calendar year, with the first reports due on July 1, 1995. Because of the controversy surrounding the listing of these two chemicals and the decision to issue this Administrative Stay, EPA finds it unnecessary and inappropriate to subject facilities, some of whom may be subject to section 313 reporting for the first time because of the listing of hydrogen sulfide or methyl mercaptan, to the burden of collecting release information and preparing to file Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) Form R reports for the 1994 reporting year. Therefore, pending a decision by the Agency of whether to propose to delete one or both of the chemicals or to affirm its final rule determination, the effectiveness of the listing of these two chemicals on the list of toxic chemicals is administratively stayed. EPA's decision will be made promptly after consideration of public comment submitted on the pending Federal Register notice. B. Substantive and Procedural Issues Surrounding Final EPCRA Section 313 Listing Although the Agency will soon be issuing a separate Federal Register notice and seeking public comment, the following is a brief summary of the issues and new information related to hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan which support this Administrative Stay. In addition, a brief discussion of the use of exposure analysis under section 313 listing determinations also follows. This is another issue the Agency will be presenting in the upcoming Federal Register notice. 1. Hydrogen sulfide . Concern has been expressed that the Agency shifted its basis for adding hydrogen sulfide to the EPCRA section 313 list between the NPRM and the final rule. EPA proposed to list hydrogen sulfide because it exhibited chronic human toxic effects, specifically citing respiratory effects. In the final rule, the Agency agreed with commenters who argued that some of the respiratory effects cited in the proposal (inflammation, edema, cellular necrosis, hyperplasia, and exfoliation) were better characterized as acute effects than as chronic effects. The Agency nonetheless listed hydrogen sulfide for chronic effects because the observed neurotoxic effects, such as insomnia, anxiety, perceptual ability and cognitive impairments were chronic in nature. Although the statutory basis for the determination did not change, the Agency cited chronic neurotoxic effects in the final rule and chronic respiratory effects in the NPRM. EPA recognizes that, although its ultimate finding remained unchanged in the final rule, interested parties may disagree with the Agency's position that the information on neurotoxicity supports a finding under section 313(d)(2)(B). EPA believes good cause exists to issue this Administrative Stay to allow parties time to prepare and submit comment and information on this point. As noted earlier, the pending Federal Register notice will provide the mechanism for submitting any comments and relevant information. 2. Methyl mercaptan . As with hydrogen sulfide, concerns have been raised about the basis for listing methyl mercaptan as discussed in the NPRM and in the final rule. EPA proposed to list methyl mercaptan because scientific evidence showed that it exhibited chronic human toxicity effects, specifically citing neurotoxicity. The Agency affirmed this finding in the final rule. Since the publication of the final rule, however, it has come to the Agency's attention that one of the scientific sources relied upon by the Agency in making this determination may have been inaccurately or incompletely summarized from the original source. In reviewing the available information for methyl mercaptan, EPA relied on Sandmeyer, ``Organic Sulfur Compounds,'' in Patty's Industrial Hygiene and Toxicology handbook, a common chemical reference work (Ref. 2). Sandmeyer, in turn, appears to have relied on another work by Kvartovkina and Moerson, (Ref. 1), a 1974 work published in Russian. When translated (a translation of the article will be provided as part of the record for the forthcoming Federal Register notice), there are a number of additional factors and limitations which may diminish the usefulness of this study for purposes of EPCRA section 313 listing determinations. For example, the findings in the original study were made, collectively, for a number of chemicals, one of which was methyl mercaptan. These potential translation and summary problems were not presented to EPA during the public comment period, nor was the Agency independently aware of the original Russian source. Given the Agency's longstanding intent to base its decisions on sound science and the potential problems posed by the above information, EPA believes good cause exists to issue this Administrative Stay to allow parties time to review the full information and prepare and submit comment on this point through the pending Federal Register notice. 3. Analysis of exposure to hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan . Several representatives of the regulated community have expressed concern that, in listing hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan, EPA was unclear in its application of the statutory criteria. Among other things, charges have been made that EPA's decision not to include evidence of exposure in deciding to list hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan on the basis of chronic human toxicity was inconsistent with past Agency practice. These charges raise important and potentially far reaching issues of the Agency's interpretation of its mandate under the statute. EPA does not agree that it has inconsistently approached the issue of the use of exposure analysis in EPCRA section 313 listings. However, many members of the regulated community have expressed dissatisfaction, alleging that the Agency has neither consistently or correctly addressed the issue of exposure. The Agency believes that a consistent approach to the EPCRA section 313 listing process is both necessary and important and that, given the charges of inconsistency with respect to exposure analysis, the public deserves an opportunity to be presented with further clarification of the Agency's position on this critical issue. A more complete discussion of this issue will be provided in the pending Federal Register notice. 4. Legal authority . As described above, the Agency believes that this Administrative Stay is appropriate and in the interests of justice, given the allegations of procedural and substantive deficiencies surrounding the Agency's listing of these two chemicals, and the resulting controversy and confusion in the regulated community. Although the Agency does not regard today's action as a rule, were it to be viewed as a rule, the Agency believes that there is good cause for issuing it without prior notice and opportunity for comment and for making it immediately effective. Under section 313(a), facilities face a current and ongoing obligation to collect information about releases of hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan. Such activities are potentially quite burdensome, particularly for any facility made subject to section 313 reporting requirements for the first time because of the listing of these two chemicals. Until such time as the issues described in this document are resolved, EPA believes that today's Administrative Stay is necessary. As stated above, EPA will be issuing a notice in the Federal Register to begin addressing these issues and will move with dispatch toward final resolution of the status of these two chemicals. In addition, this Administrative Stay is authorized by 5 U.S.C. section 705, which provides that an agency may postpone the effective date of action taken by it when justice so requires, pending judicial review. No petition for review has been formally filed as of this date with respect to the listing of hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan. However, both the Chemical Manufacturers Association and the American Forest and Paper Association have told the Agency that unless administrative action is taken to resolve the issues outlined in today's document, a prompt legal challenge will be brought. These two organizations represent the interests of a large portion of the facilities subject to section 313, including those affected by the listing of hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan. The Agency believes that rather than going through costly and potentially protracted litigation, an Administrative Stay coupled with a Federal Register notice and opportunity to comment is both consistent with the goal of the TRI program to involve the public in the resolution of important issues and clearly in the interests of justice.
