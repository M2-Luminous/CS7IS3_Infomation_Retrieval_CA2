The chairman of the Independent Smallholders Party [FKGP] is sure that his party will be one of the winners in the elections. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Four years ago, the still united FKGP received 11.7 percent of the votes. Listening to your speeches, it seems that you are almost certain that the party will far exceed this figure this time. [Torgyan] You must know that you are talking to the possible winner of the elections. Despite the situation of immense discrimination against us and despite the fact that we are under constant fire and that, near the pseudo-opposition that signed a pact, we were the only real opposition party in Hungary, we not only revived our party but also won over considerable masses of people, and this clearly proves that the FKGP is one of the potential winners of the elections. I think the Hungarian people are sober and careful enough to be able to understand why there is a deliberate silence about Jozsef Torgyan and the FKGP. The government achieves exactly the opposite effect: It is possible that, with this attitude, [Prime Minister] Peter Boross helps us win a tremendous victory and, in case we win, I will publicly thank him for this in a very polite manner. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Does your party's division hinder the achievement of such results? [Torgyan] Some 99.9 percent of our members support us. We have never made it a secret that the gates are open and we welcome any group of any name, no matter what they call themselves: democratic smallholders, conservative smallholders, national-oriented, or not national; we welcome the members, but God save us from the betraying leaders! A party whose chairman is only busy with cursing Jozsef Torgyan! I do not think that this would be an adequate program in the elections. It is clear that the current government created and maintains the United Smallhodlers' Party, and it is no accident that, behind their backs, people call them the party of ministerial armchairs. This party will end up on history's garbage dump after 8 May, and no one will have to deal with these issues ever again. We have ceased to deal with these issues for quite a while. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Your personality will surely bring many votes for the FGKP in a certain circle, but is there a real program behind the declared promises, a program that can be implemented? [Torgyan] We are the only party that clearly stipulated in its program that in case of an election victory, we will carry out radical changes in all walks of life. It is worth pointing out, and we do not keep it a secret either, that in case we become part of the government, we will discard the Budapest-centered political activity and will replace it with a village-centered policy. We will create a top agricultural ministry to revive the Hungarian agriculture, and we will subordinate all the other sectors to this, including the foreign affairs. Basically, it is possible to restore the agricultural sector in two years. This is a full program that differs from every other party's program. We would also apply totally different solutions in legal matters, constitutional issues, the state apparatus, privatization, unemployment, and the national debt. National renewal requires a selfless leadership ready for sacrifices, and one accepted by the population. We stress that if someone gets a public function, he should not try to fill his own pockets; instead, he should fill the pockets of the voters he represents. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] The FKGP has never named the desirable coalition partners. It is also true that, with the exception of the Hungarian Justice and Life Party and the Market Party, all the parliamentary parties distance themselves from the FKGP led by Jozsef Torgyan. [Torgyan] I am not willing to cooperate with certain types of leaders. People who have ignored and disregarded constitutional methods so far, would be ready to do the same anytime. Although people did not pay enough attention, I always said that a party is one thing, and its leadership is another thing. I am not sure that the parliamentary parties which you are taking into account now will have the same leadership after the elections. On the other hand, I start from the premise that a victor always finds friends. The question is whether the victor can calmly select. We want and will be able to select. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] If things turn out that way, under what conditions would you accept the position of prime minister? [Torgyan] I am a professional person who is absolutely aware that it is impossible to keep waiting for new parliamentary cycles to have a talented leader at long last. Nor can one wait until an untalented leader becomes somebody. On the other hand, one should examine the possibility of creating a social cooperation in which the whole population supports the prime minister, because it is impossible to get out of the current catastrophic situation in any other way. If the conditions for this cannot be created, one must not accept the position.
