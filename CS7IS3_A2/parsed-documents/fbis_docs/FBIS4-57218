The Senate takes note of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's obstinate refusal to carry out his constitutional obligations. Consequently, the Senate takes note of his resignation, declares a presidential vacuum, and revokes the 15 June 1993 decree. Article 2. In compliance with Article 149 of the Constitution, the president of the Court of Cassation is endowed with the powers of provisional president of the Republic. Article 3.
