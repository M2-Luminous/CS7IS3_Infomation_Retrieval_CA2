Nobody has the right to stipulate that the three-tier councils can transit beyond 1997. The nullification of the relevant laws will be announced by the National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee in the future. This is a policy of the Chinese Government. In response to Chris Patten's remark that the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office's earlier statement ran counter to the Basic Law, Lu Ping said today: This is the policy of the Chinese Government because, although the district boards and the two municipal councils are not organs of power, they are a component part of the Hong Kong political structure. Therefore, the laws on the term of the three- tier structure, if they should go beyond 1997, will be null and void. Neither Chris Patten nor anybody else has the right to stipulate that the three-tier councils may go beyond 1997. All these laws will, of course, be null and void. This is the policy of the Chinese Government. He added: As to when the announcement will be made and what law and provisions will be declared null and void, of course, this will be made by the NPC Standing Committee. Lu also asked Patten to study the Basic Law well. "If one does not study well, one has no right to speak. It is necessary to study the Basic Law well and see what it says. People can see at a glance who on earth is violating the Basic Law." As to the draft regulations on the airport corporation which the Hong Kong Government has just made public, Lu said: It is fine that the draft regulations on the airport corporation have been published. The Chinese side has made clear its hope that the British Hong Kong authorities will publish the regulations at an early date to let the vast numbers of residents air their views. After soliciting views from the various quarters, the Chinese side will consult the British Hong Kong authorities. Therefore, the current discussion of this issue by the Preliminary Work Committee [PWC] is a channel through which the Chinese side solicits views. The Chinese side hopes that the PWC will discuss this issue first and put forward its views and then we will continue to discuss this issue with the British side. At the end of the day, this is something which should be discussed by the Chinese and British sides because the Memorandum of Understanding stipulates this. Asked whether Sino-British consultations on the airport will promote cooperation in other fields, Lu Ping reiterated: The Chinese side has always hoped to cooperate with the British side but this is not a unilateral issue. It hopes the British side will genuinely cooperate in all fields. Recently, some PWC members said they hoped to have contact with British Hong Kong officials. It goes without saying this is a very ordinary affair but the British Hong Kong authorities have obviously adopted an uncooperative attitude, not allowing any officials to have contact with PWC members. Lu Ping asked in reply: "What's wrong with contacts? We should have contacts. If one is cooperative, one should not be afraid. What is there to be afraid of?"
