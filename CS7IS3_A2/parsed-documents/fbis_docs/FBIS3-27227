This is an important measure for implementing Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of army building and the instructions and guidelines of the Central Party Committee and the Central Military Commission on strengthening and improving ideological and political work in the new period. It also represents a major event in strengthening grass-roots construction. Firm and vigorous ideological and political education is our Army's fine tradition and political superiority. Under the new situation of fully implementing reform and developing a socialist market economy, ideological and political education can only be strengthened rather than weakened. The national work meeting on propaganda and ideology, which was held not long ago, urged the whole party to strengthen and improve propaganda and ideological work under the new situation. General Secretary Jiang Zemin profoundly expounded the important position, fundamental guiding principle, and major tasks of propaganda and ideological work in the new period from the high plane of the overall work situation of the whole party, thus further pointing out the correct way and setting very high demands on us to accomplish propaganda and ideological work and conduct ideological and political education well. The General Political Department promulgated the regulations on the basis of full investigation and proof and of pooling the whole Army's wisdom, which not only inherited our Army's fine tradition of ideological and political education but also drew on the successful experience since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Party Committee, thus reflecting the objective demand for strengthening and improving ideological and political education in grass-roots units under the new situation. This document is the basis for organizing and conducting ideological and political education in grass-roots units as well as the embodiment of the "Program for Army Building at the Grass-Roots Level" in ideological and political education. Units at all levels must conscientiously implement these regulations in light of reality. To implement the Regulations, we must, in the first place, study and be familiar with them. When organizing grass-roots cadres to study the program, all units must treat the study of the regulations as an important activity; brigades and regiments must integrate with preparatory educational meetings to constantly organize grass-roots political cadres to study the regulations; and political cadres must consider the regulations as the teaching material for professional study. Political cadres at all levels should understand the fundamental spirit of the regulations, should be familiar with the basic substance and requirements of the regulations, should define their own duties, and should comprehend the basic method for conducting education in accordance with the regulations. To implement the regulations, we must conscientiously work in accordance with their requirements. The purpose of drawing up this document is precisely to guide concrete work. Therefore, it would be meaningless if this document were to be pigeonholed and the regulations were not put into effect. Leaders and political organs at all levels must organize and guide education in accordance with the regulations, whereas grass-roots units must conduct education in accordance with the regulations. It is necessary to have a greater awareness of the laws and regulations and conscientiously uphold the solemnity of the regulations. The regulations must be set as the criteria of making arrangements for educational activities, for inspecting the situation of conducting education, and for evaluating educational results. We must straighten out relationships between various sectors, improve the administration of ideological and political education at the grass-roots level, and establish a normal educational order in accordance with the regulations. To implement the regulations, we must integrate them with educational practices. This year, all types of educational activities must be organized and implemented in accordance with the requirements of the regulations. Moreover, we must constantly enhance our understanding and heighten our capability of conducting education in accordance with the regulations. We must accelerate the implementation of all types of educational activities through the regulations and properly implement the regulations in the process of conducting education. To properly implement the regulations, the involvement of leaders and political organs at all levels is essential. It is not easy to draw up a good document, and it is even more difficult to put it into effect, because we have to do a substantial amount of painstaking work. Every unit must do all it can to give wide publicity to the regulations within the Army so as to build up a certain public opinion and momentum. Every unit must integrate the regulations with its own conditions in putting forward concrete measures for implementing the regulations, to take the initiative in studying how to solve the conflicts and problems in implementing the regulations on a trial basis, and to create favorable conditions for implementing the regulations. Leaders at all levels, in particular political commissars and directors of political departments, must take the initiative to study the regulations, to give publicity to the regulations, and to implement the regulations, thus setting an example for the grass-roots units. The regulations are the product of integrating the inheritance of fine traditions with reform and innovation. That is, in implementing the regulations, we must also strive for reform and innovation on the basis of inheriting our Army's fine tradition of political education. We must constantly study new conditions, solve new problems, use new experiences and achievements to enrich and perfect the regulations, and treat the implementation of the regulations as a process of constantly deepening the reform of ideological and political education in grass-roots units. We believe that, with the implementation of the regulations, we will definitely be able to score greater achievements in conducting ideological and political education in the grass-roots units.
