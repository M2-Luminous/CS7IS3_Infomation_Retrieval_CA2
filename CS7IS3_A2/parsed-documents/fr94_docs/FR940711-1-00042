FR940711-1-00042 FR940711-1-00011 Subpart 970.26 provides guidance on the application of section 3021 to M&O contracts which may be used to accomplish DOE responsibilities under the Energy Policy Act. III. Procedural Requirements A. Review Under Executive Order 12866 The Department of Energy has determined that today's regulatory action is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review,'' (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993). Accordingly, this action was not subject to review under that Executive Order by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). B. Review Under Executive Order 12778 Section 2 of Executive Order 12778 instructs each agency to adhere to certain requirements in promulgating new regulations and reviewing existing regulations. These requirements, set forth in sections 2(a) and (b)(2), include eliminating drafting errors and needless ambiguity, drafting the regulations to minimize litigation, providing clear and certain legal standards for affected conduct, and promoting simplification and burden reduction. Agencies are also instructed to make every reasonable effort to ensure that the regulation: specifies clearly any preemptive effect, effect on existing Federal law or regulation, and retroactive effect; describes any administrative proceedings to be available prior to judicial review and any provisions for the exhaustion of such administrative proceedings; and defines key terms. This proposed rule would, when adopted as a final rule, have no preemptive effect; will not have any effect on existing Federal laws; and would only clarify the existing regulations on this subject. The revised clauses would apply only to contracts which would be awarded after the effective date of the final rule, and, thus, would have no retroactive effect. Therefore, DOE certifies that this proposed rule meets the requirements of sections 2(a) and (b) of Executive Order 12778. C. Review Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act This proposed rule was reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, which requires preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis for any rule which is likely to have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. DOE certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and, therefore, no regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared. D. Review Under the Paperwork Reduction Act This rule will require only an insignificant addition to the data collection required for the Standard Forms 294 and 295. Accordingly, no OMB clearance is required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq. ). E. Review Under Executive Order 12612 Executive Order 12612, 52 FR 41685 (October 30, 1987), requires that regulations, rules, legislation, and any other policy actions be reviewed for any substantial direct effects on States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, and in the distribution of power and responsibilities among various levels of government. If there are sufficient substantial direct effects, then the Executive Order requires preparation of a federalism assessment to be used in all decisions involved in promulgating and implementing a policy action. Today's proposed rule, when finalized, will revise certain policy and procedural requirements. However, DOE has determined that none of the revisions will have a substantial direct effect on the institutional interests or traditional functions of States. F. Review Under the National Environmental Policy Act DOE has concluded that this rule falls into a class of actions (categorical exclusion A5) that are categorically excluded from NEPA review because they would not individually or cumulatively have significant impact on the human environment, as determined by the Department's regulations (10 CFR Part 1021, Subpart D) implementing the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321, 4331&hyph;4335, 4341&hyph;4347 (1976)). Therefore, this rule does not require an environmental impact statement or an environmental assessment pursuant to NEPA. IV. Public Comment A. Public Hearing The Department has concluded that this proposed rule does not involve a substantial issue of fact or law and that the rule should not have a substantial impact on the nation's economy or large numbers of individuals or businesses. Therefore, pursuant to Pub. L. 95&hyph;91, the DOE Organization Act, and the Administrative Procedures Act (5 U.S.C. 553), the Department does not plan to hold a public hearing on this proposed rule.
