Spacek said that according to Goncz, Hungary does not see the Partnership for Peace as a substitute for membership, but rather as an open opportunity for everyone. He also admitted the possibility of individual admission into NATO for Central and Eastern European countries. The two presidents agreed, Spacek said, that it is necessary to emphasize the stability of the region, which they consider a condition for carrying out the Partnership for Peace. Havel and Goncz assured each other that in the near future, experts from both countries would set up contacts with NATO military representatives on preparing the initiative. On the topic of bilateral relations, the two presidents agreed that they are interested in deepening economic and other cooperation. Czech and Hungarian Foreign Ministers Josef Zieleniec and Geza Jeszenszky also participated in the talks.
