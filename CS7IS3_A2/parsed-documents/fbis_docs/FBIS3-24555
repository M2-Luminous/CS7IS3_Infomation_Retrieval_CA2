In both cases high requirements are imposed on the structure and optical properties of the CdTe films. A basic technological problem lies in getting a stoichiometric and structurally perfect film at the lowest possible substrate temperatures. From an analysis of previous work it was concluded that an ``ideal'' process requires use of a beam of precipitating atoms having an energy of 5-50 eV per atom in order to attain high surface mobility and formation of dense and structurally perfect films. A recent trend in ion technology utilizes beams of so-called intrinsic ions having a high degree of ionization (1-10 percent) and relatively low energies (100-500 eV per ion). In this connection, one of the most promising methods for preparing semiconductor films appears to be vacuum precipitation from an ion-molecular beam. In the present work a study was made of the effect of the energy from a beam of precipitated material on the structure and optical properties of ion-molecular beam precipitated films of CdTe on glass and single crystal silicon substrates. Optimum conditions for obtaining precipitates of fully texturized, mirror-smooth, and optically perfect films were determined, and the effects of various interacting mechanisms of the intrinsic ions with the condensate on the structure and optical properties of the resulting films are discussed.
