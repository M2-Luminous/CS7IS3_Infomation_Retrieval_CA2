This time all three supported the CSCE's opinion regarding the Latvian citizenship bill. They stressed that they supported the interests of the Latvian state and saw that much has already been achieved after independence was regained. However, parts of the bill, which do not meet CSCE requirements, are now causing a certain anxiety. The Swedish ambassador acknowledged that it was impossible to achieve in three years what other European countries have achieved in the whole post-war period, and that the issue of the presence of ethnic minorities in Latvia was also the issue of survival for the Latvian people. The Italian ambassador stressed that not everyone presently fully understands the particular significance of the citizenship law and the consequences that may follow if the bill is passed in its present version. That will also complicate Latvia's joining the European Council. The CSCE commissioner, for his part, noted that the part of the draft law, which lays down naturalization quotas, was considered the most critical point. He said experts from the Council of Europe were currently in Riga and they will help the Saeima work out a suitable version that international organizations, including the Council of Europe and the CSCE, will be able to support.
