The article is under the rubric "Regions."] [Text] Approximately 40 heads of administration and directors of enterprises in 14 krays and oblasts, all members of the "Siberian Agreement" Interregional Association (MASS), met in Novosibirsk to review and dicuss Boris Yeltsyn's draft Edict "On How Relationships in Ownership of Electrical Energy Should be Regulated Between Federal and Territorial Agencies" and the mechanism for formulating tariffs on electrical and thermal energy. According to participants, the discussion in which "opposing points of view were expressed," was very heated. In the end, the draft of the presidential edict, prepared by the Ministry of Economics of the Russian Federation [RF], was declared to be "premature," since it was "put together in isolation" from the well-thought-out concept for managing a unified electrical energy system "under new economic conditions" and "it does not fully consider the problem of relationships with regard to ownership, rights, and responsibilities" between the Center and the regions. The Coordinating Council decided that within two months it would formulate and present to the government a proposal from MASS "on reforming the managerial system for electrical energy from the viewpoint of protecting the interests of the territories." Representatives of MASS called the mechanism for formulating tariffs on electrical and thermal energy "incomplete and unacceptable." Participants of the Novosibirsk get-together believe that "the intensifying crisis caused by nonpayments" is but one result of this formulation. For February, 19 percent of electrical energy and 8 percent of delivered gas were paid for. The overall level of payments has decreased from 63 percent at the end of last year to 47 percent in February 1994. Even though the main victim of nonpayments was the Thermal and Electrical Power Commission (TEK), as the absolute net creditor, the heads of Siberian oblasts considered it necessary to fight the crisis by decreasing or freezing tariffs on electrical energy, which are, on the average, five times lower than worldwide tariffs. For this reason it was decided to ask the Council of Ministers to review the "Statute on State Regulation of Tariffs for Electrical and Thermal Energy in the RF for 1994." The crux of the MASS proposals, which are intended to be prepared within a month, is that the Inter-Regional "Siberian Agreement" Energy Commission--formed on a voluntary basis--will present Moscow with "correct" tariffs for industrial and agrarian consumers of energy, as well as with regular amounts for "light and heat" to be paid by private individual customers. Notwithstanding the seeming unity of the meeting participants, to come up with agreed-upon positions in a month or two, and even more so, to gain the government's understanding, apparently will not be so simple. First, a definitive reworking of tariffs on electrical/thermal energy will impact on the financial interests of RAO [All-Russia Joint-Stock Society], the Russian Unified Electrical Power System, and will threaten the summer cycle of repair work on stations and electric power lines [LEP]. Mr. Kuzmin, who participated in the RAO discussions, stated that freezing tariffs on electrical energy is allowable only if "the government freezes prices on energy resources and railroad tariffs." However, prices of oil and coal were liberated by law, and to push prices back, even through the administrative efforts of Oleg Soskovets, would not be so simple. At this point it is worthwhile to note the position of the Ministry of Fuel and Energy, which was publicized in Novosibirsk by Deputy Minister Vitaliy Bushuyev: "Either we take the market route and try to get prices on energy carriers and agro-industrial production to correspond with world prices or we impose central regulation on everything. The second alternative spells catastrophe." Of course, there is an intermediate version of cartel agreements by industrial branches and enterprises for component parts, which brings together regional authorities and a number of high officials from the Cabinet of Ministers and, specifically, the same Mr. Soskovets. However, the true intentions and hopes of representatives of the processing industry, we think, boils down to strictly fixing "energy" prices, but not paying much attention to the prices charged by tens of thousands of suppliers to the TEK. It was not by coincidence that at the meeting of the MASS Coordinating Council, for all practical purposes no one hardly raised any questions about converting debts to promissory notes. On the other hand, there was active discussion on the subject of "cheap energy resources that are going out of Siberia." Two more conflicts come to light. As is well known, Moscow was aiming for the inclusion of a series of hydroelectric stations on the Yenisey and Angara Rivers in the RAO, the Russian Unified Electrical Power System, while authorities in Krasnoyarsk and Irkutsk tried to keep them as property owned by the oblast. At one time, this matter was investigated by the Constitutional Court, but a final decision was never rendered. On the other hand, there is no unanimity within the "Siberian Agreement" on this matter either. As a whole, MASS is in favor of having a "state within a state" by creating within the framework of the Russian unified energy system a Siberian wholesale market for power capacity and energy. At the same time, however, authorities in Krasnoyarsk and Irkutsk are firm in their intentions to supply cheap electrical energy to the power-consuming giants of the aluminum industry, while the leadership of, say, Novosibirsk would like to take that same energy and divert it to plants of the military-industrial complex. The scope of the "state system" discussed in Novosibirsk can be judged from a phrase spoken by one of the participants: "What we need now are not structural or organizational perestroykas, but painstaking work to undo the non-payment crisis."
