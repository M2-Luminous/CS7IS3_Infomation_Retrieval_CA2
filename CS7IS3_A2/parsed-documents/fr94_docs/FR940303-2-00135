FR940303-2-00135 FR940303-2-00072 Entela Inc. has recently upgraded their fire protection and security systems to include smoke detectors and proximity sensors. These are connected to the security system which dispatches local fire and police departments. Test equipment is available to perform most measurement and testing in accordance with the identified test standards. Unavailable unique test equipment is purchased or leased through an Entela-approved source. An inventory list identifies all pieces of equipment by the department number or location in the laboratory, gage number, instrument name, manufacturer, model and serial number, range of operation, calibration frequency, and the date the instrument was placed in service. Operational and calibration information is located in files in the Quality Assurance Office. Test equipment is calibrated periodically depending upon the application, ranging from daily to once every three years. Electrical equipment is typically calibrated once per year, at a minimum. Adjustments are made to the calibration frequency via a corrective action report to address complaints or to ensure credible results. A written general procedure identifying the calibration history, records, and frequency of usage is utilized to determine any deviation from the equipment manufacturer's recommended or Entela's usual calibration intervals. The Quality Assurance (QA) Department is responsible for maintaining the calibration database, the department monthly recall reports, and the procurement of calibration services. Each department is responsible for timely calibration and preventive maintenance of its equipment. The QA Department retrieves or locks out any equipment that is not turned in for calibration. New and repaired test equipment is calibrated prior to use. When a piece of equipment is received for repair or routine calibration, its ``as received'' calibration status is noted. This status is evaluated for its effect on testing that has been performed with that equipment to determine whether retesting is necessary. Each item of test and measuring equipment is required to have a label that depicts its calibration status. For example, it may have a calibration label or may be labeled, ``Before Each Use'', ``Out of Calibration'', ``Out of Service'', or ``For Reference Only''. Calibration labels identify the date when last calibrated as well as the date for the next calibration. Repair and Calibration records are maintained for the life of the equipment in the master calibration files and on the database computer (calibration). Calibration standards are traceable to NIST or to international standards bodies. Primary standards include: Gage and hardness blocks, laser interferometers, and chemical references. The QA Department issues monthly calibration recall notices and preventive maintenance reports to each department based upon the master calibration database. The department managers are responsible for complying with any of the requirements noted in the report. The Quality Assurance manager will remove any non-calibrated equipment and place it in a locked storage area unless the equipment meets the criteria for extension of calibration. A number of test and evaluation procedures were reviewed in various ongoing program areas. The specific ongoing programs the laboratory is involved with that identify the records required to be maintained for an investigation are followed. These programs use ANSI/UL Standards, ASTM test procedures, the Quality Control Manual, Third Party Certification Program (TPCP) Manual, Client Test Procedures, and Departmental Operational Procedures. These procedures contain construction or testing parameters to be met by the product being evaluated and, as required, the chronological order of evaluation. The staff responsible for safety testing generally consists of degreed engineers and chemists. In most instances, the test standard provided sufficient detail for laboratory personnel to conduct a step-by-step approach to develop repeatable and accurate test and evaluation data. Where appropriate, the test engineer provides a narrative report along with the test data to document compliance of a product with the standard. Standardized tests that are frequently run have a standard test data sheet available that contains the necessary information for the laboratory technician. Sample test and evaluation procedures and reports for the NRTL Program activities were reviewed. These sample reports include narrative descriptions. The test procedure format and scope are identified in the Third Party Certification Program Manual, and describe the content and scope for the Standard Operational Procedure. The laboratory has developed a generalized processing procedure for the product classes of electrical appliances and lighting products in final form, and in draft form for flammability testing.
