Minister Ya'ir Tzaban was of the opinion that the definition of terror should also be applied to Rabbi Moshe Levinger, but he was told that such a decision would not withstand an appeal to the High Court of Justice. During the session, the cabinet examined documents presented by Shin Bet officials about suspicions connecting the two terrorist organizations to unsolved murder cases in the territories. The issue of firing regulations in the territories also came up in the meeting, but the cabinet decided not to discuss the issue because it is currently being dealt with by the State Commission of Inquiry. Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin stated in the meeting that the question of the curfews and closures on the territories are being constantly revised. The cabinet will hold another session this afternoon. Kakh leader Barukh Barzel said that his movement will continue to operate from the underground and, if necessary, also from jail. Our correspondent Gil Litman reports that the police have arrested another Kahana Hay activist, a resident of Kfar Tapuah, who refused to turn in his weapon.
