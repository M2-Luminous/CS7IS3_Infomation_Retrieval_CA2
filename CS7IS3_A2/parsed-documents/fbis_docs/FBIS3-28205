FBIS3-28205 "dreas024_d_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-024 Document Type:Daily Report 4 Feb 1994 South Korea U.S. Reportedly in `Communication' With DPRK SK0402005094 Seoul YONHAP in English 0032 GMT 4 Feb 94 SK0402005094 Seoul YONHAP Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Washington, Feb. 3 (YONHAP) -- The U.S. State Department acknowledged Thursday that the United States has been in contact with North Korea since the last publicly reported meeting on Dec. 29 and said that Washington knows where Pyongyang stands on the nuclear issue. The official statement by the office of the department spokesman is drawing keen interest as it was issued in an extremely tense atmosphere that has gripped the U.S. capital with regard to the North Korean nuclear question. The statement also came shortly after Billy Graham, visiting Pyongyang, delivered a verbal message from U.S. President Bill Clinton to North Korean leader Kim Il-song, and the American evangelist was reported Thursday to have "urgently relayed" Kim's reply to Clinton. Asked whether there has been any contact with North Korea, the office of the department spokesman said, "there was no meeting since Dec. 29, but there has been communication with them." One official at the office stressed that "we know what their opinions (on the nuclear issue) are." But "at the present time," he said, "the U.S. Government has no plans to contact them to deal with practical problems." On the stalled negotiations between North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on nuclear inspections, the U.S. Government has stated that it will not get involved. Meanwhile, Cable Television News Network (CNN) reported Thursday that Kim Il-song, during his meeting with Billy Graham, expressed hope that the nuclear issue would be resolved. Commenting on Kim Il-song's reply to Clinton, an official at the White House said Thursday he has nothing new to report on the North Korean nuclear problem. U.S. congressional sources, well informed on affairs at the White House, said that members of the National Security Council must be analyzing Kim's message. The White House will then need time to consult with congressional leaders, they said. In a related development, the State Department confirmed Thursday that North Korea's ambassador to the United Nations, Pak Kil-yon, and his wife have arrived in Washington from New York to attend a national breakfast prayer meeting. U.S. officials who are scheduled to attend the prayer meeting, however, have no plans to confer with Pak, department officials said. The officials, recalling that Pak attended a similar meeting last year, said no significance should be attached to his attendance this year.
