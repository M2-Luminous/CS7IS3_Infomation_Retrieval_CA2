FR940118-2-00125 FR940118-2-00075 National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Program In EPA's 1987 report, An Overview of Sediment Quality in the United States, municipal sewage treatment plants and combined sewer overflows were cited as sources of sediment contamination in all regions of the country. Chemical, steel, metal working and electroplating industries were also mentioned as sources in many areas as were engine and automotive facilities, nuclear energy producers, paper mills, tanneries, refineries and other petroleum industries, electrical component and capacitor manufacturers, and wood preservers. The Agency is compiling a national inventory of point and nonpoint sources of sediment contamination to assist in targeting at risk sites and facilities. In recognition of the role of contaminated sediments as a cause of impaired water quality, the NPDES permitting program is developing and field testing models predictive of the ambient quality of water and sediment. While existing water quality models may be quite helpful in understanding the sediment dynamics in specific waterbodies, they may be too complex to be routinely used by regulatory authorities to establish water quality-based effluent limits based on sediment quality criteria. The NPDES program is supporting development of a chemical-specific sediment quality criteria-based effluent limit methdology and is testing its application. The NPDES program also intends to develop guidance on the procedure. EPA hopes that such a method will be sufficiently sophisticated to be reliable and defensible, yet require minimal data points and scientific extrapolations so that it can be routinely applied in a regulatory context. In addition to developing a sediment quality criteria-based permitting methodology, the NPDES program is supporting laboratory training, demonstrations, and guidance development on the assessment and control of bioconcentrating pollutants which, by nature, accumulate in sediments. It is also supporting development of acute and chronic sediment toxicity tests and sediment toxicity identification evaluations. The sediment quality criteria will advance all of these efforts by establishing a new tool for achieving the long-term goals of the Act. Great Lakes Program Sediment quality criteria could also be used in connection with the Great Lakes program. For example, the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement provides that the United States and Canadian governments will cooperate with State and Provincial governments to ensure that Remedial Action Plans (``RAPs'') are developed and implemented for specific Areas of Concern (``AOCs'') in the Great Lakes. The Great Lakes Water Agreement also calls for the establishment of compatible criteria between the two countries for the classification of sediment quality. Thus, EPA anticipates that Great Lake States and EPA Regions will use final sediment quality criteria for various purposes, including establishing priorities for sites needing further assessment, targeting areas for potential remediation and prevention efforts, and supporting the development of state water quality standards based on sediment quality criteria. In each of the designated AOC's located in the United States contaminated sediments have been identified as causing at least one of the 14 beneficial use impairments listed in the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. The RAPs are to specify the beneficial uses that are impaired, the remedial measures needed to restore beneficial uses, and an implementation schedule. For those AOC's already identified most of the Stage 1 RAPs (problem identification) have already been completed and most Stage 2 RAPs (remedial actions) are in preparation, therefore, the proposed criteria will be most applicable for the identification of future AOC's and development of their Stage 1 and 2 RAPs. The International Joint Commission (IJC) has published ``listing/delisting criteria'' for adding and removing a site from the AOC list. The listing/delisting criteria refer to various tools to measure the impacts on beneficial uses, including the contaminant levels in fish and wildlife, numerical water quality criteria for surface waters, and, in the case of restrictions on dredging activities, the extent to which sediment contamination may exceed standards, guidelines, or IJC objectives. The EPA will look to the Great Lakes States to review sediment quality data for each AOC in relation to the possible impairment of beneficial uses and to consider 304(a) sediment quality criteria and any other more recent data or relevant site specific data to design preventive and remedial actions for contaminated sediment. For example, EPA in cooperation with Great Lakes States and the Canadian Federal and Provincial Governments, may use the sediment quality criteria as one means to prioritize sites for action by comparing the toxic contaminant concentration in the sediments to the most stringent of either Canadian or U.S. standards or guidelines. Superfund Program Uses The SQC have been developed primarily to assist in pollution prevention and water quality control activities. Due to many factors, such as the potential for causing environmental damage through distrubing contaminated sediments, they are not intended as mandatory levels to be met in clean-up efforts. EPA recognizes that, in particular circumstances, it may be appropriate to use natural recovery as a sediment remediation tool. Superfund is primarily a remediation program concerned with the clean-up or remediation of sites that have been contaminated. The Superfund program expects to use SQC as a tool to evaluate sites that may require assessment and possible remediation. For example, if a site has been shown to exceed SQC levels, it may be given higher priority for assessment with the Hazard Ranking System (HRS) to help determine if the site should be added to the National Priorities List (NPL). NPL sites typically require long term remediation efforts. In general, the Superfund program expects to employ SQC for sites with sediment contamination as part of a tiered testing protocol. Given the above approach to the assessment of contaminated sediments, Superfund's approach is consistent with the conclusions of both the Science Advisory Board's November 1992 review of the criteria and the Agency: ``The use of SQC's as stand-alone, pass-fail criteria is not recommended for all applications.'' and ``*␣*␣* the inappropriate uses of the SQC's, such as mandatory target clean-up standards, [should be stated] unless additional site specific studies are completed.'' At the same time, SQC's might be considered water quality criteria as referenced in section 121(d)(2)(A) of CERCLA, and thus potential Applicable or Relevant and Appropriate Requirements (ARAR's). Similarly, if SQC are adopted by States as part of water quality standards, they could be considered as ARARs. The Agency requests comment on the appropriateness of the use of SQC as ARARs and if so what aspects of the remedial action they should affect.
