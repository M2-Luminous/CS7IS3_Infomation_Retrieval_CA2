Krivulak is located in the strategically most important location in the Balkans, at the bottleneck of the Vardar Valley. With 10,000 recruits, without any heavy weapons, and without a defense budget, the young state of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] can put the valley to less use than the farmers who live in the vicinity. During maneuvers up to 5,000 JNA soldiers used to camp here. [Begin recording of Major Stanko Sokolovski of the FYROM Army] Here in Krivulak the Yugoslav -- excuse me, Macedonian -- infantry gets its final polish. [end recording] The major still has problems with the new conditions. [Begin Sokolovski recording] About a month ago a unit of the U.S. UN battalion held firing exercises here. [end recording] This might become a permanent state of affairs, because there are constant media reports that Krivulak might become the base for 3,000 to 5,000 Americans. For the time being the U.S. UNPROFOR contingent will be increased by 400 to 700 men. The United States seems to want to make Macedonia a calm pole of the Balkans with its presence. After Albania, should Macedonia, which is located at the crossroads of interests in this region, also be firmly taken into U.S. hands? The defense minister in Skopje naturally denies this. [Begin recording Defense Minister Vlado Popovski] This idea of stationing 4,000, 5,000, or 7,000 Americans in Krivulak exists only in the press. It was launched by the Greeks. Serbian newspapers took it over, then it was taken over by Bulgarian papers, or the other way round. However, it is clear: Macedonia is located in an unstable region. The war in Bosnia is not over, and there is the risk that it might spread. Kosovo, too, worries us very much. We are threatened by all military activities. [end recording] The Swedish UN soldiers have the longest experience with this kind of coexistence. They have been sharing a barracks in Kumanovo with the Macedonian Army for two years now.
