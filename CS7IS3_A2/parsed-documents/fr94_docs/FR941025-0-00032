FR941025-0-00032 FR941025-0-00007 One commenter states that the oil quantity to initiate inspection action should be 22 quarts instead of 20. The commenter notes that operating experience on Boeing aircraft led to a revision in the Boeing Operations Bulletin to use the 22 quart figure. The FAA concurs in part. This final rule has been revised to refer to 22 units rather than quarts, as described in a previous response. The economic analysis in the proposed rule included all 1,570 engines in the fleet. The manufacturer has advised the FAA that this number is overly conservative and that there are only approximately 300 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry. Out of the 300 engines, an estimated 96% have accomplished the requirements of this AD. The economic analysis of this final rule has been revised accordingly. After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes described previously. The FAA has determined that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. The FAA estimates that 300 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 8 work hours per engine to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $2,316 per engine. Out of the 300 engines, the manufacturer has advised the FAA that 96% of the fleet have accomplished the requirements of this AD. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $33,072. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES .
