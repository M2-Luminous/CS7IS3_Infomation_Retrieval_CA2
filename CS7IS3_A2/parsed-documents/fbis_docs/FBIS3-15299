He plans to have meetings with President Bill Clinton, Vice President Albert Gore, the secretaries of defence, the treasury and commerce, congressional leaders, the management of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and members of the business community. A treaty between Ukraine and the United States on the encouragement and mutual protection of investments and a convention between the governments of the two countries on the prevention of double taxation and of tax evasions on income and capital taxes are to be signed during the visit. The two governments are also to sign an agreement on cooperation in science and technology and the Defence Ministries will sign an agreement on additional assistance in eliminating strategic nuclear weapons and preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A wide range of matters of mutual interest are expected to be discussed, a State Department spokesman who requested anonymity told ITAR-TASS. He did not rule out the possibility that regional security issues as well as Ukrainian-Russian relations would be discussed during the visit. "The principal aim of the visit is to broaden U.S.-Ukrainian economic and trade contacts," Dmitriy Markov, counsellor at the Ukrainian Embassy in the U.S., told ITAR-TASS. "We are also interested in discussing defence conversion matters with the U.S. side," he added. President Kravchuk and members of the American business community will discuss possibilities for capital investments in the Ukrainian economy, Sheila O'Creal, spokeswoman for the overseas private investment corporation, told ITAR-TASS. A press release circulated by the corporation in view of the Ukrainian president's visit points out that Ukraine is now in a critically important stage of transition to a market economy and may become an important market for Western investors.
