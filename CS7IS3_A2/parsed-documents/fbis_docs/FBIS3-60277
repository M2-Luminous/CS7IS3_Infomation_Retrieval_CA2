President Ramon J. Velasquez announced the government's decision in exclusive statements to EL UNIVERSAL. Velasquez said the country will certainly feel the impact of the U.S. move, which is why Venezuela will undertake "every appropriate measure to correct this situation." President Velasquez received a report from Simon Consalvi, the Venezuelan ambassador in Washington, informing him of the new gasoline guidelines in the United States. When the guidelines go into effect in January 1995, the measure will force Venezuela to stop selling some 50,000 barrels of oil a day to the United States. According the president, such a loss undoubtedly will adversely affect the country's financial situation. The decision forces us to begin actions to prevent the implementation of this measure. It contradicts the United States' proclaimed policy of free trade and economic integration. With this measure, Venezuela feels its economic interests have been damaged. Moreover, this policy contradicts Article 3 of GATT. For this reason, Venezuela, as a GATT member, should denounce before GATT this unfair trade policy affecting our exports. The official statement the government will issue today will be drafted in almost the exact terms used by President Velasquez in making his statements to EL UNIVERSAL. The government will insist the U.S. measure is at odds with Venezuela's rightful desire to maintain its current export levels. Moreover, we have a year -- from now until January 1995 -- to continue pressing our just demands, the president added.
