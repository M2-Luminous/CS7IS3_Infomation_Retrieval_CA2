Western apprehension of China's possible emergence as a new economic power in Asia that will use force to expand its territory is nothing but a delirium arising from jealousy and a lack of vision in understanding the culture of the world's biggest nation. On the other hand, history proves that only the Europeans have used conquest, either violent or peaceful, for gaining wealth or for self-defense. Yesterday in Beijing, Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed told a summit meeting entitled "China 1994," sponsored by the INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE, that Asia would regain its place in world civilization if all Asian nations shared not only the benefit of China's modernization and economic development but also saw it as a positive contribution to progress in the region. Surely, a prosperous and wealthy China will be able to become the engine of growth for the world in general and East Asia, including Southeast Asia, in particular. A diverse market will be created in China, whose 1.2 billion people enjoy only half of the U.S. wealth. Nevertheless, China still needs to import from Southeast Asian neighbors such commodities as cooking oil, gas, oil products, and manufactured goods. All Asian nations must grab this opportunity through economic cooperation with China instead of seeing this country as a giant to whom we should not be close. The entire region may benefit from China's wealth through trade and economic relations. Strangely, nations that believe that China's emergence as an economic power will threaten their position are not equally apprehensive of the economic power of Japan, which colonized them half a century ago. In this regard, we agree with Dr. Mahathir that if Southeast Asian nations are not apprehensive of Japan, they should not be apprehensive of China either. If such a feeling is inevitable, they should be apprehensive of the two nations. We believe that the apprehension has been influenced by the Westerners, who do not want to see China as an economic power. For them, Japan's success in dominating the world economy and technology is enough to disprove their belief that the Europeans deserve to lead the world. Being Asian, the countries in the region should dismiss the idea as there is no reason for them to help the Europeans thwart China's efforts and slow down Asia's efforts to gain their equal rights as world citizens. In addition, they should not be apprehensive of China's efforts to turn itself into a military power because any countries with strong economies would do the same. Moreover, seen from the perspective of international politics, China's emergence as a world politico-military power will at least counter the domination of the United States as a single superpower following the collapse of the Soviet Union. The Westerners are so apprehensive of such a situation that they have sought various pretexts, including alleged violations of human rights and freedom in China to gain international support for their efforts to isolate China. We believe that all Asian nations are well aware of the West's decadent strategy because some of them have also become the victims of the same tactics. As the prime minister said, Asian nations have a different view of China because they understand China. China has introduced the socialist market economy in an attempt to avoid an economic and political anarchy plaguing Russia. We also understand how China will implement the process of revolutionizing its society to enable all its people to enjoy overall prosperity in the 21st century. We are confident that progress in Asia will be complete and the continent will regain its place in world civilization if China's modernization and economic development succeeds. Those who have doubts over this possibility should refer to the Prophet Mohamed's appeal to his followers to go as far as China to gain knowledge some 1,414 years ago.
