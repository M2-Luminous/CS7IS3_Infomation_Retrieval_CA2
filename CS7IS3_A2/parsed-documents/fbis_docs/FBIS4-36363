'Arafat told the US ambassador to Tunis, John McCarthy, "clearly and firmly" that he would not travel to Jericho unless he received a guarantee of international aid for Palestinian autonomy, the source said. He said the PLO chairman wanted assurances that the Palestinians would receive monthly payments of several million dollars to keep self-rule on track in the West Bank town and the Gaza Strip. McCarthy, in turn, told 'Arafat that the United States wanted the Palestinian self-rule authority to take up its responsibilities "as soon as possible," the Palestinian news agency WAFA said. It reported that 'Arafat, who was "feeling better" according to his aides, also met Russian ambassador Boris Shchiborin to discuss the aid issue, amid demands from donors of assurances on how their money would be spent. They were the first official meetings for the PLO leader since he took refuge in his rooms five days earlier because of illness. Arafat, coughing and looking tired, said last week during an interview with the US television network CBS from the PLO headquarters in Tunis that he had a cold. But Palestinian and hospital sources said he had been suffering from heart problems and was being monitored by doctors. The PLO chief is scheduled to travel to Jericho in mid-June, for a visit during which a 24-member Palestinian authority headed by Arafat is due to be formally sworn in to run the autonomous areas. WAFA said 'Arafat on Tuesday also telephoned Norwegian Foreign Minister Bjorn Tore Godal, whose country heads a liaison committee in charge of coordinating the aid. The PLO leader could travel to the French capital on Friday, the source close to the organisation said.
