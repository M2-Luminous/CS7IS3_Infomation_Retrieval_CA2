Israel must understand that time is a decisive factor for a landless people." At this crucial stage in the Middle East peace negotiations, Hanan 'Ashrawi's words provide an insight into what is happening in the Palestinian camp. [Giovannangeli] What is the prevailing mood today in the occupied territories? ['Ashrawi] Disappointment, no doubt, and a lot of skepticism, but not only about the possibility of reaching a peace agreement with Israel quickly. In fact, I would even say that this is a secondary aspect in relation to the outbreak of internal problems within our own camp. [Giovannangeli] What sort of problems? ['Ashrawi] The crucial issue is that of democracy -- how decisions are made which affect the Palestinian people's future. Many of us are aware of the risk of not being ready for autonomy when we get there. We must build our institutions, form a new ruling class, and this is a task which we cannot delegate to someone else or postpone until a vague "future." [Giovannangeli] Is it this shortfall in democracy which lies at the heart of the clash within the PLO? ['Ashrawi] Rather than a clash, I would speak of a difficult self-reform process aiming to strengthen Palestinian democratic structures. In other words, the question is not to remove 'Arafat, but to reconsider his role as an unchallenged leader who takes upon himself all the burdens -- and the honors -- of decisionmaking. [Giovannangeli] What does this mean exactly? ['Ashrawi] This means creating a new ruling class that can give shape and substance to the Palestinian nation. This is the challenge which the PLO is now facing: To change from being a national liberation movement into the embryo of the future Palestinian state. [Giovannangeli] How did 'Arafat respond to your requests for greater democracy? ['Ashrawi] Disagreement concerns the "two-stage" policy advocated by 'Arafat: first achieving independence, and then everything else. I have voiced my dissent in this respect. If we do not already make use of all the energies and intellectual resources available to us today, we risk giving birth to an authoritarian state, and this is not what we have been fighting for over the past 50 years. [Giovannangeli] However, on the road leading to a Palestinian state there is Israel, which is accusing the PLO of attempting to disrupt the negotiations' timing agreed in the "statement of principles." ['Ashrawi] This stage of the negotiations reflects the essence of the conflict between Israel and Palestine. It is not "good" and "evil" which are opposing each other, but two equally legitimate sets of reasons, of rights. I am perfectly aware of the importance the security issue has for the Israelis, I know and understand their fears. But Rabin must understand that for my people, as much as for his own, symbols have great importance. The Israeli prime minister is right to say that what is at issue today is Gaza and Jericho's autonomy, but he cannot dismiss as being "tendentious" our request to highlight immediately, also in material terms, the actual link between the transitional stage and the negotiations' final outcome. I have never advocated an "everything now" position. I have always been convinced, and still am, that peace with Israel can only be achieved gradually, one stage at the time. Because of this position, I was threatened by "Hamas," but I am not afraid of being accused of treason. My fear is that autonomy may end up becoming a sort of self-imposed ghetto. [Giovannangeli] Mrs. 'Ashrawi, let us go back for a moment to 13 September 1993. What aspect of that "Declaration of Principles" do you regard as being the most valid four months later, and which, on the contrary, do you consider to be the most fragile? ['Ashrawi] The agreement contains an element of strategic importance: the explicit recognition of the PLO by Israel and the international community as a whole and, therefore, the recognition of the Palestinian problem as a national question. The agreement's limitations concern the ambiguity of certain formulations included in it, particularly as regards the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and Jericho, and the future of the Jewish settlements. The risk that I perceive today is that such ambiguities will be resolved only on the basis of the balance of forces, which is clearly to Israel's advantage. [Giovannangeli] Are you therefore pessimistic about negotiations being continued? ['Ashrawi] Despite everything, I still believe that the negotiations can be resumed, finally leading to the establishment of our self-government. The news from Davos is encouraging in this sense. I had the opportunity of meeting Israeli Prime Minister Peres several times, and I am convinced that he genuinely wishes to achieve a fair peace in the region... [Giovannangeli] Is time an obstacle to peace? ['Ashrawi] You see, the Israelis, like the Syrians or the Jordanians, can afford the luxury of procrastinating when it comes to looking for a peace settlement. At any rate, they have a state, a land to live on, a recognized national identity. We have nothing of all this. It was not easy -- believe me -- to convince the kids in the refugee camps that we must continue to believe in dialogue. However, we managed to do so, just as we managed to give back some hope to our elders by promising them that they would see their lifetime's dream come true: national independence. Today, they are asking us to justify such promises, they are asking us when all this will begin to happen. Unfortunately, we still live in the present, under Israeli occupation. [Giovannangeli] What about your own political future, Mrs. 'Ashrawi? ['Ashrawi] I intend to strengthen the Palestine Human Rights Committee, which was set up less than a month ago in the territories. This body will closely monitor the Palestinian leadership's actions, ensuring that respect for human and civil rights does not remain a statement of principles and nothing more.
