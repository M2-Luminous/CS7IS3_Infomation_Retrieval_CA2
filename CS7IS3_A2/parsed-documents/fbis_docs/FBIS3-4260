Agriculture serves as the pillar of national economic development and social stability. Its steadfast growth is of particular importance this year now that the nation is endeavouring to balance reform, development and stability -- the theme of the NPC session. Only with a healthy agriculture can stability last, which in turn facilitates reform and development. This is a rule the Chinese Government and people have sought out after repeated success and failure in history. For whenever agricultural production expands and the peasants see their lives improved, there is social stability, and reforms are carried forward smoothly. Stagnant farm production, however, will send inflation soaring and squeeze the economy out of proportion. China's sheer population size determines that it has to rely on itself to secure a solid food supply. The issue is all the more important now because grain producing capacity is not much more than the nation's food consumption. It is not only the traditional cereal producing bases that ought to strive for an increasing output, but the relatively developed coastal regions should also set aside a stable acreage for grain and adequate food storage. The central government should build its own food reservoir and set up a special-purpose national fund to regulate grain production and circulation. The supply of non-staple food, vegetables in particular, is the single most important factor that directly affects average urbanites' lives and is an essential element behind inflation. The central government's decision to designate city mayors to take full charge of non-staple food supply and ensure stable prices is a crucial measure to hold inflation at bay. As for farmers, the most pressing task is to help them earn more. The last decade of reform has enabled output to increase steadily but failed to augment farmers' income correspondingly in many regions, resulting in a widening gap between urban and rural residents. Modernization is impossible if three-quarters of the population remain poor. The government needs to increase its agricultural investment, raise grain procurement prices, ensure the supply of farm materials and machinery, provide information and organize services to farmers, and ensure no levies in addition to State taxes and the authorized collective charges are imposed on farmers. The long-term and fundamental way to increase their income, however, lies in transferring surplus rural labour to non-agricultural undertakings. This would leave farm hands with larger plots to cultivate on the one hand and migrant workers with more opportunities to show their talents on the other. New reforms are indispensable. Local governments, in the light of their conditions, may experiment with transferring the use rights of idle land to capable farmers, reshape rural businesses in the form of the share-based co-operative system, and restructure rural financial and banking networks. The national and regional legislatures should supervise the execution of existing laws and formulate new ones to guarantee that agricultural development goes along a regulated, legal track. Tough and protracting as the job is, the country has actually no other alternative but to work concertedly to advance rural development. A robust agriculture in a nation with one-fifth of the world's population not only underwrites a stable environment for domestic growth but also contributes greatly to world peace and development.
