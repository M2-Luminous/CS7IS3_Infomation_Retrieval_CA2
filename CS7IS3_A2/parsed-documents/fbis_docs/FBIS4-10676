The governors expressed their satisfaction with the agreements reached at the meeting. Much of the interest in the meeting was lost hours before it even began on Monday because the member countries had already agreed to increase the bank's capital and to focus more attention on social issues. In addition to deciding on a $40-billion increase over the next six years, bringing the IDB's capital to $100 billion, the countries of the region decided to relinquish part of their voting rights to Japan and the European banks in return for greater contributions from them. The non-American members will now have an additional representative on the IDB Executive Board, which will be headed by Japan, while the Latin American members gained an additional seat to compensate for the vote that they relinquished. When the meeting concluded, Pedro Aspe, Mexican Finance and Public Credit secretary and president of the 35th IDB Annual Assembly, said this agreement allows the Latin American countries to retain a majority with 50 percent of the votes and that no more votes will be relinquished to nonregional members in exchange for their contributions. Aspe stressed the multilateral nature of this decision, saying that it gives nonregional countries 16 percent of the votes. [passage omitted]
