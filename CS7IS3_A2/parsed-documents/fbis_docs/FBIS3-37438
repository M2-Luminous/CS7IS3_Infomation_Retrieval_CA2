An oil contract is to be signed as soon as possible! -- this was the gist of the remarks made by Geydar Aliyev when he assembled the entire leadership of the State Oil Company a few days ago. The document signed here has given the go-ahead to all of the State Oil Company's proposals regarding the basic areas covered by talks with the BP-Statoil consortium, the U.S. companies Amoco, Unocal, Pennsoil, Remco, and MacDermott, and the Turkish company Tekis Petroleum. The Azerbaijani company has been empowered to prepare and conclude a contract with them. Recently the fate of this contract has hung by a thread on a number of occasions. Following the change of government last June the Azerbaijani Government suspended the signing of this document, which caused confusion among the Western partners. But Geydar Aliyev explained away this step very simply: Azerbaijan is not rejecting the plan to develop the oil fields jointly, it merely wants everything to be done in a civilized manner with due account taken of national interests. This may well have been an unpopular step. In a difficult situation when there was political infighting in the republic, and when it was suffering one military reversal after another at the front, this course of action paid no dividends to Geydar Aliyev, who had only just come to power. Articles started to appear in the world press, even in Turkey, that were sharply critical of Azerbaijan's position on the oil question. According to opposition forecasts, the republic ran the risk of advertising itself as an unreliable partner. But the new leadership stood firm and insisted on the need for a second expert analysis of the terms of this contract which was causing so much fuss. During its work, the independent expert commission reviewed the percentage share of the anticipated profit in Azerbaijan's favor. The experts announced that they had managed to win back several tens of billions of dollars from the foreign partners. Admittedly, this did not happen without a great deal of huffing and puffing: The leader of the expert group was accused by a number of publications of extorting money from the Western firms, but the affair did not receive wide coverage, the talks continued, and all the indications are that they reached a successful conclusion. A number of analysts are linking this surprising turn of events and the hasty conclusion of a contract with Geydar Aliyev's current visit to Turkey and his upcoming visit to Britain. Both these states are keen to develop Azerbaijani oil. Because, however economically interesting this contract proves to be for the republic, it is at the same time a powerful political trump card in Azerbaijan's hand which could potentially play a major role in establishing very close contacts with influential Western countries. Azerbaijan can thus provide itself with strong protectors and, most important of all, guarantors of the resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.
