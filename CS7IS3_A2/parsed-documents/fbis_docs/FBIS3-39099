Mr Rifkind's comments came ahead of the Prime Minister's visit to Moscow on Tuesday [15 February] when Mr Major is expected to discuss the Bosnian situation with Russian leader Mr Yeltsin. The Defence Secretary, speaking in Edinburgh, said: "The Russian government has of course been very supportive of the UN and supported the Security Council resolution last year under which the possibility of air strikes is being organised. "It's perfectly understandable there should be some concern. Everybody is concerned about the use of force." Mr Rifkind emphasised his confidence in Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose, the UN force commander who is seeking to implement the ceasefire. He also said that the role of UN commanders on the ground would be extremely important in any decision to launch air strikes because of the risk to UN forces and aid workers. It was not unusual that there were differing degrees of support for international action, he added. The important point was that the Security Council took a decision some months ago and the latest resolution on air strikes was based on that. "In any account I am sure the views of all the nations concerned will continue to be considered," said Mr Rifkind. The Defence Secretary was guest of honour at the official opening of a new 1 million pound headquarters of the Scottish Yeomanry, a new Territorial Army unit created 15 months ago for the role of light reconnaisance and home defence.
