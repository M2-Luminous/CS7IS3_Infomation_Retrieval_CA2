FBIS3-59124 "drweu018__a94016" FBIS-WEU-94-018-A Document Type:Daily Report 27 January 1994 ANNEX Germany Bundesbank Reports Record Profits in 1993 LD2401151094 Hamburg DPA in German 1322 GMT 24 Jan 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY LD2401151094 Hamburg DPA Language: German Article Type:BFN [Text] Frankfurt/Main (DPA) -- The German Bundesbank recorded record profits in 1993. Its gross income increased to almost 21.4 billion German marks [DM]. The figure is shown in a weekly report dated 31 December 1993, which lists the amount of DM21.368 billion under the heading "other equity and liabilities." Alongside other liabilities, accruals, and deferred income, this figure also contains the profit accrued in 1993. Experts assume that Federal Finance Minister Theo Waigel will receive about DM18 billion "at the final count" from Frankfurt. In 1992, a total of around DM13.1 billion of Bundesbank net profits, amounting to DM14.7 billion, went into government coffers, while in 1991 the federal finance minister received exactly DM14.5 billion out of Bundesbank profits of DM15.2 million. Waigel has included DM7 billion of the 1993 Bundesbank profits in the federal budget. Any extra must be used to repay debts. The Bundesbank's results for the year are determined by the Central Bank Council and officially announced, as is customary, in April. The Bundesbank's most important source of income in 1993 remained interest from loan transactions with domestic banks. Although official interest rates did go down sharply during the course of 1993, this was largely offset by the expansion in the volume of refinancing. As the U.S. dollar, the Bundesbank's most important reserve currency, recovered greatly in 1993 from its historical low in 1992 of DM 1.3870, there is no need to write off funds in this area either.
