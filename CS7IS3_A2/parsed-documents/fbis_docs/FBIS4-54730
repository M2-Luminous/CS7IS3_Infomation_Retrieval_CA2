The strikes are "absentee" strikes which means the miners are not at their places of work. The chairmen of Solidarity factory committees in the mines and power stations met on Tuesday evening to discuss the forms further strike action would take. According to one of the union representatives who wished to remain anonymous Solidarity will be escalating the strikes in mining. The source said a decision to this effect would be taken on Wednesday during a meeting of the Slasko-Dabrowski regional Solidarity leadership in Katowice. The strike at Poland's lignite (brown coal) mines was suspended on Saturday. Power stations are not limiting electricity supplies.
