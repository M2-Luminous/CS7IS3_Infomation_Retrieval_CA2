India has extensive documentation to prove this point and the material has been presented to Western governments as evidence of Pakistan's role in sponsoring transborder terrorism. There have been detailed reports filed by independent journalists to further substantiate Pakistani complicity in disturbing the peace in Kashmir. However, every time such evidence is made public, either by the Government of India or the national media, Pakistan has been prompt in denouncing it as a propaganda. Ironically, it is the Pakistani media which has now begun to publish reports that provide indisputable evidence of Islamabad's support to terrorists. For instance, the FRONTIER POST, a well-known newspaper published from Peshawar and Lahore, has been publishing a series of articles and news reports which reveal the extent to which fundamentalist religio-political parties and organizations that enjoy official and quasi-official patronage have been sending across trained young men to Kashmir. The newspaper has also reported how some of these organizations whose camps are attended by Pakistani Army officers have been planning the kidnapping and killing of security personnel on duty in the valley. All this, of course, is not news as far as India is concerned. There can be no doubt that the ISI [Inter Service Intelligence] is not the only Pakistani outfit which has its fingers firmly in the Kashmiri pie; so have the Jamaat-i-Islami and its allied organizations. Yet, the Pakistani Government led by Ms. Benazir Bhutto has have no compunction in trying to make political capital out of the strife and violence that is a handiwork of its agencies. At the ongoing UN Human Rights Commission conference in Geneva, Ms. Bhutto has sought to propagate the Pakistani allegation of human rights violations resorting to the old tactics of repeating a lie again and again so that it appears to have a kernel of truth. But the propaganda blitz is unlikely to cut much ice. Now that even the Pakistani media has begun to divulge the truth, it is only a matter of time before the cat leaps out of the bag. It will not be surprising if following the spate of reports in the Pakistani newspapers Islamabad decides to impose press censorship to suppress the cold facts. But all this can only have a cosmetic effect for there is no power which can suppress the truth for ever, and the truth is that Pakistan driven by territorial greed is instigating and fanning violence in Kashmir. *
