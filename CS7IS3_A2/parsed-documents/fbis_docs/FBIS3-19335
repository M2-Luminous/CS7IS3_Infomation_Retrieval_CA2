In Sarajevo, Muslims and Serbs have agreed on reopening three important access roads and the strategically important bridge of brotherhood and unity -- which could mean the end of the siege. In Herzegovina's capital, Mostar, Muslims and Croats have stopped shooting at one another; in the Muslim ghetto in the eastern part of the city people can once again move about freely. For two years we could only report bad news from Bosnia, until, in early February, following the massacre in the marketplace, NATO issued an ultimatum to the Serbs around Sarajevo. Since then, things seem to have started developing in a completely new direction. It is still too early to talk about lasting peace -- there is still heavy fighting going on around Maglaj and Bihac. But chances that the war could come to an end are better than ever before. This is not only confirmed by the latest reports from the Balkans. Something else inspires confidence: For the first time, there are mediators involved whose voices carry weight with the warring parties, while those whom nobody would have believed any more moved into the background. American mediator Charles Redman and Russian special envoy Vitaliy Churkin have taken on the role of strategists -- representing their governments. One must remember that they have levers at their disposal that Lord Owen and his mediator colleague Thorvald Stoltenberg never had. And this is the only reason that the Americans could mediate the federation agreement between Croats and Muslims. Both sides had something to lose: Zagreb had to be afraid of sanctions, and the Bosnian Government knows that it depends on the Americans' support. The relationship between Belgrade and Moscow runs along similar lines: The Serbs see Russia as their only potential patron and thus have to follow the demands of the Russian Government. Belgrade has to accept that Moscow is not pursuing pro-Serbian policies mainly in the sense of a Slav brotherhood, but that it wants to mediate peace. What is the progress so far worth? The agreement between Croats and Muslims is comprehensive, and it tries to regulate life in the common federation almost down to the rotation principle for the village mayors. But this does not mean much. Earlier plans had laid down grand principles too; refugees were to be allowed to return to their homes, the results of "ethnic cleansing" were not to be accepted. The problem was that nobody wanted to keep these principles. What is important is that both sides will have to take things seriously this time -- because they will feel American pressure. If this pressure eased off, their enthusiasm for peace could die down very quickly. Also, this pact can be an interim solution at best, because none of the major issues have so far been at the center of negotiations. The issue of distribution of territories made all earlier mediations fail. In Vienna it was agreed that the federation is to make up 60 percent of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Considering the share of the Muslim and Croat populations in Bosnia, this would be a just solution. But: The Serbs would have to give up part of their captured territories. This means that the most difficult task still lies ahead of Churkin and Redman. They will have to get the Serbs to participate in the talks on possible solutions as quickly as possible. In doing this, they will once again have to use pressure. It has already been signalled to Belgrade that it has a clear choice: Either it gets the Bosnian Serbs to compromise, or it will remain isolated in the long run.
