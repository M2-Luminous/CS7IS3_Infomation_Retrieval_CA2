An event that should have gone unnoticed -- because it is an unavoidable part of the political and legal system -- took on a tragic significance with the death of a young peasant and the unprovoked aggression against various journalists, including four Private Communication Network reporters. One fact that encourages us to meditate was clearly visible at the end of the demonstration yesterday: Paraguayan democracy needs to mature. Intemperance, authoritarianism, arrogance, and resentment is still a very heavy burden on many fellow Paraguayans' minds. It requires only a spark, or the slightest encouragement, for these negative feelings to erupt in the most irrational way imaginable. That is what happened yesterday with the consequences we must all regret today. We have said in this column that the strike was a right established by law and a legitimate weapon for union struggle. We have also said that the exercise of that right should never mean infringement on other people's right to go to their work places. Traffic interruption and the attacks against bus drivers are, without doubt, acts that we cannot in any way approve. We also believe that the attack against journalists was totally unjustified. We must make here a basic analysis: If only one journalist had been injured we could have accepted it -- in a preliminary way -- as an unfortunate accident, something that could occur anywhere in the world. But we had several attacks and must, therefore, conclude that the incident was more serious, that journalists were seen as necessary targets of physical aggression for their responsibility in the events. We cannot forget that for months the government has been formulating the odd accusation that it is the press which invents the problems. The president of the Republic has made this accusation on several occasions in the angry tone that has become part of his communication style. And what is even worse, during a meeting between the president and political leaders at government palace we heard threats in a tone that Paraguayans are no longer used to hearing and which seemed taken from the last months of 1988. What was most serious was the fact that the president, forgetting his position as president, accompanied those threats in general terms against all those who use their legitimate right to dissent against the government. If the president forgets that he is, first, the president of all Paraguayans and becomes incomprehensibly intemperate, it will be very difficult to expect common sense and rationality from modest police agents who receive orders from their superiors. Their reaction is no accident, but a true response to the message they heard at the highest levels. We cannot expect too much from those who must stand in the front line if those responsible for governing the country single out the press as being responsible for all wrong doings and then, when the social conflict explodes, travel to a cattle fair abroad. They only act within the context of the ideas and opinions being aired at the highest levels. So we must ask: Who, in fact, pulled the trigger?
