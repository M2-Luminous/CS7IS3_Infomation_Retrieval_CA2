In an interview for Russia's newsmen, he said the leaders of the republic are seeking peace and accord between the different political forces, but national revival is hampered by the armed opposition, which continues attempts from neighboring Afghanistan to infiltrate deep inside the republic. And in that connection, Imamali Rakhmanov assessed highly the actions of the CIS collective peacekeeping forces stationed in Tajikistan. They play an important role in stabilizing the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border.
