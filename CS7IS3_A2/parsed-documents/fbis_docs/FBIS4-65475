Last week, the executive committee of the Public Electricity Corporation [DEH] discussed the project to connect the electricity grids of Greece and Turkey, and decided to initiate procedures with a view to signing the relevant agreement with Turkey. One of the government's main arguments for the necessity of this connection is that it will create an energy axis linking Turkey, Greece, and Italy, in which our country will occupy a central position. The connection between Greece and Italy will be accomplished by an underwater cable whose construction has already begun. Because Italy is in need of large supplies of electricity and Turkey has considerable quantities of it available for export, such an energy axis could be of great advantage to Greece. For obvious reasons, nevertheless, Turkey does not wish to let its Western exports be dependent on an intervening Greek network, and is therefore pursuing the construction of an alternative route which will link Turkey with Italy by going through Bulgaria, Skopje, and Albania. (The agreement about this connection between Italy and Albania -- which is to be accomplished by underwater cable between the two countries -- has already been signed.) By means of such a northern energy route, designed to link Turkey to the West and to the Balkan countries in-between, Greece is deprived of its advantage. Connecting the electricity grid of Greece to that of Turkey, however, will have yet another, graver, repercussion. Given the fact that our country is now facing a shortage of electric energy and that this shortage is expected to keep growing until at least 1998, the Turkish hookup will make us dependent on our neighbor for energy. That means that the exclusive function of the hookup will be to export Turkish electricity to Greece for Greek consumption only, under terms -- as indicated by talks between DEH and TEK [the Turkish electric company] -- very unfavorable for Greece. During a meeting of representatives of the two electric companies which took place in Athens on February 23-24, TEK asked DEH to pay 6.265 cents for each kilowatt-hour of imported electricity. This is almost twice the present cost of 3.46 cents per kwhr produced by the large oil-fired generating unit that DEH is currently using. The cost of energy produced by large-capacity lignite coal units is even lower than that. Of course, DEH has not yet made known its final decision regarding the asking price, as this is scheduled to be discussed at the next meeting of the representatives of the two companies next month. In any case, the bargaining position of DEH does not inspire one with confidence. It is currently within TEK's discretion to offer our country electricity at high prices because, on the one hand, Greece faces serious difficulties in being supplied by either the Yugoslav or the Bulgarian network and, on the other, it has been too slow to install new electric generating facilities with which to meet its steadily rising electricity needs. During their meeting with representatives of TEK last February, the representatives of DEH negotiated imports of electric energy from Turkey equivalent to the output of one generating plant of 180 mw capacity, functioning continuously with lowered rates at night. Through the connection of the two networks, therefore, Turkey achieves two objectives: In the first place, it makes our country, and more especially the nationally sensitive region of Thrace, dependent on Turkey for electricity. It is an undisputed fact that the supplies of electricity from Turkey will be channelled to Thrace, first because this border region does not possess even a single electricity-producing unit, and second, because any attempt to circulate imported electricity through the entire extent of the Greek network would be financially ill-advised. Even now, all the electricity imported from Bulgaria is used exclusively by Thrace. In the second place, it coerces Greece to pay excessively high prices before it can satisfy urgent and extensive electricity needs. In the opinion of some energy experts, the reason for which Turkey is exacting such prices from Greece is that it hopes, by so doing, to finance its plan of rendering the Balkans dependent on itself for energy. The high tariffs it is proposing to Greece will allow it to depress the prices at which it can sell electricity to the other Balkan countries (all of whom are also in urgent need of electricity imports), facilitating in this manner their economic and political dependence on Turkey. The Meetings Turkey's coercive tactics toward Greece in regard to electric energy prices is evident in the way meetings between DEH and TEK have evolved since 1990. In the first of these meetings (Constantinople, 8-9 October 1990), there was no discussion of prices but only of the theoretical rationale for the schedule of rates, which were to be based on the cost of production per oil unit (i.e., cost of oil plus operation and maintenance costs). During the second meeting (Athens, 8-9 November 1990), the Turks proposed a price of 2.93 cents per kwhr, while DEH countered with 2.1 cents. At the third meeting (Smyrna, 19-20 December 1990), the two sides agreed on theoretical methods of determining price, while postponing the practical and precise determination of basic parameters until a later date. During the same meeting, it was also mentioned for the first time that the yearly quantities to be imported by Greece between 1991 and 1994 would be of the order of 1.2 to 1.4 billion kwhr. Two additional meetings have taken place since: the first before the elections on 24 September 1993 at Ankara, and the second on February 23-24 in Athens. At this last meeting, TEK representatives proposed the markedly high price of 6.265 cents for each imported kwhr. It must be noted that the price Turkey is asking is almost double not only the production costs of DEH, but also those of the cost of the notorious BOO facilities which the previous government had negotiated with private interests. Analyses conducted by DEH in regard to the offers made for the Lavrion generating plants led to the conclusion that their production cost would be between 3.5 and 4.0 cents per kwhr, inclusive of the investment cost.
