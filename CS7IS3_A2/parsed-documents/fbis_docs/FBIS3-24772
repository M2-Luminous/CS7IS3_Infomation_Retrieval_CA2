The prime minister said the government, formed in November 1994, had promised to pay salaries in two months, but he admitted that the payments had not yet been made. This is why a government-labor unions joint commission was set up to ensure harmonious payment of salaries throughout the country. Here is Prime Minister Koumakoye. [Begin recording] The government and the labor union movements have set up a joint commission to find out exactly how many months of salaries have been paid. According to the reliable information I got from the General Treasury Service, it is a bit more than 6 billion CFA francs that have been (?disbursed). But which ministries have been paid? Does the Treasurey have a right to continue the payments? These are the questions that need answers. Do not ask a prime minister to be an accountant. To help the public understand what is going on in the country, I recently spoke about the poor management of our human resources. How can one understand the idea that two civil servants working in the same office have been paid differently? One received one year's salary arrears, while the other received five month's arrears. How can this be possible? How can one explain that, in the same prefecture, two civil servants from the same service are paid differently? One received his salary, while the other did not. These are the questions to answer. The government and the labor unions are currently examining the issue so that work as well as Chadians can be rationally managed. Even if the fruit of Chadians' work is meager, it should be fairly shared among them--unless there is none. This is the work we are doing with the labor union movements, and I think that the staunch advocates of the workers are those who do not work well. The [word indistinct] are there, and this Chadian is paid 10 months' salary while that one is paid one month's. In all, it makes 11 months' salary. What is important for us is the amount of salaries paid, and this is what we have noted now. The simplest procedure -- I have already examined this with the labor unions -- is to issue collective checks, which is simple, and to assign each minister to manage his personnel. We are discussing this with the labor unions. We will solve these problems because we have established a joint commission to carry out comprehensive work and because we have come here to find the strategy to avoid what we have already experienced. It is an issue of common sense. We have come to find out together how we can help civil servants avoid further misery and help the Chadians avoid pain. I think this is the purpose of our meeting. It is in this regard that, on behalf of the government, the prime minister announced the government's strategy (?calling for) for positive contributions as others already did through suggestions [words indistinct]. These are the observations that I would like to make. We know one another well. The most important issue today is to agree on the way the country will be managed and [words indistinct] end up with democratic and open elections. [end recording] Concerning the backup measures needed after the devaluation of the CFA franc, the prime minister added that in addition to the measures of conservation already taken and to be taken by the government, taxes will be abolished or reduced. This will be carried out within the framework of the Customs and Economic Union of Central Africa [UDEAC]. Let us listen to him again: [Begin recording] Measures are being examined; namely, the adjustment of prices and taxes so that they can be proportional to Chadian's purchasing power and help reactivate economic activities and, therefore, all of the nation's activities. The document that relates to this issue is (?here) [words indistinct], but it should be noted that it is the UDEAC taxation code that is in force. We cannot unilaterally revise this code without consulting the central African countries, the members of the union. Anyway, the government's duty is to take conservation measures to protect citizens's purchasing power, and we are currently considering such measures. This means that we are currently examining the reduction or abolition of some taxes, as well as the adjustment of a number of prices. We are working on it. Give me time to meet your needs.
