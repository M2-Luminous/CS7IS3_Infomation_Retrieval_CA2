The above poll was conducted by the REZONANSI Sociological Service in Tbilisi on 20-21 February. There were 500 respondents. It is the view of 36.7 percent of Tbilisians that the republic's leaders are using their positions to organize their own personal lives. It has to be said that the view expressed by this 61 percent of the capital's residents cannot be far from the truth as, otherwise, it turns out that Georgia is being led by people who are mentally retarded. If we take into account the superfluous number of leaders, it is impossible for so many people to have ended up in one place by chance, unless, of course, they were specially gathered. One can undoubtedly point out the criminal action or lack of action of the leader and the heads of Parliament and government as a result of which they are condemning a large part of the population to starvation. In a country where almost all products are sold at world prices, the minimum wage amounts to 17 American cents. It also has to be said that, given the excessive size of the apparatus of state officials and their visibly small salaries, the republic's leaders are intentionally pushing them toward corruption. Corruption instituted from the top -- in the police, the Procurator's Office and judicial bodies, and also in structures of local administration -- is having and will have particularly serious consequences. It is suspected that the damage being done to the republic was premeditated, as was the fact that, following ratification of Georgia's membership of the CIS, there was an amazing change overnight in the provision of electric power, water, and transport to the population. Regarding the supply of electric power, prior to ratification of the CIS statutes, the situation prevailing in Georgia was more catastrophic than that in Armenia in the winter of 1992-93, which, for Armenia, had been the worst winter since the outbreak of the war in Nagorno-Karabakh. At that time, Georgia was the only source of electric power for Armenia and, in spite of this, the population was being supplied with electric power regularly and according to schedule and the subway was functioning normally. Moreover, prior to ratification of the CIS statutes, the following situation prevailed in Rustavi [important industrial city south-east of Tbilisi]: A large part of the town had been completely without any electricity and water for three weeks. The population (as in Varketili) [suburb of Tbilisi] had closed the road that needed to be cleaned by the authorities (if we are to believe the rumors being circulated, the city's mayor Areshidze was telling them that they had wanted democracy and this was it). Following ratification of the CIS statutes, the supply of both electric power and water was restored.
