Semenyuk, Minister of Power Engineering and Electrification, Ukraine, by L. Brovchenko: "Paradoxical Situation: Industry Must Struggle to Reduce Its Income"] [Text] Everyone is concerned about the energy situation, and everyone feels the energy crunch. Even television broadcasts had to be curtailed, resulting in a dearth of information in addition to low building temperatures and other forms of distress. These facts formed the topic of our conversation with V. Semenyuk, Minister of Energy and Electrification of Ukraine. [Semenyuk] The situation is very complicated. Our current receipts of fuel--coal, heavy oil, and gas--are running 20 percent below last year's. In other words, we are short 40 billion kilowatt-hours (bKw-h) because of inadequate fuel supplies. Problems with heavy oil and gas--which we get from abroad--are particularly grave. Coal deliveries by the Ukrainian coal miners are more-or-less normal at 100-115 thousand tons a day, but we burn 150-160 thousand tons every day. The difference comes from our reserves, which in better years amounted to ten to 11 million tons. Last year we managed to save eight million tons of coal. At this rate of consumption our reserves of coal will last for another month or so. [Brovchenko] But the winter will last longer than that ... [Semenyuk] There's more! Some power stations have already run out of coal or have only one or two day's supply. Stations that produce heat in addition to electricity have first claim on coal. In short, if the coal industry will produce at the present level, then we can last until February. As far as coal goes, we are optimistic since its used to produced 27-28 percent of our electricity. Since one third of the electricity comes from nuclear power plants, it helps that the parliament lifted the moratorium on the Chernobyl plant which supplies 1.2 to 1.3 bKw-h per month. So far this winter it has produced 8 bKw-h of electricity, which otherwise would have required four million tons of coal. In addition, gas deliveries fell by six billion cubic meters this year. The year before last by December we had consumed 80-82 million cubic meters, and a year ago 56-56.5 million cubic meters. But the worst scenario pertains to heavy oil deliveries which are 15-20 percent below normal. We have only emergency reserves left, leaving unused some 40 percent of the equipment at thermal power stations. The situation is particularly bad at the Burshtyn, Ladyzhan, Trypillya, and Vuhlehirsk plants, followed by Prydniprovsk and Kryvyy Rih stations. [Brovchenko] People are using electric heaters and gas stoves at home and at work for heat, which defeats the entire purpose of conserving our energy resources. What's to be done? [Semenyuk] True. As a result of the overload some one thousand transformer substations have been damaged in November. We haven't been able to repair them yet because of electricity is so cheap--cheaper than energy derived from coal and gas. Everywhere else household electricity costs 1.5 to twice as much as that made available for industrial use and people are less inclined to waste it. Currently, we have established a rate of 90 karbovantsi (krb) for 75 KW-h of electricity for household use. Using any more will cost you 180 krb at cost-recovery rates. With 16 million households, it is impossible to monitor everybody's use, and everything depends on a sense of responsibility and integrity of the consumers. [Brovchenko] That's somewhat utopian. We just got through building a communist society which was to be based on a high sense of responsibility of the citizens and found out that it doesn't work. [Semenyuk] True. We should provide assistance for the poorer segments of the population and charge the wealthier elements a higher rate in order to control energy use. However, a proposal in this vein was not supported by the Council of Ministers. [Brovchenko] So, your industry is short about 20 percent of the fuel it needs to meet the demand for electricity. Will some limits be placed on the use of electricity by consumers? [Semenyuk] We will try to avoid this. We will also try to exclude the fuel industry, community and agricultural facilities, as well as processing, baking, meat and the dairy industries. Machine engineering, chemical and metallurgical industries may be cut back by 40-50 percent. [Brovchenko] What will altering the work schedules give you? [Semenyuk] Reduce peak demands for electricity, although overall consumption will remain the same. [Brovchenko] And what about television stations? [Semenyuk] Curtailing their use saves 3.6 million Kw-h per day, or almost 80 million Kw-h per month, which is equivalent to 40 thousand tons of coal a month. If had enough fuel broadcasting hours would not have been curtailed. [Brovchenko] Its a paradoxical situation. Your profits increase with increased usage of electricity and yet you have to advocate less consumption. [Semenyuk] Unfortunately, that's the case. We cannot stockpile what we produce and production and consumption have to balance. That's why we count so much on a sense of responsibility of the population because of our problems with fuel supplies. We could buy fuel from commercial suppliers, but that requires money. Our consumers owe us three billion karbovantsi. [Brovchenko] How much electricity is produced by hydropower stations? [Semenyuk] The output of Ukrainian hydropower stations is 4.7 million kW-h per year; gas-powered stations produce 4-5 percent of our electricity. A third is produced by nuclear power stations and 66 percent by thermal plants. [Brovchenko] Still, do you lean to optimism or pessimism? [Semenyuk] I think we'll survive the winter.
