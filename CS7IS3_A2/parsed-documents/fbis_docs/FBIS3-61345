These amendments provide for criminal liability for mercenary service, participation in armed conflicts on the territory of other states, and illegal activity by citizens' associations. To be sure, everyone understood that these amendments had been prepared--first and foremost--bearing the UNSO [Ukrainian People's Self-Defense Forces] in mind. The journalist Oleh Yeltsov addressed some questions to Dmytro Korchynskyy, deputy commander of UNSO, on this score. Their discussion is printed below. [Korchynskyy] The enactment of these amendments can be regarded from the following two points of view: political and legalistic. In our opinion, from the legalistic point of view, these amendments are inconsistent with--or even contradict--international norms, the Ukrainian Constitution, and...common sense. Thus, the law in question provides criminal liability for participation in international armed conflicts without the objective of receiving remuneration. Moreover, such persons are really not mercenaries, but rather so-called combatants; and they are protected by various international conventions. Byron, Hemingway, and Che Guevara were combatants. If they were living in Ukraine right now, they would be put behind bars for five years. And, in fact, Hemingway would be sentenced to 12 years because he received payment for his activity. A great deal of interest has also been aroused by the definition of a "militarized formation or unit": It is motivated by the military principle, which includes authority, subordination, and discipline; for how else can a troop formation or sports training be conducted? And so now people will be condemned for discipline and military training. These amendments likewise provide for criminal liability for participating in informal associations. Not even the Bolsheviks attempted to do this when they were in power. From now on, the amateur members of a choral group will be taking a chance if they have failed to register themselves. But it is understood, of course, that the singers will go on singing, while this law will be applied to us--the foes of the present regime. [Yeltsov] Nevertheless, no matter what kind of a thing his new law may be, it has been put into effect. What moves do you intend to make in order to cope with it? [Korchynskyy] I'd like to ask you the following questions: Who will be the judges? In accordance with what kind of legality will they proceed when the state itself is utterly criminal in nature? [Yeltsov] Critical observations and remarks have been directed at the UNA [Ukrainian National Assembly]-UNSO for quite some time now. How do you explain the fact that these "criminal" amendments were enacted precisely at this time? [Korchynskyy] Everything that is occurring in the state now must be perceived within the following overall context: ruination of the credit, financing, and banking system, the actions of the government directed at incapacitating any kind of economic life at all.... That is to say, those very same persons who are attacking the foundations of economic life are also attacking us. And they certainly do sense the threat--or at least the genuine inconvenience--which is personified by our organization. They are moved by a trend to step up the persecutions of our self-defense forces and the UNA structures with strikes and free trade unions. The regime has begun to be agitated by the fact that the working people's actions are assuming more organized features. An increasingly greater number of workers are coming to the conclusion that the path of strikes and trade-union methods alone will not correct the situation. And--here and there in the localities--a genuine threat is already being posed to this government. [Yeltsov] In such cases, what will be your specific actions in the situation which has evolved? [Korchynskyy] We are being provoked to take revenge. And, indeed, it's no problem for us to beat up this or that bureaucrat, or to "put down" a certain number of persons. Believe me, we have gained enough combat experience for this purpose at various points of military confrontation. However, it is not revenge that we need, but rather victory. We will not fall into the trap of yielding to such a provocation. If we were to set for ourselves the mission of overthrowing and ruining this state, then it would not be hard to accomplish that. We have experience in acting under the conditions of destruction. [Yeltsov] Then what is it that you are striving for? [Korchynskyy] We are for order and a strong state. [Yeltsov] What kind of a path do you see in order to attain such goals? [Korchynskyy] Cooperation and consolidation among the UNSO, the political power of the UNA, the officer corps, the national capital, and the independent unions. If such a constructive force were to be finally and definitively formed, the present-day regime would be toppled without any bloodshed and with the maximum legitimacy. [Yeltsov] But let's turn from the political program to your orientation with regard to today's legislative space. As of now, UNSO activity has already been designated or categorized as illegal. Will your actions be aimed at going underground or at endeavoring to become legalized? [Korchynskyy] First of all, we will be utilizing the possibilities of legal activity. We will try to register our units in the localities. [Yeltsov] But if your attempts to become included within the power structure prove vain and useless, what kinds of actions will you take then? [Korchynskyy] It is undoubtedly the case that the potentials of the MVS [expansion not given] are incomparably greater than those of the UNSO. I have only a few thousand comrades-in-arms. But all of them have been tried and tested in combat actions; they have gathered together and are bonded by their own blood. In our organization we do not betray each other. That is to say, we jusge a person by his healthy, human instincts. But a situation could evolve whereby our organization couldbe deprived of its leadership--a leadership which has made no effort to hide itself from the present-day authorities. And then uncontrolled actions by our fellows could not be ruled out. [Yeltsov] But against whom would they take action: against the government, the parliament...? [Korchynskyy] On that score I'm sure that it would be an unmotivated kind of terror. And history has emphasized that unmotivated terror is the most effective. [Yeltsov] A great many rumors continue to abound concerning the existence of reserve supplies of firearms in the possession of the UNSO. [Korchynskyy] It would be simply senseless for us to stockpile such weapons. Practical experience in military conflicts on the territory of the CIS has attested that arms should not be gathered in such stockpiles. They will appear as soon as the need for them arises. We do not need to seek out weapons--they are all around us. [Yeltsov] Rumors are also spreading about the existence of a ruthlessly severe security service in your organization... [Korchynskyy] The best security system is a sure system of relations in the midst of the organization itself. And in connection with underground activity, centralization is even detrimental.
