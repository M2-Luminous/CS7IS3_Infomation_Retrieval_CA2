FR940913-2-00044 FR940913-2-00029 [Docket No. TM95&hyph;2&hyph;34&hyph;000] Florida Gas Transmission Co; Fuel Reimbursement Charge Adjustment Report September 2, 1994. Take notice that on August 31, 1994, Florida Gas Transmission Company (FGT), tendered for filing a Fuel Reimbursement Charge Adjustment Report pursuant to Section 27 of the General Terms and Conditions of its FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1. FGT states that the ratio of fuel usage and unaccounted for volumes to actual deliveries determined in accordance with Section 27 of its tariff and reflected on an attached workpaper is 2.31%. Because this percentage supports the currently effective Fuel Reimbursement Charge Percentage of 2.25% requested in FGT's out-of-cycle filing on May 11, 1994, in Docket No. TM94&hyph;5&hyph;34 and approved by Commission order issued June 17, 1994, and because changes in the Percentage must be reflected in all Shippers' arrangements with suppliers and upstream transporters and/or gatherers, FGT is not proposing any revisions at this time. Therefore, no tariff sheets are filed with the report. FGT further states it will continue to closely monitor the actual quantities of fuel and lost and unaccounted for gas as information becomes available and make such adjustments to the Fuel Reimbursement Charge Percentage as warranted in accordance with Section 27 in order to closely match the fuel retention with actual operating experience and minimize the over or under retention of company used fuel and unaccounted for volumes. FGT states that copies of the filing were mailed to all customers serviced under the rate schedules affected by the filing and the interested state commissions. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE, Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Sections 385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before September 13, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the Public Reference Room.
