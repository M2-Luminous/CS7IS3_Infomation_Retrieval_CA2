In 1993 the sector's turnover was 780 million yuan (over 90 million U.S. dollars), 70 percent up over the previous year and ranking among the top performers in the country. Last year the booming economy of Guangxi provided a profitable market for posts and telecommunications. The business volume of the postal service increased by 22 percent over 1992. International and domestic express mails were up 45.6 percent and 202 percent, respectively, over the previous year. Postal savings bank deposits amounted to 1.5 billion yuan (nearly 200 million U.S. dollars)-worth by the end of the year. The business volume of telecommunications services increased by 103 percent, which was 34 percentage points higher than the national average. In 1993 Guangxi telephone subscribers in urban areas increased by 83,000, bringing the total number to 240,000. Mobile phone carriers in the region reached 13,000 in 1993, 6.2 times more than in the previous year. The total number is now 15,000. In 1993 Guangxi invested 1.25 billion yuan in 368 fixed-assets projects for posts and telecommunication, four times more than 1992. Five optical-fiber cable lines have been put into operation, including ones from the regional capital of Nanning to Guangzhou, Pingxiang and Beihai. The telephone operation capacity of the region's 46 cities and counties has been upgraded. More lines were added to long-distance telephone exchanges in the regional network. The region has made efforts to attract foreign funds in developing posts and telecommunication facilities. More than 80 million U.S. dollars in government loans from foreign countries, including Germany, Belgium and Finland, have been used. It also signed 60 import contracts with Sweden, the United States, the Republic of Korea, Japan and Hong Kong, with the total contract value amounting to 100 million U.S. dollars. Meanwhile, the region plans to invest two billion yuan this year in over 400 projects, including construction of a 600,000-line program-controlled telephone exchange project, 3,000 km of optical-fiber cable lines, and 60 mobile telephone stations.
