FR940805-1-00030 FR940805-1-00004 Last, the Commission is proposing to require the oil pipelines to file their applications with the Commission on an electronic medium in addition to the paper filing. The formats for the electronic filing and the paper copy will be obtainable at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Public Reference and Files Maintenance Branch, 941 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426. The Commission intends to establish the formats in cooperation with the oil pipeline industry. VIII. Environmental Analysis The Commission is required to prepare an Environmental Assessment or an Environmental Impact Statement for any action that may have a significant adverse effect on the human environment. 29 The Commission has categorically excluded certain actions from these requirements as not having a significant effect on the human environment. 30 The action proposed here is procedural in nature and therefore falls within the categorical exclusions provided in the Commission's regulations. 31 Therefore, neither an environmental impact statement nor an environmental assessment is necessary and will not be prepared in this rulemaking. 29 Order No. 486, Regulations Implementing the National Environmental Policy Act, 52 FR 47,897 (Dec. 17, 1987), FERC Statutes and Regulations, Regulations Preambles 1986&hyph;1990 Â¶ 30,783 (1987). 30 18 CFR 380.4. 31 See 18 CFR 380.4(a)(2)(ii). IX. Reporting Flexibility Certification The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) 32 generally requires the Commission to describe the impact that a proposed rule would have on small entities or to certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. An analysis is not required if a proposed rule will not have such an impact. 33 Most oil pipelines to whom the proposed rule would apply do not fall within the definition of small entity. 34 Consequently, pursuant to section 605(b) of the RFA, the Commission certifies that the proposed regulations, if promulgated, will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. 32 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612. 33 5 U.S.C. 605(b). 34 Section 601(c) of the RFA defines a ``small entity'' as a small business, a small not-for-profit enterprise, or a small governmental jurisdiction. A ``small business'' is defined by reference to section 3 of the Small Business Act as an enterprise which is ``independently owned and operated and which is not dominant in its field of operation.'' 15 U.S.C. 632(a). X. Information Collection Requirements The Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) regulations 35 require that OMB approve certain information and recordkeeping requirements imposed by an agency. The information collection requirements in this proposed rule are contained in FERC&hyph;550 ``Oil Pipeline Rates: Tariff Filings'' (1902&hyph;0089). 35 5 CFR 1320.14. The Commission's Office of Pipeline Regulation uses the data collected in these information requirements to investigate the rates charged by oil pipeline companies subject to its jurisdiction, to determine the reasonableness of rates, and when appropriate prescribe just and reasonable rates. In addition, the information to be required by the proposed rule would allow the Commission to determine if an oil pipeline lacks significant power in the relevant markets when it proposes to charge market-based rates. Because the adoption of the proposed procedural rules would create an expected increase in the public reporting burden under FERC&hyph;550, the Commission is submitting a copy of the proposed rule to OMB for its review and approval. Interested persons may obtain information on these reporting requirements by contacting the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 941 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426 [Attention: Michael Miller, Information Services Division, (202) 208&hyph;1415], Comments on the requirements of this rule can be sent to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of OMB (Attention: Desk Officer for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission). XI. Comment Procedures The Commission invites interested persons to submit written comments on the proposals of this NOPR. As much as possible, the comments should be keyed to the topic headings of this NOPR. An original and 14 copies of the written comments must be filed with the Commission no later than 30 days after the date of publication in the Federal Register . Comments should be submitted to the Office of the Secretary, Federal Energy Regulation Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C., 20426, and should refer to Docket No. RM94&hyph;1&hyph;000. All written comments will be placed in the Commission's public files and will be available for inspection in the Commission's Public Reference Room at 941 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C., 20426, during regular business hours. List of Subjects in 18 CFR Part 348 Pipelines, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. By direction of the Commission. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
