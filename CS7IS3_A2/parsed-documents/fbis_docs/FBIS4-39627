The Russian head of government was wearing not a hospital gown but a severe suit. He looked somewhat tired, but he was right on form. The prime minister said that he had come to Germany on an unofficial, private visit in order to consult local medics on a kidney stone [kamenno-pochechnyy] disorder. "The diagnosis has already been made in Russia, but I would like to have a second opinion." Professor Rudolf Khoyenfellner, under whose direction medical tests were conducted, refused to go into medical details: "We are obliged to observe medical confidentiality. There are no grounds now for breaking this rule. We regard illness as a personal problem." [Yavlyanskiy] Is this an ordinary case of kidney stone disease? [Khoyenfellner] Stones are, in general, something abnormal. Although we do frequently encounter this ailment. It is just that in this case we are dealing with a somewhat unusual form of the disorder. Questions to Chernomyrdin: [Unidentified journalist] What is of most concern to you now, taking a global view of the world? [Chernomyrdin] Affairs in Russia. Our country is going through a difficult period. Much depends on the government for which I am responsible. We are now proposing a number of additional measures to accelerate the reforms. I am in no doubt that a turning point will come. I am taking the opportunity to work here as well. One of the chief issues is to attract foreign investments. [Unidentified journalist] Are you planning to pay an official visit to Germany this year? [Chernomyrdin] To be honest, both countries need such contacts. There are plans for such a trip. But it has not yet been decided exactly when. [Unidentified journalist] It is said that you are writing your memoirs and intend to publish them in Germany.... [Chernomyrdin] I have already answered this question in Krasnodar recently. I am not writing anything. I am not in the mood for these things now. I am no writer. I do not regard myself as one. That is not even in my thoughts. It is incredible! Does this mean that people are saying I traveled south to write my memoirs? In fact I spent three days sitting in a helicopter, dashing about the region. [Unidentified journalist] What if you are offered an operation? [Chernomyrdin] It is not very complex, the way I understand it. We will get it done here and complete the treatment in Russia.
