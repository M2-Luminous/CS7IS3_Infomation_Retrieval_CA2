The Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] has multiplied the number of its members in recent years. However, only 7 percent of citizens voted in favor of the KDNP, a party that represents Christian-national values. We asked KDNP Deputy Chairman Laszlo Varga about the causes of this unexpected failure. [Banhidi] You declared repeatedly that, in the past, the Hungarian people never gave more than 16 percent of their votes to either the extreme right, the arrow-cross people, or the communists. In view of the results of the first round of the elections in which the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] received 32 percent, what is your opinion about such an expression of the voters' will? [Varga] Indeed, I mentioned this repeatedly during our campaign meetings in the capital and in the provinces. I also declared in front of prominent foreign guests present at the conference of the European Democratic Union in Budapest that they are now in a country where people never lost their senses and never gave more than 16 percent votes to either the arrow-cross people or the communists. And now, the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] received as many votes as the arrow-cross people and the communists together. I see a simple explanation for this, namely that, in democracy, every government has to go if it is unable to deal with unemployment and inflation. Of course, there is no rule to this, and there is no exception to the rule either. People see and feel politics on their own skin and through the increase in their own expenses. Some 20 percent of our 2.5 million pensioners are living on the boundary of the subsistence minimum, and we have an unemployment rate of almost 500,000 people. In such a situation, these people cannot think further than everyday problems and subsistence. The citizens decided to have another government. This would take care of the election issue, but the situation is not that simple after all. No matter how many mistakes this government made, and every government makes mistakes, they are not the only ones that caused the problems; the fact that a socialist economy had to be turned into a market economy in the course of the change in the regime also had its share. The Hungarian population failed to consider and evaluate this. [Banhidi] At least on the basis of the first round of elections, we can say that the socialist-liberal advance in Hungary is unique in Europe, and the consequences of this phenomenon are unpredictable.... [Varga] I agree that such an advance of the left and of the liberal trend is a unique phenomenon on the map of Europe. However, we set the pillars of democracy, and I continue to have confidence in the common sense of the Hungarian people. I regard the first round of elections a little as a mistake, haste, and even defiance, rather than a real stand in favor of the MSZP ideology. At the same time, in my opinion, one should not be afraid of a left-wing danger because, the left that is regarded as left in the classic sense of the word in Europe does not exist in Hungary. Rather, I see a danger in the fact that we do not yet know which, and how many, people there are in the MSZP who are still there from among the old communists. Although transformed, this party came from the past, and it is difficult to forget that. [Banhidi] Many people think that the socialists' victory is also due to the exaggerated national and Christian line and manifestations of the coalition.... [Varga] It is possible that the national-Christian concept has become overused. One can overuse a slogan, but if this slogan has content, I think the use and depth of this slogan must affect the people. If we take the composition of our current population, people between 15 and 50 years of age make up 60 percent of the population. In the previous regime, these people grew totally disaccustomed to the national and Christian values or their internal content. Governments and powers come and go but, in a democracy, the people find out quickly whether the promises are really fulfilled. [Banhidi] In evaluating the results of the first round, one can hear voices according to which a certain process of change has started in the KDNP and this could even lead to a change in the person of the party chairman. [Varga] The mandate of everyone in the KDNP will come to an end this year. The debates are natural, and they were strong after the first round of the elections. [Banhidi] Has any national committee member accepted personal responsibility? [Varga] There has not been any one like that, and I did not hear of any calling to account. [passage omitted] [Banhidi] There are people who think that those who voted in favor of the MSZP are confusing the concepts of settling accounts and revenge. The socialists have not yet announced their candidate for the position of prime minister, but Gyula Horn would accept the position if the MSZP members decided in favor of this.... [Varga] We do not yet know whether Gyula Horn will become prime minister; nor do we know yet whether the MSZP will get an absolute majority after the second round. The key position is now in the hands of the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]. A lot will depend on their results. [passage omitted]
