"It is time for the regional and international communities to come to the assistance of the people of St. Kitts and Nevis in finding a solution to our problems before the situation escalates further," the party said in a statement. The party is pressing for fresh general elections, arguing that the minority coalition government formed by Prime Minister Kennedy Simmonds' People's Action Movement [PAM] and the Nevis Reformation Party has no moral authority to run the twin-island state. The coalition holds five of the eleven seats in parliament. The Labour Party has four (like PAM) and the Concerned Citizen's Movement two. On Wednesday, Labour Party supporters took their campaign for fresh elections to parliament, meeting for the first time since the November 29 election. Outside parliament, they clashed with police, who fired stun grenades to keep back the crowd and clear the way after the presentation of the traditional throne speech for the exit of Governor-general Sir Clement Arrindell, Prime Minister Simmonds and other officials. At least two persons were reported to have been injured. The Labour Party said parliament "was opened amid loud noises from unarmed people calling for fresh elections, shattering glass and bottles, smoke bombs, tear gas explosions and concussion bombs fired on the protesters by the police". The party said businesses and banks had been closed, school children sent home and government departments closed to the public. It accused the government of "repressive and military action ... just to open parliament". The party said it was clear "that the people of St. Kitts do not intend to accept the Simmonds regime, and they would continue to struggle for the government of their choice and for fairness and justice until Dr Simmonds honours the agreement he made with the national church leaders for fresh elections within six months". Simmonds described the protest action as "unfortunate and really distressing". The police reported the incident had been brought under control by midday.
