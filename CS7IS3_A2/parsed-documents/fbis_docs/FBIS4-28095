The nine-member panel, established by Hata's predecessor Morihiro Hosokawa earlier this year, is scheduled to offer recommendations to Hata by summer for a revision of the national defense program outline, which has served as Japan's basic defense policy since 1976. A panel member, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that the current concept should be changed following the end of the Cold War era because the concept still assumes large-scale disputes between the United States and the former Soviet Union. The group so far has discussed post-Cold War developments around the world and the military situation surrounding Japan. The panel is going to present an assessment of international situations that the world has changed from the U.S.-Soviet confrontation to a new international order where complex threats spread. The sources said that the planned new concept will pledge to maintain defense capability improvements based on the U.S.-Japan security pact. They said the new concept will not aim at specific threats to Japan. The new concept will also urge readiness for regional conflicts, terrorist attacks and cooperation for U.N. peacekeeping operation, the sources said. Observers said a new concept will demand a thorough review of the current level of Self-Defense Forces strength and formation. Based on the panel's recommendations, defense policies, including Japan's future role in U.N.-led peacekeeping operations, will likely be revised in time for inclusion in the Defense Agency's budget requests for fiscal 1995.
