[Kostikov] B.N. Yeltsin's initiative has led to a major Russian diplomatic victory not only on the European stage but on the world stage as well. Without a single shot being fired, without threatening anyone or posing a risk to our soldiers' lives, and without spending a single ruble, Russia has effectively won a most important battle for its world status. It is not just that Russia has returned to the sources of its historical political role in the Balkans by protecting the Serbs, who are close to us in religious, cultural, and national terms. Russia has firmly marked out the parameters of its influence in Europe and the world. It has become clear that no small or great power can fail to take account of Russia's position and national interests. It has become clear that no international organization of a universal or military character can make effective decisions unless it takes account of Moscow's voice. The illusory nature of the notion that any major problem in Eastern Europe can be resolved behind Russia's back has become apparent. It has become clearer that though it is withdrawing its military contingents from Central and East European countries, in full accordance with Russia's new foreign policy doctrine, Moscow remains a powerful and significant presence in Europe by virtue of its national policy. [Burmistenko] The communist opposition has recently accused B.N. Yeltsin of diminishing Russia's status as a great power. Is there any basis for this? [Kostikov] The Russian president's actions and their consequences have revealed a fact that is extremely important for world politics as a whole. They have stressed the role of the great powers, and particularly of Russia, in resolving international conflicts. Let us recall how much time, effort, and talk have been expended by the United Nations and NATO in order to deal with the conflict. As a result of all these diplomatic maneuvers, the world very nearly found itself on the brink of a world crisis which threatened to spill over into war and drag in the major powers. The Russian president has made a single strong chess move, and the threat has been averted and preconditions have been created for a definitive settlement. So I think it would be more accurate to talk about B.N. Yeltsin's role in restoring Russia's status as a great power. [Burmistenko] What impact might the resolution of the Sarajevo conflict have on the internal political situation in Russia? [Kostikov] Let us recall how many spiteful and often venomous barbs have been cast in Boris Yeltsin's direction on this score by our ultranationalists. There are few deadly sins the president has not been accused of: betraying our national interests, forgetting our national dignity, selling Russia off to the evil West, and surrendering Russian positions to the United States, and how much political speculation there has been! Only lazy people have not gone to former Yugoslavia in order to accumulate political capital, so to speak. Without leaving Moscow, President Yeltsin has achieved what the political chatterers could not and did not achieve. He has actually demonstrated the provision enshrined in the new Constitution which says that the Russian president is the guarantor of the country's national interests. Calmly, without haste and without excessive publicity and ballyhoo, he has shown that as of today he is the indisputable leader of Russia. It is sufficient to ask just one question: Who other than Yeltsin could currently say things, and say them in such a way, that he will be listened to in Sarajevo, Europe, and the world? Nobody else, in my opinion. This, incidentally, sheds indirect light on the issue which the communist opposition is currently making such a fuss about: Should Russia make haste to hold presidential elections? Should all sorts of commissions be established to investigate the events of 3-4 October with a single and clearly provocative objective -- to give the president a "nasty nip." [Burmistenko] Can we expect some other new steps from B.N. Yeltsin regarding the resolution of the crisis in Sarajevo? [Kostikov] The president's opponents have always maintained that Yeltsin is unpredictable, extravagant, and impulsive.... Over the past few days, during the Bosnian crisis, we have if you like seen a new president of Russia: A predictable, calculating, and crafty diplomat who is sure of himself and his country's policy. By his initiative, the president has created good preconditions for resolving the crisis. I think this political capital should be carefully developed and built up by diplomatic efforts. Without excluding the leaders of other countries, of course, or international organizations. It seems to me that an international conference at the highest level is called for in order to settle the issue once and for all. And Russians can rest assured that their national interests and the interests of Russia's traditional allies will be reliably protected.
