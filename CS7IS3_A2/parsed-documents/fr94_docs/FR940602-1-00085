ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) today proposes to amend its regulations under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) governing the permitting of hazardous waste management facilities. This proposed rule expands the opportunities for public involvement by allowing public participation at an earlier point in the permitting process for all RCRA facilities, and during key permitting milestones. This proposed rule also amends and clarifies permit modification classifications pertaining to combustion facilities. Finally, this proposed rule amends the procedures for interim status combustion facilities during the trial burn period by making the procedures more equivalent to the procedures governing permitted facilities. DATES: Comments on this proposed rule must be submitted on or before August 1, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments on this proposal should be addressed to the docket clerk at the following address: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, RCRA Docket (5305), 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460. Commenters should send one original and two copies and place the docket number (F&hyph;94&hyph;PPCP-FFFFF) in the comments.
