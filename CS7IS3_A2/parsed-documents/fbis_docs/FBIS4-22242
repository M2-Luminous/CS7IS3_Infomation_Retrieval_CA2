FBIS4-22242 "jpusr033___94004" FBIS-USR-94-033 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 4 April 1994 RUSSIA POLITICAL AFFAIRS ZAVTRA on `Who Comes After Yeltsin' ZAVTRA on `Who Comes After Yeltsin' 944F0461A Vladimir ZAVTRA in Russian No 9, Mar 94 pp 1, 3 944F0461A Vladimir ZAVTRA Russian CSO [Excerpts from the DEN Analytical Center's report on potential presidential contenders in Russia: "Who Comes After Yeltsin?"] [Text] It is symptomatic that the leading world research centers follow increasingly attentively the dramatic struggle unfolding in the Russian Federation in anticipation of President Yeltsin's imminent departure from the political scene. More and more materials on this topic appear on the pages of the 50 most influential periodicals of the world's leading counties. Questions regarding the current Russian president's state of health can be heard increasingly often at press conferences of Western statesmen returning from Moscow.... Meanwhile, the corrupt Russian "democratic" publications and television continue cheerfully to maintain that "everything is okay" with Yeltsin. The DEN Analytical Center's experts, using some methodology of the contents, morphological, and factor analysis, have studied and sifted through hundreds of materials published in the mass media, as well as research and forecasting reports prepared by various science institutions and special services on the problem "Yeltsin and Who Comes After Him?" Below are some excepts from this report. Why Yeltsin Will Soon Leave In keeping with the current Constitution, new presidential elections are scheduled for 1996. Most serious analysts both in Russia and abroad, however, including CIA "Kremlinologists," believe that new presidential elections most likely will take place much earlier. The reason is increasingly intensifying problems related to B. Yeltsin's health. In the assessment of American and German physicians, the current master of the Kremlin suffers from pathological changes in the brain caused by complications following an acute middle ear infection, liver cirrhosis, renal insufficiency, and lately also rapidly progressing stenocardia. He periodically undergoes hemodialysis (blood transfusions) and can no longer maintain a regular work schedule. B. Yeltsin's periods of normal state of mind increasingly often give way to deep depression, which can cause certain changes in the logic of thinking and brings persistent thoughts of suicide. Since February 1993, the president has had to rest and undergo treatment for 15 days on average every month. B. Yeltsin also has fully expended himself as a politician; in principle, he is no longer able to offer anything to lead the country out of the wide-scale, systemic crisis (proof of that is the president's February state of the union address). Having finally realized the meaninglessness of the October bloody massacre and the inexorable impending economic collapse, B. Yeltsin has found himself in political zugzwang. Trying to maneuver, he only creates the appearance of activity, although in reality he can no longer change anything even if wanted to. He simply does not have the proper tools for this: The state apparat has been practically destroyed by him and his inner circle in the course of "democratic" purges and "reforming," while the remnants of this apparat are extremely corrupt and the economy is inexorably sliding into a coma, since the real administrative levers have been lost in the course of Gaydar's "reforms." The president's inner circle is perfectly well aware that B. Yeltsin is broken morally and psychologically, and contemplate increasingly often his early resignation (according to Sergey Filatov). What keeps him from this is probably the fear of culpability--not so much in a moral as in a criminal sense, the charges of which the new authorities may bring against him regardless of their political coloration. In addition, he may be forced to resign under the pressure of a mass protest movement, caused by potential avalanche-like enterprise stoppages, the blood clots of insolvency, growing unemployment, and a sharp decline in the standard of living. Strikes and serious mass unrest may reach a critical point as early as by April-May. It is significant that in this situation it is precisely those who until recently had been B. Yeltsin's closest confederates--Ye. Gaydar, V. Shumeyko, G. Burbulis, G. Popov, Yu. Luzhkov, and even V. Chernomyrdin--are ready to "surrender" their president in order to shift onto him all the responsibility for the national catastrophe. Some Western special services' analysts do not rule out the possibility of physical removal of B. Yeltsin in the event that the situation get worse, for the purpose of "tying up loose ends." As an argument in favor of the probability of such a variant they cite completely irrational actions of the president's associates involving various destructive reorganizations of special services, which has caused a sharply negative reaction among many staff members of the Main Protection Directorate, the Vympel special unit, and the Federal Counterintelligence Service. Besides, these structures also can be used by the mafia in order to bring their own man to power with the help of a terrorist act. The `Leader's' Heirs Last year B. Yeltsin promised the Russian people "to find and nurture" his successor, who could guarantee the continuation of his reforms. One of the first to proclaim himself the successor of the increasingly infirm leader of democrats was Ye. Gaydar. He got the presidential seat in his sights, at the same time disregarding objective circumstances that were not shaping in his favor. Despite the loud crash of Gaydar's reforms, which were being implemented without any thought-through plan and assessment of potential consequences, the commissar's grandson did not learn any lessons from it. Repeating the hackneyed free-market incantations during his election campaign, and having spent about 15 billion rubles [R] contributed by such financial giants as Menatep, Most-Bank, Stolichnyy, Tokobank, and Inkombank, he led Russia's Choice to a crushing defeat. And this is keeping in mind that he had at his disposal all the capabilities of the state apparat, which was utilized and directed by S. Filatov. Nevertheless, Ye. Gaydar, who is very susceptible to the crudest flattery, undertook to set up his own party, which he intends to use as a tool in his struggle for the president's job. More farsighted radical democrats, however--such as G. Burbulis, B. Fedorov, and others, including old Democratic Russia hands L. Ponomarev and G. Yakunin--looked skeptically at this idea. Gaydar does not have much of a chance to create an effective national party, especially considering that G. Burbulis, S. Filatov, and others already had announced more than once the creation of a "Yeltsinite" presidential party but had failed. Despite the support of a considerable part of financial capital, small speculative business, criminal-mafiosi clans, as well as most of the mass media, as the economic crisis deepens, Ye. Gaydar's hopes for making it to the presidency become increasingly ephemeral. It is actually to the advantage of Ye. Gaydar's competitors that he of all people intends to declare himself the leader of the radical democratic forces at the elections. Ye. Gaydar's current fellow travelers and allies--K. Borovoy, with his Economic Freedom Party, and P. Bunich's coalition--do not have any serious influence on the population today. Most importantly, Ye. Gaydar does not have either slogans that are attractive for the entire spectrum of public opinion nor original ideas and plans capable of solving Russia's problems. It is not accidental that such experienced politicians in the United Sates as Secretary of State W. Christopher and Clinton's personal friend S. Talbott have already practically written off Ye. Gaydar. Federation Council Chairman V. Shumeyko considers himself a potential successor to the current Kremlin ruler. So far he has not officially declared his claim to the presidency, but inside his inner circle, during drunken parties and in public baths, he boasts of his tallness and thick hair as the most necessary prerequisites, in his opinion, for the future president of Russia. During the years of B. Yeltsin's rule, V. Shumeyko has climbed a career ladder from director of a medium-caliber plant in Krasnodar to deputy speaker of the Russian parliament, and then a first deputy prime minister, who delivered to the leader-president the adoption of his new Constitution, which in turn earned him the place of the first chairman of the parliament's upper chamber. Truly a glittering career for a mediocre man, who possesses neither global thinking nor the serious experience of a major politician and administrator, not to speak of elementary decency. In his ascent to the pinnacle of power, he was helped by such personal traits as unscrupulousness, perfidy, and cynical hedging. That the notorious international-scale fortune-seeker D. Yakubovskiy is V. Shumeyko's closest confederate-- and according to wicked tongues, also his treasurer--speaks for itself. Now, using his position to establish contacts with the regions, V. Shumeyko is preparing for himself a base for a presidential race. At the same time, he has no chances of winning the fight for the president's job. Influential regional leaders treat him with barely concealed contempt, while the general public has not forgotten the general procuracy's investigation of V. Shumeyko's case on charges of corruption. The next potential successor to B. Yeltsin and his political disciple is S. Shakhray, who began speaking of his presidential ambitions as early as in the spring 1993. S. Shakhray acts more cautiously today; he learns from other, more experienced politicians, and persistently conducts active organizational work, setting up structures for the election race. Despite a de facto defeat in the parliamentary elections, the Party of Russian Unity and Accord [PRES], which he had created, did pass its first durability test. PARES possesses weak but nevertheless realistically operating organizations in a whole number of regions. During the election campaign S. Shakhray received substantial financial support mainly from commercial structures controlled by V. Chernomyrdin's group. In the words of V. Shokhin, spoken in confidence in a small circle, "....when Serezha (Shakhray) saw that he was not getting anywhere with the party (PRES), he dropped on his knees before the prime minister, begging, `I will do everything you say, just help me.' It was then that V. Chernomyrdin gave him both the money and the Gazprom infrastructure...." S. Shakhray for all practical purposes has created the PRES Central Committee apparat using as a base the Ministry of Ethnic Affairs and Regional Policy, and uses his official capacity as a minister to strengthen party positions at the local level. He strives to expand the infrastructure of his support in the center and the regions, using K. Zatulin's entrepreneurs union, and is attempting to set up an information corporation made up of a number of newspapers, magazines, and radio and television programs, united by regional and national subject matter. S. Shakhray displays cynicism, unscrupulousness, and an orientation on political expediency at any cost. Today he behaves "flexibly": He proclaims his cooperation with the communists in the State Duma; he supported the exoneration of the October events' participants. The work he had organized with respect to signing a treaty with Tatarstan was completed successfully and the treaty signed. Also, S. Shakhray skillfully made use of the idea first put forward by Yu. Skokov--forming the Russian state in the current environment on a treaty-federative basis, which allows for the solution of a multitude of complex ethnic and regional problems. This is despite the fact that only recently S. Shakhray, together with S. Filatov, had been a vehement opponent both of the idea and of Yu. Skokov himself. S. Shakhray possesses a specific momentary thinking, and the complex of a provincial Komsomol [All-Union Leninist Communist Youth League] functionary who has suddenly found himself in a high-level job in the capital. He is well known for unrestrained self- advertising; the desire always to say something in the mass media-- with or without good reason; handing out numerous promises, which remain just empty words; and the inability independently to solve major and complex problems. All of this makes him rather a lightweight in the eyes of the political establishment. "For Russians, the short, round Shakhray, with his magnificent mustache, is more an object of insulting jokes than a real political figure." Because of this, it will be difficult for him to change his negative image in the foreseeable future; keeping also in mind that he lacks constructive global ideas on how to lead the country out of the economic dead end, his chances in the fight for the presidency are extremely low. Besides, over the past few weeks S. Shakhray's financial support has dropped dramatically. History has the last laugh: People who make it to the top are most often not the most honest and intelligent but the most crafty and brazen ones. An example: the so-called mayor of Moscow Yu. Luzhkov (illegally appointed to this job some time in the past by B. Yeltsin). Actually, today, when he has already begun his own election campaign, Luzhkov no longer publicly swears allegiance to the president. Under Mr. Luzhkov, the capital city turned into a huge refuse pit, one of the largest criminal centers in the country. Moscow is today one of the ten most dangerous capitals in the world. Just recently, demonstrating his loyalty to B. Yeltsin and "democratic ideals," Luzhkov several times used the capital city militia for brutal beatings of old men and children. He is one of the main figures responsible for the mass murder of Russian citizens in October 1993. Now, however, the hour has struck for another merrymaking feast of political monkeys! Today Yu. Luzhkov presents himself as the defender of "ordinary people," fights A. Chubays, no longer threatens "Red-and-browns" with prison and execution. At a recent February meeting with Afghan war veterans, Yuriy Mikhaylovich beat himself on his broad chest and sincerely swore that he "had never been a democrat." And when he was asked how he felt about G. Yakunin, the capital city mayor said without blinking an eye: "People like Yakunin should be drowned in an ice-hole!" Luzhkov is supported by large banks and companies; the key role among thenm belongs to Most-bank (Gusinskiy-Luzhkov's financial group). Gusinskiy himself had been nurtured by that same Mr. Mayor through famous Moscow food credits! Generally speaking, in terms of financial clout only Chernomyrdin can compete with Luzhkov. According to some information, in setting up his organizational structure Yu. Luzhkov allocated R9 billion for boosting the land- assembly movement alone. The wags have it that the authors of panegyrics glorifying Luzhkov, which were published in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, ROSSIYA, and other periodicals, each received $10,000 from the generous mayor. Luzhkov, however, is aware of his very vulnerable spots that may deprive him of a realistic shot at the presidency. V. Chernomyrdin is a probable, albeit temporary, successor to B. Yeltsin in the event of the latter's early retirement. Having achieved no positive results in improving the economy and continuing along the general line of Gaydar's course toward the destruction of Russian industry, V. Chernomyrdin nevertheless has invested maximum effort in the strengthening of his support base--the financial-industrial group, which includes Gazprom, the Imperial Bank, and Lukoil Company. The prime minister has a serious financial base for a presidential election campaign and his own loyal people in many bodies of executive branch. At the same time, he has a rather weak standing in the mass media, which are mainly controlled by old (Ye. Yakovlev) and new (O. Poptsov, M. Poltoranin) democrats or by information concerns (NTV, INTERFAX, the SEGODNYA newspaper, and others), which are owned by the Most Group and take a generally anti-Chernomyrdin stance. Some experts believe that since Ye. Gaydar's resignation, B. Yeltsin does not have anybody except the current prime minister on whom to shift the blame for the disintegration of the economy. If the president does decide to take this step, this will postpone for B. Yeltsin--although not for long--the inexorable fate of facing his own culpability. V. Chernomyrdin does not have any strategy; therefore, he clumsily maneuvers in search of support: He attempts to get interaction with the parliament going; is willing to form an alliance with Yu. Luzhkov; flirts with Yu. Skokov's Producers Union and the trade unions. All of this is unlikely to help him, though: He does not have realistic concepts for getting out of the crisis, and even less so the ability to implement them. In addition, no one in the current political circles in Russia has forgotten that it was V. Chernomyrdin's actions that have led to the bloody tragedy on the night from 3 to 4 October 1993. While G. Burbulis in the Kremlin together with M. Poltoranin tried to calm down B. Yeltsin, who was already preparing to flee Moscow, the prime minister organized at the Staraya Ploshchad a headquarters for the takeover of the House of Soviets. It was V. Chernomyrdin who saved B. Yeltsin's regime, and now, "having used him as needed, they may dispose of him." In this connection, it is unlikely that V. Chernomyrdin will make a promising political figure, especially keeping in mind that it is obvious for both the "left" and the "right" that he is not capable of effective action. Thus, in the opinion of leading Western analysts, none of the political figures whom B. Yeltsin in principle could proclaim his heir can be seen today as a favorite at the next presidential elections. Moreover, all of them already are making an effort to distance themselves to some degree or other from B. Yeltsin in order to avoid sharing with him the political responsibility for the economic collapse and degradation of the state. The Main Contenders If presidential elections were to be held in the next two or three months, V. Zhirinovskiy would have a very good chance. A talented populist, he at this point successfully expresses in his communications the emotional state of the Russian people, the inner psychological tension of ordinary people accumulated over the years of the Yeltsin regime's rule. The success at the parliamentary elections in December 1993 made the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] leader the most famous Russian politician in the world after B. Yeltsin. V. Zhirinovskiy and his party enjoy the support not only of marginal strata, but also of a number of commercial structures, including the Neftekhim trading house, a consortium of Russian-Dutch financial investment companies, and so on. Sharp criticism of the current regime and demonstration of patriotic convictions will allow V. Zhirinovskiy to gather a considerable vote at the upcoming presidential elections (I will repeat: If they take place within the next two or three months). Nevertheless, V. Zhirinovskiy cannot realistically count on winning. His behavior in the parliament and during foreign trips, his propensity for catchy slogans without any concrete deeds, and his rowdiness gradually build up an opinion of him among a considerable part of the population as a cheap politico demagogue incapable of real deeds. Naturally, this is not happening without purposeful activity on the part of the "democratic press"; however, the LDPR leader himself all too often provides the pretext. Besides, many of those who voted for V. Zhirinovskiy in the transient turmoil of the December elections gradually begin to reorient themselves toward leaders from the CP RF [Communist Party of the Russian Federation], ROS [Russian All-People's Union), and so on. A factor that will also work against V. Zhirinovskiy is that he practically supported B. Yeltsin in the October events. Besides, the LDPR leader does not have a real team, any innovative ideas on how to overcome the economic catastrophe, and so on. Fearing V. Zhirinovskiy, special agents of the current regime rushed, or were implanted, into his inner circle--people who have links with criminal structures and big "dirty" banking business. The purpose: If attempts to buy off or completely discredit the LDPR leader fail, at least influence his entourage. A serious contender for the president's job today is A. Rutskoy. In the environment of growing economic difficulties, for which ordinary people justifiably blame the president and the government, support for Rutskoy as a charismatic leader, a fighter and defender of the underdog, who suffered personally from the antipopular regime, will be objectively increasing. If his health permits, A. Rutskoy may lead a united opposition by becoming its symbol. It cannot be precluded that in the event of mass unrest and strikes after the forced resignation of B. Yeltsin, the Federal Assembly as the only legitimate body in this situation may directly entrust carrying out the president's duties to A. Rutskoy, since his removal and arrest were clearly unconstitutional. The events of the past three years show, however, that A. Rutskoy, an unquestionably honest and sincere man, has turned out to be impulsive, uncalculating, and an insufficiently experienced politician, without a strong team. In the opinion of some Rand Corporation experts, A. Rutskoy and his closest confederates were unable in September-October of 1993 objectively to assess and influence the situation and to take the necessary and effective measures against B. Yeltsin's anticonstitutional actions, although they had an opportunity to do so. One of the analysts in the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense writes: "It is hard to talk about people who behaved with dignity and suffered for their mistakes. There is no guarantee, however, that A. Rutskoy will not again fall for deception and will not take unfounded actions that will play into the hands of strategic enemies of Russia." Another weakness of the vice president is that while proclaiming correct, patriotic slogans, he does not have enough political and economic experience as well as organizational skills to develop and painstakingly implement a clear anticrisis program, without which the country's revival is impossible. He also does not have a real political infrastructure. Unfortunately, detention has not improved the health of the twice-wounded Afghan war veteran, Hero of the Soviet Union A. Rutskoy. High blood pressure and other health problems will not help him, either, to make a successful bid for the presidency, in the event that he decides to go ahead with it. Another notable political leader who so far has not announced his presidential intentions but certainly has good grounds for it is the Communists' leader, G. Zyuganov. He heads a truly broad-based, national party with sufficiently strict internal discipline. Despite his practically complete isolation from the mass media in the course of the December election campaign, the CP RF achieved good results. The image of G. Zyuganov as a reasonable, principled man protecting the national interests of Russia has contributed to the Communist Party's shedding of the bogeyman image that B. Yeltsin and Democratic Russia had successfully used to scare the people as late as on the eve of last year's April referendum. Even in the West, G. Zyuganov is perceived today as an acceptable leader of a civilized party, rather than an extremist thirsting for class revenge. Theoretically, G. Zyuganov's political knowledge and practical experience of organizational work make him a contender for the high state post. However, the CP RF's weak financial base, lack of serious positions in the mass media, and the persisting negative attitude toward Communists on the part of a considerable part of society--first and foremost entrepreneurs--do not allow the party to count on a singlehanded victory in the presidential elections. Most likely, it would be expedient for the Communists during the presidential elections to form a bloc with patriotic and some centrist forces in order to nominate one candidate, who then could count on realistic success. In this case G. Zyuganov and his party colleagues could gain important state jobs in order to exert effective influence on the political course of the new president. One German journalist called Yuriy Skokov "a serious man, who speaks only when he has something to say." The former Security Council secretary, and currently the chairman of the Producers Union, recently announced that he may run in the presidential elections in 1996. A vehement opponent of savage experiments on the nation, a clever and calculating technocrat, capable of putting forward deep and well-thought-through ideas, Yu. Skokov may become one of the most promising candidates. It is not accidental that in December 1993 Ye. Gaydar said that he sees Yu. Skokov as one of his most dangerous opponents. Yu. Skokov's personal modesty, decency, laconic speech, and the high expectations he places on himself and others are to a certain extent reminiscent of Yu. Andropov and A. Kosygin. Men like this traditionally are respected by the Russian people. An economic practitioner and a realist politician, Yu. Skokov does indeed have a score of strategic concepts, whose implementation will make it possible to avert further political and social polarization in society, to start implementing a concrete operational plan for stabilizing the economic situation. He is well known and appreciated by directors of factories grinding to a halt, and by heads of republics, krays, and oblasts that are barely making ends meet. Yu. Skokov's main shortcoming is that he is practically unknown to popular public opinion in the country, even though in influential elite circles--military, political, trade union, and others--he commands respect and authority. In the final analysis, Yu. Skokov's political fate depends on whether he will be able to change the trend of being kept in the shadows of silence. Another shortcoming of Yu. Skokov's candidacy is that despite his adherence to the idea of a civilized, nationally oriented market, he does not have well developed links with entrepreneurial circles. Potential Figures S. Baburin, who a few days ago was nominated as a presidential candidate by the Russian All-People's Union, hardly has a chance not only of victory but even of making it to the second round of voting. However, ROS, which was eliminated from the December election campaign, may take quite a few votes away from V. Zhirinovskiy at the upcoming presidential elections (by the estimates of a number of Western experts, S. Baburin may gather 7-8 percent of the vote). At the same time, ROS' coalition with the communists, agrarians, and some part of the centrists oriented toward a strong state, and their joint nomination of a candidate with an unblemished reputation may bring the "left" and patriotic forces victory in the presidential elections. The Russian "democratic" and the Western media on the threshold of the December 1993 elections frequently mentioned G. Yavlinskiy as a favorite. In fact, along with Russia's Choice, "Yabloko" [the Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc] was generously financed by Most-bank, Stolichnyy Bank, and others, probably on the assumption that it was safer to bet on several horses. Yavlinskiy was lauded in all sorts of ways "as a sober and intelligent free-market reformer" by such leaders of businessmen's associations as M. Masarskiy and M. Yuryev; M. Gorbachev supported him in every way possible, including financially. At the same time, the criticism of the most odious consequences of Gaydar's reform should have brought him, in G. Yavlinskiy's design, the support of ordinary people. However, "G. Yavlinskiy's party" did not achieve the expected results. This happened because, as a well-known American journalist in Moscow put it, "G. Yavlinskiy, not only for you Russians, but also for us Americans, is the same as Gaydar, except somewhat slimmer and somewhat smarter. But in essence he is the same kind of armchair theoretician, with a propensity for macroeconomic experiments `at any cost'...." Like S. Shakhray and other "perestroyka chickens," G. Yavlinskiy is unscrupulous and a big mouth: One day he denounces B. Yeltsin's September state coup; then on the night from 3 to 4 October on television he urges a merciless crackdown on the defenders of the Constitution. G. Yavlinskiy's loss at the December elections was predetermined in many respects by the fact that a firm idea has formed in the public opinion of him as a man who lusts for power at any cost. Therefore, despite the support of Americans who are already turning away from Ye. Gaydar, and the help of the "democratic press" curators A. Yakovlev and Ye. Yakovlev, Yavlinskiy was doomed (by the way, after the December elections the Yakovlev duo also cooled off to Gorbachev's pet). The provinces, the Russian backwoods, have a very negative attitude toward G. Yavlinskiy. That is why he was not able and probably will not be able to build a national movement, party, or other structure drawing on a mass support. One of the most significant factors in the upcoming presidential campaign may be the nomination of V. Zorkin, the former chairman of the Constitutional Court. Among the strongest suits of the current Constitutional Court member V. Zorkin is his uncompromising moral position, adherence to the letter and the spirit of the law, and a certain emotional attractiveness of his personality in the public opinion. He has coalition potential, which gives him the ability to bring under his banners a certain part of the centrist and left-of- center political spectrum. At the same time, Western experts analyzing the chances of various contenders for the Russian Federation presidency, also note certain shortcomings in his position. In particular, he lacks a serious political infrastructure and does not have an effective economic strategy for overcoming the current economic crisis; his financial resources for the dynamic conduct of the presidential race are unknown; he does not have a team or experience of leading tightly-knit political groups. Some Conclusions ....3. Three problems will be decisive for the upcoming presidential election campaign in Russia: attitude to the October tragedy; the extent of corruption at the top; and the economic crisis theme. 4. A key, but outwardly still latent problem during the presidential campaign will be the issue not of access to the highest state position but the ability to utilize this authority. Therefore, the candidate who will have the best chances will be the one to provide an adequate answer to two principal questions: What to do and how to do it.... 7. Since the country lacks unarguably personality-based charismatic leaders (even Zhirinovskiy represents only a weak type of situation-engendered charisma), much will be decided by the character and pace of forming electoral coalitions. Of particular importance in this will be not the size of political coalitions per se, but the organic nature of their structure. Many of current unofficial candidates for the Russian presidency very soon will begin bitter bargaining in order to set the price at which they will join some or other coalition.... 8. Judging by all signs, the emergence of "dark horses," that is, some completely unknown figures, during the presidential race is extremely unlikely. If this does happen, it would be for only one reason: the desire of some political players to split an opponent's coalition (or prevent the creation of an unacceptable coalition).... * * * * The political time of the first president of Russia is inexorably approaching its end. Quite possibly, Boris Yeltsin today is one of the unhappiest men in the country. Maniacal suspiciousness, dark forebodings, fatigue, and pain constantly press upon this man. Was he ever sincere? Even if he had been.... "The road to hell is paved with good intentions." He will also remain in history as Boris the Bloody. In October 1988 Yeltsin spoke with inspiration beautiful words about democracy, freedom, and human rights. In October 1993, children were being killed at his order. Some time a long time ago, a father told his son some wise words: "Do not try to get where you do not belong." Boris did not listen. B. Yeltsin's presidency turned into a tragedy for the country, Dramatic events expect the second president.... And still.... "The future is perfect, for it is unknown."
