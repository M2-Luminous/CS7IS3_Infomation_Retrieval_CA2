As your ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent has learned from reliable sources, documents providing for an increase in the minimum wage in the country have already been placed on the desk of Government Chairman Viktor Chernomyrdin. According to the Labor Ministry's proposals adjusted to take into account the opinion of the Finance Ministry and the Federation of Independent Trade Unions, it is proposed to index the minimum wage by a factor of 1.4 as of 1 July. Thus it will rise from 14,620 rubles [R] to R20,500. The same factor will be applied to the calculation of wages in the budget-funded sectors of the economy. Category One of the Single Wages Schedule, which determines wages in all budget-funded organizations, will rise from R16,000 to R22,400. This is the figure which will form the basis for setting the wages of workers in the public sector. The Labor Ministry's proposals finally reflect the differentiated approach to the formation of the incomes of various categories of workers. In practice, this should mean extra financial increments that will be paid to workers in the first four categories of the Single Wages Schedule. Total pay in, for example, Category One will be no less than the minimum pension plus all the extras [nakrutki], and this will amount to R39,000. This will be the actual rate for a worker in Category One of the Single Wages Schedule. This is surely the first time in the short history of pay indexation that these proposals have been given the full support of the Finance Ministry. Furthermore, the financial experts have given an assurance that if this indexation is implemented as of 1 July, as planned, the money required for that purpose will be allocated from the budget in full and in that month.
