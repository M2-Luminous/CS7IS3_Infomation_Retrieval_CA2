It paid a midday "official" (provincial press service) visit to Salzburg. According to the Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe] group of the provincial parliament, the delegation had been invited by the "Group of Liberal Entrepreneurs" (RFW), whose federal chairman is Helmut Haigermoser, an FPOe deputy in the federal parliament. The Iraqis were received by Margot Hofer, the future third diet president of the FPOe. Hofer reported that the Iraqis had pointed to the "disastrous humanitarian situation" and the "high infant mortality." If this is true, the sanctions should be lifted, she said. Last year a trip by FPOe politicians, including Haigermoser, to Iraq, which is being boycotted by the international community, sparked harsh criticism. The FPOe delegation visited Baghdad at the invitation of Husayn's regime.
