Mitterrand scored an 48 percent approval rating in April, up by one point from the previous month, against Balladur's 42 percent, down from 47, according to the Gallup poll published by the weekly EXPRESS magazine. Amongst those interviewed, 40 percent disapproved of Mitterrand's actions, down from 41 the month before, and a steady 12 percent gave no opinion. Balladur's disapproval rating rose by seven points to 51 percent. Seven percent would not give an opinion. The poll, taken on a sample of 945 people around France, was conducted on Thursday March 31 and Friday April 1 just after Balladur's government had ordered an embarrassing climbdown over plans to introduce a cut-price youth wage. Balladur had enjoyed a long political honeymoon since coming to office in 1993 but has recently taken something of a political battering with a series of run-ins with French fishermen, airline workers and students.
