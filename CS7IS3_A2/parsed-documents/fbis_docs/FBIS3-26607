Premier Lien made the remarks during his year-end news conference at the Government Information Office. Lien took office in February last year. "The life of a politician is short, but the life of the nation is forever," Lien said, asking the mainland leaders to be ever mindful of the future development for all of China. If the Chinese Communists continue to take the zero-sum approach to debase Taiwan, treating Taiwan as a renegade province, then unification of this kind will be called "annexation," Lien declared. "The One-China policy is the nation's fundamental policy, but this China is currently divided," Lien said. "The Republic of China is a sovereign nation founded in 1912, but currently the ROC rules only reach Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu." Lien added, "Realistically speaking the discussion of the sovereignty issue should be put aside at the present stage when considering the issues relating to foreign affairs and mainland policy." The so-called transitional Two-Chinas policy declared by Economics Minister Chiang Pin-kung during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit conference in Seattle last fall was not a change of the government's mainland policy but was meant only to point out the reality existing between the two sides, Lien said. The relationship between Taiwan and mainland are that of siblings, not enemies," Lien told some 100 local and foreign reporters. "There is no real animosity between Chinese people of the two sides, and together we can create a future of freedom, security and prosperity." But until Beijing authorities abandon their hostility, Taipei would not consider opening the so-called "three communications" -- direct trade, mail and transportation across the Taiwan Strait, the premier indicated. Last December, Economics Minister Chiang said the government should lift the ban to allow direct sea links between Taiwan and the mainland between certain designated cities and harbors to reduce transportation costs. But Lien said yesterday the time is not ripe to deal with such a complex issue from a purely economic angle. Beijing will first need to show its sincerity by recognizing Taipei as a separate political unit, Renouncing the use of military force against Taiwan and halting a campaign to isolate Taiwan in the international arena, Lien said. The government will continue to regulate Taiwan investment on the mainland based on the National Unification Guidelines, according to Lien, who said he does not think the economic activities should be separated from politics.
