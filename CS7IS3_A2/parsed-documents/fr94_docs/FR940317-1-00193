FR940317-1-00193 FR940317-1-00016 NRMSIRs were discussed in the Adopting Release, where the Commission noted that in determining whether a particular entity is a NRMSIR, it would look, among other things, at whether the repository: (1) Is national in scope; (2) maintains current, accurate information about municipal offerings in the form of official statements; (3) has effective retrieval and dissemination systems; (4) places no limits on the issuers from which it will accept official statements or related information; (5) provides access to the documents deposited with it to anyone willing and able to pay the applicable fees; and (6) charges reasonable fees. 27 The Joint Statement has further refined the concept to suggest the designation of state-based repositories, and the creation of an index, maintained by the MSRB, for market participants to learn of the availability of information provided to the MSRB or to a NRMSIR. 28 27 See Adopting Release, supra note 6 at 54 FR 28808, n.65. 28 The Joint Statement suggested that in order to be recognized as a NRMSIR, a repository should, among other things: (1) maintain current, accurate information about municipal securities in the form of annual financial reports, operating data, and other current information; (2) have an effective retrieval and dissemination system; (3) place no limits on the issuers from which it will accept information unless it is a single-state repository; (4) provide access to the documents to anyone willing and able to pay the applicable fee; (5) charge reasonable fees; (6) collect information on at least a state-wide basis; and (7) provide for timely notification to an MSRB index of names of issuers about which it is to receive information. Joint Statement, supra note 15 at Addendum. The proposed amendments do not define the term NRMSIR. The Commission requests comment on whether NRMSIR should be defined in the rule, with specific standards established for NRMSIRs. If standards were established, the Commission believes the following standards are appropriate. It requests comment on these standards. NRMSIRs should maintain current, accurate information about municipal securities, including final official statements, the issuers' annual financial information, and issuers' notices of material events. Moreover, NRMSIRs should have effective systems for the timely collection, indexing, storage, and retrieval of these documents. NRMSIRs should be capable of national dissemination of final official statements, annual financial information, and notices of material events through electronic dissemination systems, in response to telephone inquiries, and hard copy delivery via facsimile, by mail, and by messenger service. Specific dissemination systems and standards should be delineated in order to emphasize the importance of effective information dissemination. Timely public availability upon receipt of information by a NRMSIR also is important. For example, final official statements and annual financial information could be made available by the next business day after their receipt by a NRMSIR, and notices of material events could be made available within fifteen minutes of their receipt by a NRMSIR. Comment is requested on the provision by NRMSIRs of electronic dissemination of information, and on the suggested timing requirements for availability of documents for dissemination. Repositories created and operated by states would be required to accept submissions from all issuers within their own states, and would not be permitted to accept documents from issuers in any other state. National dissemination requirements, however, would be applicable to single-state repositories. All other repositories would not be permitted to limit the issuers from which they will accept final official statements, annual financial information, and reports of material events. Comment is requested on whether state-based repositories can serve as an effective means to disseminate information to the market for a nationally traded security, so the issuer of that security can meet its disclosure obligations using a state-based repository. Comment also is requested on whether a significant number of states are willing to make the necessary financial commitment to create a state-based system. NRMSIRs would not be permitted to discriminate on the basis of the requestor in providing documents, and would be required to charge reasonable fees. Finally, in order to implement the indexing system suggested by the Joint Statement, a NRMSIR would be required to provide notice to the MSRB of its designation by an issuer as the repository for the issuer's final official statements, annual financial information, and notices of material events. This would allow the creation of an index by the MSRB for informing the municipal securities market of where an issuer is sending its secondary market disclosure. Comment is requested on the feasibility of expanding this provision to require a NRMSIR to inform the MSRB whenever it receives information from an issuer. Comment also is requested on whether documents should be required to be placed with the MSRB either in addition to or in lieu of a NRMSIR. 29 29 See supra note 25 (regarding the competitive implications of the MSRB's seeking NRMSIR status). The MSRB has expressed concern that permitting issuers to place documents with multiple NRMSIRs may result in repositories receiving information at different times. This raises the issue of when the information becomes ``public,'' and thus when dealers are considered accountable for it. 30 Comment is requested on these issues, and, in particular, on how to assure that NRMSIRs simultaneously receive secondary market disclosure. Comment also is requested on whether any proposal should require that secondary market disclosure is deposited with all designated NRMSIRs. In addition, comment is requested on whether the proposal should designate specific methods for sending information to NRMSIRs. 30 Letter from Christopher A. Taylor, Executive Director, MSRB, to Catherine McGuire, Chief Counsel, Division of Market Regulation, SEC (December 20, 1993). Since the Commission adopted Rule 15c2&hyph;12, the Division of Market Regulation has issued three letters taking no-action positions recognizing national information vendors as NRMSIRS, based on the standards set out in the Adopting Release. 31 The Commission anticipates that if standards for NRMSIRs were adopted, these NRMSIRs, as well as new NRMSIRs, would be required to have their operations meet the new standards. Comment is requested on the ability and willingness of both potential NRMSIRs, and those presently operating under no-action letters, to meet the standards described. Furthermore, comment is requested as to whether designation by Commission order, pursuant to standards set out in Rule 15c2&hyph;12, is an appropriate method for recognizing NRMSIRs, or whether it is appropriate to continue the current no-action policies of the Division. 31 Letters from Richard G. Ketchum, Director, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, to: Joseph V. Riccobono, Executive Vice-President, American Banker-Bond Buyer (Jan. 4, 1990); J. Kevin Kenny, President, Chief Executive Officer, J.J. Kenny Co. (Jan. 4, 1990); and Michael R. Bloomberg, President, Bloomberg, L.P. (Jan. 11, 1990). IV. Application of the Tower Amendment With the passage of the Securities Acts Amendments of 1975 (``1975 Amendments''), Congress provided for a limited regulatory scheme for municipal securities. 32 Prior to the passage of the 1975 Amendments, municipal issuers were exempt from the registration and continuous reporting provisions of both the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. While municipal issuers continued to be exempt from all but the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, the 1975 Amendments required the registration of municipal securities brokers and dealers, 33 and established the MSRB, 34 granting it the authority to promulgate rules governing the sale of municipal securities. 32 The Securities Acts Amendments of 1975, Pub. L. 94&hyph;29, 89 Stat. 97 (June 4, 1975). 33 15 U.S.C. 78 o &hyph;4(a)(1). 34 15 U.S.C. 78 o &hyph;4(b)(1).
