The meeting of the two presidents, which was held on the territories of the two states, had a characteristic course and contents. At first, discussions were held at the presidential residence in the Albanian town of Podgradec by the side of Lake Ohrid. In the afternoon the Albanian delegation headed by President Berisha crossed the Albanian-Macedonian border for a short visit to Ohrid and made a tour of the cultural and historical monuments together with the Macedonian delegation headed by President Kiro Gligorov. President Berisha welcomed Macedonian President Gligorov in front of the residence and the two presidents held private talks for an hour. After that the two delegations joined the discussions. Then Gligorov and Berisha went for a short walk along the side of the lake, stopping for a brief discussion near the lake. They held discussions without an interpreter. After the discussions, both presidents made statements to journalists, assessing the talks as very positive, fruitful, and as a step forward in the development of relations between the two states. Moreover, we found out from unofficial sources that the talks were held in an open, friendly, and relaxed atmosphere, that a number of questions were raised, and that it was concluded that there were not and that there should not be open questions between the two states. We have also found out that President Berisha confirmed that Albania would support the admission of Macedonia to the CSCE. The Albanian side also supported the census in Macedonia. In his statement to journalists Berisha said that he had invited President Gligorov, his wife, and his closest associates to spend the weekend together, so, as he put it, "the meeting is not official, but friendly, and I need hardly assure you that it is very positive. We have had open, friendly discussions and we talked particularly about cooperation between the two countries. We agreed to work on deepening this cooperation. Substantially, we talked about better communications between the two countries. The opening of the air traffic route Skopje-Tirana is very important." The two sides assessed the signing of a great number of agreements as very useful because they will promote this kind of cooperation. For instance, the transportation of goods and people by rail, and so on. Sali Berisha also said that Albania was ready to help store 1.5 million tonnes of fuel in Albanian ports and depots, as well as another million tonnes of other goods. "I think it is very important," he said, "to abolish visa requirements for the two border zones for a distance of 20 to 25 kilometers, on which the two sides will have to agree. This will be one of the initial steps toward a total abolition of visa requirements. The signing of other agreements, such as the one on economic cooperation and on guarantees for investment, will encourage better opportunities for the promotion of cooperation and friendship between the two states." "We," Berisha said, " discussed political cooperation, too, as well as relations in the Balkans. I personally welcome the efforts of President Gligorov to carry out the census in Macedonia and to pass the law on the census, as well as for the further promotion of the rights of Albanians in Macedonia, for the daily publication of the newspaper "Flaka et Vllazerimit," for the expansion of radio and television broadcasts in the Albanian language, for opening a faculty for teachers in Skopje, for the expansion of the secondary school system, and so on. All these will increase the role of the Albanian factor for the stability of Macedonia and of the Albanian population in Macedonia. We also encourage the contribution of the Albanian political forces in Macedonia within the framework of the government coalition to the stability of the state. We also discussed the development of the situation in the region. Both countries are resolute in their efforts to be integrated into Europe and European institutions. At the same time, both countries are resolute in overcoming the present difficulties through dialogue. Ultimately, we think that the cooperation between Albania and Macedonia represents a contribution not only on the bilateral, but also on the regional plane. President Gligorov has invited me for an official visit to Macedonia, which I have accepted with pleasure," Berisha said in conclusion. President Kiro Gligorov told the journalists that the two delegations had discussed a number of questions related to further cooperation in all fields in an unofficial but friendly atmosphere on this beautiful day. "In this respect," Gligorov said, "we have a broad understanding of the need to promote cooperation between the two neighboring countries, for which we have concluded that there are a lot of possibilities and a lot of reasons. The absence of a railroad track connecting our two neighboring countries is not normal. That is a remnant of the past. The most fruitful cooperation is cooperation between neighbors in the first place. Such things as a railroad track, with the possibility of using the ports in Albania, as we have been offered here, open perspectives for promoting overall economic cooperation. In addition, after the establishment of diplomatic relations at the highest level, our relations need legal regulation. In order to build relations on a long-term basis it is necessary to have regular cooperation in all fields. It can help not only the promotion of economic cooperation but also the security of the borders. We spoke of an agreement on economic cooperation, on guarantees for mutual investment in order to avoid double taxation, an agreement on cultural cooperation, and mutual care for the borders and a gradual increase of traffic there." "All the neighboring countries," Gligorov continued, "ease traffic and economic cooperation between people at the borders. We have to urge the experts in this direction, to make them sit down and discuss that. Concerning our cooperation in the Balkans, we have concluded there are many reasons for maintaining peace and stability. We have remained outside this senseless war and I think we have to secure this. That is another reason for good cooperation. It is of extraordinary importance to take the necessary measures in each country for the Albanians in Macedonia and the Macedonians in Albania to feel they are in their own state, and our mutual assessment was that the implementation of the census will cancel one item from the agenda that was causing or could cause misunderstandings. In each country it is necessary to know the number of citizens who consider themselves Albanians or Macedonians; in each country they are citizens who must enjoy all their rights and have all their responsibilities. This and the atmosphere at our discussions, with a common European orientation, must represent a reason for the respective ministries to meet; we must urge more frequent and more successful meetings between our economists, as well as other delegations, in order to construct an atmosphere of greater confidence day by day." "The official visit of President Berisha to Macedonia will be of great importance. So far all our meetings have produced results and proved our good relations. I hope that at the next official visit of Sali Berisha to Macedonia we shall make a step forward. I am grateful for the cordial hospitality," Gligorov said. After lunch at the residence both delegations left for Ohrid where they visited cultural and historical monuments. Presidents Gligorov and Berisha visited Saint Clement's Church, the gallery of icons in the church, and Saint Sofia's Church, and then they took a walk in the old part of the town as far as the port. In a good mood and in nice weather President Berisha showed a special interest in Ohrid's historical sights. After a short rest in the "Biljana" residence in Ohrid, Sali Berisha returned to Albania.
