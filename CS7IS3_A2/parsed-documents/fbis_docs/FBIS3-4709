This means that North Korea has broken the promise it made after a working-level contact with the United States in New York on 26 February. North Korea made an abrupt announcement of the delay in expressing its position after the South-North Liaison Office at Panmunjom closed at 1600 [0700 GMT] on 28 February, embarrassing our government. The government analyzes that North Korea is delaying in expressing its position because it has not yet made a clear decision on its position on South-North dialogue. In the course of its negotiations with the United States, North Korea has insisted on resolving the nuclear issue through "an agreement between North Korea and the United States," trying to exclude South-North dialogue. North Korea opposed the stipulation of the South-North envoy exchange up to the last moment in the DPRK-U.S. working-level contacts that were resumed in New York on 22 February and created a crisis in which the nuclear inspection team's entry into North Korea was doubtful. North Korea is probably calculating that by making the South lose face on South-North dialogue, it will gain the upper hand in negotiations when working-level contacts are resumed. This can be one of the reasons North Korea is delaying in expressing its position. North Korea, however, is not likely to ultimately refuse South-North working-level contacts. It seems that when working-level contacts are resumed, intensive discussions will be held on the subjects the South and North Korean envoys will discuss and the method of exchange of the envoys. South and North Korea failed to reach a complete agreement on this matter until they concluded the third working-level contact on 25 October 1993. In the third contact, they came to a virtual agreement on the level and mission of envoys by agreeing that "high-level envoys nominated by the top authorities" of South and North Korea will "deliver verbally each top authority's intent and personal letter" to the other side. Our side proposed hypothetically [chusangjoguro] that "they discuss the nuclear issue and the implementation of the South-North basic agreement," while North Korea clearly suggested that they discuss the implementation of the declaration of denuclearization, measures for easing tensions and implementing the North-South agreement, the promotion of the grand unity of the whole nation, pending issues between the two sides, and the South-North summit talks. It seems that there will be no problem with this matter as our side at a meeting of unification-related ministers on 27 February expressed the position that the envoys "can discuss not only the nuclear issue and the issue of summit talks, but anything else." North Korea's demand for the "suspension of the South's nuclear war exercise" and the "abandonment of the international cooperation system," which North Korea persistently raised in South-North working-level contacts last year -- no matter what the agenda items of each contact were -- cannot be a big problem, either, because it will be met automatically when the North Korean nuclear issue is resolved.
