"I do not believe we are in the business of going to war in order to create conditions of peace. And I don't think either the world or the contributing nations would accept that." With Gorazde "on the edge of a major humanitarian disaster", as he told BBC Radio 4, and with the Serbs pouring shells into the town at the rate of one every 20 seconds, Gen Rose has few options -- short of "going to war" -- to stop the Serbs doing what they want. The pressures on him are immense. Bringing to the job the authority and background to take a more robust approach to delivering aid he succeeded far beyond expectations, both in brokering a ceasefire between Croats and Muslims and in forcing the removal of Serb guns around Sarajevo. But the pressures that defeated his three predecessors were always present and are currently defeating him. White-painted vehicles cannot be used for combat. His main problem has been to distinguish between the UN Security Council resolution that created a "safe area" around Gorazde and other enclaves and one that calls for the protection of UN personnel if they come under attack. He indicated yesterday he remains torn between the two. "I am responsible for the lives of 15,500 young men and women here who have been sent here as peacekeepers, not to fight a war," he said in Sarajevo. "My responsibility is to them as much as it is to the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina." The threat of air strikes succeeded around the safe haven of Sarajevo, but Gorazde required close air support operations that were quite different. Instead of the precision strike aircraft that Nato had planned to use in operations against artillery and command bunkers around Sarajevo, Gen Rose could only call on available "cab rank" close air support aircraft to attack opportunity targets around Gorazde. The Serbs had the advantage of time and place in their attacks: the Nato pilots were handicapped by bad weather, and by rules of engagement that require positive visual identification of specific tanks or guns threatening UN personnel directly. American pressures to make no distinction between defending UN personnel and protecting safe areas -- as stated by Mr Warren Christopher, Secretary of State, a week ago -- appeared to confuse the UN. While officials at the NATO air headquarters in Italy pressed for a wide-scale bombing campaign to stop Serb tanks, Gen Rose was pressed by Mr Yasushi Akashi, the UN Secretary-General's special representative, to use close air support strikes only when absolutely necessary. Mr Akashi won. Gen Rose was reminded that he is a UN officer on a peacemaking mission. The resulting close air support actions were too little and too late. While properly prepared air strikes could still check the Serbs, largely with American aircraft, Gen Rose knows that the Bosnian Serbs still have more than 100 UN hostages, with opportunities for grabbing others, and that he has very little hope of getting more troops to reinforce his peacemaking efforts. Yesterday, he could only hope that the Serbs will be merciful in their victory at Gorazde. "I very much hope the situation will slowly return to normality, that we can prevent a humanitarian disaster around Gorazde and we can then go back to what we're supposed to be doing here and that is helping to return this country to peace and normality," he said. Deflated and without his usual bounce, Gen Rose sounded bitter at the duplicity and treachery of the Bosnian Serb leadership. "It is a very sad day for the world when peace-keeping is used as a cover for the prosecution of war aims in such a blatant fashion. The assurances that were given repeatedly during the peace talks over the last week to people like Mr Akashi, and indeed to Mr Churkin (the Russian envoy) have been totally ignored. "We now arrive at a very very sad situation indeed. However, you do have to put that against our overall mandate here in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is obviously a force for peace. And if you look at what has been achieved in central Bosnia and in and around Sarajevo you will find that life is slowly returning to normal." His options to help Gorazde now are limited to trying to get medical help to the town. But even in that Gen Rose said he depended on the agreement of the Serbs to let casualty evacuation convoys in. The Serbs, he said, did not advise it "for the moment," and he admitted it may be another day or two before they do.
