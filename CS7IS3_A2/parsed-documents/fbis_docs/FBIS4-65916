He presented a set of propositions to the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance Wednesday on cooperation, notably on creating a mechanism for consultation on security in Europe and throughout the world, and on increased military and political cooperation. A well-placed NATO source said Wednesday that the Russian minister proposed levels of participation proportional to Moscow's military weight, indicating an enthusiasm exceeding all expectations. "We thought (Russia) was only prepared to dabble its toe in the PFP, but Grachev indicated it was ready to dive in," the NATO source said. But Grachev also called for a formal system of consultations between Moscow and NATO on European and world security. He reiterated Russia's wish for regular and automatic meetings with NATO at all political and military levels. The Atlantic alliance is resisting any formal commitment to such consultations. "NATO is not ready or willing to give any droit de regard (right of influence) or even worse a veto over its activities," NATO deputy secretary general Sergio Balanzino told a press conference Wednesday. Balanzino, the chairman of Wednesday's meeting, suggested that NATO was willing to accept the evolution of a "constructive and substantial dialogue" if Russia embraced the military partnership. But NATO rejected a treaty formalising bilateral relations with Russia, although it did not rule out a less formal declaration when Moscow signs the PFP.
