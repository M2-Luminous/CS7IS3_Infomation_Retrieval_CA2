FR940810-0-00203 FR940810-0-00021 A rotating mechanical stage is convenient for use with polarized light. 6.2.6. Phase telescope. 6.2.7. Stage micrometer with 0.01&hyph;mm subdivisions. 6.2.8. Phase-shift test slide, mark II (Available from PTR optics Ltd., and also McCrone). 6.2.9. Precleaned glass slides, 25 mm X 75 mm. One end can be frosted for convenience in writing sample numbers, etc., or paste-on labels can be used. 6.2.10. Cover glass # 1 1/2. 6.2.11. Scalpel ( # 10, curved blade). 6.2.12. Fine tipped forceps. 6.2.13. Aluminum block for clearing filter (see Appendix D and Figure 4). 6.2.14. Automatic adjustable pipette, 100- to 500- m L. 6.2.15. Micropipette, 5 m L. 6.3. Reagents 6.3.1. Acetone (HPLC grade). 6.3.2. Triacetin (glycerol triacetate). 6.3.3. Lacquer or nail polish. 6.4. Standard Preparation A way to prepare standard asbestos samples of known concentration has not been developed. It is possible to prepare replicate samples of nearly equal concentration. This has been performed through the PAT program. These asbestos samples are distributed by the AIHA to participating laboratories. Since only about one-fourth of a 25&hyph;mm sample membrane is required for an asbestos count, any PAT sample can serve as a ``standard'' for replicate counting. 6.5. Sample Mounting Note: See Safety Precautions in Section 6.1. before proceeding. The objective is to produce samples with a smooth (non-grainy) background in a medium with a refractive index of approximately 1.46. The technique below collapses the filter for easier focusing and produces permanent mounts which are useful for quality control and interlaboratory comparison. An aluminum block or similar device is required for sample preparation. A drawing is shown in Figure 4. 6.5.1. Heat the aluminum block to about 70 â—‹ C. The hot block should not be used on any surface that can be damaged by either the heat or from exposure to acetone. 6.5.2. Ensure that the glass slides and cover glasses are free of dust and fibers. 6.5.3. Remove the top plug to prevent a vacuum when the cassette is opened. Clean the outside of the cassette if necessary. Cut the seal and/or tape on the cassette with a razor blade. Very carefully separate the base from the extension cowl, leaving the filter and backup pad in the base. 6.5.4. With a rocking motion cut a triangular wedge from the filter using the scalpel. This wedge should be one-sixth to one-fourth of the filter. Grasp the filter wedge with the forceps on the perimeter of the filter which was clamped between the cassette pieces. DO NOT TOUCH the filter with your finger. Place the filter on the glass slide sample side up. Static electricity will usually keep the filter on the slide until it is cleared. 6.5.5. Place the tip of the micropipette containing about 200 m L acetone into the aluminum block. Insert the glass slide into the receiving slot in the aluminum block. Inject the acetone into the block with slow, steady pressure on the plunger while holding the pipette firmly in place. Wait 3 to 5 seconds for the filter to clear, then remove the pipette and slide from the aluminum block. 6.5.6. Immediately (less than 30 seconds) place 2.5 to 3.5 m L of triacetin on the filter (Note: Waiting longer than 30 seconds will result in increased index of refraction and decreased contrast between the fibers and the preparation. This may also lead to separation of the cover slip from the slide). 6.5.7. Lower a cover slip gently onto the filter at a slight angle to reduce the possibility of forming air bubbles. If more than 30 seconds have elapsed between acetone exposure and triacetin application, glue the edges of the cover slip to the slide with lacquer or nail polish.
