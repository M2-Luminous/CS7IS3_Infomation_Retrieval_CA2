About 500,000 sheep in Scotland, England, Ireland and Wales are still affected by the fall out from the 1986 explosion. They plan to fit transmitters to scores of animals so they can be tracked by satellite wherever they are on the remote hills and moors. Each back-pack strapped to the sheep contains a microcomputer, transmitter and receiver. The packs not only record the sheep's exact position but also every jaw movement. Researchers can tell when the animals are feeding and when they are simply ruminating. The aim is to find the remaining ``hotspots'' of radiation. More than 500 UK farms are still subject to movement restrictions on their flocks almost eight years after the explosion at the Russian plant. The worst affected area is Wales where about 230,000 sheep on 340 farms are affected by legislation preventing their meat from being sold until they have been checked by government scientists . Many sheep, even those born long after the Chernobyl disaster, are still eating radiocaesium in vegetation growing on contaminated soil. Now, after successful trials with a satellite-based Global Positioning System developed for the U.S. Defence Department, scientists at the Institute of Grassland and Environmental Research at Northwyke, Devon and the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology at Merlewood, Cumbria, are ready to tackle the contaminated farms.
