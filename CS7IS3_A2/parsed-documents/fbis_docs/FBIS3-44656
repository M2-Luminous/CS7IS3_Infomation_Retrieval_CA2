Those attending the conference are directors of departments (or bureaus) in charge of agriculture, animal husbandry, aquatic production, agricultural reclamation, township enterprises, and farm machinery in all provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the central government, and cities authorized to have independent economic plans; as well as representatives from various sectors. The meeting's main agenda is to examine the current situation of agricultural production and rural economy; study ways to implement the guidelines laid down by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the central conference on rural affairs, and the national economic conference; and draw up priorities of and major measures for deepening rural reform and accelerating agricultural and rural economic development in 1994 and beyond. The specific targets that Liu Jiang put forward at the meeting for agricultural production and rural economic projects this year are: Grain output should exceed 450 million tonnes, cotton output should reach 4.85 million tonnes, and the output of oil-bearing crops should exceed 17 million tonnes; the output of meat, fowl, eggs, milk, aquatic products, vegetables, and fruit should increase substantially; the gross agricultural output should increase 4 percent; revenue from township enterprises' sales and taxes on profits should increase 25 and 19 percent, respectively; and peasants' per capita net income should increase 5 percent. Liu Jiang stressed that this year the government will give priority to these three projects, namely increasing peasants' incomes, in reforming rural areas' economic structure, and in promoting rural economic development. Liu Jiang said: Increasing peasants' incomes constitutes the core of agriculture and rural economic work today as well as for the rest of the 1990's. The way to increase peasants' incomes is to deepen reform and speed up development. While paying attention to increasing peasants' incomes, we must continue to act firmly to reduce their burdens and accelerate various developmental projects meant to help the poor. To deepen the reform of the rural economic structure, the government will give priority to developing the market, improving the market system, providing stronger guidance, support, protection, and regulation for agriculture; and speeding up the development of economic operating mechanisms and managerial systems in rural areas compatible with the development of the socialist market economy. To ensure their economic development, the rural areas must make great efforts to develop efficient agriculture that produces quality goods in large quantities, to increase the output of nonstaple food, to extensively process agricultural goods and diversify their use, and to help township enterprises develop in a highly efficient [gao xiao 7559 2400], sustained, and healthy manner. Liu Jiang said that agricultural and rural economic projects' emphasis should be placed on the following three areas: First, steadily increasing grain and cotton output. Liu Jiang said: To ensure an adequate grain supply, we must stabilize acreage, improve the production mix, improve quality, and increase the unit yield this year. The sown acreage must be at least 1.65 billion mu. Efforts should be made to readjust the plan in various regions and the types of crops that they grow so that there will be large acreage for rice, wheat, corn, soybeans, and miscellaneous crops of good quality. Preferential measures should be taken so that the principal grain-producing regions can stabilize their grain production. As for cotton production, we must be determined to reverse the unfavorable trend, reinstate the former acreage, draw up rational plans, and increase the unit yield so that the level of a normal year can be maintained. Second, we must make great efforts to develop the production of nonstaple foods. As for animal husbandry, we must stabilize pig production and increase the percentage of fowl as well as the beef and mutton output among the total meat production. As for fisheries, efforts should be made to develop aquatic breeding and to increase the output of well-known, special, and quality products as well as new products. The comprehensive control of diseases of prawns and other aquatic products must be properly organized. Efforts should be made to control prawn disease as quickly as possible. As for vegetable production, the size of acreage in the outskirts devoted to vegetables must be maintained, a system for ensuring vegetable acreage should be established, and efforts should be made so that vegetable acreage will not be misused. Third, great efforts must be made to develop township and town enterprises. The development of these enterprises should be directed at increasing economic returns; the development should be compatible with the state's industrial policy; and the relationships between growth and returns, between quantity and quality, and between development and improvement must be properly handled. Township and town enterprises in the east should be restructured so that they can yield higher returns and are export-oriented. Their industrial structure and product mix must be readjusted so that their technology will be higher, the quality of their goods will be better, their operating size will be larger, and their returns will be higher. We must speed up the development of township and town enterprises in central and western China and speed up the formulation of the "Demonstrative Projects on Cooperation Between Township and Town Enterprises in Eastern and Western China." The first group of demonstrative projects must be finalized early this year.
