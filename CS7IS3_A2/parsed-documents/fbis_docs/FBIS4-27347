This situation was revealed in the survey report "Current Status and Evaluation of Corporate Measures in Global Environment Issues" announced on 12 May by the Science and Technology Policy Research Institute of the Science and Technology Agency. The research institute implemented the survey targeting 500 listed firms, and obtained responses from 263 companies. As the incentive for undertaking global environment issues, 98 percent of the firms cited "social responsibility," and 95.8 percent of firms are devising some environmental measures. A trend was seen that the larger the firm, the more it was aggressively undertaking it. Viewing the content of the environmental measures, 89.3 percent of the firms are undertaking "environment-related" measures such as environmental pollution and noise countermeasures, and many are dealing with laws and regulations or high effect on investment, such as 93.3 percent for "resources-related" measures such as conservation. On the other hand, only 9.5 percent of the firms were carrying out "ecosystem maintenance-related" measures such as prevention of reckless development. As for problems of undertaking global environment issues, 91.7 percent cited high cost of new facilities investment and the drop in production efficiency, and they are concerned about a decline in competitiveness. Moreover, as provision of social conditions, 87.8 percent of the firms demanded preferential tax treatment or financial subsidies from national or local public bodies. The firms that sought approval to shift costs to the public or a review of lifestyles exceeded 60 percent. An table for overall evaluation of the handling of global environment issues by firms is attached to the report. The research institute distributed the report to about 500 companies, and is urging each firm to grasp objectively the actual state of their own company's handling of environmental issues and make a self-diagnosis using this evaluation table.
