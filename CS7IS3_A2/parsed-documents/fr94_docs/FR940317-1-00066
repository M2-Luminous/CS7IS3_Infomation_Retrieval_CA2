FR940317-1-00066 FR940317-1-00013 (4) Whether medical payments paid by an insurer to its insured can be subrogated depends on local law. Some jurisdictions prohibit these claims to be submitted by the insurer notwithstanding a contractual provision providing for subrogation. Therefore, local law should be researched prior to deciding the issue, and claims forwarded to higher headquarters for adjudication should contain the results of said research. Such claims, where prohibited by State law, will also be barred by the Antiassignment Act. (See paragraph (c) of this section.) (5) Care will be exercised to require insurance disclosure consistent with the type of incident generating the claim. Every claimant will, as a part of the claim, make a written disclosure concerning insurance coverage as to_ (i) The name and address of every insurer; (ii) The kind and amount of insurance; (iii) Policy number; (iv) Whether a claim has been or will be presented to an insurer, and if so, the amount of such claim; and (v) Whether the insurer has paid the claim in whole or has indicated payment will be made. (vi) Each subrogee must substantiate his or her interest or right to file a claim by appropriate documentary evidence and should support the claim as to liability and measure of damages in the same manner as required of any other claimant. Documentary evidence of payment to a subrogor does not constitute evidence either of liability of the Government or of the amount of damages. Approving and settlement authorities will make independent determinations upon the evidence of record and the law. (vii) Subrogated claims are not cognizable under subparts E, J or K. (c) Transfer and assignments. (1) Except as they occur by operation of law or after a voucher for the payment has been issued, unless within the exceptions set forth by statute (31 U.S.C 3727 and AR 37&hyph;107), the following are null and void: (i) Every purported transfer or assignment of a claim against the United States, or of any part of or interest in a claim, whether absolute or conditional. (ii) Every power of attorney or other purported authority to receive payment of all or part of any such claim. (2) The purposes of the Antiassignment Act are to eliminate multiple payment of claims, to cause the United States to deal only with original parties, and to prevent persons of influence from purchasing claims against the United States. (3) In general, this statute prohibits voluntary assignments of claims with the exception of transfers or assignments made by operation of law. The operation of law exception has been held to apply to claims passing to assignees because of bankruptcy proceedings, assignments for the benefit of creditors, corporate liquidations, consolidations or reorganizations, and where title passes by operation of law to heirs or legatees. Subrogated claims that arise under a statute are not barred by the Antiassignment Act. For example, subrogated workmen's compensation claims are cognizable when presented by the insurer. (4) Subrogated claims that arise pursuant to contractual provisions may be paid to the subrogee if the subrogated claim is recognized by State statute or decision. For example, an insurer under an automobile insurance policy becomes subrogated to the rights of a claimant upon payment of a property damage claim. Generally, such subrogated claims are authorized by State law and are therefore not barred by the Antiassignment Act. (5) Before claims are paid, it is necessary to determine whether there may be a valid subrogated claim under Federal or State statute or subrogation contract held valid by State law. If there may be a valid subrogated claim forthcoming, payment should be withheld for this portion of the claim. If it is determined that claimant is the only proper party, full settlement is authorized. (d) Action by claimant _(1) Form of claim. (i) The claimant will submit his or her claim using authorized official forms whenever practicable. A claim is filed only when the vital elements (see Appendix B to this part) have been supplied in writing by a person authorized to present a claim (paragraph (a) of this section) unless the claim is cognizable under a chapter that specifies otherwise. (ii) A claim may be amended by the claimant at any time prior to final agency action or prior to the exercise of the claimant's option under 28 U.S.C. 2675(a). (2) Signatures. (i) The claim and all other papers should be signed in ink by the claimant or his or her duly authorized agent. Such signatures will include the first name, middle initial, and surname. A married woman should sign her claim in her given name; for example, ``Mary A. Doe.'' (ii) Where the claimant is represented, the supporting evidence required by paragraph (a)(5) will be required only if the claim is signed by the agent or legal representative. However, in all cases in which a claimant is represented, the name and address of the representative will be included in the file together with copies of all correspondence and records of conversations and other contacts maintained and included in the file. Frequently, these records are determinative as to whether the statute of limitations has been tolled. (3) Presentation. The claim be presented to the commanding officer of the unit involved; the legal office of the nearest Army post, camp, or station; or other military establishment convenient to the claimant. In a foreign country where no appropriate commander is stationed, the claim may be submitted to any attache of the U.S. Armed Forces. (See AR 1&hyph;75.) Claims arising overseas which are cognizable under Article VIII of the Agreement Regarding the Status of Forces of Parties to the North Atlantic Treaty, Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security Between the United States of America and Japan Regarding Facilities and Areas and the Status of United States Armed Forces in Japan or other similar treaty or agreement are filed with designated claims officials of the receiving State.
