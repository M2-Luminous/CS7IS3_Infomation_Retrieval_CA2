The new loss was discovered yesterday during an extraordinary and detailed accounting of weapons and ammunition of all units ordered by Army General Staff (YES) chief Lieutenant General Voulgaris, following the theft of the G3 A3 guns from a Larisa unit a few days ago. The weapon (G3 A4) was missing from the command unit of the 651 AVIP [expansion unknown] located in Ayios Stefanos. A sworn investigation was ordered. According to YES officials, it is possible that the weapon was stolen long ago. It is believed that in December another G3 A4 gun was stolen from a unit of the Kavala division. In Larisa, the investigation revealed, among other shortcomings, that rules of internal security were not kept. [passage omitted]
