Espy said his visit to China last October made him aware that "China represents a very important market for U.S. agricultural commodities, an important market that will be increasingly important in the next decade." "If somehow we would rescind MFN to China, other nations against whom we compete would just come in and fill the vacuum," he noted. He has made these concerns very clear to the White House, he added. Another cabinet member of the Clinton administration, Ronald Brown, secretary of commerce, indicated today that from the perspective of the Commerce Department, the answer to what the U.S. should do on the issue of China's MFN "is increasingly clear." "We know that China is growing at about 13 percent a year or more. We know that China is going to spend probably 600 billion U.S. dollars in infrastructure projects between now and the year 2000. I very much want American business and industry, small and large, to participate in the economic benefits of that growth in China," he said. President Clinton is required to make up his mind whether to extend China's MFN with no conditions attached by June 3. It is "a difficult decision to make," Brown observed.
