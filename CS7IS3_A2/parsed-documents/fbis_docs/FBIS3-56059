In parallel, Ukrainian-American talks were held in which Acting Prime Minister Yefim Zvyagilskiy, Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko and other officials took part on the Ukrainian side. At night, when the talks ended, the U.S. president flew to Moscow. Earlier the presidents held a press conference at the airport. Answering questions from journalists Bill Clinton said, inter alia, that Ukraine's decision to become a nuclear-free state opens for it broad possibilities of getting economic aid from different international organizations. The fact that Ukraine understands the "Partnership for Peace" formula provides it with a possibility of cooperation with U.S. and NATO armed forces, something which will promote Ukraine's security, too. During the meeting with journalists, the heads of two states told them about various aspects of the talks that had taken place. Kravchuk thanked Bill Clinton for his active assistance in the cause of developing cooperation between the two states. After the press conference Kravchuk announced that he was prepared to give a television interview to national television and CNN.
