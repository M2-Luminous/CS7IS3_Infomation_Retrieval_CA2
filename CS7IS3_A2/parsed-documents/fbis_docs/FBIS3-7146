As has been reported, the Kim Yong-sam ring, in a so-called security related-ministers meeting held recently at Chongwadae [presidential residence], raved, placing blame on us, that it would resume the Team Spirit joint military exercise and that it would deploy Patriot missiles in South Korea soon. Based on this provocative step, the puppet Army troops entered into an emergency alert posture, and Patriot missiles are being moved from the United States to South Korea. These extraordinary military moves are intentional acts aimed at further aggravating tensions on the Korean peninsula in order to lead the situation to an extreme phase of war. This is an unpardonable crime. As everyone knows, we have been consistently asserting that all the pending issues, including the nuclear issue, be resolved through dialogue and negotiation. However, the Kim Yong-sam ring is not interested in national reconciliation and unity or the country's peace and reunification, but is only scheming to harm the fellow countrymen in collusion with outside forces. Therefore, they intentionally broke down the working delegates' contact for the presidential special envoys of the North and the South, to which they had reluctantly responded, and are resorting to open war maneuvers. If the Team Spirit joint military exercise is resumed and Patriot missiles deployed in South Korea, it is very clear what adverse effect it will bring to the situation on the Korean peninsula. It is well known that traitor Kim Yong-sam, coming in power under the mask of a civilian regime, raved about supremacy of the nation over foreign forces and the improvement of relations with the North from the starting point of regarding it as the same nation. However, although he said that in words, in action he resumed the Team Spirit joint military exercise, which was suspended even during the Sixth Republic, last year, and is planning to enforce it this year as well. He is bringing even Patriot missiles, the deployment of which even his predecessor military hooligans did not dare, into South Korea, further aggravating tension. The Kim Yong-sam ring is an extremely vicious war fanatic far worse than his predecessor military dictators, and a national traitors ring of filthy flunkeyist nation-sellers and national treachery which try to find a way for survival by harming the fellow countrymen in collusion with outside forces. By resuming the Team Spirit joint military exercise and bringing in Patriot missiles, they themselves revealed that they are warmongers under the guise of a civilian mask. As long as the Kim Yong-sam traitorous group, which is more intimate with outside forces than with the fellow countrymen and seeks war and division rather than peace and reunification, remains is power, we cannot hope for peace and reunification of the country, nor can we avoid the catastrophe of a nuclear war falling on the nation. It is the shame of our nation that there exists a ring of national treachery like the Kim Yong-sam ring in our country which boasts a 5,000-year history. The Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique, which deepens confrontation between fellow countrymen and brings fire clouds of war, should be removed as soon as possible. If the Kim Yong-sam ring, a foolish ring which sustains its doomed life clinging to the lower end of the U.S. master's clothes, thinks it can harm someone by means of a war in collusion with outside forces, it is grossly miscalculating. Our people and People's Army who are well prepared for either dialogue or war will never just remain still and look on. If they start a war despite our repeated warnings, we will resolutely punish them. The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique should squarely see that the provocation of a war will be an act of suicide which brings a total destruction of the civilian regime and act with discretion, and stop immediately the very dangerous act of leading the situation to the phase of a war.
