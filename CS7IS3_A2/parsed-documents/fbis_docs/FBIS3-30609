Good evening. [Tomic] Good evening. [Jovic] Everyone who has watched the Serbian Assembly broadcasts is aware of this, but we will nevertheless remind viewers that in your capacity as head of a deputy caucus, you addressed the deputies and very clearly explained the Socialist Party of Serbia's [SPS] platform. [Tomic] And not only the SPS's platform, but primarily President Milosevic's request that Serbian political forces join forces in a policy of peace, economic prosperity, and crime-fighting. I think this is the backbone and essence of the whole thing, and the views expressed in the parliament have confirmed this. [Jovic] What could be seen from the broadcasts is that you have been given a good reception as new Serbian Assembly chairman; what we still do not know, but are sure to learn on Tuesday when the Assembly meets again, concerns the negotiations. This request actually marked the end of the previous session. The negotiations with the head of deputy caucuses, how are they going? [Tomic] Well, the negotiations and talks will continue during this break. On Tuesday [8 February] we will probably be completely ready to continue our work; we primarily need to elect a deputy assembly chairman, then working bodies, then we have the election of the secretary general, and finally, we should elect the deputies to the Chamber of Republics in the Federal Assembly. These tasks will mark an end to constituting the republican Assembly, which will be prepared in such a way that it will be capable of carrying on with the important part of the tasks in its domain, and with what the people of this republic, the people of Serbia, expect. [Jovic] For the time being, are all the heads, all the deputy caucuses, participating in the negotiations? [Tomic] Well, you know, the talks are collective, they are discussing things among themselves, in the opposition bloc, among the representatives of the SPS, and so forth. Consultations are underway. We expect that Monday [7 February] will be particularly busy, and that in the course of the day we will conclude most of these talks, negotiations, and preparations for the session that will then begin. [Jovic] So everything can be reviewed at the session on Tuesday, while it is still hot, so to speak? [Tomic] Yes. Of course, we still have a few things to do on Tuesday morning, but you know how these things are; these activities take time, they will probably continue through Tuesday, depending on the number and type of proposals, whether all these proposals are to be coordinated, agreed upon, whether all of them will be on the agenda, and so forth. [Jovic] Thank you very much. It is important that we have started rolling. [Tomic] Absolutely. [Jovic] Thank you.
