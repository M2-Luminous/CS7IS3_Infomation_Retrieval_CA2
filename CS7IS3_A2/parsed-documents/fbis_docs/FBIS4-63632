This sum could ensure that the cost stays at the 1993 level in the actual implementation of the budget. The Defense Committee's amendment did not go through, however, at its first reading. Explaining her position, Mrs. Khakamada said this is the minimal cost needed to preserve the armed forces' combat effectiveness, maintain important defense products, and carry through military reform. The position on the question is a matter of principle for me, she stated. It is the direct function of the state and one of its main duties to increase the country's defense capability, as well as to solve the social problems of servicemen and of their families, even if there is a budget deficit. This constitutes the fundamental difference between keeping defense outlays at the necessary level and deficit financing of inefficient sectors of the national economy. Sustaining the army even at the cost of a budget deficit makes the state stronger in the final analysis, whereas uncontrolled spending of funds dictated by the lobbyists of various sectors only weakens it.
