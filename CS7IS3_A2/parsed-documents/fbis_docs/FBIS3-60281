The country programme prepared by India, with the help of UNDP and the cooperation of Indian industry, was recently approved by the executive committee on country programmes under the Montreal Protocol. Under the Protocol, the entire incremental cost of the phaseout in India, whose annual consumption of the environmentally damaging chemicals is less than 0.3 kg per capita, is to be met by the global fund. The Rs. 6,000 crores approved is the first part of the payment. India is unique among developing countries as it is self-sufficient in the production of chlorofluorocarbons and is expected to soon produce halons in sufficient quantities to meet the domestic demand. In 1991 the total consumption of the harmful chemicals in India was about 10,000 tonnes. By the year 2010, the demand and consumption is expected to rise to 1,84,000 tonnes. A large part of the increase is expected in the airconditioning and refrigeration industries.
