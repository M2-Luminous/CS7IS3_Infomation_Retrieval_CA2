Speaking at the opening of the World Economic Forum here, Kohl sought to overcome Western misgivings about Moscow's new conservative cabinet and a feared drift away from its commitment to market reforms. "The alternative is whether we give our support to those who support reform, not knowing whether they will succeed or not, or sit in our historical corner knowing the failure will be disastrous," he said. Kohl said the possible expansion of the G-7 to give Russia permanent membership would be "a question of the greatest importance" at the group's July summit in Naples, Italy. "They would not be just guests, they would be members of a round if this was provided by the democratic reforms in Russia," the German leader said in response to a question. "I don't see any alternative." The G-7, which has agreed to provide Russia 43 billion dollars in assistance, comprises the United States, Japan, France, Britain, Canada, Germany and Italy. In a keynote address to some 1,500 top political, business and media leaders gathered here, Kohl linked the West's future well-being to the success of economic and political reforms in the former Soviet bloc. He urged active assistance for reform programmes throughout Central and East Europe and well stepped-up efforts to widen Western markets to imports from the East. [passage omitted]
