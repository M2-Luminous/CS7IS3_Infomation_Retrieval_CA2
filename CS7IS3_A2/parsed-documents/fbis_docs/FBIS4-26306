FBIS4-26306 "drchi119_v_94004" FBIS-CHI-94-119 Daily Report 20 Jun 1994 TAIWAN Taipei's U.S. Office Awaiting Name Change Taipei's U.S. Office Awaiting Name Change OW2006141894 Taipei CNA in English 1338 GMT 20 Jun 94 OW2006141894 Taipei CNA English BFN [By Flor Wang] [Text] Taipei, June 20 (CNA) -- Vice Foreign Affairs Minister Chen Hsi-fan said on Monday (920 June] that the government has informed Washington about its intention to change the name of its representative office in the United States, but that the U.S. side so far has not replied concretely to Taipei's proposal. Chen made the remarks at a Legislative Yuan joint committee meeting when Democratic Progressive Party legislator Hsu [words indistinct] questioned him on the designation of the office -- currently the Coordination Council for North American Affairs, or CCNAA -- while they were discussing Taiwan's plans to sign a copyright agreement with the United States through the office. Chen said the government has proposed that the name of the office be changed to the "Taipei Representative Office," but Hsu said "Taiwan Representative Office" would be a more appropriate name. Citing Taiwan's representative offices in Japan and Britain, both of which use "Taipei Representative Office," Chen said it would be easier to obtain U.S. approval to use "Taipei Representative Office" because of the lack of formal relations between the two countries. As Taipei is the capital of the Republic of China [ROC], it is logical to use "Taipei" to designate the nation's representative offices overseas, Chen noted.
