This also goes for the crystallisation of its identity as regards both its rightful role in the world community and its concept of its own distinctiveness and essence. I take the view that in this respect as in some others Russia still keeps in large measure to the past, to disconnected fragments of it, and may be said to apply the formula of its legal succession to this sphere as well. Yet Russia will have to "predetermine itself," with its vision of the problems of "Russia and the East," of relations with the East, as a most important part of the process. What is the issue today, when the substance of a problem that seems so very traditional or rather historical for the country is undergoing a serious transformation as a result of 70 years of membership in the Soviet Union and, above all, drastic geostrategic, social, and economic changes in Russia? It is primarily our relations with Eastern (in fact Asian) countries as well as their projection into our relations with the West. Until recently this part of the globe received little attention from Russian policy and diplomacy for both objective and subjective reasons. But Boris Yeltsin's visit to South Korea, China, India and Japan, his remarks in Peking about "breakthroughs" to Asia and in Delhi about a "period of pro-Eastern policy" give hope for serious reassessment, for a continuation of the process of revision, with tangible deeds following important statements. The attitude to the East and relations with it are a key aspect of Russia's identity, of its self-determination as a civilised spiritual, psychological and even political phenomenon. Whether Russia belongs to or sees itself as part of the West or the East was the object of a controversy that ran through Russian social thought for a long time, being slightly diluted in the 1920s by emigres who advanced the concept of Eurasianism. Nor is this surprising, for the controversy has always involved diametrically opposed political notions of the road along which Russia should move. It seems to me, however, that this aspect of the controversy has lost meaning (assuming that it ever had any), and the present flare-up of Eurasianism is rather indicative of the opposition's search for ideological equipment and its reaction to immoderate (and occasionally indecent) Westernisation on the part of a section of the intelligentsia and some spokesman for the government. Be that as it may, the formula of Westernisers versus Eurasianists and those who consider themselves inseparable from Russia's "native soil" provides no answer to the question of the relationship between Russia and the East. The issue today is obviously Russia's fundamental attitude to the East, the need to recall certain distinguishing characteristics of our country, not a reproduction of theses of Eurasianism, which argues that Russia is following a road of its own and that regular global developments do not apply to it. The experience gained to date leaves no room for doubt that they involve the East, West, North and South. Hence Russia cannot stay off the road of democracy and a social market economy, whose various forms are winning ever wider recognition. This, however, presupposes realising that the long-standing notion of the "ownership" of the phenomenon of democracy is outdated and that to embark on democracy is not the same as accepting the Western model. The vitality of democracy depends on its ability to make further progress. Currently, many in the West are pondering on how to improve the democratic procedure in use. More and more people there consider that these procedures are by no means ideal and that it is indispensable to devise effective ways of combating increasing corruption, overcoming the population's political indifference due to the crisis of the party system in its present form and to the disregard of pressing needs of the electorate by leaders, to their selfishness and demagoguery of defending the interests and rights of minorities from the democratic diktat of the majority. In this situation the search for consensus which is typical of Eastern countries seems to be coming to the fore in various sections and structures of society. The 21st century is likely to become an era of democratisation in the East. But this will hardly come down to a mere transplantation of the Western model and hence to Westernisation. Incidentally, all talk about grafting Western ideals is indefensible also tactically. It may complicate the democratisation process, causing this "extraneous" phenomenon to be rejected, a prospect exploited by nationalist and oligarchic forces in the East. Formerly, in the period of confrontation between two world systems, there certainly was a point in stressing the "Western" character of democracy. Today, however, the situation is entirely different. Russia largely owes its originality (but not exclusiveness) and its legitimate role and potential as a member of the world community to the fact that it combines, if not always harmoniously, the features of Western (European) and Asian (Eastern) civilisations. While the poet Alexander Blok used those famous words "Yes, we are Scythians, yes, we are Asians" in the heat of debate, they were not accidental but reflected a historic intertwining. Traditionally drawn primarily to the West, Russia has always been a Eurasian country nonetheless, and this not only territorially. Its history, polyethnic environment, culture and very interests induced it to play the role of a link or even mediator between the two countries. Of course, how far it coped with this role is open to question. But there is no doubt that over the centuries diverse civilisational streams converged in the expanses of Russia, where a polyphonic socio-cultural area, a fabric of intercivilisational bonds and a culture of mutually enriching interchanges came into being and an atmosphere of psychological tolerance and openness to beneficial influences was created. Everything relating to Russian nationals--their way of life, individual and social psychology, arts and letters, character and mentality--bear the imprint of this intercivilisational and supranational phenomenon influencing also the political evolution of the country, if not decisively. The "non-Westernness" of many spiritual and moral qualities of ethnic Russians and other inhabitants of Russia is obvious. Directly deducing the specifics of Russia and its people from contacts with the foreign and internal parts of the East or from the "Eastern" component of their "soul" is out of the question, for they are a product of more complex interaction. Still, the influence of these contacts, of Russia's Eastern environment, seems indisputable. Traces of it can be found in the language, the humanities (meaning their scope and the range of their interests), literature, noblemen's names and much else. This is as it should be, for, apart from two and a half centuries of the Mongol domination, Russia continuously and intensively extended its contact with the East through conquest and cultural interpenetration. It grew into Asia, forming its own East, an Asia of its own, where hundreds of thousands of ethnic Russians and other Russian nationals closely interacted psychologically, intellectually, and emotionally with the Eastern way of life and Eastern culture. No non-Asian country has anything like this, and the spiritual reverberations of this interaction were bound to make themselves felt in one way or another throughout Russia. How very tangible the results of this mutual receptiveness can be is illustrated by the problem of adaptation of today's wave of emigration from some southern republics. It appears that there is a substantial distinction in psychology and way of life between these emigrants and their compatriots in, say, Central Russia, which creates difficulties in this respect as well. A high degree of tolerance for a polytechnic environment is a further reflection of Russia's historic identity, of the blend of Western and Eastern components that its genetic type represents. To be sure, Russian chronicles have also recorded other things. Chauvinism, too, has had and still has influential adherents. By and large, however, Russia as a country and society is more resistant--as the dramatic experience of recent years shows--to anti-emigration trends like those that are now rife in, for example, Western Europe. Russia's attitude to the East is an attitude to itself, too, for Russia is also home to Tatars, Bashkirs, Yakuts, Caucasian, and dozens of other "Eastern" nationalities. Their place in our country, in its life and fortunes, is entirely different from that of, say, Arabs or Africans in France, Indians or Pakistanis in Britain. Russia is not just a habitat of diverse ethnic groups but a polytechnic country where the Russians as its backbone and other peoples have for centuries lived not only side by side but together, intermingling, fusing culturally and spiritually, jointly weathering social cataclysms and repulsing foreign invasions. They have a common history and common destiny. Add to this that for 70 years we lived in one state, leading a common life with millions of Uzbeks, Kazakhs, Kirghiz, Turkmens, Tajiks, Azerbaijanians, and that today we belong with them to the Commonwealth of Independent States. All this was bound to and did have its effect, drawing and linking us together. In other words, whereas Western Europe and the United States may look on the East as something different or even alien, it would be unnatural of Russia to do so. This is what geography and history, cultural and civilisational factors have willed. Some Russian leaders today repudiate Russia's "Asian heritage," seeing nothing in it but negative, ignominious things, a burden pulling us back. Yet this heritage is as contradictory as any other legacy of history. Along with elements of medieval stagnation and even slavery, it includes what is a natural part of the historic strength and potential of Russia and its civilisation. Russia belongs to neither the West nor the East alone. It is at once a Western and Eastern country. This does not mean that Russia is a mix or mechanical combination of cultural continents. Our country is the product of a synthesis that has given rise to a new, distinctive civilisation, a whole civilisational mainland, an original organism whose thinking and sentiments set it apart from others. And so all attempts to "rid" us of things Eastern and fully Westernise us are futile. What is more, they are absurd. Today the multicivilisational, Western and Eastern sources and nature of Russian distinctiveness are acquiring special value. "Integration" is a word you now hear almost everywhere. It is a trend paving the way to the future for humanity. A universal civilisation is dawning all over the world, and its components are taking shape and spreading, especially to the economic sphere but also to politics and culture. Much less is said, however, about the circumstances that the result will by no means be a unified world, the effacement of distinctions, the abolition of cultural diversity. If this were to happen, humanity would become faceless, for it would lose one of the most powerful driving forces of its progress. I am sure the 21st century will give existing civilisations a second wind as they develop and adapt to new conditions without losing their identity. It will usher in an increasingly polycentric world. We will arrive at it after abolishing a bipolar system, as we have already done, and completing the present transitional stage of unbalanced concentration of political influence, military power, and information potential at one pole. Unlike the past, however, the evolution of diverse civilisations will probably take place in unprecedentedly close mutual contact. The era of isolated civilisations shutting out all others is over. They are being drawn together by the transnationalisation of economic life and information, the feverish development of communications, mass migrations. This creates tensions at "junctions" and other difficulties. Experience shows that even the achievement of a high, roughly equal level of economic growth does not eliminate problems arising from civilisational and cultural heterogeneity. We live at a time when not only close contacts and a rapprochement between countries and nations but a convergence of civilisations and cultures are gaining in importance and urgency. This is all the more essential now that the greatest ideological conflict of the 20th century is over. Against this background Russia with its mixed civilisation, a country which has gone through a social experiment, is a particularly noteworthy phenomenon. Its intercivilisational essence, the experience of the coexistence of and contacts between diverse nations, may prove very valuable for humanity at this stage if preserved and fostered. The East always held a prominent place in the foreign policy and overall potential of the Russian state and the Soviet Union. Basically, this also applies to the present period even though a number of important circumstances and vectors have changed, which means that many earlier approaches will have to be revised. What is different now is primarily Russia's real status. Russia used to identify itself with a superpower, the Soviet Union, and actually embodied it. The Soviet Union was chiefly a Russian state. Most foreigners called it "Russia" and its citizens "Russians," doing so not only by mistake or force of habit. Today Russia is striving to act as a full-fledged legal successor of the Soviet Union, and Russian diplomacy is doing as much in the main sectors. Yet the changes that set in with the disappearance of the Soviet Union as a superpower strongly affected Russia even though it may still not quite realise its new situation because the aura of the recent past and reflexes of a state that has gone out of existence linger on. Russia has joined the ranks of great powers (with a population half the size of the Soviet Union's and an area that is smaller by a third) and will yet have to back up this new status by providing itself with an appropriate economic and political basis. The priorities and main tasks of Russian policy and diplomacy are not quite clear as yet. They are certain to depend for some time to come on personal predilections, reflexes of attraction and rejection, automatic reactions evolved over the past few years. But however pro-American and pro-European a section of the intelligentsia and some leaders of the country may be (they understandably want Russia to be regarded as inseparable from Europe and the West and to have a say in European affairs), there is no disregarding realities. The disintegration of the Soviet Union has objectively shifted the geostrategic and geopolitical epicentre of Russia to the East, towards Asia, although nominally this is not the case and, more importantly, is somewhat contrary to our current requirements. A belt of new independent states has emerged to the west of Russia (Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, the Baltia republics) drawn mainly to Western Europe, not Russia. These states are virtually moving Russia away from Europe, being a partition that may become a barrier where the position on Russia is unfriendly. On its southern periphery Russia is now faced with independent Transcaucasian and Central Asian states plus Kazakhstan. Furthermore, some of them are becoming a serious security problem. Today Asia accounts for nearly 80 percent of Russia's territory, 70 percent of its frontiers and the lion's share of its natural resources. What the country can expect to help it end the present economic deadlock and make progress are primarily its eastern areas. Siberia and the Far East (12 million square kilometres of territory and the longest Pacific coastline), their economic cooperation with and integration into the fast-developing Asia-Pacific region. As matters stand, the Asian part of Russia is thus bound to play a bigger role in the destiny of the country, its economic growth and foreign policy. This is also true of its Far Eastern coast at a time when most of the country's Baltic and Black Sea ports are gone. A welcome change is the fact that Russia is no longer shackled by a superpower policy involving overarmament and ideological messianism and demanding that the country approach the world as the arena of an all-out rivalry for leadership. Russia no longer sees the East as an area of confrontation between two systems. It has withdrawn from an unacceptable and unwinnable game. I believe all this means that Russia must resist the temptation of a duumvirate approach that, while possibly tickling its self-esteem, is useless. Besides, the United States remembers Russia in this context mostly when it is a question of certain survivals of the Cold War, an attitude which is only natural from the point of view of that country's national interests. Russia's most powerful neighbours are in the East--in Asia. Its relations with the East include relations with China. These are already of fundamental importance and their importance for Russia's destiny will grow further in the first decade of the next century, when China will have a real chance to become an economic (and possibly also a military) superpower, according to many forecasts.
