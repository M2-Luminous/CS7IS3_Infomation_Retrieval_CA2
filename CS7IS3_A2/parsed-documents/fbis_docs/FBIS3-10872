When will you cut yours? [Colosio] I aspire to govern Mexico at the side of the Mexicans. Let me be clear: No one but the citizens and society will guide my work as president of Mexico. [EL NORTE] President Salinas designated you as the candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI], and he later ratified you by saying: "Let there be no confusion." Doesn't that weaken from the beginning the credibility you want to secure during your campaign? [Colosio] I would like to tackle your question with two answers. First, regarding the PRI, I want to tell you that my nomination took place in accordance with my party's rules, customs, and traditions. All party members who aspire to be candidates accept those rules. My nomination received broad party support. Regarding my credibility as a candidate, I want to tell you that it is an objective of my campaign, and I intend to win the trust, support, and confidence of the citizens. I have the best platform to achieve results. I firmly believe that, which is why I have called for debates. [EL NORTE] You have said that countries are not invented every six years. Does that mean Salinism will continue to rule in Mexico? [Colosio] I must explain myself. I realize that the country and Mexican society need, want, and demand changes, but Mexicans want to make changes without going backward. Mexicans want to explore new roads, new opportunities, and new economic, political, and social approaches. But they want these things without jumping off a cliff, without political adventures. What the people want right now, at the end of the century in an increasingly complex world, is certainty, a real future, and responsibility. [EL NORTE] Your admiration for Salinas is well known, but looking beyond your compliments in his favor, he can make mistakes. In your opinion, what errors has the president made in governing the country? [Colosio] I do not believe in passing final judgment. The president and Mexicans have made a great effort to progress. Personally, we are united by great friendship and fondness. As part of the government, I, in my area of responsibilities, worked with him and shared commitments and objectives. I know that he has always been motivated by a great love for Mexico. I also know that some things can be done better. It must be admitted that the government often does not do everything it would like to do but does what it can based on the available resources and the respect due to the citizens' liberties and rights. In government, intentions and realities always conflict, and difficult balancing acts result. [EL NORTE] There will be a special period of congressional sessions to pass reforms guaranteeing electoral impartiality. Will this end the perfect dictatorship? [Colosio] There will be a special period and an electoral reform if all political parties and all candidates agree to it. That was stated in the agreement that all the candidates signed on 27 January. I insist: We will go to the special period and pass legal reforms so long as this is preceded by an agreement among the parties and the candidates. This would, of course, contribute to a democratic transformation in Mexico. I think everyone must place the interests of the nation above party or group interests. That is why I committed myself to compliance with that agreement. I am fully committed to it. [EL NORTE] If you won such exemplary elections, would you be the product of a new political system? Would this be the end of the perfect dictatorship? [Colosio] Wait a minute. It is important to speak of democracy all the time, not only when one wins. There are candidates and parties that speak of democracy only when they win. When they lose they say the elections were a fraud. I think we must promote trust among ourselves. Trust is very important these days. [EL NORTE] Problems built up in Chiapas for centuries. Statesmen have the obligation of foreseeing violence and of warning the country about it. That was not done. How do you interpret this possible lack of foresight or imposed silence that was broken by the sound of gunfire on 1 January? [Colosio] Lack of foresight and climactic situations resulting from shortages and limitations in those communities are two sides of the same coin. Cumulative abuse created a situation that could not be resolved with preventive actions. We must view this as a structural conflict that has taught the government, society, and -- why not admit it -- the PRI some lessons. [EL NORTE] First as PRI president and later as social development secretary, you said nothing about a latent war in Chiapas for a long time. Were you unaware of what was happening there? How did you react on 1 January? If you were aware, why did you remain obstinately silent? [Colosio] I visited Chiapas as social development secretary four months before the conflict. I met in Ocosingo and Margaritas with representatives from all regional organizations, all of which made known their loyalties and beliefs. They presented various demands, and we responded. The anguish and hopelessness of those communities tell us that we arrived too late. I admit that. [EL NORTE] Why, if you are the candidate of hope, does hope not go to Chiapas? [Colosio] I will go at the appropriate time and be among the people of Chiapas. But I will do it without acting against the negotiation process there. I condemned violence from the very beginning. I proposed that the various parties issue a joint communique. I have spoke of this on several occasions. If you mean that I have not made Chiapas the central issue of my campaign, you're right. I will tell you this: My decision has been not to block, hinder, or interfere with the peace process. No party and no candidate must make Chiapas into political booty. I repeat: I will visit Chiapas. I will look for the best time to do that. [EL NORTE] [Former Chiapas State Governor] Absalon Castellanos and [Interior Secretary] Patrocinio Gonzalez Garrido have been accused of illegal enrichment and repression in Chiapas. The Zapatist National Liberation Army has demanded that they face political trial. What is your position? [Colosio] I believe in the law. There are ways to denounce and punish crimes. I am in favor of abiding by the law. If the people you have mentioned are guilty, let them be punished, but I do not agree with condemning people based on unsubstantiated accusations. [EL NORTE] Castellanos and Gonzalez Garrido are "distinguished PRI members." Does the PRI owe the country an explanation? Will PRI's Honor and Justice Commission finally function? [Colosio] They may or may not face the commission, depending of whether they are found guilty of the crimes of which they are accused. [EL NORTE] The PRI would then have to give an explanation? (Colosio says nothing but nods) [EL NORTE] The debate among the presidential candidates is turning out to be just a fantasy. What is going to happen? [Colosio] I have proposed that the candidates hold a debate because I think that the more people of voting age are informed, the freer they will be to choose among the various platforms and proposals present in the national political spectrum. The debate must mean more information available to the citizens, information provided live to them by the candidates. I propose two dates for the debates, one at the end of April and another at the end of June. I have proposed that the debates he held at the Federal Electoral Institute.
