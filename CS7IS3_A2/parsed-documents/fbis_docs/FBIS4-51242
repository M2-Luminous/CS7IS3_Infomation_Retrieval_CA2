"The attaching of conditions will be unacceptable to the Chinese side," Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin told a weekly press briefing. .U.S President Bill Clinton is widely expected to renew China's most-favoured-nation (MFN) status before the weekend but with limited sanctions that could involve a ban on imports of weapons and ammunition made by the Chinese military. "The unilateral exertion of pressure and adoption of restrictive measures with regard to trade... is not in conformity with international practises," Wu said, adding that any decision to impose limited sanctions "would be unwise." "We hope that the U.S. President will make a suitable decision," he said. Wu refused to comment on what steps China would take should conditions be attached to MFN. Clinton warned last year that renewal of China's MFN status, which brings the lowest available US tariffs on imports, depended on China showing "overall significant progress" in human rights. He outlined seven areas needing improvement before the June 3 deadline for deciding on whether to maintain China's MFN status for another year, and asked US Secretary of State Warren Christopher to make a report. Clinton officials said Christopher found China had met the minimum requirements in two areas: cooperation in ending the export of prison-made goods and allowing relatives of some dissidents to leave the country. Reacting to reports that Clinton might also seek to set up a U.S. commission to monitor China's progress on human rights, Wu said dialogue "can be conducted with regard to the difference over the issue of human rights between China and the United States." However, he reiterated that China was opposed to any interference in its intenal affairs. China has repeatedly protested the linking of MFN renewal with the human rights issue.
