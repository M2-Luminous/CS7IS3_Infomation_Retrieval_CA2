According to DUMA, the daily of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), parliament is expected to announce today its final decision on the draft resolution which the cabinet worked out and moved for debate at an extraordinary meeting held last night. TRUD, the daily of one of the major trade unions, says that MP's of both the former communist BSP and the anti-communist Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) yesterday accused the government of violating the Constitution and of high treason. The private STANDART NEWS brings forward the fact that the government adopted its decision behind the back of parliament. "Parliament and government did not come to terms," BULGARSKA ARMIYA says. The press reports that Deputy Prime Minister Valentin Karabashev and Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov said in parliament that the decision for transshipment of equipment across Bulgaria for UNPROFOR in Macedonia was adopted, while Deputy Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev said it was not. A commentary in DUMA, headlined "Corridor -- Yes! But It Depends for What Purposes," says that "the Americans cannot understand our sensitivity and justified fear of Turkish troops deployment in the Balkans." According to the daily with the largest circulation, 24 CHASA, the government's decision of yesterday has shaken its positions. "Government Discredited Bulgaria Again, This Time at the United Nations," reads a front-page report in DEMOKRATSIYA, the daily of the oppositional SDS. According to KONTINENT, the scandal in parliament predicts the fall of the cabinet. KONTINENT quotes MP's of the SDS as saying that the Union will most probably move a vote of no confidence in the Government. A signed commentary in KONTINENT says that the continued agony of Bulgaria could only end if Prime Minister Lyuben Berov resigns.
