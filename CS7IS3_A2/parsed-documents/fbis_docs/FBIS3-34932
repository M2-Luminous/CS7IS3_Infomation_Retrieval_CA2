This has been intended to draw attention to the fact that we have frequently stressed, namely, that Iraq has fulfilled its commitments toward the Security Council resolutions. This fact was confirmed in the statements made by the accursed Ekeus. These statements usually begin positively, and those concerned with politics and its secrets clearly understand such positive statements. Thus, the Security Council and its Special Commission should also clearly fulfill their commitments toward Iraq, lift the total embargo of its oil exports, and end the unjust blockade without resorting to a test period. This is because positiveness in international dealings means credibility. Throughout the joint work with the UN Special Commission, Iraq has been credible, particularly within the framework of building confidence, stemming from Iraq's international commitments and the maintenance of independent political and national decisionmaking. Has the accursed Ekeus managed to move one step forward on the path of this positiveness, which remained the common denominator of all his statements before and after each round of talks held in Baghdad or at the UN headquarters? One who follows events sees the contrary and even senses a contradiction that evokes wonder and astonishment. Days after the talks ended, the accursed one ignored positiviteness and said something that satisfied the four big powers and stimulated the appetite of the agents, the defeatists, and their hired media trumpets run by Zionism. The accursed Ekeus went back on his recent statements when he was received by the slaves of the Americans in the [Iraqi] governorate of Kuwait. Thus, positiveness turned into differences, and the tears he shed at the al-Rashid Hotel turned into greed for a handful of dollars. Ekeus wanted to ignite a fire and undermine Iraqi steadfastness. But, he did not realize that an Iraqi palm tree will not bow to storms. History will note that Ekeus has sold only the honor of his job, lost himself, and deserves a new nickname in addition to his previous nicknames. Mankind will recall Ekeus as an accursed and self-contradictory one. How bad are his nicknames and his loss of conscience!
