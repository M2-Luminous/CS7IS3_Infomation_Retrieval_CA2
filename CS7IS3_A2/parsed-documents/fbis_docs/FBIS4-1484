FBIS4-1484 "drafr083_cs94008" FBIS-AFR-94-083-S Daily Report 28 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA ANC, IFP Trade Charges of Election Irregularities ANC, IFP Trade Charges of Election Irregularities Ramaphosa on `Extensive' IFP Violations MB2804154194 Johannesburg SABC CCV Television Network in English 1500 GMT 28 Apr 94 MB2804154194 Johannesburg SABC CCV Television Network English BFN [Address by ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa; place and date not given -- recorded] [Text] We wish to put it on record that the ANC has received extensive reports of violations of the electoral laws, electoral regulations, and the Code of Conduct in some parts of the province of KwaZulu-Natal. We are filing with the IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] a detailed complaint of a series of such violation by the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] and its supporters. This is particularly rife in parts of Northern Natal and the Midlands. A list of such incidents will be made available to you later, but I will refer to it. Evidence at hand already indicates the following violations amongst others: The removal of ballot boxes from polling stations by IFP supporters, the transfer of IEC voting material to pirate polling stations established by IFP supporters, threats against the IEC officers as well as the expulsion of ANC party agents from polling stations, and the lack of secrecy in polling booths where voters are coerced into voting for the IFP. When our people went to the polls they knew that the days of voting would span from 26-28 April. A large number of our people have turned up at the polls in a very enthusiastic manner and we believe that, yesterday, many of our people streamed to the polls and despite all the other problems that were experienced, were able to cast their votes. The declaration of the 28th as a public holiday, in our view, has enhanced the volumes that will also go to the polls today. The measures that had been taken by the IEC to make sure that voting material is delivered to the polling station has also enhanced the voting process. We do not, as a result, at this stage believe that it is necessary to extend voting beyond the official date. The IEC is also on record as having said they are willing and prepared to extend the hours of voting, meaning that polling stations do not necessarily have to close at 7PM. I am able to say that many polling stations across the country yesterday closed way beyond 7PM, thus allowing many of our people to vote. The same should happen today, but we do not believe that it is necessary for the day -- or another day to be added to the days of voting as we believe that many people are going to vote today and indeed many people did vote yesterday.
