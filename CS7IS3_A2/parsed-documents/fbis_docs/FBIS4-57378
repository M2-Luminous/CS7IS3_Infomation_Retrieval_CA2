The Holy Week holidays had come early, even to the headquarters of Renovacion Nacional [RN-National Renewal]. At that time only one office was still lit up in the almost deserted building. It was the office of Andres Allamand, the leader of the party, who was receiving an unending series of telephone calls regarding the verdict in the case of the people who were beheaded. Obviously, the subject drew the intermittent attention of the opposition leader, and this matter also must have been mentioned in the discussions which Allamand had this weekend with Roberto Ossandon, the secretary general of his party. Ossandon promised to go with Allamand on his daily morning run. On the other hand, the differences with the UDI [Independent Democratic Union] on opposition strategy toward the present government do not seem to bother Allamand, who considers that the democratic attitude displayed during the Aylwin administration was positive and extremely important. Nor does the president of the RN feel that his leadership has been challenged. He analyzed the present and future of his party with undisguised optimism, while displaying caution about controversial subjects. [Hanania] Are you uncomfortable about having been elected a deputy in Las Condes with votes "borrowed" from Concertacion? [Allamand] On the contrary. I feel that this increases my responsibility as a member of Parliament, since I feel to some extent under an obligation to respond to a broader electorate than usual. I am aware that some of the people who voted for me are identified with the opposition and some of them support the government. [Hanania] Nevertheless, do you accept that those votes saved you from a defeat by Carlos Bombal, which, in the view of leaders of your own party, would have been humiliating? [Allamand] I think that when you go into an election, you have to accept the results. And, whether you win or lose, it is not humiliating in any case. [Hanania] But the election in District 23 was not an ordinary one. It was no mystery to anyone that in your district the future of two different leadership styles of the right was at stake. One of them--your own--was more open. The other, representing a harder line, was that of Carlos Bombal. In view of the results, how do you interpret the present status of those two leadership styles? [Allamand] I think that both of them survived. [Hanania] Does that mean that there are two leaders of the right? [Allamand] I would not put it in personal terms. I believe that in the center-right there are positions which continue to exist, side by side. They are similar but are not exactly symmetrical--nor are they identical. [Hanania] Does the fact that Bombal received more votes than you did mean that he reduced your status as leader in the RN? [Allamand] (Smiling). Not at all. Anyone who knows the particularly difficult conditions under which I became a candidate knows that when I obtained the results I did, this was a great success. I am not unaware, nor do I ignore the fact that in reality Carlos Bombal received a slightly larger number of votes. However, the votes which we both obtained are equally significant. [Hanania] Then your leadership was not affected? [Allamand] The subject of the leadership is a question for the longer term. I do not think that it is determined by a given election. It is no mystery to anyone that if there was an electoral district in Chile in which the nomination of an RN candidate was particularly complex, it was Las Condes. But I am sure that it was a great campaign and that the result left all of us fully satisfied. This matter of the kind of leadership label you have does not particularly concern me. Why talk about possible conflicts over the leadership which may arise? In politics you have to work to promote the things you believe in. For example, the latest Adimark Poll shows an extraordinarily positive result for me, personally--by far the best which I have had over the past few years. [Hanania] But Roberto Mendez, the Adimark pollster, has pointed out that the data in that study show a lack of leadership in the opposition today. [Allamand] I do not think that is true. Quite the contrary. I do not like to talk about myself, but that poll clearly showed me as the strongest opposition leader, a long way ahead of the others. Among the 15 leading political personalities there are only two from the opposition. I am in eighth place on this list, and Carlos Bombal is 15th. In any case I do not think that this list is very important. [Hanania] At the beginning of March 1994 you pointed out that the first task facing you was organizing your party. Do you intend to run for a third term in office as president of the RN? [Allamand] The party has left behind it a crisis situation and a lack of internal harmony which has damaged our political activity since 1992, with the fateful espionage episode. Now in the RN we are moving with a new kind of cohesion and harmony and with a desire to work together. I am very satisfied about the path which the party has followed over the past few months. However, I have not yet decided whether or not I will run for a new term as president of the party. That is a matter on which there is still time to make a decision. [Hanania] According to what has happened in the past few days, there are now several people who are considering replacing you, including those who would continue with the same political line, such as Deputy Teodoro Ribera, and representatives of the more "Jarpista" group [conservative faction formerly led by Jarpa], such as Senator Sergio Romero. [Allamand] I think that there are various persons who might take part in an eventual contest for the party leadership. Now what I do not believe is that such markedly different views are being expressed as are reflected in your question. My impression is that the party now has great cohesion. Furthermore, I am not sure whether those two people you mentioned would be satisfied with being identified with one tendency or another. [Hanania] In view of the position which such a well-known follower of the conservative line as Deputy Alberto Cardemil has been establishing within the RN, are you not concerned that this conservative position could again become dominant in all its glory and majesty, but now without Jarpa? [Allamand] (Laughing). On the contrary. The task of the president of the party is specifically to try to harmonize the various views of the future. [Hanania] Will that kind of harmony require the end of the "Jarpista" [conservative] tendency? [Allamand] Please, who is interested in that? You make me laugh. It is simply absurd to talk about the end of the Jarpa tendency, given the present, internal situation in the RN. Nobody is now working within the party in a kind of competition for certain positions, and, even less, to develop new factions within the party. This is a party which is fed up with factions, many of which arose more because of personal problems than anything else. I visualize a situation from now on of much greater cohesion and harmony. I think it is very good for a large party like this one, which also had several candidates for the Presidency of the Senate, to have a number of possible candidates for the presidency of the party. Opposition Alliance [Hanania] Although the RN and the UDI have agreed on the objective of having the "Union por Chile" [Union for Chile] presented as a valid alternative government for the 1999 elections, once again the two parties differ on the tactics to be followed to reach that objective. While the RN continues to hold to the idea of keeping in effect a democracy based on agreements, the UDI is tending toward a democracy based on alternatives. [Allamand] This difference between the "democracy of the agreements" and the "democracy of the alternatives" is much more apparent than real, since, among other things, it must not be forgotten that we developed both concepts during the previous government. In a modern democracy positive differences, that is, alternatives, must coexist. We must have enough intelligence to generate points of convergence, that is, agreements. [Hanania] Nevertheless, some of your associates consider that once the transition is over, the policy of agreements will no longer be justified. [Allamand] We must not return to confrontation in Chilean politics simply because the transition to democracy has been completed. I believe that there is an enormous amount of political immaturity in those who allege that they wish to have nothing more to do with one of the greatest "intangibles" which the country has as a whole, that is, the climate of political harmony and social peace. [Hanania] Some UDI leaders consider that a policy of that kind will delay the possibility for the opposition to become a real, alternative government, because such a policy blurs the differences. [Allamand] I believe, quite to the contrary, that such a policy would bring the differences out more clearly and strengthen them because such a policy would show unmistakably to the country that the opposition has ideas and the capacity really to have an impact on national leadership and, consequently, to be the government. In a democracy you govern from the side of the government, but also from the opposition. And if they ask me how you move more quickly by being an alternative government, in my view it is not by waiting for six years to propose a list of actions to be taken which you have kept up your sleeve but rather through the consistent and continuing action of providing solutions to national problems. [Hanania] Do you think that the position of the UDI reflects a certain meanness of spirit by concentrating on outlining the right rather than emphasizing the interests of the country? [Allamand] I would not put it in such harsh terms. That is a kind of a caricature of the situation. All of a sudden the forms seem to be harsher than the substance. The question now is whether, during the Frei administration, the opposition should lend its active cooperation to accomplishing major, national tasks or, on the contrary, to stand by its own positions and simply act as spectators. I believe that the proper way to behave when you are in the opposition is by cooperating actively in carrying out the national tasks which face governments. I hope that, finally, the UDI will also work along the line that you have to serve the permanent interests of the country, whether in the government or in the opposition. [Hanania] Nevertheless, many people, including some within the government itself, think that the RN will wind up adopting the views of the UDI, just as, for example, it wound up accepting the incorporation of the UCC [Center-Center Union] in the right-wing agreement. [Allamand] In effect we accepted the incorporation of the UCC since, had we rejected it, it would have been impossible to prepare a list of candidates for the Senate. In that event, this list achieved great success. The basic discussion was always about how the UCC was to be incorporated. It should not be forgotten that the UCC began by asking for 15 districts in which it would stand on its own. But at this point that sounds to me like an argument from the past. [Hanania] My question, Deputy Allamand, was whether you rejected the possibility that the RN would also end up accepting at this point the view of the UDI by hardening its position against the government. [Allamand] You are working on the basis of the view that the UDI imposes its point of view, which, objectively speaking, is not true. During the whole period of the previous administration the RN was consistent and coherent in implementing a policy of agreements from the first to the last day. And, simultaneously, we set out conditions for entering into electoral alliances, both in the election of 1992 as well as in the election of 1993. I hope that in this new stage of greater harmony we may act jointly. We have a certain policy. Of course, we are interested in having a united, opposition policy. [Hanania] If you find that the results of the policy of agreements followed during the Aylwin administration was so satisfactory, why do you think that the UDI would wish to change it? [Allamand] Those who think that the opposition behaved badly during the Aylwin government are blind. We increased our parliamentary representation both in the Senate as well as in the Chamber of Deputies. We consolidated our electoral support and increased our vote. [Hanania] Do the differences which appear today between the RN and the UDI relate to the way the right might handle the power which it obtained in the Senate? [Allamand] At a time when the center-right has experienced its greatest cohesion and unity over the past five years, it is almost absurd to be concerned about such differences as exist. There are many more points of agreement than in previous periods. Now, each party has its own identity. The UCC has its identity, the UDI has its own, and we have our own. [Hanania] And is the UCC playing the role of moderator? [Allamand] Within the coalition no one is playing the role of umpire or moderator. Each party presents its points of view, things are discussed, and so far there has been enough agreement to act together. [Hanania] Do you believe that the unity which the right has achieved will be really stable? [Allamand] I think that the worst part of this difficult process is behind us and that today we have a positive stage in front of us. During the previous administration the differences between the RN and the UDI were understandable, to a certain extent, because the agreement which we had regarding what we had to do as an opposition was different. We contributed to reforms which I consider key factors in the present, forward looking situation in which Chile finds itself. These included tax and labor reforms, without which I am sure that the previous government would not have had the prevailing social peace between labor and management. The UDI had a different view. However, today we have a significant, united position. [Hanania] Speaking of reforms, what progress has been made in the conversations which you have been having with the new government in dealing with pending constitutional reforms? [Allamand] In terms of constitutional reforms, there is a "critical mass" in support of moving forward quickly to increase the investigatory powers of Congress and to strengthen municipal governments, including the direct election of mayors. There are other matters on which spontaneous agreement has also emerged, such as, for example, the need to deal with the possibility of a vacancy in the office of president. I have proposed that perhaps this is a good time to see if we can reach an agreement which would make it possible to return to synchronizing elections. Today there is major confusion, and we have an intermittent sequence of elections. There are other subjects, such as that of the appointed senators, the impossibility of removing the commanders in chief of the armed forces from office, the matter of the National Security Council, the composition of the Constitutional Tribunal, and the electoral system itself, on which, as of this point, agreements are not in sight. [Hanania] Do the constitutional reforms also involve the conversations going on with the PS [Socialist Party]? [Allamand] I have the greatest respect and political regard for Camilo Escalona, and that helps us to carry on a continuing conversation between socialists and members of the RN in analyzing different political, economic, social, and constitutional subjects. It is a positive sign for us to have direct conversations which, furthermore, are appropriate for any mature and healthy democracy. To some extent we have disposed of the idea that the democratic center-right and the democratic left have to go through a kind of customs examination presided over by the DC [Christian Democracy party]. That relates to a past phase of Chilean democracy.
