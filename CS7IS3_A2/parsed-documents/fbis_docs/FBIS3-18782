Qualified majority support from the two sides is needed for the common position to be adopted and if this is not forthcoming, the Programme could be caught up in an inter-institutional game of ping-pong that could would put a serious question mark over the possibility of it starting up within the prescribed period of time. This, the first application of the co-decision procedure that was ushered in by the Maastricht Treaty, poses several basic questions about inter-institutional symmetry. Ten Parliamentary Amendments It was last February 9 that the European Parliament returned its Opinion on its second reading of the programme and adopted 10 amendments to the Council of Ministers' common position. The changes mainly affect the overall budget and its spread among the various activities, its annual schedule and the role of the Joint Research Centre. Budget Amendments The Parliament has asked for the overall Framework Programme budget to be plumped up by ECU400 million so as raise the total agreed upon by Ministers from ECU10.746 billion to ECU11.146 billion. Ministers also decided that the sum could be increased to as much as ECU11.441 billion in 1996, in the light of the Programme's progress, the general economic circumstances and the Union's budgetary situation at the time. The Parliament contests these criteria and reckons that the total should be raised to at least ECU12.041 billion in the light of an assessment of the cost/benefit ratio and the application of the programme, not in accordance with the economic or budgetary situation. The Parliament also takes exception to the way the money is being shared out among the two periods -- ECU5.283 billion for 1994-1996 and ECU5.463 billion for 1997-1998 - and proposes the following annual formula: - 1994: ECU10 million - 1995: ECU3.013 billion - 1996: ECU3.252 billion - 1997: ECU3.199 billion - 1998: ECU2.926 billion - Total updated: ECU12.4 billion The Parliament also has its ideas about how to spread the overall resources among the different research activities. It proposes another ECU140 million for the first Activity (research programmes), including an additional ECU20 million for electronic data transmission, ECU70 [million] for industrial technologies and materials, ECU16 [million] for non-nuclear energy and 34 for targeted social and economic research. It proposes to add ECU180 million for the second set of activities (international cooperation), including ECU50 [million] for initiatives to combat environmental and health problems in the countries of the former Soviet Union. It is asking for an additional ECU80 million for the third action on disseminating/exploiting research findings. Exposing the JRC to More Limited Competition The European Parliament takes the view that the competition that the Council wants to expose the Joint Research Centre [JRC] to is too much. It proposes to boost the JRC budget for its specific programme activities (ECU619 million, against ECU575 [million] in the common position) and to reduce the amount earmarked for activities opened up to competition (ECU66 million, against ECU91 million). According to the Parliament, JRC activities should be opened up to competition by no more than 15 to 20 percent in the case of the Framework Programme (against 24 percent in the common position) and 7 to 10 percent in the case of the nuclear energy research component (against 10 percent). Committee Procedures, Scientific Control and Aims The Parliament also sees advantage in gradually integrating the research activities in the coal and steel sector, now covered by the ECSC Treaty, into the Framework Programme. For example, MEPs want technological and social research operations that have a bearing on the coal and steel sector to be included in the appropriate specific research programme. As for the specific programme on targeted social and economic research, the Parliament wants to include a new research strand aimed at promoting security and health at work and achieving harmonisation in this realm. Several parliamentary amendments seek to ensure that the Programme is monitored by independent outside experts. When it comes to committee procedures, the Parliament suggests adding to the Framework Programme decision an annex providing for the adoption (in the context of the implementation of specific programmes) of joint implementation procedures to be established by means of an inter-institutional agreement. Convening the Conciliation Committee In the early stages of its March 4 sitting, the Research Council will more likely than announce that it is impossible to take on board all the amendments and will then convene the Conciliation Committee as is provided for by the co-decision procedure. First Test for New Co-decision Procedure The long-drawn-out passage of the 4th Framework Programme has provided the first opportunity for the first purposeful application of the new co-decision procedure established under the Maastricht Treaty. The procedure can be avoided only if the Council nods through all the Parliamentary amendments and this is extremely unlikely in the present case. Some of the amendments, such as those to do with the JRC's nuclear research activities, are disapproved of quite strongly by Ministers. The co-decision procedure applies only to the EU Treaty not the Euratom one and some Member States want the amendments proposed for nuclear energy to be rejected. The Greek Presidency's agenda therefore includes a meeting of the Conciliation Committee in the afternoon of 4 March, at the end of the Council sitting. There are two possible outcomes: - either the Council members or their representatives and European Parliament representatives, that go to make up the Committee, agree, each by a qualified majority, on a common project. They have six weeks to do so, after which the two institutions have a further six weeks to approve (by a qualified majority in the case of the Council and an absolute majority in the case of the Parliament) the inter-institutional agreement. Should this come to pass, the Framework Programme may be adopted fairly soon, - or the Committee fails to reach an agreement on a common project. The Council thus has six weeks within which to confirm, by a qualified position, its common position, possibly combined with one or another Parliamentary amendment. If the latter is not pleased with the situation, it may act by an absolute majority to reject the common position. These time limits may be extended, if need be, by several months, so the Framework Programme could be delayed quite seriously if the second possibility were to become true. Inter-institutional Symmetry Theoretically, the Council should be able to adopt the Euratom part of the Framework Programme by means of a consultation pure and simple with the Parliament and without taking account of the latter's amendments. The risk there, however, would be that the Parliament would dig its wheels in over the non-Euratom component and apply the co-decision procedure right to the bitter end. In order to stop this from happening, the Council has agreed to make a linkage between the two decisions and not to adopt the Euratom part as long as the other part of the Framework Programme has not been adopted as well. This first application of a decision covered by the co-decision procedure provides the Member States with clear evidence of to what extent the Parliament's powers have been increased under the Maastricht Treaty and this is not entirely to their liking. During preliminary talks within Council working groups, several Member States expressed concern about what effect the co-decision procedure is having on the inter-institutional balance. If the Council wants to avoid the conciliation procedure, it has to say "aye" to all the parliamentary amendments. The UK takes the view that in general the Council cannot always cave in to the Parliament's demands so as to avoid getting ensnared in a lengthy and convoluted process. White Paper and Cooperation with EEA Countries After mooting whether to take on board all the parliamentary amendments, and, if need be, convene the Conciliation Committee at the end of the Council sitting, Ministers are expected to discuss what contribution research policy is making to the White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment and the debate is likely to use as its starting point a report by Antonio Ruberti, the European Commissioner for Research. Next an informal gathering is scheduled to take place between Research Ministers from the five EFTA countries that have signed the European Economic Area Agreement (Austria, Finland, Sweden, Norway and Iceland) so as to consider the opportunities for cooperation between the EU and the EFTA countries in the EEA.
