Permit me to express my gratitude to you for this meeting today and to offer my thanks to President Zhelev, who invited me to make this visit, which I hope will be of service for cooperation, drawing together, and friendship between our two countries. History and joint coexistence in our region have been associated with numerous friendly links between our two peoples. The Albanians do not forget that in times of great difficulty for them, they were able to set up colonies here in Sofia, which were powerful centers for our national rebirth. Enlighteners and eminent Albanian revivalists who lived and worked in Sofia organized associations which published books and newspapers that cleared the path for our nation to advance toward independence. Leaders of the Albanian bands fighting for freedom also found support in Bulgaria. The Bulgarians helped the Albanians to win their independence, and we experienced a feeling of true friendship. When Albania won her independence, this was welcomed with immense joy by our people. The Albanians should have confidence in our support for ensuring that their state remains free and independent -- this was stated in the greetings telegram from the Bulgarian state in connection with Albania's independence. The new atmosphere that has been created in the countries of Eastern Europe following the overthrow of the dictators' regimes, which oriented Albania and Bulgaria toward the universal democratic values and integration into Europe, has indubitably opened up broad horizons and new prospects for developing comprehensive cooperation and friendship between us. The visits to Albania by President Zhelev, National Assembly Chairman Yordanov, Foreign Minister Daskalov, and other Bulgarian ministers, as well as the visits to Bulgaria by Albanian Parliament Chairman Arbnori, Prime Minister Meksi, and Albanian ministers, helped us to establish closer cooperation and to sign agreements of mutual interest to both states. Among these agreements I would like especially to mention the signing by our two presidents in Tirana of the Treaty on Friendship and Cooperation Between Albania and Bulgaria. I am glad that during this visit we also signed an agreement on economic and trade cooperation and an agreement on protecting and stimulating investments that will directly help us to increase economic production-sharing between our two countries. Esteemed ladies and gentlemen, many times in the course of past centuries our two peoples overcame difficulties and troubles. However, I do not want to dwell on history now, but merely to stress that during the second half of the 20th century the communist regime was an immense common drama that we both experienced, but the liberation from totalitarian domination clearly demonstrated that the Albanians and Bulgarians can be bent but never broken. At the moment, Albania and Bulgaria are committing their utmost efforts to realizing the wishes of their peoples, expressed by their free vote, to build a society on the basis of a rule-of-law state, with due respect for the liberties and rights of man, to build a market economy, and to achieve their integration into Europe and the international community. Permit me to pay my respects to this parliament in recognition of its exceptional work in replacing the legislation of a dictatorial society with the laws and norms of a free democratic society. [applause] I take pleasure in being able to inform you that Albania is strongly committed to the same transformation. During the last two years, to overcome the legacy, certainly the most bitter one of all the legacies in Eastern Europe, we chose the fast track for implementing in-depth legislative, social, and economic reforms. This course is probably the most painful one; it requires the most sacrifices, but on the other hand most quickly produces visible results. The Albanian Parliament passed hundreds of laws meeting European standards, the most important of which are a Charter of Human Rights and difficult constitutional laws that correspond to the European Human Rights Convention. In two years, all our institutions have undergone profound transformations. In the economic field, we privatized the land, housing plots, road transportation, trade, and services. We have privatized over 1,000 enterprises during the last eight months alone. In 1994 we will continue the privatization of medium-size and large enterprises. The have liberalized prices and foreign currency exchange, and the results were not slow in coming. The stores are full, the long lines have disappeared, and our currency has stabilized and, in practice, is convertible. Last year annual inflation fell to 30 percent from 400 percent prior to the elections on 22 March 1992. In 1993 Albania reported the greatest economic growth in Europe, a growth of 10 percent in the GNP. Despite all this, Albania remains the poorest country in Europe, with an infrastructure of a Third World country, with obsolete technologies, and a high rate of unemployment that varies between 14 and 18 percent. These factors hamper our way forward. Ladies and gentlemen, our two friendly countries, as well as the other countries of the Eastern Europe, have liberated ourselves from communist dictatorships and chosen the road of freedom [applause], the market economy, and the rule-of-law state, a road that they do not expect to be strewn with flowers. However, as well as the immense natural difficulties of the transition, of orientation toward the market economy, we have encountered unexpected problems and even unforeseen dangers. The dismantling of the Berlin Wall and the Iron Curtain are naturally immense achievements of mankind as a whole and of Western society in particular. Their replacement with a financial wall, barriers of a different psychological nature, and ultranationalist and racist obstacles constitute an immense threat, not only for our countries but also for our continent. The removal of the Iron Curtain was not only accompanied by the liberation of the dozens of countries and hundreds of millions of people from one of the most cruel dictatorships that mankind has experienced, but we have to admit that it was also accompanied by dangerous phenomenons: the Bosnian syndromes, the Zhirinovskiy phenomenon [applause], the Serbian aggression, and its exacerbation by various forms of nationalism, ultranationalism, racism, and so on. Before the specter of communism had fully disappeared, other ghosts from the near and more distant past today pose a threat to peace, security, and democratic values on our continent. Taken together, all of them hamper and interrupt the process of integration that is vitally important and crucial for both the fate of democracy in our countries and the whole of Western mankind, and intensify confrontation. Therefore, today more than ever, the consolidation of bilateral and regional cooperation is of particular importance for our present and future, for our children. [applause] Mr. Chairman, our peninsula has been plunged into in a profound and dangerous crisis. The war in Bosnia is the greatest human drama that Europe has experienced since the time of World War II. This war, if the aggressor is allowed to get away with it, is only the prelude to a regional war waged on a broader scale, the consequences of which cannot be described. [applause] First, the war in Bosnia is the result of the decision of the communist dictatorship in Belgrade to create a Greater Serbia by aggression and in conformance with the memorandum of the Serbian Academy of Sciences that envisages the ethnic purging of more than 40 percent of the population inhabiting this territory, on the sole ground that it is not Serbian. Second, there is an exacerbation and encouragement of this aggression by other nationalist Balkan -- and not only Balkan -- countries that believe that, following the Serbian model, they can satisfy their own chauvinistic and ultranationalistic ambitions. [applause] Third, it is more than naive to think that a Greater Serbia, if established, could establish peace, stability, and equilibrium in the Balkans. In practice, this idea is just as dangerous as the previous two, and would have graver consequences. This is so because first, it accepts the alteration of borders by force, and second, it supports the ridiculous thesis that the Serbian people should dominate in the Balkan peninsula, when it makes up no more than 7 to 8 percent of the population of the Balkans. Believing in this viewpoint is tantamount to aiding the long-term destabilization of the region, because history has clearly confirmed on numerous occasions that a Greater Serbia was always a transitory and unstable structure and lead to war, conflicts, instability, and aggression. [applause]. It is a fact that a Greater Serbia always represents a direct danger for the Bulgarians, Albanians, Macedonians, and other peoples. We believe that the aggression against Bosnia-Herzegovina, a sovereign state and a member of the United Nations, and its dismemberment by force of arms set a question mark over the common and individual security of the countries in our peninsula. We are seriously worried about the continuous degradation of the situation in Kosovo, where 2 million Albanians live on a compact territory, making up 90 percent of its population. In the former Yugoslavia, Kosovo was an autonomous province and enjoyed almost all the rights of the former Yugoslav republics. Kosovo had its own state, economic, and cultural institutions, whereas today Belgrade denies these human and national rights, rejects dialogue with them, and is creating in Kosovo an explosive situation that may easily blow up. Albania declares that it opposes changing borders from a position of force. It insists that if Belgrade transfers the conflict to Kosovo, it will bear the total responsibility for a regional war. The prevention of this war is an important and permanent priority for Albania, Bulgaria, and other countries interested in peace and stability. I consider that, under these conditions, bilateral cooperation -- political, economic, cultural, and military -- between Albania and Bulgaria, and also within the multilateral framework of the European institutions, the Partnership for Peace initiative, and the Black Sea Economic Zone initiative are of immense importance for peace and stability in our region. By their policies, Albania and Bulgaria have provided and are making an important contribution to preserving peace and preventing conflicts. In this context, I would like to stress that Bulgaria's refusal to take part in the trilateral summit in Athens is of immense importance for reducing and restraining the expansionist ambitions of those who consider that they can implement them by forming aggressive axes and alliances. Furthermore, although it maintains that the Albanian question is the chief one in the Balkans, Albania does not want borders to be changed by force. It stands for a democratic region in which respect is shown for the human and national freedoms and rights of the Albanians in the place where they live. Our two countries recognized The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and regard its stability as a condition for preventing a conflict in the southern part of the Balkans. [applause] Ladies and gentlemen, I am an optimist regarding the development of the spirit of understanding, cooperation, and friendship between Albania and Bulgaria. Albania attaches particular importance to its friendly relations with the Republic of Bulgaria because it is convinced that this corresponds to the political, economic, and cultural interests of our two nations, and also contributes to expanding a climate of defusing tension and cooperation in our region, the Balkans. I consider that bilateral and multilateral cooperation in the Balkans is a crucial factor for the process of the integration of our countries and peoples into Europe. I express my wish for the traditional friendly cooperation between Albania and Bulgaria and the multilateral cooperation to develop even further. May God help Albania to develop and speedily advance along the road of progress, states the greetings telegram that I quoted at the start of my speech. I would like to conclude by offering the same good wishes to you. [applause and cheers] May God bless our countries and peoples, and the friendship and cooperation between them! Thank you. [applause]
