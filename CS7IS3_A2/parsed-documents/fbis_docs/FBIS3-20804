This is evident from the preliminary results of the Czech Statistical Office. Total exports for 1993 rose to Kc372.3 billion (approximately two-fifths of the gross domestic product), while imports amounted to Kc366.4 billion. Slovakia accounted for virtually 19 percent of the overall volume of foreign trade; countries with developed market economies accounted for 58 percent. The remainder is accounted for by developing countries and the countries of the former Eastern bloc. The Czech Republic achieved a positive balance of trade with the countries of the European Union (Kc7.5 billion), developing countries (Kc13.6 billion), European countries whose economies are in transition, excluding the former USSR (Kc8.4 billion), countries having a system of state trade (Kc6.4 billion), and Slovakia (Kc9.6 billion). The balance of trade involving countries of EFTA [European Free Trade Association] was on the negative side (Kc12 billion), as was the balance involving the remaining developed nations with market economies (Kc7.7 billion) and trade involving the countries of the former USSR (Kc19.8 billion). A significant increase developed in exports (excluding exports to the Slovak Republic because data for 1992 do not exist), which amounted to a 20-percent rise in comparison with 1992. Imports for last year, compared to the previous year, rose by only 2.7 percent. Excluding the Slovak Republic, the balance of trade remained on the negative side to the extent of Kc3.7 billion, although the current account of the balance of payments in convertible currencies was specifically on the positive side last year; for just 11 months of 1993, it amounted to $637 million--that is, approximately Kc18.5 billion.
