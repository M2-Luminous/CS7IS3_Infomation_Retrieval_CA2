UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] rebels have been launching offensives at Cuito and Malanje, while the government has been bombing UNITA headquarters at Huambo. Aid flights have been interrupted and the civilian death toll is already well into the hundreds. Well, today, a flight made it to Cuito and came back with a number of relief workers being evacuated from the city. World Food Program Director in Angola Philip Borel was on the plane. On the line to Luanda, Chris Greene asked him what the relief workers had said about the situation in Cuito over the past few days. [Begin recording] [Borel] Well, the situation is very bad. I can't say nothing more than that. It is extremely bad. [Greene] Could they give any impression of the number of people who have been killed? [Borel] It is very difficult to give statistics when you are most of the time in a bunker. [Greene] You say they spent most of their time in a bunker. Does that mean that the shelling was more or less continuous for the last few days? [Borel] Correct. Even last night and even in the morning. [Greene] So, it is still going on? [Borel] Yes, yes. We are very concerned. [Greene] Do you see any possibility of being able to get relief flights into Cuito in the near future? [Borel] I think it is extremely premature to say anything before the political arm of the United Nations has indicated to us that we may resume the flights. [Greene] Are your people who have just come out of Cuito able to tell you anything about the food situation there? [Borel] Yes, sure. The food situation is terrible. Mr. Hans Peter Vicola who is our [word indistinct] manager in Cuito has done a beautiful job. He has himself made the latest distribution on Monday and after that, since a bomb fell on our warehouse, we have no more food to distribute; but according to his information, we may have maybe one week of spare food for all the population and after that, there will be [words indistinct] survive. [Greene] How many people had WFP been feeding up there? [Borel] More or less 160,000. [Greene] So, basically the entire population? [Borel] That is correct. You see, they have no other link [words indistinct] our flights. [Greene] What information have you had today about the situation in other parts of Angola? [Borel] I think the situation is bad in Malanje again. We have not resumed a flight to Malanje. The situation is still difficult in Huambo. We have resumed a flight to Huambo. The situation in the north also is quite tense and we have not resumed a flight. Everywhere else [words indistinct] normally. [Greene] What does normal mean in that kind of context? [Borel] Normal means that we have flights without problems to Luena, Saurimo, Menongue, and [words indistinct] corridors, from Namibe, Lubango, Ndjiva, and from Lobito to Cubal, and a lot of other places. Yesterday, we succeeding a [words indistinct] to Dundo. [end recording]
