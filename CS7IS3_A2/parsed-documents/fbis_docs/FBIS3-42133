The two governments, currently discussing deployment of Patriot missiles on the Korean peninsula, are considering some time in March or April, a senior Seoul official said Tuesday. Korea is in no hurry to deploy the missiles as there are no clear signs of a threat to the Korean peninsula, while the United States wants deployment to take place as soon as possible, producing the difference of opinion, the official said. Seoul, fearing that the missile deployment may provoke Pyongyang and sidetrack the process of resolving the North Korean nuclear problem, wants to watch the progress of the nuclear talks before making a decision, he said.
