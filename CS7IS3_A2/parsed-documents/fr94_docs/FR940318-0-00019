FR940318-0-00019 FR940318-0-00004 One commenter suggested that the OTS clarify and amend the recourse provisions of its capital rule to recognize more subtle distinctions in risk. Upon consideration, the OTS has decided not to amend its recourse provisions as part of this rulemaking because the OTS and the other federal banking agencies are considering the treatment of loss sharing arrangements and related recourse issues as part of their comprehensive interagency review of recourse, initiated by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Counsel (FFIEC). Under the FFIEC's initiative, the agencies are considering revisions to their risk-based capital standards to distinguish among loss sharing arrangements involving asset sales based on the degree of risk involved in the transaction. III. Description of the Final Rule Under today's final rule, multifamily mortgage loans qualify for the 50 percent risk-weight category if they satisfy the following criteria: (1) The loan must be secured by a first lien on a multifamily residential property consisting of 5 or more dwelling units; (2) the loan must amortize principal and interest over a period at origination of not less than seven years and not more than 30 years; (3) when the loan is considered for a lower risk-weight category, all principal and interest payments have been made on a timely basis in accordance with its terms for the preceding year; (4) the loan is performing and not 90 days or more past due; (5) the loan is made by the savings association in accordance with prudent underwriting standards; and (6) if the interest rate on the loan does not change over the term of the loan, then: (a) The current loan balance amount does not exceed 80 percent of the value of the property securing the loan; and (b) for the property's most recent fiscal year, the ratio of annual net operating income generated by the property (before payment of any debt service on the loan) to annual debt service on the loan is not less than 120 percent, or in the case of cooperative or other not-for-profit housing projects, the property generates equivalent debt service coverage; or (7) if the loan has a variable rate, then: (a) The current loan balance amount does not exceed 75 percent of the value of the property securing the loan; and (b) for the property's most recent fiscal year, the ratio of net operating income generated by the property (before payment of any debt service on the loan) to annual debt service on the loan is not less than 115 percent, or in the case of cooperative or other not-for-profit housing projects, the property generates equivalent debt service coverage. In addition, the final rule extends ``grandfathered'' treatment to those multifamily mortgage loans that on the effective date of this rule qualified for the 50 percent risk-weight category under the definition of ``qualifying multifamily mortgage loan'' in the OTS's previous capital rule and continue to satisfy the criteria of that definition, but do not satisfy all the criteria for inclusion in the 50 percent risk-weight category under today's rule. Any ``grandfathered'' multifamily mortgage loan that does not remain in compliance with the requirements of the prior rule may requalify for the 50 percent risk-weight category only by satisfying the criteria set forth in today's rule. Under today's rule, a multifamily mortgage loan 5 must continue to meet the requisite criteria on an ongoing basis, unless otherwise specified, for the loan to remain in the 50 percent risk-weight category. A multifamily mortgage loan that does not remain in compliance with the requirements set forth in today's rule must be reassigned to the appropriate risk-weight category. The OTS notes that institutions may make multifamily mortgage loans that do not meet the criteria set forth in this rule so long as such loans conform with prudent underwriting standards. Such loans must be placed in the appropriate risk-weight category. 5 Multifamily mortgage loans include loans secured by property that is used for some commercial purposes so long as the property is primarily a multifamily residence. Furthermore, purchasers of multifamily mortgage loans may look to the borrower's payment history with the selling institution and the characteristics of the purchased loans to determine compliance with the timely payments requirement and other qualifying criteria under this rule. Likewise, institutions with multifamily mortgage loans in their portfolio that did not qualify for a lower risk-weight under the OTS's previous risk-based capital rule may review the borrower's prior payment history to determine compliance with this rule's criteria.
