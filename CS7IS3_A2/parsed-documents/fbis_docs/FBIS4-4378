FBIS4-4378 "dreas062_j_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-062 Daily Report 27 Jan 1994 Indonesia * Suharto Proposes Initiatives for Bosnia * Suharto Proposes Initiatives for Bosnia 94SE0072A Jakarta KOMPAS in Indonesian 27 Jan 94 pp 1, 14 94SE0072A Jakarta KOMPAS Indonesian CSO [Text] Indonesia, as chairman of the Nonaligned Movement (NAM) will propose initiatives for an International Conference on Bosnia-Herzegovina. For that purpose, President Suharto has instructed the head of the Chairman's Administrative Board of the Nonaligned Movement (BPK NAM) to look into possible ways of implementing this. In addition, Indonesia is planning to open diplomatic relations with Bosnia-Herzegovina. Indonesian wishes in these matters were revealed at talks held between President Suharto and Alija Izetbegovic, the president of Bosnia-Herzegovina, at the presidential palace in Jakarta yesterday. Minister/State Secretary Murdiono told reporters that the two parties gave serious consideration at the talks, which lasted from 9:30 to 10:30 AM, to the possibility of holding an International Conference on Bosnia-Herzegovina. Murdiono said that President Suharto gave direct instructions to Nana Sutresna, the head of the BPK NAM, to look into and make preparations for a possible conference. More particularly, President Suharto asked Nana Sutresna to instruct the Indonesian ambassador to the U.N. in New York to discuss this matter with the NAM Coordinating Bureau. Besides that, as chairman of the NAM, Indonesia will ask the international community to treat Bosnia fairly. The minister/state secretary said that the fact that the international community has been treating Bosnia unfairly is clear from the embargo, which has also been imposed on Bosnia, since Bosnia is far less powerful militarily than Serbia. In response to questions from reporters about holding a conference, Murdiono said that he could not yet imagine what the composition of such a conference would be. "Would Indonesia be the host or not?" he said. The idea must be developed and gain positive and wide-spread support. He asserted that the idea of holding an international conference is an Indonesian initiative, in President Suharto's position as chairman of the NAM. Murdiono went on to say that both heads of state agreed to immediately open diplomatic relations. This means that Bosnia-Herzegovina will have an ambassador to Indonesia. An Indonesian ambassador would be accredited to Bosnia or to Sarajevo. However, he said that the matter cannot be resolved as easily as that because it is a high-level decision and would take time. "As an example, the Bosnian ambassador would not necessarily be located in Jakarta and the Indonesian ambassador would not necessarily be located in Sarajevo. But, as I said earlier, he could be accredited and he could be posted to Jakarta," the minister said. As for the possibility that Indonesia would send military aid, Murdiono said that the matter had not been discussed at this meeting. "I only want to remind you that humanitarian aid has been sent there in the past," he explained. Murdiono once again emphasized that the reasons behind the effort to lift the weapons embargo on Bosnia are that Bosnia is in a weaker position, from the point of view of the balance of power. That is why in the past President Suharto, as chairman of the NAM, instructed the ambassador and permanent representative of Indonesia to the UN to fight for the lifting of the embargo. Murdiono admitted that the fight had not yet been successful. At the same time, at a news conference held after the talks, President Alija Izetbegovic said that Indonesia is a large and very influential country which is now in the position of chairman of the NAM from 1992 to 1995. Indonesia, he continued, is also influential in the Islamic Conference Organization (ICO). Therefore, Izetbegovic respectfully asked President Suharto to use his influence in the NAM to lift the weapons embargo against Bosnia. "Because the embargo is really aimed at Yugoslavia, and Bosnia isn't Yugoslavia," said Izetbegovic. Izetbegovic made his official remarks in English. But when he answered reporters' questions, he used his native language, which his son Sabina Berberovic then translated into English. He was accompanied by Subrata, director general of the PPG [Press and Graphics Development]; by Susilo Sudarman, foreign minister ad interim; by A. Tahir, ambassador-at-large for the European Region of the NAM; and by Muhamed Sacirbey, the Bosnian ambassador and permanent representative to the UN in New York. He said that the only way to achieve peace is through a balance of military power. Without this balance of military power, every negotiating technique will end up dictating against Bosnia. "That is why the Geneva peace talks failed," he said. "That is also why I am asking President Suharto to use his influence with the ICO to continue their political support and humanitarian aid to Bosnia," added Izebegovic. He said that if the aggression goes on for a long time, the weapons embargo must also be matched by the imposition of an air embargo. This step is important in opposing Serbia and the other forces which are hampering the shipment of humanitarian aid to Bosnia. Izetbegovic said that Bosnia is very similar to Indonesia in several respects. "Bosnia is also a multicultural, multireligious nation and a pluralistic society," he said. "We think that perhaps Indonesia and the Indonesian people alone can understand our problems," he added. The talks between President Izetbegovic and President Suharto lasted from 9:30 to 10:30 AM West Indonesia time. At the same time, talks also took place between Nana Sutresna, the head of the BPK NAM, and Muhamed Sacirbey, the Bosnian ambassador and permanent representative to the UN. Izetbegovic considered his meeting with President Suharto to be very useful and constructive. Izetbegovic familiarized President Suharto with all aspects of the present situation and the history of the Bosnian crisis, especially its political and military aspects. In particular, he conveyed his thanks to the Indonesian nation and people, who have always supported the Bosnian people's struggle. Murdiono said that President Suharto in turn familiarized his colleague from Bosnia with the history of the struggle of the Indonesian people from the time they obtained their freedom until they received international recognition. President Suharto emphasized that the struggle for Indonesian freedom required a combination of military struggle and diplomatic struggle. After these private talks Izetbegovic prayed at the Istiqlal Mosque. Then, at about 12:00 noon, he kept to his promise to meet with reporters. Unfortunately, before the reporters could finish asking their questions, Director General of the PPG Subrata ended the meeting saying that President Izetbegovic had to leave for Halim Perdanakusuma Airport. Earlier, the Indonesian Islamic Committee for Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Al-Irsjad Institute had contributed money in the form of a check for $94,000, 64 rings, 15 necklaces and 33 earrings. All of these contributions, which were collected spontaneously, were handed over by Anwar Haryono, chairman of the Indonesian Islamic Missionizing Board and accepted by President Izetbegovic. When he was saying his midday prayers at the Istiqlal Mosque, President Izetbegovic expressed his gratitude to the Islamic community, which had always taken part in the Bosnian-Herzegovinian struggle. He also expressed his admiration for the attitude of the Indonesian people, who have always helped and supported the Bosnian people's struggle. He said that his visit to the Istiqlal Mosque had not been on the list of events or part of state protocol. He admitted that he had known of the existence of the Istiqlal Mosque for a long time. "That's why since I'm in Indonesia why not pray here and see this glorious mosque for myself," he said. The Bosnian presidential party arrived at Istiqlal at 1:00 pm West Indonesia time and that is why they prayed as a group. In one row there was President Izetbegovic hemmed in by Tarmizi Taher, minister of religion; by Susilo Sudarman, foreign minister ad interim; by Achmad Tahir, ambassador-at-large to the NAM for the European Area; and by Irfan Ljubijankic, the Bosnian foreign minister, who acted as prayer leader.
