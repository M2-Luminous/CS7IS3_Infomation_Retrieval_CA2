Statement by 10 Deputies of the Russian Federation State Duma"] [Text] Ten deputies of the Russian Federation State Duma have come out with a statement criticizing government policy over the settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijan conflict. "Supported by the Russian government and using the conflict around Nagorno-Karabakh, Armenian military forces have occupied 14,000 sq km of Azerbaijan territory, evicting more than half a million residents, emerging as the main source of aggression in the Caucasus," stresses the document signed by, among others, opposition deputies Sergey Baburin, Aleksandr Nevzorov, and Anatoliy Lukyanov. The statement maintains that, against the eventuality of the Azerbaijan leadership's refusing to approve the Russian peace plan, Armenian military formations are preparing an assault on the city of Gyandzha while "Armenian military forces are incapable of conducting such offensive operations without direct support from the Russian Federation Defense Ministry." The authors of the statement believe it necessary in the very near future to hear at a State Duma session reports by the Russian Federation defense and foreign ministers to learn "to what extent the policy pursued by them in the zone of the Armenian-Azerbaijan conflict corresponds to Russia's national interests." It is noteworthy that prior to the statement a State Duma delegation led by Russian Path deputies' group coordinator Sergey Baburin visited Baku where it held negotiations with the Azerbaijan government. Although the statement was signed by only 10 deputies (mainly representatives of the Russian National Union), it can be assumed that communist and agrarian factions in the Russian parliament will support the charges made against the Chernomyrdin government. The Liberal Democratic Party of Russia faction will hardly join this statement because Vladimir Volfovich [Zhirinovskiy] has repeated accused Azerbaijan of infringing Armenians' rights. As for the State Duma committees, they have not as yet worked out a common approach to the Karabakh problem. State Duma Security Committee chairman Viktor Ilyukhin has signed "the statement of 10." At the same time the State Duma Committee on International Affairs so far tends to support President' Yeltsin's policy in the Karabakh conflict. Committee Chairman Vladimir Lukin, in the course of recent negotiations with Azerbaijan parliament speaker Rasul Guliyev, sought to persuade him to accept the peace plan prepared in Smolenskaya Square. As far as concerns talks between Baku and Moscow on terms for Azerbaijan's accession to the Moscow 17 May protocol, it is so far difficult to say that a definite accord will be reached. On Saturday in Moscow talks were held behind closed doors between Russian Federation and Azerbaijan Defense Ministers Pavel Grachev and Mamedraf Mamedov. An informed source in the Azerbaijan Defense Ministry told NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's correspondent that in the course of the meeting Mamedov stated that a condition for Azerbaijan's signing the document is the inclusion into the text of the protocol of an exact date for Armenian troop withdrawal from the occupied territories. Baku believes that the Armenian side must start the withdrawal, not after both sides pull out their troops from the current front line but simultaneously with it. The Russian minister agreed with Baku's arguments. The sides agreed to continue consultations after Grachev's return from his trip to the NATO headquarters in Brussels. The haste with which Russian generals are going to introduce peacekeeping forces in Azerbaijan suggests that Moscow is not particularly interested in seeing the CSCE Minsk group join the peace process. On 16 May Grachev told journalists that the Russian defense department will not wait for the arrival in the region of international observers but will be acting according to its own plan. Such a statement seems to be at odds with the accord about coordinating Moscow's and the CSCE's efforts on this issue reached between Russian Federation Foreign Affairs Minister Andrey Kozyrev and head of the CSCE Minsk group Ian Iliasson. At the end of last week the U.S. Administration warned Moscow indirectly about the impermissibility of conducting a peacekeeping operation in Nagorno- Karabakh without coordination with the CSCE and the UN. U.S. Ambassador to Azerbaijan Richard Kauzlarich made the following statement in Baku: Any plan for resolving the Karabakh problem, including a Russian plan, must be executed within the CSCE Minsk group framework... The introduction of CIS disengagement forces into the region must proceed under the supervision of international observers.
