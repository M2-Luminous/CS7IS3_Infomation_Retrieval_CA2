[Al-Jifri] The issue has been internationalized by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih twice: once when he signed a document on the formation of a joint military committee which included brothers in Oman and Jordan and French and U.S. friends. He thereby wanted to embarrass (President) 'Ali Salim al-Bid and portray him as the one who was rejecting the solutions, so al-Bid had to sign. He internationalized the issue for the second time when he launched military aggression against all the southern territory and not against the Socialist Party as he claims. [passage omitted] [Shatarah] Are you satisfied with the Arab and international positions on the war in Yemen? [Al-Jifri] Most of our Arab brothers and friends have adopted cordial stands which we will never forget. We thank them for these stands, which our people appreciate. [Shatarah] And the U.S. position? [Al-Jifri] It too is a serious position which demonstrates understanding of the issue. [Shatarah] There are reports that the north is implementing a plan aimed at separating Hadhramaut from the south, setting up a Hadhrami state, and then merging the other southern governorates with the north? [Al-Jifri] That has not run, nor will it run, through the mind of anyone in the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY]. If 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's aim is to achieve that through the aggressive war he has launched, he will not achieve it. [passage omitted] [Shatarah] Do you believe that the delay in recognizing the DRY has contributed to the escalation of the fighting? [Al-Jifri] World states are dealing with us -- which is a tacit recognition. As for official recognition, without doubt it is on the way. Because we have a cause and rights. And because our people have maintained a heroic steadfastness unprecedented in our contemporary history. They have made great sacrifices for the sake of the DRY. World states cannot ignore something like that. [Shatarah] 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih says that he will not hold a dialogue with the Socialist Party leadership but, instead, with the moderates and the unionists, in the sense that he rules out dialogue with you as a new leadership in the south. [Al-Jifri] And who said that he is the absolute master in this world and thus can exclude whomever he wants and accept whomever he wants? Let him say what he wants. [passage omitted] [Shatarah] What measures will you take in the event of the failure of the cease-fire attempts and the international envoy's mission? [Al-Jifri] 'Ali 'Abdallah announced (for the media) his agreement to implement the Security Council resolutions in letter and spirit. But -- as usual -- he failed to fulfill that. And we have no other option than to stand fast, resist, and prevent him from entering, seizing, and toppling the DRY (Aden). However, we will comply fully with the cease-fire. And we will use our right to defend ourselves, the land, and out honor. And the only solution to this matter is the dispatch of international observers to supervise the cease-fire. [passage omitted] [Shatarah] What truth is there in the reports of Jordan's involvement in sending military engineers to work with northern forces? [Al-Jifri] I have no details about that matter, and it was not expected of the brothers in Jordan. [passage omitted]
