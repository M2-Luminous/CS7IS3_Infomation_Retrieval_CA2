Mayorov, commander of Northwestern Group of Forces, and V. Birkavs, prime minister of Latvia; from the "Novosti" newscast] [Text] Yesterday Latvia and Russia were on the brink of a military conflict. Rucs, head of the Vidzeme district of Riga, undertook a provocative action. He decided to capture a few facilities where for the time being the Russian army is stationed. He ordered the deputy commander of the Northwestern Group of Forces and the deputy commander for personnel work, who had come to the talks, to be arrested and dispatched to the Latvian-Russian border in handcuffs. [Mayorov] Gentlemen, I believe that this action pursued political aims, and the main aim which the Latvian nationalists were pursuing was to disrupt the talks between Russian and Latvia, talks which had been proceeding normally, and to disrupt the withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvian territory. I must report to you that after these events -- and these events had been building up from the morning onwards, gradually -- on the order of the defense minister, combined units and units of airborne troops, including the Pskov Airborne Division, combined units and units of the military transport aviation, the front aviation, and the navy and, of course, units of the Northwestern Group of Forces were brought into combat readiness for the liberation of our servicemen and captured facilities. We were prepared to liberate our people and our facilities by force. I informed Latvia's President Mr. Ulmanis before midday. In reply he requested -- well, first, he told me that he was taking measures to resolve this conflict, that the organizer himself of this action -- well, evidently this is the outside organizer, behind him evidently there are other forces of nationalist persuasion -- Mr. Rucs would be indicted, and the officers and the facilities would be freed. He requested that no strong-arm methods be undertaken. We acceded to this request. [Birkavs, shown standing in office with Latvian coat of arms on wall] First of all, I express regret in connection with what happened, and on behalf of the government I apologize to those concerned. The absolutely impermissible conduct of head of the district council Mr. Rucs resulted in the Cabinet of Ministers immediately relieving him of his post. Criminal proceedings have been instituted. Now the police are looking for him in order to bring him to book. The official reply of the Foreign Ministry with apologies to Russia will be presented today.
