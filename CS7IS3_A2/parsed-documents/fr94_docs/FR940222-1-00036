FR940222-1-00036 FR940222-1-00008 The AAPCC is an estimate of the average per capita cost, under the fee-for-service system, for Medicare-covered services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries who are not enrolled in HMOs, CMPs, or HCPPs. HCFA's Office of the Actuary prepares an AAPCC for both aged and disabled beneficiaries for each county in the United States and adjusts the AAPCC rates demographically by age, sex, Medicaid status, and institutional status. For example, a 65&hyph;69 year old female, who is not eligible for Medicaid and not in an institution, might have a monthly AAPCC rate of $300 in a given county. An 80&hyph;84 year old female, institutionalized in the same county, might have an AAPCC rate of $680. These rate differences reflect the lower average Medicare costs for the younger, non-institutionalized beneficiary. There are 30 demographic groups for the aged Medicare population and 30 for the disabled Medicare population. Cost HMOs and CMPs receive monthly interim payments based on the annual operating budget they submit before the beginning of their contract year. At the end of the contract year, they must submit a cost report to document their actual costs, as a basis for a final settlement. As of March 1993, there were 93 risk HMOs and CMPs with 1,603,178 Medicare enrollees and 22 cost HMOs and CMPs with 140,415 enrollees. 2. HCPPs HCPPs are prepaid health care organizations that have agreements with HCFA to be paid in accordance with section 1833(a)(1)(A) of the Act. Under such an agreement, HCFA pays the HCPP only for part B services. Payment is based on ``reasonable costs'' and those costs are generally determined following the methods used for cost HMOs and CMPs, as described under section II.A.1. of this preamble. Some HCPPs provide the full range of part B services, while others offer a much more limited scope. HCPPs are not required to provide part A services and cannot be paid for those services under the HCPP agreement. Some HCPPs are organized to furnish comprehensive health care services to their Medicare enrollees and to their commercial enrollees. Those HCPPs, which could elect to contract as HMOs or CMPs, furnish or arrange for all or most part A services. The providers of those part A services submit their claims to, and are paid by, Medicare intermediaries. In March 1993, there were 57 HCPPs with 640,633 Medicare enrollees. B. History of Cost Limits 1. Statutory basis for setting cost limits Section 1861(v)(1)(A) of the Act authorizes us to establish limits on reasonable costs for entities that are paid on a reasonable cost basis. The limits must be based on estimates of the costs necessary in the efficient delivery of health care services. Our basic goal in establishing limits on costs for HMOs, CMPs, and HCPPs is to ensure that the Medicare program pays no more for care furnished to beneficiaries enrolled in these organizations than it would pay for services for beneficiaries not enrolled in an HMO, CMP, or HCPP. We consider that to pay more than we would have paid under the fee-for-service system would be inefficient and, thus, an inappropriate use of Medicare funds. 2. Provisions of the Regulations Before 1986, the regulations provided that, for HMOs and CMPs paying physicians on a salaried basis, costs were reasonable if they did not exceed the costs for comparable services in the HMO's or CMP's geographic area. Those costs, however, were not subject to the reasonable charge levels of the Medicare fee-for-service payment system, and HMOs and CMPs were not required to document the comparability of their costs to the costs allowed under that system. Costs incurred for payment to groups of physicians (organized either on a group practice or an individual practice basis) and for payment for other part B services could not exceed the Medicare reasonable charge levels. However, with respect to physicians' services, most HMOs and CMPs were exempted from this limit, under the ``effective incentives'' policy. Under this policy, the exemption was available if the members of the group of physicians accepted effective incentives, such as risk-sharing, designed to discourage unnecessary or unduly costly utilization of health services. In connection with these rules, the AAPCC was used as a guideline, but not as a limit, in assessing the reasonableness of the total costs incurred by HMOs and CMPs. The rules for HCPPs were similar and are still in effect. For HCPPs that pay physicians on a basis other than fee-for-service, such as capitation, costs are not measured against the reasonable charge or other fee-for-service rate. Rather, costs are measured against what a ``prudent buyer'' would pay for comparable services in the geographic area. Payments based on fee-for-service are generally subject to Medicare reasonable charge levels. However, if the payments are to a medical group whose members accept ``effective incentives'' to control utilization, the payments are subject to the ``prudent buyer'' standard rather than reasonable charge levels.
