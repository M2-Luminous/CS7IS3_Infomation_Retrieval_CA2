ACTION: Temporary regulations. SUMMARY: These temporary regulations are being issued to provide guidance to the public with respect to the substantiation requirement contained in section 170(f)(8) of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 170(f)(8) was added to the Code by section 13172 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. The guidance contained in these regulations affects donors of charitable contributions of $250 or more. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 1, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Joel S. Rutstein, 202&hyph;622&hyph;4930 (not a toll-free call). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Paperwork Reduction Act These regulations are being issued without prior notice and public procedure pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553). For this reason, the collection of information contained in these regulations has been reviewed and, pending receipt and evaluation of public comments, approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under control number 1545&hyph;1431. For further information concerning this collection of information, and where to submit comments on this collection of information, the accuracy of the estimated burden, and suggestions for reducing this burden, please refer to the preamble in the cross-reference notice of proposed rulemaking published in the Proposed Rules section of this issue of the Federal Register . Background This document contains amendments to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 1) relating to the substantiation requirement for the deduction of certain charitable contributions under section 170(f)(8) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). Section 170(f)(8) was added by section 13172 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. Need for Temporary Regulations The provisions contained in this Treasury decision are needed immediately to provide guidance to the public with respect to the application of the substantiation requirement of section 170(f)(8). Therefore, it is found impracticable and contrary to the public interest to issue this Treasury decision with prior notice under section 553(b) of title 5 of the United States Code. Explanation of Provisions Section 170 allows a deduction for contributions to or for the use of certain specified organizations, including those organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes. To be deductible under section 170 of the Code, a payment to or for the use of a qualified organization must be a gift_that is, a payment of money or transfer of property without adequate consideration. Rev. Rul. 67&hyph;246, 1967&hyph;2 C.B. 104. Thus, if a taxpayer receives goods or services from the organization in consideration for a payment, the taxpayer may not deduct as a charitable contribution more than the excess of the amount paid over the value of the consideration received therefor. Id. The Service has determined, however, that if a taxpayer receives only certain inconsequential or insubstantial benefits in consideration for a payment to a qualified organization, the taxpayer may deduct the entire payment as a charitable contribution. Rev. Proc. 90&hyph;12, 1990&hyph;1 C.B. 471. See also Rev. Proc. 92&hyph;49, 1992&hyph;1 C.B. 987 (amplifying Rev. Proc. 90&hyph;12 by providing that certain free, unordered, low-cost items that accompany charitable solicitations are considered to have insubstantial value). (See ยง601.601(d)(2)(ii) of the Statement of Procedural Rules, 26 CFR part 601.) Section 170(f)(8) disallows a deduction for any contribution of $250 or more that is not substantiated by a written acknowledgment from the donee organization. The acknowledgment must provide information regarding (a) the money or other property contributed, and (b) any goods or services provided by the donee organization in whole or partial consideration for the contributed money or other property. Section 170(f)(8) is a compliance provision, intended to facilitate the enforcement of the substantive requirements for a deduction under section 170. The compliance purpose of section 170(f)(8) does not require that an acknowledgment refer to goods or services provided by a donee organization to a donor if the provision of goods or services does not affect the amount that the donor is entitled to deduct as a charitable contribution. Therefore, the temporary regulations provide that goods or services given in return for a contribution need not be taken into account for purposes of section 170(f)(8), if the goods or services have insubstantial value under the guidelines provided in Rev. Procs. 90&hyph;12 and 92&hyph;49 (and any successor documents). (See ยง601.601(d)(2)(ii) of the Statement of Procedural Rules, 26 CFR part 601.) The legislative history of the 1993 Act states that Congress intended a similar exception to apply in connection with the disclosure requirement of section 6115. See H. Rep. No. 213, 103d Cong., 1st Sess. 566 (1993). Although the legislative history does not discuss application of such an exception to the substantiation requirement of section 170(f)(8), the Service has determined that such an exception is equally appropriate. Some donee organizations receive contributions through arrangements in which employers withhold amounts from the wages of their employees in accordance with pledges made by the employees, and pay the withheld amounts to the donee organizations. Donee organizations that use these arrangements may not know the identity of the contributing employees or the amounts contributed by each employee. Therefore, these donee organizations may face difficulty in preparing the acknowledgments contemplated by section 170(f)(8). The statutory language and legislative history of section 170(f)(8) suggest that Congress appreciated the difficulties of applying the substantiation requirement to contributions made by payroll deduction and intended that these difficulties be addressed by regulations. Section 170(f)(8)(E) directs the Secretary to ``provide such regulations as may be necessary or appropriate'' to carry out the purposes of section 170(f)(8), ``including regulations that may provide that some or all of the requirements of [that section] do not apply in appropriate cases.'' The Conference Report on the 1993 Act expresses the conferees' intent that the Secretary exercise his regulatory authority ``to clarify the treatment of contributions made through payroll deductions.'' H. Rep. No. 213, supra, at 567. Accordingly, the temporary regulations also provide special rules for contributions made by payroll deduction. The special rules allow taxpayers to substantiate contributions made by payroll deduction by a combination of two documents: (a) a document furnished by the taxpayer's employer that evidences the amount withheld from the taxpayer's wages, and (b) a document prepared by the donee organization that states that the organization does not provide goods or services as whole or partial consideration for any contributions made by payroll deduction.
