This is an important decision made at the GATT Uruguay Round talks as well as an important change in the international multilateral trade system. According to the schedule in the wake of the Uruguay Round, the World Trade Organization will probably take effect on 1 July 1995, but the exact date will be finally fixed at the Uruguay Round ministerial meeting in Morocco this April. The idea and proposal of establishing a world trade organization was put forward by the EC and Canada in the later stages of the Uruguay Round talks. However, they called it a multilateral trade organization which was intended to effectively implement the results of the Uruguay Round talks, expand the scope of GATT, and include the results of the Uruguay Round talks on the three new areas of intellectual property rights, investment measures, and service trade in the legal framework of the multilateral trade system and make GATT an official international trade organization and a permanent international trade agreement. The basic principles and goals of the World Trade Organization are basically the same as those of GATT, that is, to promote the achievement of the goal of liberalizing world trade through implementing the principles of market opening, nondiscrimination, and fair trade. However, the former represents world trade in a wider scope, is more formal in organizational structure and legally, and has a much wider scope of functions. This is concretely embodied in the following aspects: The World Trade Organization is very wide-ranging in content. It not only includes the goods trading rules which are traditional and which were amended in the Uruguay Round, but extends the world trade rules to such new areas as farm products, which have long been excluded from GATT, and investment measures, intellectual property rights, and the service trade. As an official international trade organization, it makes up for the shortcomings of GATT and is legally on an equal footing with other international organizations. It has a larger scope of functions. In addition to GATT's original functions of organizing the implementation of multilateral and submultilateral [ci duo bian 2945 1122 6708] trade agreements, offering an arena for multilateral trade talks, and acting as a forum, it will also be responsible for periodically examining the trade policies of its members, handle trade disputes between members, and be responsible for strengthening cooperation with the IMF, the World Bank, and their subsidiary organizations so as to achieve uniformity in global economic policy. All agreements (excluding several submultilateral agreements such as government purchase agreements) will be a unified agreement and a basket of agreements and will not allow for optional signing. It will considerably amend the mutually inapplicable GATT clauses and allow its members to negotiate with a new joining party on tariff reductions and concessions. But upon the entry of the new joining party, the two sides have the right to determine that their clauses are mutually inapplicable to each other. Unlike GATT, since the World Trade Organization will be an official international organization, all joining parties will be called "members." The World Trade Organization will have two types of membership status, namely founding member and new joining member. Founding members must possess the following qualifications, neither of which are dispensable: They must be GATT members when the World Trade Organization takes effect; they must sign a basket of Uruguay Round agreements; they must make tariff and nontariff reductions and concessions, and reductions and concessions in the area of the service trade in the Uruguay Round and make these reductions and concessions part of the Uruguay Round reductions and concessions list and the reductions and concessions list of the service trade general agreement. New joining member of the World Trade Organization refers to a country or an independent tariff region which possesses full rights over foreign trade that has become a member after negotiating joining conditions with the World Trade Organization after the World Trade Organization agreement takes effect. A decision of the World Trade Organization regarding acceptance of a new member must be approved by a two-thirds majority at a ministerial meeting. The establishment of the World Trade Organization will have a huge and far-reaching influence on standardizing and managing the future world economy and trade and on promoting the liberalization of global trade to a much greater extent and in a much wider scope. The World Trade Organization has inherited and developed the open and cooperative multilateral trade system represented by GATT, and thus greatly enhances people's confidence in the multilateral trade system. This is the motive power for the multilateral trade system to be long-lasting. The series of agreements under its jurisdiction will become new "traffic rules" for future world trade and will help ensure that international trade proceeds under normal order. Since the Uruguay Round trade liberalization measures concretely organized for implementation by the World Trade Organization will make all markets around the world more open and enable them to gradually benefit from this, it is undoubtedly very conducive to promoting international trade and economic growth and to increasing the employment opportunities of all countries. Its unified dispute resolution mechanism will mediate international trade disputes much more quickly and effectively and will to some extent reduce the unilateral retaliative acts of some big trading nations. Nevertheless, as a product of the Uruguay Round, the World Trade Organization has some shortcomings due to the limitations of the Uruguay Round. It does not take into sufficient consideration the interests of developing countries, in particular. It has not resolved all problems in the sphere of international trade, such as the issues of trade and the environment and the issue of restrictive commercial practices. The Uruguay Round has only temporarily balanced the international trade interests of some Western powers. Following the implementation of a basket of Uruguay Round agreements, they will unavoidably have new contradictions and conflicts of interests and will need the World Trade Organization to coordinate and resolve them. Therefore, the tasks faced by the World Trade Organization will be very heavy.
