Instead, it will provide the opportunity to more consistently carry out the current policy and change just a few points of emphasis, he said. Laar said the government planned to pay special attention to the tax reform and to putting the Tax Department to work. Laar criticized the Finance Ministry, which in his words had delayed reforms and in some cases ever "worked against them." He said the Economics Ministry under the new minister was expected to pay more attention to working out legislations. Laar said he was sure that the ministerial changes were not going to bring down the professionalism of the Cabinet. "The new ministers have gained experience in politics, which will enable them to come to better terms with the parliament," he said. The prime minister declined to comment on whether or not the other coalition partners -- the Moderates and the Estonian National Independence Party -- had plans to replace any of their ministers.
