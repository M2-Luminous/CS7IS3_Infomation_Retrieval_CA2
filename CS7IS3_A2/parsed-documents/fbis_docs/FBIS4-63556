This is still unknown, but one can definitely say that at least a vast majority. All of them are currently living through hard times. There are no contracts, no subassemblies; nobody knows what to do with products piled up in warehouses (of course, Belarus used to produce only a part of the end product). Enterprises manufacturing civilian goods are in no better shape. It is hard to get access to new markets, some technologies have become desperately obsolete and thus, the products are not competitive. There exists a well-known way to resolve the situation -- by means of structural reshaping and conversion. These are very complicated processes. At the headquarters of Belarusian producers -- the State Committee for Industries and Interbranch Ties -- much has been done and is still being done in this field. A program for the structural reshaping of Belarusian industries in the 1990's has been drafted, discussed, and passed by the Council of Ministers. According to Mikhail Prakharenka, department chief at the State Committee for Industries, the program has determined priority industries -- the building of metal-processing machines, electronic devices, instruments, computers and communication equipment, pharmacology, polymer, and construction materials. The priority nature of these branches will be supported by a package of advantages, direct investments from the state budget, and regulation of imports by means of tariffs. The aim of these measures is to fill the market, increase exports, and decrease imports by means of developing the branches capable of manufacturing goods that are currently imported. The committee is paying serious attention to conversion. Due to assistance rendered by committee experts in 1993, a number of enterprises undergoing conversion have definitely changed the proportion between military and civilian production. In most cases the ratio of 92 to 8 percent has been changed to that of 8 to 92 percent. There are fewer military contracts. However the state policy is also aimed at preserving the existing level of production of armaments and military hardware and enhancing exports of competitive products. It is also necessary to supply the Belarusian Armed Forces. The scientific and technological potential of defense enterprises is quite high. Sometimes it cannot be used at civilian enterprises because military technologies are several decades ahead of the current level. The primary goal of conversion is to preserve the accomplishments and reorient the existing scientific and technological potential toward manufacturing competitive civilian products. Defense enterprises are engaged in a majority of nationwide projects and scientific-technological endeavors. Many Minsk residents have abandoned hope of ever having telephones installed. The program drafted by committee experts will help speed up installation of telephones in Minsk homes. It envisions the use of high-tech equipment in the field of communication, namely radio telephones. This does not demand the laying of costly telephone cables. New automated telephone stations will also be cheaper than traditional ones. It is hard to enumerate all concrete programs drafted for various industries. All in all, there are 17 of them. The aim of these programs is well-defined -- to enhance the efficiency of production and reduce consumption of power and materials. The implementation of all the priority programs that involve more than thirty scientific staffs, has begun. There have been results, too. More than 2,000 sample products have been manufactured within the framework of these programs, including consumer goods never produced in Belarus. Instrument-builders are unquestionable leaders in this competition. Thus far, they have designed and launched production of 28 models of wood-processing equipment, a number of new machines for the production of bearings, universal knee-type milling machines and lathes, as well as high-precision thread milling machines. Machine builders can be proud of the new diesel engines, the new type of MAZ trucks, and truck-mounted cranes capable of lifting up to 20 tonnes. Radio electronic devices deserve to be mentioned separately. This industry is the basis for developing other branches because it determines the technological level and exports potential of industries producing home appliances, radio electronic and information systems, means of communication, medical equipment, and various means of transportation. A large number of radio electronic enterprises are concentrated in Minsk alone. Their modernization and realigning to novel technologies would entail huge costs. However it is clear that this is inevitable. The Belarusian computer market is flooded with equipment assembled in Asia which, very often, is of poor quality. Yet our personal computers are inferior even to these low-quality products. That is why our state enterprises and institutions bought almost $3 million worth of computers in 1993 alone. This money could have been paid to native producers provided they offered competitive equipment. The State Committee for Industries concentrates its efforts on these targets. What we can produce ourselves we should produce here, and not buy overseas. Otherwise our industries will not survive.
