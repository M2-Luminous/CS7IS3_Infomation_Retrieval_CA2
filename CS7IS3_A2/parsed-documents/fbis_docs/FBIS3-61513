RADIOEKOLOGIYA Language: Russian Article Type:CSO [Article by L. M. Lobanok, A. Ye. Kiriyenkov, and N. V. Gerasimovich, Institute of Radiobiology, Belarus Academy of Sciences, Minsk, under the rubric ``Investigation of the Sequelae of the Chernobyl Disaster''; UDC 574:538.1.04] [Abstract]Experiments were carried out on rats kept in the 10-km zone of the Chernobyl disaster (flood plain of the Pripyat River) for one month, exposed at dose rates of 20 mR/h. Radionuclides were assayed in the perfused isolated heart right after the exposure period and 6 months later, and findings were compared to control rats that were not exposed to radioactivity. Records were kept of heart rate, systolic, diastolic pressure, rate of rise and drop of pressure, and volumetric blood flow rate. The membrane filtration method, with [.sup]3[/] H-alprenol hydrochloride and propranolol antagonists, was used to test _b_-adrenoreceptors, with determination of specificity, binding sites and hormone affinity of the receptor. The experimental group of rats showed changes in amount, structural and functional properties of _b_-adrenoreceptors of the myocardium. Rate of contraction of the isolated heart and volumetric coronary flow diminished 6 months after exposure. It can be assumed that restoration of _b_-receptor density after 6 months and their affinity for agonists is related to impaired interaction of _b_-adrenoreceptors and N protein. The functional state of the heart did not change with 30-day exposure to the contaminated zone, but there was alteration of mechanisms of its adrenergic regulation.
