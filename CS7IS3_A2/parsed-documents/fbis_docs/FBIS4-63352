While in Wunsdorf, he is scheduled to visit the headquarters of Russia's Western Army Group in Germany, as well as to meet with officials of the Deutsche Bank to discuss the funding of Russian troop withdrawal from Germany, a spokesman for the Russian Defence Ministry told TASS. On Tuesday, the Russian defence minister will arrive in Brussels. Later in the day, he is to address the NATO leadership and defence ministers with a report on the basic principles of Russia's military doctrine. On Wednesday, Grachev is scheduled to have a series of bilateral meetings with NATO defence ministers, including with his U.S. counterpart William Perry. He will also attend a joint meeting of NATO defence ministers, which is to concentrate on European security and on prospects for NATO's political and military cooperation with Central and East European states, as well as with the CIS. At this meeting, the Russian defence minister is expected to expound on Russia's attitude towards NATO's Partnership for Peace programme. On the eve of his visit to Brussels, Grachev told reporters that Russia was interested in a more "serious and substantial format of relations with NATO than the one envisaged by the Partnership for Peace programme". "We will offer an alternative scheme of partnership, already approved by the Russian president. Its essence is that Russia should join the programme with due regard for its significant role and place in the system of European security and the United Nations", the Russian defence minister pointed out. Russia attaches much importance to Grachev's upcoming visit to Brussels. President Boris Yeltsin expects the NATO leadership to recognize the special status of Russia as a great power. This "can be done either through a protocol within the Partnership for Peace framework, or through a separate bilateral document between NATO and the Russian Federation", Yeltsin told TASS on Friday. From May 26, the Russian defence minister will start an official visit to Belgium. He is due to meet his Belgian counterpart Leo Delcroix and to visit some military installations. On May 27, Grachev will return to Moscow.
