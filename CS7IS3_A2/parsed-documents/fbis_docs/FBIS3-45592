In 1985 after it was named by the Central Military Commission as the "Heroic Hard-Boned Sixth Company," the company became the only company in PLA history to have received the highest honor for two times. Over the past several decades, this heroic company has continued to perform new meritorious services in safeguarding the motherland and socialist construction; its "hard-boned" spirit has taken root, blossomed, and borne fruits throughout the armed forces; and many Sixth Company-typed companies have come to the fore one after another. The CPC Central Committee and the Central Military Commission always speak highly of the Hard-Boned Sixth Company and its "hard- boned" spirit. Addressing an enlarged meeting of the military commission in 1977, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "As far as companies are concerned, they are doing the right thing to emulate the Hard-Boned Sixth Company because the company's work style should not be the work style of one company alone. All companies, and even cadres at all levels, should study hard and train hard like the Sixth Company, and should have the political awareness of the company." While inspecting the company in 1991, Comrade Jiang Zemin stressed that great efforts should be made to promote the "hard- boned" spirit, saying that "hard-boned" spirit means never bow before any adversity, but dare to fight and be brave to sacrifice to seize victories. The "hard-boned" spirit is a fine tradition and a precious spiritual wealth of our armed forces. During the war years, it was this spirit our troops counted on to fight strenuously, march forward courageously, and win one victory after another. After New China was founded, it was again this spirit our armed forces have counted on in building themselves into modern and regular armed forces as well as in taking an active part in socialist construction and accomplishing missions of combating emergencies, providing relief, and rescuing people in distress. Because of their great contributions to China's economic revitalization and economic take- off, they have become important forces in socialist modernization. The "hard-boned" spirit is also the Chinese nation's traditional spirit needed by people on all fronts of socialist modernization. Especially today when China has entered the stage of tackling key problems of reforming the economic system, deepening reform, opening up wider to the outside world, and gradually building a socialist market economic system, many new problems have to be resolved, and many hardships have to be surmounted. This requires our cadres and masses to emulate and foster the "hard-boned" spirit, defy all hardships, wage persistent and strenuous struggles, and move forward courageously until victory has been won. To emulate and foster the "hard-boned" spirit, we must strive to arm our minds with scientific theory. Only when we are armed with Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought can we have a firm and correct political bearing and a strong spiritual support. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics has inherited and developed Mao Zedong Thought. If we earnestly study the third volume of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" and have a firm grip of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, we will have a firm conviction and be able to uphold the party's basic line without wavering under all circumstances. To emulate and foster the "hard-boned" spirit, we must work hard to master the knowledge and abilities which modernization needs. Our modernization drive is an extraordinarily formidable and complex mission which cannot be accomplished with courage and zeal alone. It also requires real abilities and close integration of revolutionary spirit and scientific attitude. Comrades of all trades and professions must seize the time to study specialized knowledge and make constant efforts to improve their professionalism so that they can contribute their wisdom and talents to socialist modernization. To emulate and foster the "hard-boned" spirit, we must take the interests of the whole into account and fight in unity. The key reason why we have been able to win in revolution and construction lies in the fact that our party and our people are a united whole. No matter how mighty it may seem, our personal strength and the strength of a small group are tiny, and only when our strength converges and pools together can it become an indomitable force. During the course of reform, opening up, and modernization, we must submit our personal, partial, and local interests to collective interests and the interests of the whole so that our party and the people of the country can become more united, and so that our strength as a whole will be even stronger. The "hard-boned" spirit has strong characteristics of the time. While this spirit was needed in the past and is needed today, it will be needed in the future forever. In the future when our country's socialist modernization has developed with great vitality and when the people's living standards keep improving, the "hard- boned" spirit will continue to be the spiritual pillar supporting us to combat hardships and move forward, and it will continue to shine and go down from one generation to another when we are accomplishing our great cause.
