Last year alone, 3,000 murders were committed and almost 9,000 attacks made with the use of fire arms. Ogorodnikov announced that this tendency persisted in 1994. Given this, the Interior Ministry has drafted proposals on amending and enlarging the laws on the circulation of weapons, and proposed measures to toughen punishment for crimes involving fire arms. According to the ministry, fire arms get into the criminals' hands as a result of improper control during the withdrawal of troops from the former Soviet republics and foreign countries. Over the past three years, more than 38,000 fire arms have been stolen. To quote Ogorodnikov, the openness of the Russian borders and instability in North Ossetia, Ingushetia and Chechnya also facilitate the inflow of fire arms to the central part of Russia.
