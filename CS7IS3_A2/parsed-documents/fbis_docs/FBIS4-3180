Describing the situation as "grim and uncertain" in Gorazde, a "safe area" for Bosnian Muslims that was on the verge of falling into Serb control, Clinton said chances for lifting the embargo appeared greater for the time being. The Europeans and Russia in the past have opposed ending the embargo but now "their soldiers on the ground are in danger," Clinton said. He disputed suggestions by some congressional leaders that the U.S. unilaterally lift the embargo, which was seen as denying the Muslims the chances of defending themselves while failing to stop the arms flow to the Serbs and Croats. "First of all, there are substantial questions about whether under international law we can do it," he said.
