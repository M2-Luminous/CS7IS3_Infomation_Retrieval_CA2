The sources told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the Islamic Action Front [IAF] party, the Pan-Arab Action Front [PAAF] party, and the Jordanian Arab Socialist Ba'th Party [ASBP] handed the invitation to Iraqi Ambassador to Jordan Nuri al-Wayyis. The sources confirm that a meeting was held at the Iraqi Embassy in Amman last week between the Iraqi ambassador and representatives of the three parties. The Iraqi ambassador expressed during the meeting his wish that the parties' representatives make a gesture and invite the Iraqi BPRC to visit Jordan. In the light of that, the Iraqi Ba'th Party is expected to accept the invitation. The three parties express clear sympathy with Iraq's political stances. The Iraqi Embassy has been eager to develop cooperation between these parties and the leadership of the Ba'th Party in Iraq. The IAF party and the PAAF party announced in the past the establishment of a joint coordination command between them, and they now take unified political and party positions on all issues raised. The Jordanian ASBP joined them later.
