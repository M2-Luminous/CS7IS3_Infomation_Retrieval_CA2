He was a soldier near the Namibian border from April 1988 to April 1989 when Cuban forces went home at the implementation of UN Resolution 435 that ushered in Namibian independence. Mr Robaina denied reports from Zambia that claimed he said Cuba would again send troops to Angola in the event of foreign intervention on the side of the UNITA rebels, saying Havana had too many domestic difficulties to even consider it. He said the overnight disappearance of Cuba's traditional economic relations with the Soviet Union and East Bloc countries had left his Caribbean island in serious economic difficulty. Speaking in Windhoek at the tail end of a six-nation African tour, he cited ongoing "irrational persecution" and a trade blockade by the United States as a key factor in Cuba's strained financial status. There was no sign of any flexibility from the Clinton administration, he said, adding that Cuba was having to undergo a policy transformation in order to survive in a changed world. U.S. pressure was creating problems for eight in every ten international firms which tried to establish themselves in Cuba, Mr Robaina said. He said he was confident about a succesful conclusion to the Angolan peace talks dragging on in Lusaka, and hoped for a "happy ending" to the Angolan conflict. During his visit to Namibia, Mr Robaina concluded a visa exemption agreement and a trade pact which he said would further consolidate relations between the two countries. Cuba is expected to participate in Windhoek's international trade fair in April, and has invited Namibia to reciprocate in Havana in November. Introducing the Cuban on Friday, Namibian Foreign Affairs Minister Netumbo Ndaitwah said relations between Namibians and Cubans were "sealed in blood".
