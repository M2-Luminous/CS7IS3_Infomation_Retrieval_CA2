"I'd rather talk about it tomorrow, after we have discussed the issue also in the government," Laar said. Tonight's Cabinet meeting is not connected with the dismissal of Indrek Kannik from the office of the defense minister, the premier said. "This meeting was called already before the Pro Patria started to adopt its decisions," Laar said. But he also mentioned that the situation had become "intolerable." "Now the Pro Patria faction has made its decisions," Laar said. Answering a question if it was possible that Pro Patria might split if Kannik and some of his allies were defeated in the current power struggle, Laar said he considers such development of the affairs a very regrettable prospect. "One of the main objectives of my activity in the last half year has been to avoid such conflicts," the prime minister said. He added that although he had tried avoid a conflict, "each thing has its limits and now these limits have been reached." The prime minister declined to say whether he had plans to make other changes in the Cabinet apart from Kannik's dismissal. Laar said he had not delivered to the president a formal proposal to dismiss Kannik. He said he is going to formally seek the president's approval for the replacement after the Cabinet has approved the decision made by the Pro Patria faction.
