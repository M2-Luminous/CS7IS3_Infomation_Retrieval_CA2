According to Prime Minister Pawlak the results of the economic transformations in Poland are appreciated by international financial organizations such as the World Bank, the IMF and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. [Begin Pawlak recording] In 1994 we expect that Polish gross domestic product to grow by about 4.5 percent, exports to increase by 6 percent and investment by 6 percent. We envisage that the annual rate of inflation in this period will decrease, falling to about 25 percent. The government is continuing the process of reforms, the foundation of which is formed by a market economy and the principle of free economic management, as well as by the demonopolization of foreign economic relations. The government will also continue the processes of ownership transformations, although here we want to use the criterion of efficiency as the primary criterion. We are interested in creating conditions for a free flow of goods, services, capital and people. At the same time we need a greater openness of foreign markets to our goods, as well as increased interest of foreign entrepreneurs in investment projects in Poland. [end recording]
