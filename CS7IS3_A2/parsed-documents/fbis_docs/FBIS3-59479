He has made his place in Macedonian history as the statesman who finally accomplished what Goce Delcev [Macedonian politician in 19th century, founder of the terrorist Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization that fought against Ottoman authority, and for Macedonian autonomy within a Balkan confederation] had dreamt of. Everybody will tell you so, the Macedonian intellectuals, classic and alternative, as well as the opposition leaders, and the so-called ordinary citizens. "May our state live as long as possible," is what everybody says, a peasant women from a village in Galicani, as well as a clerk from Skopje. President Gligorov is not only in the pink of health, but he is also the statesman of the country in which one shoots only on the New Year's eve and when hunting ducks om Lake Ohrid. Gligorov acknowledges that NIN is an old friend of his. Having heard that I am going to interview Gligorov, economist Dr. Ljubomir Madzar tells me in NIN's editorial office: "If there is any wise politician in the Balkans, then it is Kiro Gligorov." [Jovanovic] I listened to your New Year expose in parliament, when you made a concise assessment of everything that happened in the last three years, particularly in 1993. Did you forget to say something in that general address to the Macedonian Parliament and public? [Gligorov] I certainly missed many things, keeping in mind that the expose must not be too long, but rather sufficient to comprise some of the most important things that had happened. Still, I certainly did omit some things: First of all, I spoke little about the events taking place north of Macedonia, about the war that is still going on, and the peace prospects. I deliberately skipped that topic in my expose, because, right now, it is really difficult to say anything in that respect. In certain moments it seems to me that so much blood has already been shed, that the economic position is so bad, so that the logical conclusion should be the imminent end of the war. However, one has to take into consideration the fact that, unfortunately, a readiness for further conflicts and the prolongation of the war also exists. I am not sure that, after everything that has happened in Sarajevo recently, the war might not perhaps accelerate. That is what I am afraid of. Any war has its end, but it is sad when one sees what is happening day after day, how many victims the war has already claimed, all the devastation, and so forth. As though everybody is certain that the war will end only when virtually everything that was built over decades is in ruins. That is something that cannot but be our concern as well. Not only because the war, as long as it lasts, can always spread to the surrounding regions and states. We in Macedonia cannot be at ease, because some of our perspects for a stronger, more rapid development cannot be expected while the war is still raging in former Yugoslavia. We are all captives of that situation. We are all hampered in a way, in the situation of closed borders, barriers, hate, and so forth. I did not state it in my expose, but I think it is important that, among the Macedonian people, no hate toward the neighbors, or toward all other peoples with whom we lived, or are still living -- in the Balkans -- has been created. I think that is very important. Perhaps, we shall further suffer the consequences of the sanctions, closed borders, and so forth, yet, one day when everything comes to an end, we shall be able to communicate with all the peoples around us without a twinge of conscience that we hated them, or caused some conflicts. I think that nobody will be able to say that our behavior was a contribution to the war becoming even more severe. I think that is very important. And if there is anything I am satisfied about, it is exactly that: The Macedonian people has been looking at the conflict around us with a feeling of sorrow that something like that is happening, and that we are incapable of doing anything to make the war stop, or at least to prevent its continuation. On our part there has been no malice, nor has there been any sort of warmongering, but there has rather been the dominant desire not to spoil the relations we developed over decades while we were living together. Also, we have never shown a trace of malice toward the neighbor-countries with which we have never lived in a union, but with which, right now, in these circumstances, we are communicating much better in terms of economy, culture, and such things, because we are facing a time that demands open borders. Tomorrow, when all this comes to an end, we shall be able to offer a hand to each party with all our hearts, and to take part in the collective efforts to stop the Balkans being a blind alley of Europe, to make Europe stop treating it as a destructive virus, like something that constantly causes new problems. I think I probably did not say enough in my expose, that the further destiny of the Balkans will depend, above all, on whether democracy will definitely win in each of the Balkan countries, whether the conditions will be created for a development that would rest upon democratic institutions. I do not have any illusions about it, I do not think that it will happen tomorrow, or that such a process may be accomplished overnight. [Jovanovic] What is your estimate of when such a process will be finished -- in two, three, five years? [Gligorov] Well, I think that two election periods are inevitable, yet it is difficult to say how long it will take for each of the Balkan countries to accomplish that. Because, the conditions are different from country to country, but unfortunately, the longer the war is, the worse effects it will have on those democratic processes. Still, I believe that if democracy wins in each of the Balkan countries after the war, it will also mean the victory of the orientation toward the market economy, which is supposed to have its own social characteristics, and, on the other hand, also the ecological characteristics, which are very important for the future. [Jovanovic] I am quite pleased with your being the first to mention the importance of ecology.... [Gligorov] If they were to find a place for those elements in the economy, I think that would be a more painless way for the Balkans to prepare itself to enter Europe. In that respect, one needs time, one needs certain phases in the development of the political and economic systems. All other elements are quite favorable for the Balkans, which has many things to offer in terms of culture and the level of civilization, and to contribute to the enrichment of the European cultural scene. In addition, one must create a political atmosphere in which all conflicts and disputes will be settled by political means, in democratic ways, because conflicts are still an inevitable thing. One cannot suddenly come into a conflict-free state from such a conflict-ridden situation, where a war is in full swing. Conflicts will continue, but what makes the difference is the means that will be implemented for the settlement of those conflicts. [Jovanovic] Since you again mention the war and conflicts, and your fear of the deterioration of the war in Bosnia, how do you comment on the famous CIA report, that was denied in the meantime? According to the report, Slobodan Milosevic is the only leader in Serbia who is worth talking to. The report states the possibility of the war spreading to Kosovo. True, Macedonia is not mentioned, but it says "even further to south." [Gligorov] I do not believe in the authenticity of that report. It has already been denied two or three times in different ways. By itself that report is of no interest to me, but what I am suspicious about is the rationale of that report. If we view the United States as the only global strategic force, then America can only have an interest in the prevention of the further spread of conflicts in the Balkans. The spread of the war that is now going on to the north of Macedonia, sooner or later, means the involvement of two NATO member countries, that is Greece and Turkey. If the war were to spread to Kosovo and Macedonia, then it would be a scenario remembered from the not-so-distant history: The Balkan Wars. I do not see any interest of the United States in such a war, because it would shake NATO quite badly, and cause much deeper repercussions in Europe, in contrast with the current war, which shakes not only Europe but the whole world, but which, however, has its own limitations. It is still a war in one enclave, it cannot generate European consequences in the sense of its spreading out of the Balkans. However, a war in which Greece, Bulgaria, Serbia, Albania, and later Turkey were to take part, would have much more far-reaching consequences, and that is the sense in which the presence of the U.S. troops here, in Macedonia, is interpreted, as well as support for the prevention of the spreading of the war. [Jovanovic] The following question must be boring for you, still, when we talk about the Americans, on one hand we have their military presence in Macedonia, which is at this moment quite productive, regardless of which angle we view things from, that is, from which neighboring country's point of view. On the other hand, the United States has not yet recognized the Republic of Macedonia. What do you think the United States is waiting for? Is it only the pressure exerted by the powerful Greek lobby, or is something else the matter? [Gligorov] In that respect, the position of the United States is quite complex, or better to say delicate. Because Greece is a NATO member-country, and a U.S. ally. On the other hand, it is obvious from its behavior, that the United States is aware of the fact that Macedonia is the factor of stability in the south of the Balkans, which is evidenced by Macedonia's behavior in general, the way in which it became independent, how it arranges interethnic relations, what its attitude toward the neighbors is like, what its attitude toward the European policy is like, and so forth. For that reason, the United States helped us in certain situations, they sponsored our admittance to the United Nations. So, one can say that the United States is in a very delicate position, and it is probably relying on time to solve certain things. I do not think there is any other reason, any other combination that is behind the United States' reluctance to recognize Macedonia. [Jovanovic] Nevertheless, that is something that not only the Serbian regime, but also the Serbian opposition, are manipulating with. It is claimed the United States wants to rule from Macedonia. [Gligorov] Why would the United States rule from Macedonia, and what for? If that was the case, a much greater number of U.S. troops would be stationed here, rather than a symbolic number of troops. And their number is symbolic only to add political weight to their presence. [Jovanovic] Is the initiative for Macedonia's admittance into NATO, which has already been endorsed in parliament, precisely on the same path -- that the Republic of Macedonia should provide itself with political integrity on one hand, while on the other hand with sovereignty? [Gligorov] Security is built, above all, through membership in the United Nations.... Each UN member-country is provided with some general security, because its membership gives it the possibility to count on the protection of the United Nations. Second, security is also built through membership in the CSCE. We have not yet managed to become a member of the CSCE, because Greece opposes that, but Macedonia has been admitted as an observer. Third, in terms of security, the two opposing alliances, that is the Warsaw Pact, and NATO, no longer exist. So today, after the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, the only collective factor of security is NATO. And seen politically, our orientation is the European option, that we, in 12, or 15 years, gradually, by phases, enter the European Union. I believe it will be the orientation of all Balkan countries. On the other hand, the European Union and NATO are quite compatible institutions, although they are separate, and have distinct tasks. Now, our parliament's decision does not mean that Macedonia will become a NATO member-country tomorrow. It is more an expression of our determination, a declaration. We know that, regardless of our aspirations, we cannot be instantly admitted into NATO. [Jovanovic] At this moment, the reasons for Greece opposing the recognition of Macedonia are generally known. However, much more interesting and unclear are the reasons why Serbia, that is the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia], has not recognized Macedonia yet. Would you, please, comment on the latest provocative statements by Mihajlo Markovic from the Socialist Party of Serbia, saying that "Serbia knows how to make Macedonia join Serbia, that is Yugoslavia?" [Gligorov] I would not comment on any of those statements. I would rather express a feeling: Objectively seen, Serbia and the FRY have absolutely no reasons not to recognize Macedonia, and vice versa, Macedonia has no reasons not to recognize the FRY, and there are no reasons for those acts not to be done simultaneously. The FRY did that in the case of Slovenia, but the other side showed no readiness to do the same. It is not my job to assess what the FRY's interests are.... Considering the situation not only as a statesman, but also as a man, I think that the recognition of Macedonia by the FRY at this moment, and the recognition of the FRY by Macedonia, would be quite helpful, first of all to the FRY. That would definitely show that the charges accusing Serbia of preparing to spread the war to the south, or to ignite a war in Kosovo, are not correct. The credibility of the peace option that is supported by Milosevic now, who is stating everywhere that Serbia wants peace, and that it will do anything for peace, would increase considerably. The recognition of the Republic of Macedonia would be a right move that would strongly boost the credibility of Yugoslavia. [Jovanovic] And, why do you think Milosevic is not making such a move? [Gligorov] Probably because of the relations with Greece. Second, the current period of political life in Serbia makes it clear to us that there are forces in Serbia that are against the recognition of Macedonia. [Jovanovic] Who do you think has a firmer attitude toward Macedonia: the opposition or Milosevic? [Gligorov] It is hard to say now, in the time following the elections. Many things were said in extreme excitement.... We have slid back into history too much, we are giving too much significance to what happened in the Balkan wars, going as far back as to the battle of Kosovo [14th century]. Naturally, in such an atmosphere, ghosts that we thought had vanished are reviving. For all time, in 45 years of shared life, I had the impression that the great majority of Serbs, holding almost inconsiderably different views, accepted and experienced that we, the Macedonians, are a different people, and that they accepted Macedonia as a republic, as a state according to the Constitution of former Yugoslavia. Now, some ghosts of the past are reviving.... [Jovanovic] Not only that, but also some ideas about the Balkan Orthodox confederation, and the Pan-Slav empire.... [Gligorov] I am expressing in advance my doubts in all the alliances that are founded on religious or ethnic bases. Such alliances existed in the last two or three centuries, and we know how they ended up! The foundation of an alliance on an ethnic or religious basis will bring about a new division of Europe, and a new division of the Balkans, and, in such circumstances, the Balkans will suffer most. And therefore I think that, basically, one should support the general course of Yeltsin toward the Europeanization of Russia, aiming at Russia's becoming a part of the European family. Europe will continue to live as a Europe comprising many nations, and many different religions. [Jovanovic] You mean the Europe according to the formula of Goce Delcev? [Gligorov] Yes. He said, such a long time ago, that he saw and understood the world as a community of different peoples that were competing with one another on the cultural plane. [Jovanovic] That is actually the project of the European Union.... [Gligorov] That is right. The project is about the creation of a common civilization in which no country will lose its individuality, its identity, and every each of them will contribute to the common cultural treasure. The Balkans has many things to say in that respect. [Jovanovic] Let us go back to the relations with Serbia: Are there indications that something is changing in those relations? Was there any half-secret, or secret meeting between you and Milosevic? [Gligorov] No, after the meeting in Ohrid we have not met. [Jovanovic] Are there indications, or initiatives for a new meeting? [Gligorov] No. Neither secret, nor public initiatives. [Jovanovic] It is claimed that one of the reasons for a firm Serbian attitude toward Macedonia is an unfavorable status of Serbs in Macedonia. I see that the Macedonian Parliament has adopted a document, the so-called "Memorandum of Understanding." What is the essence of that document? [Gligorov] That is a good document. In fact, it conveys and accepts everything that, in European documents, refers to the rights of different nationalities, national minorities, and so forth. As for the real situation, look, you are staying here, and you see that, in our society, no nationality, including the Serbian, has been treated badly. On the contrary. Look at the TV news, theater, film, you can see everywhere people with Serbian family names. In Macedonia that is a normal thing. Even when the Yugoslav People's Army [YNA] left Macedonia, we held on to that principle. And that principle says that everybody who wants to stay here, can stay. I would be satisfied if such a document, regarding the rights of Macedonians in Serbia, was adopted in Serbia. [Jovanovic] Let us move to the Macedonian program of economic stabilization.... [Gligorov] Our program of stabilization is something neither new, nor unknown, nor original. First of all, if one accepts the market economy, then several things are to be observed. Firstly, property. Secondly, the market. Thirdly, opening up to foreign countries. The market must not be introverted. Money must not be issued without any control, and not to mention the use of that money to cover the budget, or investments. [Jovanovic] Which is in some countries the strategic policy.... [Gligorov] Some things are known, and they just need to be implemented. In such circumstances, the restrictive program like ours carries a great risk in itself. That must be said. However, any postponement in the name of our more easily accomplishing the goal later is a delusion. We know that from the experience of former Yugoslavia -- the reform would have been most easily accomplished in 1965. So, one ought to start radical changes as soon as possible, given the support of the international financial institutions: the IMF, the World Bank, the London Bank for Cooperation with Eastern Countries, the European Community. Without it, the task would be extremely difficult, and it would go beyond the limit of social endurance, and one has to take into account that limit as well. [Jovanovic] You have mentioned the danger of the transfer of the so-called filthy technologies. [Gligorov] The transfer of filthy technologies reflects the attempts of many countries, which is happening right now, to more easily surmount the problems of development, and that is the line of least resistance. For the time being, we can hardly expect that foreign capital will suddenly start flowing into Macedonia, and that, regardless of the aid for development, it will be flowing in through the pipes of the international financial institutions, the World Bank, the World Financial Corporation, the Agency for Development, and other banks. No project will be accepted without our consent. For that reason, the country should be organized in such a way that the people must not forget the ecological factor. Given that awareness, nobody would be able to sell us some filthy technologies. All institutions that are engaged in ecology, above all the movement for ecology, should organize themselves, and get involved in choosing and approving the projects, so that the destiny of some underdeveloped countries that lacked experience and caution does not necessarily have to fall upon Macedonia. [Jovanovic] At the end. What was the hardest time for you in these three years, and what were the happiest moments, when you felt most satisfied? [Gligorov] There were two hardest moments. First of all, the moment when the YNA was supposed to leave Macedonia -- the uncertainty whether we would accomplish an honest agreement, which would be a good capital for the future, or whether it would come to a conflict. At the time, the danger existed that, in such an atmosphere, a wrong move could be made, either on the part of the YNA, or on somebody else's part, for instance, somebody could have tried to surround a garrison, or to provoke some army units. That was a very tense atmosphere, particularly when the first metal coffins started arriving from the north, being the aftermath of the initial skirmishes and clashes. Somehow it happened that those first victims were Macedonians. In a very short time, 43 soldiers were killed. We had to use all means to prevent getting involved in the war. The second moment was the Lisbon declaration, when it looked as if our fate had been sealed by the decision of the group of 12 in Lisbon: The European Community would recognize Macedonia as a state only if it were to eliminate the word "Macedonia" from its name.... That could have also generated some unpleasant and dangerous events, which could have spread as well, eventually. That was also a dramatic moment that lasted about six months. In that period, we were politically and diplomatically isolated, we were not able to explain our political position. However, everything was settled at the meeting in Edinburgh six months later, in December 1992. [Jovanovic] And when did you feel most satisfied? [Gligorov] Well, that is certainly the long-awaited moment of Macedonia's admittance into the United Nations. That was a tough process, although everybody knew we met all the conditions, which was also unambiguously confirmed by the Badenter arbitrating commission, underlining certain qualities that ranked us first, ahead of Slovenia. And despite everything, we were supposed to wait until April 1993, while, let me remind you, Badenter's report had been submitted on 15 January 1991. The admittance to the United Nations is an event that not only pleased me most, but also relieved me in a way.
