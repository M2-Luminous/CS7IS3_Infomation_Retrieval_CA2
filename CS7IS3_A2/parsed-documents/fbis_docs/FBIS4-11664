The Moroccan delegation to the meeting, which will be held in the Iranian capital in the next few days, will include Qarawiyah [Academy] ulema and advisers from the Awqaf and Islamic Affairs Ministry with the supervision of senior Royal Court officials. Most prominent among the Moroccan participants will be Cheikh Mohamed Lazrak, Ahmed El Ghazi El Houseyni, and Abdelkarim El Daoudi. The meetings of the Joint Committee will be attended on the Iranian side by ulema and experts from the Assembly for Inter-Islamic Understanding and the Sunni Affairs Committee at the Office of the Iranian President. Most prominent among the Iranian figures who will participate in the meetings will be Hojjat ol-Eslam V'eizzadeh-Khorasani, secretary general of the Assembly for Inter-Islamic Understanding, and Ishaq Medani, presidential adviser on Sunni affairs. The conferees in Tehran will discuss the possibility of crystallizing basic features for dialogue between the ulema of the two sects and of arriving at general theological common grounds of jurisprudence that would form the basis of a program for the work of the committee, which was born last year in Rabat after lengthy meetings held at the Moroccan Academy. Theological sources who will participate in the meetings say that the dialogue between the Moroccan and Iranian ulema will concentrate on trying to crystallize the points of agreement between the Shiite and Sunni sects which had already been underscored at the Rabat meetings, especially the principles of Islamic unity and solidarity, tolerance, dialogue, goodwill, and rejection of violence, coercion, and arrogance. These principles are expected to form the basis of a practical and elaborate program for cooperation between the Sunni and Shiite theological and jurisprudence institutions, and it is not unlikely that rejection of violence and intransigence will be one of its main features. That is the issue considered to be at the core of the disagreement between the religious and political authorities in Iran. The new round of Sunni-Shiite dialogue constitutes another endeavor to enhance the call for inter-Islamic understanding and for dialogue between the Sunnis and the Shiites originally made by King Hassan II at the start of the new hegira century about 10 years ago. He made that call in his message to Muslims on the occasion of the new century and he reaffirmed that call in the summer of 1990. The past two years witnessed the beginning of the dialogue process between Moroccan and Iranian ulema. Last month Morocco welcomed a delegation of Lebanese Shiite ulema who attended the Ramadan lectures which are usually delivered in the presence of the Moroccan king.
