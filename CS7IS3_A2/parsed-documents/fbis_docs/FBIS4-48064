The United Nations' plane that had to make a U-turn yesterday finally managed to land early this afternoon at the airport in the Rwandan capital. RFI's special correspondent, Jean Helene, was on board: [Helene] Heavy weapon fighting, which had been going on since dawn, stopped early this afternoon, shortly before the arrival of the Hercules C-130. The UNAMIR [United Nations Mission in Rwanda] said that it had asked the belligerents for a special truce in order to be able to evacuate the body of the Ghanaian peace-keeper killed on Monday [9 May] night. He was hit by shrapnel from a shell that fell on the Amahoro stadium, where nearly 3,000 refugees are being guarded by Ghanaian soldiers. The UN plane remained on the ground for 20 minutes while UN troops were paying homage to their comrade. Exchanges of artillery fire resumed at dusk, albeit less heavily, in the suburbs of the capital. According to the news that we have, the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] troops have not made any significant progress in Kigali for the last 48 hours despite extremely violent fighting, including near the Kanombe camp, where some 4,000 para-commandos are stationed. According to some observers, the strategy of the RPF is to bomb the camp for several days running before launching a ground attack. More to the south, the RPF has gained ground and it can now either move up to Kigali or go on eastward toward Gitarama, the headquarters of the transitional government. It will certainly run into the government forces deployed in the area in order to stop its advance. [passage omitted]
