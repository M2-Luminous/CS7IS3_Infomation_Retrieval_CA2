The GOA-wide ``other species'' TAC is calculated as 15,535 mt, which is 5 percent of the sum of combined TACs for the target species. 7. Proposed Halibut PSC Mortality Limits Under ยง672.20(f), annual Pacific halibut PSC mortality limits are established for trawl and hook-and-line gear and may be established for pot gear. At its September 1994 meeting, the Council recommended that, for 1995, NMFS re-establish 1994 PSC limits of 2,000 mt and 750 mt for the trawl and hook-and-line gear fisheries, respectively, with 10 mt of the hook-and-line limit allocated to the DSR fishery in the Southeast Outside District and the remainder to other hook-and-line gear fisheries. As in 1994, the Council proposes to exempt pot gear from halibut limits for 1994. At its September 1994 meeting, the Council also recommended that NMFS initiate rulemaking that would authorize exemption of the hook-and-line sablefish fishery from the halibut PSC limit. The Council recommended this because of the 1995 implementation of the sablefish and halibut Individual Fishing Quota (IFQ) program, which would allow legal-sized halibut to be retained in the sablefish fishery. NMFS is preparing a proposed rule to implement the Council's recommendation. The proposed rule would also specify a reduced halibut PSC limit for the 1995 GOA hook-and-line gear fisheries other than sablefish. The Council recommended that the trawl fishery apportionment of the 1995 halibut bycatch mortality limit (2,000 mt) remain unchanged from 1994. In 1994, NMFS approved a rule that authorizes separate apportionments of the trawl halibut bycatch mortality limit between trawl fisheries for deep-water and shallow-water species (59 FR 38132, July 27, 1994). These apportionments are divided seasonally to avoid seasonally high halibut bycatch rates. NMFS preliminarily concurs in the Council's 1995 recommendations. Some changes may be made in the seasonal, gear type and fishing-complex apportionments of halibut PSC limits for the final 1995 specifications. NMFS considers the following types of information as presented by, and summarized from, the preliminary 1994 SAFE Report, or from public comment and testimony. (A) Estimated Halibut Bycatch in Prior Years The best available information on estimated halibut bycatch is available from data collected in 1994 by NMFS-certified observers. The calculated halibut bycatch mortality by trawl, hook-and-line, and pot gear through November 11, 1994, is 2,221 mt, 752 mt, and 4 mt, respectively, for a total of 2,977 mt. Halibut bycatch restrictions seasonally constrained trawl gear fisheries during the first, second, third and fourth quarters of the fishing year. Trawling, with the exception of trawling for pollock with pelagic trawl gear, was closed in 1994 from March 21 to March 31 for the shallow-water species complex (59 FR 13894, March 24, 1994); from April 22 to June 30 for the deep-water species complex (59 FR 21946, April 28, 1994); from May 19 to June 30 for the shallow-water species complex (59 FR 26761, May 24, 1994); from August 15 to September 30 for the shallow-water complex (59 FR 42776, August 19, 1994); and from August 29 to September 30 for the deep-water complex (59 FR 45239, September 1, 1994), as a result of halibut PSC seasonal allowances. The fourth quarter halibut PSC allowance was reached on October 29 (59 FR 55066, November 3, 1994). Hook-and-line gear was closed to directed fishing for all but DSR on May 28 to December 31, 1994 (59 FR 17737, April 14, 1994; 59 FR 43296, August 23, 1993). The sablefish hook-and-line gear fishery was reopened for a 48-hour period in September, 1994, concurrent with the Pacific halibut fishery (59 FR 44944, August 31, 1994). The amount of groundfish that trawl or hook-and-line gear might have harvested, if halibut PSC had not been seasonally limiting in 1994, is unknown. However, lacking market incentives, some amounts of groundfish will not be harvested, regardless of halibut PSC bycatch availability. (B) Expected Changes in Groundfish Stocks At its September 1994 meeting, the Council recommended lower 1995 ABCs than 1994 ABCs for pollock, deep-water flatfish, rex sole, flathead sole, arrowtooth flounder, other rockfish, northern rockfish, pelagic shelf rockfish, shortraker/rougheye, and Atka mackerel. Higher 1995 ABCs, as compared to the 1994 ABCs, were recommended for Pacific cod, shallow-water flatfish, POP, and thornyhead rockfish. The 1995 ABCs for DSR and sablefish are unchanged from 1994 levels. More information on these proposed changes is included in the preliminary SAFE Report, dated September 1994, and in the AP, SSC, and Council minutes from the September 1994 meeting. (C) Expected Changes in Groundfish Catch The total of the proposed 1995 specified TACs for the GOA is 326,242 mt, which represents 107 percent of the sum of TACs for 1994 (304,589 mt). Significant changes in TACs for pollock, Pacific cod, POP, other rockfish, shallow-water rockfish, and arrowtooth flounder are proposed. Increased TACs for some groups could result in increased halibut mortality associated with those fisheries. The changes in pollock TACs are not expected to affect halibut bycatches, because most of the pollock harvest in the GOA is accomplished with pelagic trawls that experience low bycatch rates of halibut. (D) Current Estimates of Halibut Biomass and Stock Condition The stock assessment for 1993 conducted by the International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) indicates that the total exploitable biomass of Pacific halibut in the BSAI management area and the GOA together was 300.4 million lb (136,236 mt) using the standard assessment methods and 249.8 million lb (113,288 mt) when discounting the effects of an upturn in catch per unit effort for 1992 and 1993. This represents a decline in biomass of 12&hyph;15 percent from the previous stock assessment, a rate that is higher than the 5&hyph;10 percent annual decline observed in previous years. Exploitable biomass was estimated at 219.6 million lb (99,592 mt) for the GOA areas, a decrease of 13 percent with respect to the 1992 biomass. Recruitment was the lowest in 20 years, but was consistent with cyclical patterns of recruitment that have occurred over the last 50 years. The low recruitment exhibited in recent years can be expected to contribute to a continued decline in the overall stock at a rate of 10&hyph;15 percent over the next several years. Some changes may be made to the IPHC Report in November.
