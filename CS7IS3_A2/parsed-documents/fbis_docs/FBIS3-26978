Speaking at the "Poeitika" television station, Krajisnik said, "We are committed to fully respect the Muslim-Serb agreement and its provisions calling for the control of heavy weaponry and demarcation lines." "This concerns the basic interests of the Serbian people, and we cannot in any way raise any problem to the agreement," he said. He warned that the danger of Serbian people being bombed "has never been greater than now." "We are very serious about the threat. We must be fully prepared for air strikes," he said. He expressed the hope that by submitting the heavy weapons, "The will of the forces calling for the bombing of Serbian positions will be partially satisfied." Meanwhile, former commander of the United Nations Protection Force (Unprofor) General Jean Cote said the Serbian side has promised to withdraw their heavy weapons from around Sarajevo before the NATO deadline of midnight GMT Sunday, or put them under UN control. He said the Muslim side has promised to do the same. United Nations commander Lieutenant General Michael Rose today warned that if the warring sides do not submit their weaponry before the NATO deadline, the Western alliance will definitely use force. NATO also said today that it will not wait one minute more in executing the air strike plan after the deadline is reached. Bosnian Serb Defense Minister Dushan Kovachevich said today that if NATO really carries out air strikes on Serbian positions, the Serbians will defend themselves by all means necessary. He expressed the hope that a "wise party" will be heeded within NATO. Reports said convoys of artillery could be seen moving along the highways outside Sarajevo toward destinations selected by the UN command. Spokesman Bill Eikman said today that the UN is deploying forces in preparation for air strikes, and that 3,000 more UN troops are expected to arrive in Sarajevo soon. However, Spain and France have reportedly refused to increase the number of their troops, and Russia has refused to allow its UN soldiers to move close to Sarajevo.
