The Japanese reactionaries and other U.S.-toeing forces, too, are joining them by clamoring for "international cooperation system". The South Korean puppet clique broke down talks with the North and are leaving no stone unturned, as a shock-force, to stifle the fellow countrymen with the backing of outside forces. At a time like this, the United States, Japan and South Korea are trying to stage a large-scale joint war gamble. It is only too clear what they seek through the gamble. It proves that the U.S., Japan and South Korean reactionaries are intending to contain the DPRK militarily through their conspiracy and tieup under the cloak of "international cooperation system" and, to this end, they are substantiating their criminal triangular military alliance. The United States and its followers are trying to destroy the DPRK, the bulwark of socialism, by driving the situation on the Korean peninsula into extremes militarily, but it is a foolish idea. Should the United States and its followers persist in straining the situation on the Korean peninsula by staging "Rimpac" joint war exercises, they would be held wholly responsible for grave consequences arising therefrom.
