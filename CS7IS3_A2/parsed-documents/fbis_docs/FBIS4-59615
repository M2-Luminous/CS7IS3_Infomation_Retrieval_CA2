It described them as "characterized by objectiveness and maturity." It vehemently criticized France, advising it to be "neutral." A senior FIS official told AL-HAYAH that France knows that the FIS is "an Algerian party which won the elections twice (municipal and legislative)." He expressed his surprise at French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe's statement describing the FIS as "a terrorist organization" hostile to Europe and the West. The official said: "We consider this statement unjustifiable interference in Algerian affairs and blatant bias toward the current regime in Algeria." He went on: "Let France know that the change in Algeria is taking place on Algerian territory and through the will of the people. France might through its conspiracies manage to limit the speed of the change, but it is impossible to stop the change. Thus we say once again that it is better for France to be neutral if it cannot side with the people." [passage omitted] Commenting on the U.S. position, the FIS official said that the Clinton administration's position "has recently been characterized by objectiveness and maturity." He went on: "In its dealings with the outside world, the FIS takes account of every state's position on its conflict" with the Algerian regime. This is why "we are interested in knowing at the time of crisis who supports the people's freedom and who wants them to live under suppression." Asked about the marches staged a week ago in support of the dialogue in Algeria, and whether the FIS took part in them, he said: "The FIS cannot ask people to take to the street" in support of the marches while the "operations of repression continue to be launched against FIS supporters or those thought to belong to it." [passage omitted] On the development of the dialogue between the authorities and the FIS, the official said that, "if a negotiated solution is wanted to move a step forward, (President Major General Liamine) Zeroual must keep his pledge and thus release the cheikhs (FIS leaders). Negotiations must be held with them, and no one else."
