What he has brought is also unknown. However, we could say that Lamb's conclusions must reach the U.S. President before he meets Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller. We could also say that the presence of a Turkish Government member in the occupied areas is not accidental. The U.S. envoy met Tugay Ulucevik before meeting Denktas for the last time before his departure. Many hypotheses can be drawn: that Ankara is trying to look like it is putting pressure on Denktas so that Ciller can avoid being seriously pressed by Clinton, or that Denktas is trying to make up reasonable arguments for the excuses he is finding to waste time. As we reported yesterday, the U.S. official's lightning trip would have been more significant if it had been accompanied by a staggering dilemma: What would happen if Turkey continued to disobey the UN Security Council [UNSC]? A letter from U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin, revealed by HURRIYET, indirectly warned that the UNSC would adopt measures if the deadlock continued. Lamb's statement that President Clinton remains firmly attached to the efforts for a solution is somewhat hopeful. But, for it to bear fruit, the chief of the White House must exert all his authority and influence on Ciller, who will find it difficult to disappoint Clinton if his policy and willingness appear to be decisive. It is well-known that Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's meeting with Clinton will follow Ciller's visit. It is also well known that Hellenism has been dealt serious blows and has been very bitter about the stance of the great powers on Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM], the intervention in Bosnia-Herzegovina with the participation of Turkish "peacekeepers," and other incidents...all are equally disappointing. The situation in the Balkans is heating up and Ankara is trying to penetrate it. On the other hand, Greek foreign policy took a different form expressed with rage. National dignity will not tolerate any more provocations and the Greek political leadership, united, stands up to foreign plots and humiliation. The knife has reached the bone.... In his upcoming meeting with Clinton, Papandreou is expected to raise all of these issues and with firm arguments support Hellenism's decision not to tolerate humiliations. It is also expected that after his talks with Ciller, the U.S. President will have something more tangible, other than his positive but theoretical interest, to offer to the Cyprus issue. We have reached boundary levels and any verbal justification of Ankara's stance would equal a ridiculing of ourselves and others. Decisive handling is necessary when deadlines expire with no results because of proved malevolence, not making things look good. Now is Clinton's time to turn the page and write history with a just solution to the Cyprus issue.
