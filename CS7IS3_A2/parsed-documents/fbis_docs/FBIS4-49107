The Execution of the 1993 Budget In 1993, Zhejiang was able to maintain its good momentum of having a sustained, rapid, and healthy economic growth as a result of the efforts made by governments at all levels and all departments in following through with the instructions in Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important talks and the guidelines laid down by the 14th party congress, in implementing all measures drawn up by the party Central Committee and the State Council for strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control, in carrying out the resolution of the first session of the eighth provincial people's congress about the report of the budget and final account, in continuing with the mental emancipation, in increasing the intensity of reform, and in accelerating economic growth. On this basis, Zhejiang's revenue grew quite rapidly, and the financial needs of economic construction and other development projects were basically ensured. Zhejiang's 1993 budgetary revenue authorized by the first session of the eighth provincial people's congress was 13 billion yuan; but the actual amount received was 28 percent above target, reaching 16.665 billion yuan. That was 38.6 percent higher than that of the preceding year. The revenue included business taxes of 16.411 billion yuan, which was 38.7 percent above target and 50.6 percent higher than that a year before. Moreover, Zhejiang also fulfilled the quota of selling 1.223 billion yuan of treasury bonds. While the 1993 spending budget approved by the first session of the eighth provincial people's congress was 10.096 billion yuan, the province actually spent 12.493 billion yuan, or 23.7 percent more than the approved budget and 26.8 percent higher than the 1992 budget. The spending included 685 million yuan for capital construction projects--29.3 percent higher than the budget and 26.8 percent higher than that a year before; 1.065 billion yuan for enterprises to tap potential and upgrade technology--63.9 percent higher than the budget and 70.2 percent higher than the 1992 budget; 1.221 billion yuan for supporting agricultural production and for operating expenses for agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy projects--24.3 percent higher than the budget and 32.4 percent higher than that of a year ago; and 3.479 billion yuan for the operating expenses for cultural, educational, and health projects--17.3 percent higher than the budget and 25.2 percent higher than the 1992 spending. In this last category, educational operating expenses were 2.043 billion yuan, or 28.9 percent higher than that of a year ago. Meanwhile, the expenditure for science and technology was 221 million yuan--2.3 percent higher than the budget and 12.3 percent higher than that a year ago; 1.484 billion yuan for administrative expenses--30.2 percent higher than the budget and 37.5 percent higher than that a year ago; and 571 million yuan for law enforcement--24.1 percent higher than the budget and 32.2 percent more than that a year ago. The provincial treasury's 1933 revenue authorized by the first session of the eighth provincial people's congress was 650 million yuan, but the actual income amount was 902 million yuan, or 38.8 percent higher than the authorized amount and 59 percent higher than that a year ago. The provincial treasury's 1993 expenditure authorized by the first session of the eighth provincial people's congress was 2.46 billion yuan, but the amount actually spent was 2.64 billion yuan, or 7.2 percent higher than the budget and 12.3 percent higher than the expenditure a year ago. It is expected that Zhejiang's revenue and expenditure in 1993 could be balanced with a little surplus. This is based on the deduction of 4.85 billion yuan--a sum Zhejiang had to deliver to the central treasury (including the part of export tax refunds that had to be delivered to the central government)-- from the amount of revenue as well as the special subsidies of 1.03 billion yuan from the central authorities. There were many reasons why the province's revenues and expenditures in 1993 rose so fast and exceeded the budgeted figures by so large a margin. On the revenue side, first, it was because the provincial economy, after achieving a high growth rate in the preceding year, continued its fast momentum, thereby generating more tax revenues from the production and circulation sectors. The province's gross domestic product [GDP] is expected to reach 164.5 billion yuan, a 25-percent increase over the previous year. The added value of industrial output is expected to reach 87 billion yuan, a 40-percent increase. Sales revenues of industrial enterprises at and above the township level that maintain independent accounting rose 52 percent. Total retail sales reached 75.87 billion yuan, up 33.2 percent. Industrial and commercial tax revenues reached 16.411 billion yuan, a 50.6-percent increase. Of the total, 13.169 billion yuan was from three types of industrial and commercial tax, up 59.4 percent. Second, it was because since the second half of 1993 departments at all levels in the province have seriously implemented the guidelines of Central Document No. 6. They reduced fiscal deficits; corrected unauthorized exemption and reduction of taxes, energy, transport construction, and budget regulatory funds; halted the approval of temporary exemption and reduction of taxes; and stopped loopholes that caused revenue losses. As a result, revenues had increased for the entire year. Third, it was because financial and tax departments enforced strict management of tax collection, strengthened tax auditing, sternly dealt with illegal acts of evading taxes and refusing to pay taxes by fraudulent means, and strengthened collection and management of taxes from individual businesses. In 1993, the province collected 2.23 billion yuan of taxes from individual businesses, a 39.5- percent increase. On the expenditure side, it was mainly because of factors closely related to policy implementation, such as increase in wages and cost of living allowances for workers following the lifting of controls on grain price, and the rapid increase of personnel expenditures. The province's administrative budget alone was 1.484 billion yuan, an increase of 0.41 billion yuan or 37.5 percent. In addition, various localities also tried their best to spend more in support of agricultural, scientific and technological, and educational development and in support of enterprise technological transformation and urban infrastructural construction. According to statistics, the province's budgetary expenditures on education last year reached 2.269 billion yuan (including education funds and urban education surcharges), an increase of 0.549 billion, up 31.9 percent, faster than the increase in general budgetary expenditure during the same period. Enterprises' expenditure in tapping potentials and technological transformation grew 0.439 billion yuan, or 70.2 percent, over the previous year. The province's 1993 revenues and expenditures budget was generally well implemented. On the revenue side, there were no violations discovered, such as collecting taxes excessively or "eating next year's food." On the expenditure side, various localities gave priority to key projects and emphasized overall balance, thereby pushing forward economic construction and social undertakings. Localities used increased revenues mainly to reduce fiscal deficits, increase productive expenditures, develop various undertakings, and cover necessary personnel expenditures. In the past year, under the leadership of the local party committee and government, departments at all levels in the province deepened reform, opened up wider to the outside world, always gave priority to the work of accelerating economic development, worked hard to expand financial resources, and stepped up efforts to increase revenue and reduce expenditures. They did a tremendous amount of work to accomplish the province's budgetary goal and achieve balance between revenues and expenditures. (1) Earnestly implementing the guidelines of Central Document No. 6 and strictly enforcing the "three covenants" to rectify financial and taxation orders.Since the second half of 1993, in accordance with the guidelines of Central Document No. 6 requiring local authorities not to create deficits in local budgets, various localities have achieved unity in thinking and understanding and produced remarkable results in overcoming and rectifying the erroneous idea that "deficits are harmless" and in adopting firm measures to increase revenues and reduce general fiscal expenditures. In the process of reducing fiscal deficits, people's congress standing committees at all levels strengthened supervision and guidance and performed a tremendous amount of work. They earnestly launched inspection of unauthorized exemptions and reductions of taxes, abolished certain preferential policies locally formulated in violation of rules, and corrected the erroneous practice of some localities that wailfully exempted or reduced the energy and transport construction funds and budget regulatory funds. They halted the approval of temporary exemption and reduction of taxes. As a result, the province's financial and taxation order moved further in the right direction. (2) Meticulously organizing forces to vigorously implement measures to push forward reform of the financial, taxation, and accounting systems. Since the beginning of last year, various localities have given priority to implementing the general rules and new financial and accounting systems for various industries. As time was short and the task onerous, departments at all levels assumed responsibility for themselves and cooperated with each other to carry out in a timely fashion the training of financial and taxation personnel in their own departments and in enterprises. They earnestly brought about the transition from the old accounting system to the new one and the change of books. This has ensured the smooth implementation of measures for reforming enterprises' accounting system. Regarding the implementation of the "Regulations on Transforming the Management Mechanisms of State-Owned Industrial Enterprises," (hereinafter referred to as the "Regulations") and the "Implementing Measures" adopted by the province, various localities proceeded from reality and reformed the various financial regulations and rules incompatible with the "Regulations," truthfully delegating the financial decisionmaking power to enterprises as mandated by the "Regulations." To hold back the strong momentum in the rapid rise of budgets for public medical service, the province reformed the medical service system last year to reduce waste in public medical service. On the question of pushing forward financial and taxation system reform, first, we earnestly carried out experiments in financial reform of the tax-revenue sharing system. Acting in accordance with the uniform planning of the state and province, localities actively explored and accumulated experiences for the formal implementation of the tax- revenue sharing financial system. Second, since the second half of 1993, under the leadership of the local party committee and government, departments at all levels actively carried out preparatory work for reform in five major fields. They earnestly studied, analyzed, and measured the financial and tax reform and its impact on the economy, and they carried out propaganda and training for implementing the new tax system. Third, pursuant to the guidelines of the State Council "Decision on Implementing the Tax- Revenue-Sharing Financial Management System" and the principle of "standardization, convenience, and fairness" forwarded by the provincial government and after careful study and repeated measurement, a program for implementing the tax-revenue-sharing financial system at the city, prefectural, and county levels has been formulated. Moreover, localities have also made useful explorations, and scored heartening progress, in the reform of the revenue-sharing, wage, shareholding, housing, and other systems. (3) Adopt positive measures to promote all-round development in the economy and endeavors in all other fields. In 1993, localities earnestly implemented relevant state policies and measures by providing vigorous support to development of new and high technologies and the construction of infrastructure facilities and basic industries. We encouraged the introduction of investment and advanced technologies from abroad, improved management of World Bank-funded projects and loans, and promoted the development of an open economy. We raised funds to increase agricultural input; promoted a high-yield, high-quality, and high-efficiency agriculture; accelerated the development of a network of collectivized services in rural areas; supported the development of village and township enterprises; and offered assistance to economic development in mountainous, island, and other poverty-ridden areas. In 1993, the province spent 840 million yuan to support agricultural production, up 39.9 percent over the previous year. Continued efforts were made to implement the policy designed to invigorate and improve the operations of state-owned large and medium enterprises. State-owned industrial enterprises covered by the budget set aside 581 million yuan from their sales income as technology development, supplementary working, and additional appreciation funds, up 137.1 percent over the previous year. Meanwhile, we tried every possible way to raise funds for enterprise technical upgrades. The provincial treasury raised 210 million yuan to help fund key technical upgrade projects--including technical upgrading of silk mills and select village and township enterprises-- during the Eighth Five-Year Plan period [1991-96]. With focus on implementing the two sets of rules [Business Accounting Standards and General Rules of Financial Affairs for Enterprises] and the "Regulations," we helped enterprises upgrade internal management, implement measures aimed at making up deficits and increasing revenues, and improve economic efficiency. We continued to implement the policy and measures of "revitalizing the province by relying on science and technology and education," implemented reform of the educational and scientific and technological management systems, and expanded funding sources. More support was given to the development of science and technology, culture, education, public health, and other endeavors; expenditures on these endeavors covered in the 1993 provincial budget alone amounted to 3.927 million yuan, up 820 million, or 26.2 percent, over the previous year. (4) Improving tax collection, strictly controlling spending, and implementing well work related to increasing revenue and reducing spending. Localities stepped up auditing tax collection in an effort to improve tax collection and organize revenues well. Most of the cities and counties set up tax auditing forces and stepped up coordination among financial, taxation, public security, industrial and commercial administration, and judicial departments, and cracked down hard on illegal acts, such as evading or refusing to pay taxes. While paying close attention to collecting taxes from principal sources of tax revenues and major tax payers, the province conducted special tax auditing among self-employed industrial and commercial entities and privately run enterprises, recovering an additional 44.6 million in taxes. We stepped up tax collection among foreign-funded enterprises and launched a vigorous drive against tax evasion. In 1993, the province collected 819 million yuan in industrial and commercial consolidated taxes, up 557 million yuan, or 2.25 times, over 1992. We improved invoice administration and cracked down on such illegal acts as illegal printing, counterfeiting, or sale and issuance of fake invoices. To exercise strict control over expenditures, localities improved expenditure administration and paid special attention to bringing administrative outlay and institutional purchase under control. A quota system that was widely introduced in regard to administrative outlay was effective in encouraging the departments and units to manage their finances well and produced fairly good results. Departments at all levels also implemented effective measures to cut down on meetings and reduce meeting-related spending, postal and telecommunications expenditures, and office equipment purchases. (5) Enforcing financial and economic discipline and strengthening supervision and inspection of finance and taxation. In accordance with the State Council's unified arrangements, various localities earnestly carried out a general checkup on taxation and finance. By the end of last December, the province had uncovered 571 million yuan in discipline-violation monies, traced 424 million yuan in payable taxes, and recovered 356 million yuan in fiscal revenues. We also investigated and dealt with a number of serious and major cases; further strengthened state-owned property management; appraised fixed assets and circulating funds in administrative undertakings and units; and further strengthened supervision over the assessment and title-registration of state-owned property in Sino-foreign joint ventures, contractual joint ventures, and joint-stock enterprises, thus making important contributions to preventing the drain of state-owned property. We paid further attention to developing the undertakings of registered accountants and strengthened the development and administration of registered accountants and accounting firms. By the end of 1993, 129 accounting firms with a total of 1,220 registered accountants had been set up across the province. We did earnest work in clearing illegal fees, particularly in exposing illegal-fee problems that drew strong criticisms from the masses. By the end of 1993, the province had announced the abolition of a number of fees that were inconsistent with stipulations by the central and provincial governments and sorted out and refunded unreasonably collected fees amounting to 10.039 million yuan. Of course, some problems that brook no ignorance remained in our work. First, there was inadequate awareness of the need to keep expenditures within the limits of income, act according to our capability, and strike an overall balance. Some cities and counties were very tight in disposing finances because their income growth had failed to keep up with growing expenditures. Second, there were a softening of budgetary restraint and lack of effective control over spending, with some departments and units spending money without much care or regard to cost effectiveness, and even frequently engaging in extravagance and waste. Individual localities still saw the diversion of funds for aiding the poor to other purposes. Third, some enterprises remained wanting in economic efficiency. By the end of 1993, 398 state-owned industrial enterprises covered by the budget suffered losses totaling 450 million yuan and had net accounts receivable topping 5.25 billion yuan. Fourth, the methods of tax collection and administration still fell behind the needs of developing circumstances despite some improvement, leading to frequent occurrences of law violations such as tax evasion, violent tax refusal, and tax fraud. All these problems call for our great attention and earnest improvements in future work. 2. Draft Fiscal Budget for 1994 The year 1994 is important for continuously maintaining the favorable momentum of economic development as well as a crucial one for advancing the establishment of a socialist market economic system. Determined in accordance with the economic development strategy determined by the provincial party committee and government and the focus of this year's provincial economic work and in conjunction with the overall requirement of fiscal reform, the guiding ideology for the provincial budgetary arrangements for 1994 is:Implement in depth the guidelines of the CPC 14th National Congress and the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee on issues concerning the establishment of a socialist market economic system; implement the guidelines of the ninth provincial party congress; earnestly and properly carry out financial and taxation reform; actively support all other reforms; adhere to the principle of keeping expenditures within the limits of income, acting according to our capability, and striking an overall balance; strengthen fiscal management; ensure that local finances will not run into the red; and work hard to foster finances and increase fiscal revenues to support economic construction and the development of various social undertakings. According to the guiding principle set by the Zhejiang provincial authorities for this year's budget preparations and the province's economic planning targets, and based on the regulations governing the tax revenue sharing system, the province's fixed financial revenue for 1994 is projected at 8.02 billion yuan, a 10.1-percent increase over the previous year (calculated using similar items [tong kou jing, 0681 0656 1777]; same for the following). The budgets of major revenues are: (1) industrial and commercial tax revenues (including the 25-percent value-added taxes [VAT]) are set at 6.57 billion yuan, up 8.3 percent from the year before; (2) agricultural tax revenues are set at 570 million yuan (including taxes and other revenues from special agricultural products), a 12.1-increase percent over the previous year; (3) enterprise income taxes are set at 1.21 billion yuan, same as the previous year; (4) revenue of energy and transportation funds is set at 30 million yuan, 67.4 percent less than the previous year; (5) revenue of budget regulation funds is set at 36 million yuan, 71.7 percent less than the previous year; (6) revenue of pollution fighting fees is set at 120 million yuan, a 2.2-percent increase over the year before; (7) revenue of extra educational fees is set at 310 million yuan, up 12.5 percent from the year before; and (8) subsidies to cover state-owned enterprises' losses is set at 1.1 billion yuan, 25.4 percent less than the previous year. The province's fixed financial revenue for 1994 is projected at 8.02 billion yuan. Including the projected 5.2 billion yuan (excluding the 5.06 billion yuan that is to be submitted to the central authorities according to the system) of tax revenue return from the central authorities and of the central authorities' subsidies for special projects, which is computed based on the province's 1993 revenue, the province's usable funds for 1994 is projected at 13.22 billion yuan. According to the principle that no deficits are allowed to be included in local budgets, and to ensure that there will be sufficient funds for the province's 1994 expenditures, we plan to set the province's 1994 expenditure at 13.22 billion yuan, a 5.9- percent increase over the previous year (calculated using similar items; same for the following). The budgets for major expenditures are: (1) expenditure for capital construction is set at 620 million yuan, 9.1 percent less than the year before; (2) expenditure for tapping enterprises' potentials and for their technological transformation is set at 790 million yuan, down 25.6 percent from the previous year; (3) expenditure for science and technological development is set at 240 million yuan, up 9.7 percent from the year before; (4) expenditure for agricultural development is set at 1.25 billion yuan, a 9.7-percent increase from the year before, of which 830 million yuan is for supporting agricultural production, or 10 percent higher than the previous year; (5) expenditure for cultural, educational, and public health purposes is set at 4 billion yuan, 14.9 percent higher than the year before, of which 2.361 billion yuan is for educational purposes, or 15.6 percent higher than the previous year; (6) administrative and management expenditure is set at 1.62 billion yuan, up 9.4 percent from the year before; (7) expenditure for public security, procuratorial, and judicial work is set at 650 million yuan, 13.5 percent higher than the year before; (8) expenditure for supporting development in underdeveloped areas is set at 53 million yuan, a 5.3-percent increase over the previous year; and (9) extra educational expenditure is set at 250 million yuan, up 12 percent from the year before. In the draft provincial budget, provincial financial revenue for 1994 is projected at 450 million yuan, or 2.8 percent less than the previous year calculating using similar items. Including the projected 2.37 billion yuan of tax revenue return from the central authorities, of the central authorities' subsidies for special projects, and of funds submitted and transferred from all cities and counties, the usable provincial funds for 1994 is projected at 2.82 billion yuan. We plan to set provincial financial expenditure for 1994 at 2.82 billion yuan, or 7 percent more than the previous year calculating using similar items. From the aforementioned budgeted financial revenues and expenditures, revenues are budgeted in a positive manner, expenditures are tight, and the revenues and expenditures budgets are balanced. However, due to various factors, the province's general financial situation in 1994 will still be tough and contradictions between the supply and demand of funds still will be quite prominent. The first reason is that, after the tax revenue sharing system is implemented, 75 percent of VAT and all consumption taxes will be submitted to the central authorities; in addition, we have to gradually increase the amount to be submitted, as required by the old system. The second reason concerns expenditures. We not only have to deal with the increased expenditures for wage adjustment, for subsidies to cover the differences resulting from the readjustments of coal and electricity prices, and for subsidizing housing reform, which are all a result of new policies adopted last year, there also will be many increased expenditures due to new policies to be implemented this year. Therefore, contradictions between revenue and expenditure will be even more acute this year and it will be more difficult to maintain a balance In addition, since this is the first year to carry out new financial and taxation system, some concrete situations and problems need to be further investigated and studied. In terms of various policies and measures that have been or will be introduced, a process of transition and adaptation is needed for their actual operation. The financial and taxation work as a whole will face even more arduous tasks because new situations and problems will keep cropping up. Of course, we should also understand that there are quite a few favorable conditions. Our economic development, reform, and opening up are facing rare opportunities. First, since we have gradually carried out the central authorities' various measures concerning macroeconomic control, we have alleviated the contradiction between overall demand and supply and created even more favorable conditions for economic development. Second, with the progress of the financial, taxation, banking, investment, and foreign trade management systems, a socialist market economy will be further established and improved. Third, affected by the growth of investment, agricultural prices, and wages as well as other factors, market demand will continue a vigorous momentum. Zhejiang will continue to experience sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development and greater progress in reform, which in turn will provide better conditions for the financial and taxation work. Therefore, we should comprehensively and objectively analyze the current situation, unify thinking, enhance understanding, boost morale, foster faith, and strive to achieve financial balance. 3. The Key Points of the 1994 Financial Work To ensure that Zhejiang will have a balanced financial budget in 1994, we should further study and carry out the guiding spirit of the "Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Some Issues Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic Structure" and that of the ninth provincial CPC congress, focus on the establishment of a socialist market economy and the key points of Zhejiang's 1994 economic work, and improve financial and taxation reform as well as reform in other aspects. To meet the need of a socialist market economy, we should accelerate the change of government functions, promote the development of economic and other aspects, enhance enterprises' economic performance, increase profits, and reduce expenditures. (1) Further promote sustained, rapid, and healthy economic growth in Zhejiang by expanding financial resources and improving economic policy. Improving the economy and cultivating financial resources have always been the primary task of financial and taxation work. We should further stabilize the farming sector's status as the foundation of the national economy and carry out policies and measures concerning the promotion of agricultural production and rural economic development. We should actively support the establishment of a grain production risk foundation, grain reserve and control system, and reserve system for agricultural capital goods. It is necessary to support the readjustment of agricultural structure and promote a high-yield, high-quality, and high-efficiency agriculture. We should work hard to raise special funds for water conservancy projects and strive to enhance the economic performance of such funds. Continued efforts should be made to support economic development in mountain, island, and poverty-stricken areas. We should further expand channels for pooling funds and energetically support the construction of basic industries and infrastructure facilities, including transportation. It is necessary to support the construction and development of public utilities and public affairs undertakings. We should support the development of scientific and technological and educational undertakings by increasing capital input. We should help enterprises accelerate technical renovation, make up deficits and increase surpluses, strengthen market competition capability, and enhance economic performance. We should continue to raise funds to support the provincial government's technical renovation plans for major projects and the silk industry. We should strengthen the management of World Bank loans so as to increase their economic results. We should conscientiously carry out the state's relevant policies and regulations concerning financial and taxation matters and provide continued support to the economic development of various development zones and open cities. We should provide further support to the reform of the foreign trade system, strengthen financial supervision of foreign trade companies and foreign-funded enterprises, and strive to enhance Zhejiang's export and foreign-exchange earning ability. Meanwhile, we should take active measures to energetically support the development of tertiary industry. (2) We should unify our thinking and effectively carry out various measures for reforming the financial and taxation systems.Reform of the financial and taxation systems is an important aspect in establishing a socialist market economic structure. We should understand the great significance of financial and tax reform from an overall and strategic point of view. We should carry out the reform of the financial and taxation systems as the central task of this year's financial and tax work; we should carefully organize this work, make proper arrangements for it, and conscientiously perform it. We should earnestly study new situations and problems arising in the course of reform and particularly study the possible impact of the financial and tax reform on economic development. As for problems arising in the process of replacing the old structure with a new one, we should deal with different problems in different ways. Problems which fall within the powers and functions of the provincial government should be studied and handled promptly and properly by the provincial government. As for problems that fall within the central authorities' powers and functions, we should report them to higher levels to have them solved as soon as possible. We should vigorously support reform in banking, investment, foreign exchange, and other fields; support and participate in the reform of the social security and urban housing systems; and support the experiment on the establishment of a modern enterprise system. We should continue to implement in an all-round way the "Regulations" and the procedures the provincial government adopted for carrying out the "Regulations." The plan for the revenue-sharing system for the province, cities, prefectures, and counties, which was appropriately revised after being discussed at a provincial economic work conference and listening to the opinions of various localities, has been formally issued for implementation. Acting in the spirit of seeking truth from facts and proceeding from arousing local governments' initiative in developing the economy and increasing financial revenues, the provincial government will earnestly handle the interrelations between the province, cities, prefectures, and counties to further promote a coordinated development of the province's economy. The provincial government will concentrate an appropriate proportion of the increased financial revenues on certain projects -- this is an objective requirement for the provincial government to increase its ability to exercise macroeconomic regulation and control and to maintain the province's coordinated economic and social development. Conscientious efforts should be made to perform ideological work, to promote coordinated development in various parts of the province, to concentrate on economic construction, and to make financial revenues steadily increase with economic development. (3) We should accelerate the change of functions in finance and taxation to meet the needs of the market economy.How to do financial and tax work well under the socialist market economy is a new task before us. According to the requirements of the changing situation, we should further emancipate our minds, change our ideas, and step up our study of the market economy theory. We should conscientiously explore and study concepts and methods of managing money matters in the new situation. The stress of financial and tax work should be shifted as soon as possible to macroeconomic regulation and control as well as supervision and management. We should open up the field of financial investment, develop the negotiable securities trade, strengthen the management of funds for public housing, and further strengthen supervision and control over extra-budgetary funds to prevent the loss of such funds. We should quickly readjust the economic development strategy according to the change in the distribution of financial resources, strive to bring about economic growth, and try to increase financial revenues for local governments. We should quickly institute a local tax system and lose no time in studying the levying and management of taxes on earnings from the transfer of land leases and real estate and of inheritance and bequest taxes. We should further strengthen the management of state-owned assets and set up a social supervision network in this regard. Continuous efforts should be made to appraise the fixed assets and circulating funds, define property rights, and check up on creditor's rights and debts and on the value of enterprises' assets. We should do a good job in registering state-owned assets, strengthen the management of Chinese-owned shares of joint ventures practicing the share-holding system, prevent the loss of state-owned assets, and effectively ensure that state-owned assets and their rights and interests are not infringed on. We should further step up the study, publicity, and implementation of the "Law on Registered Accountants," strengthen the ranks of registered accountants and the management of their offices, and continuously develop their work to meet the needs of the developing socialist market economy. (4) We must intensify tax collection and management and make great efforts to bring in more revenue.This year is the first for implementation of the new tax system and for the revenue-sharing system to operate. We must collect taxes strictly in accordance with the new tax law. We must continue to tighten the collection of the "two funds" [fund for priority energy and communications projects and fund for regulating the budget] from enterprises and institutions not operated by the state. These funds may not be deducted or exempted at will. We must continue to reform tax collection and management and make greater efforts in building contingents of competent tax auditors so that the ranks of auditors can be reinforced and tax collection and management can be strengthened. We must tighten the work of collecting taxes from independent business operators, private enterprises, and foreign-funded enterprises and we must audit their tax payments. We must tighten the management of invoices and draw up the necessary regulations and rules. Effective measures must be devised to heighten people's awareness of paying taxes, gradually establish and improve the system of tax payers filing taxes on their own initiative, actively promote taxation agency services, and promote the use of computers in tax collection and management. Harsh measures should be taken to crack down on all types of unlawful conduct of evading and refusing tax payments and all tax frauds. We must stop all revenue loopholes and firmly collect what should be collected. (5) We must tighten expenditure and strictly control expenses. We must continue to uphold the principle of spending within our means and doing what is within our ability, be stringent in earmarking funds, ensure the needs of priority projects, and curtail allotments for ordinary projects. Budgets for essential personnel must be ensured. Budget restraints must be firmly enforced, projects must be carried out strictly according to available budgets, and any casual or reckless spending habits must be combated and corrected. The procedures of setting administrative budget quotas should be further reviewed and improved. This year's budget-cutting should focus on expenses for meetings, postage, telegrams, and utilities. Institutions should speed up the restructuring of their fiscal management, and those that have the needed resources should be supported to provide compensatory services within the bounds of law so that their capacity for self-development will be stronger as result of their efforts to bring in additional income for themselves. The "accounting of revenues and expenditures must be done separately" rule must be enforced, and controls over all budgetary incomes must be consolidated. Grain-related finances must be tightened to make sure that there will not be any new debts incurred in this area this year. We must earnestly study measures for tightening control over institutional purchases under the new situation and make every effort to stop institutional consumption from ballooning.
