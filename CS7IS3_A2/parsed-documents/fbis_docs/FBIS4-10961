Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, however, was the one who most strongly opposed this idea. The issue is sensitive, especially for developing countries, but the three days of debate among the countries of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT), which ended yesterday in Marrakech, suggest that the issue will not be discarded. It ended up becoming a compulsory point of reference in the speeches of the ministers, and also a factor that neatly marked a division for the future. Gore's closing speech, and the speech delivered by Amorim a short time before, were the most clear examples of the final session. "Economic growth cannot be maintained if it ends up producing social convulsion," Gore said to representatives of more than 120 countries. "A global system of commerce that does not eliminate exploitation will collapse in the end, because people around the world will not support it," he noted. Gore did not clarify what precisely the United States is expecting in this regard, but noted that there is concern about extreme situations of manpower exploitation. The implication is that this might produce unfair competition. He said, however, that "the United States will resist any attempt to turn the issue of improved working conditions into a form of protectionism." Amorim not only considered "inappropriate" the debate on the subject, but believes that it raises the fear of the appearance of "global protectionism, which opens the way to the exportation of technologically sophisticated goods produced by developed countries, and closes the door to our competitive exports." The social conditions issue, he suggested, might result "in the exportation of unemployment from rich to poor countries, transferring a social burden that poor countries cannot bear." The idea of "global protectionism," which Amorim later explained to this newspaper, entails the fear that developing countries will end up paying twice: by opening several markets, through the Uruguay Round of talks, and by having their exports hindered in the sector in which they are most competitive. The fear is that by using the concept of "social dumping," economically developed countries can find a way to ban importations from industrial areas where low manpower cost is a comparative advantage of developing countries. Even though there are substantial differences with the U.S. position, Amorim praised Gore's public commitment to avoid using the "social issue" as a veiled form of protectionism. Even rich countries are far from having reached an agreement on the subject. For example, British representative Timothy Sainsbury said that Great Britain "is not convinced that the WTO and the international trade system provide the best context for addressing the subject." German Minister Gunther Rexrodt advocated a "multilateral discussion," provided the matter "does not become an instrument for commercial restrictions or for a new source of protectionism." Gore also put strong emphasis on the environment, in this case with Brazilian support. There is consensus on the subject within GATT, and a subcommittee will make a comprehensive analysis of relations between the protection of the environment and trade during the installation phase of the WTO (which should come into operation at the beginning of 1995). After its creation, the WTO will have a special committee for the issue, which will function until 1996. Gore was the highest-ranking official attending the signing of the Uruguay Round agreement in Marrakech. His presence was aimed at giving a high profile to President Bill Clinton's commitment to free trade, which became confusing immediately after the conclusion of the Uruguay Round in December with the threat of using unilateral legislation (Super 301) in the commercial area. Both Gore and U.S. negotiator Mickey Kantor reiterated Clinton's commitment to the commercial opening. Japan, which was the main potential victim of Super 301, adopted a hard stance on the issue. Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata said in his speech that his country is "deeply concerned about the protection of domestic industries by the abuse of antidumping measures, which will lead to the adoption of unilateral measures and to the promotion of regionalism." This was a veiled message for the United States. In a meeting with Gore after the GATT session, Hata--who is considered a likely candidate for the post of new Japanese prime minister--assured that the new government in Japan would not change its commercial opening policy, and would continue along the course of the liberalization reform. The United States expects more concessions in this area, in order to avoid imposing commercial sanctions on the Japanese. Japan, like the United States and the other main GATT members, reaffirmed its willingness to ratify the Uruguay Round in 1994, in order to make feasible the target of beginning WTO operations on 1 January 1995. Ambassador Paulo Nogueira Batista has told this newspaper that there has been a change in the strategy for negotiations over the Uruguay Round. Instead of submitting it to Congress, the U.S. executive branch decided to submit it separately to the Senate. This will call for approval by a two-thirds vote, and not by a simple majority, but will give the Round the status of an international treaty, and this is very important. Precisely because GATT does not have this status (because of U.S. resistance at the time it was created), the U.S. Congress does not refrain from applying commercial laws that oppose multilateral regulations. If the U.S. Congress approves the WTO, it will be more difficult, for example, to use instruments like the Super 301, Nogueira Batista has said. Minister Celso Amorim believes that this aspect of the Uruguay Round, as an instrument for reinforcing multilateral mechanisms and multilateral discipline in world trade, is perhaps its main benefit. Obviously, there were gains with the reduction of tariffs on industrial products and reductions of agricultural subsidies. Pressure From Brazil However, not all Brazilian expectations were met. For example, Brazil ended up obtaining a tariff reduction--beyond the average tariff--for orange juice of only 15 percent in the United States, and 20 percent in Europe. The Europeans made a much more generous offer, but backed down on their word at the last minute, under pressure from Spain and Italy. At a bilateral meeting yesterday with Sir Leon Brittan, the European official for commerce, Amorim reiterated his hope that "it will not be necessary for us to wait for a new round for Europeans to give us fairer treatment." Amorim yesterday met with representatives of the Czech Republic, China, Uruguay, and Morocco. He and other ministers also had lunch with Kantor. To Chinese Minister Gu Yongjian, Amorim reiterated his expectation that the Chinese will refrain from buying agricultural products on the international market from countries that subsidize their agriculture.
