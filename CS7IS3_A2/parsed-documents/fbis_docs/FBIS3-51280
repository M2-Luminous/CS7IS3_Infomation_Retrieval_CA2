As a friend, Moreno is one of those persons who will go to any lengths when he sees that someone close to him is having a hard time of it or is faced with some problem. I am in a position to say this because I have been a beneficiary of his advice and generosity, because his family and mine are joined by old bonds of friendship, and because, independently of his intelligence--and that thing they call creative genius, which in his case is a perfect definition of his way of being and of bonding--he is, in essence, what Machado called a man, in the best sense of the word. Such is the well-deserved fame that Moreno enjoys with nearly everyone. Furthermore, his intimate relationship with Andres Pastrana is unconcealable. It is a relationship that presumably began when the two were teenagers, but which undoubtedly grew stronger when they began to work together, first as journalists, then on "TV Today," with Andres as the announcer and director and Luis Alberto the manager, a successful team effort. We later saw that Moreno's cooperation was vital to Pastrana's candidacy for mayor of Bogota. Few could have imagined that, as a political adviser and the planner of innovative campaign strategies, this tiny man--but a man gifted with great soul and a superior mind able to intuit where and how the adversary might respond--could indeed have such talent for advising. This without mentioning that the advisee would follow every recommendation he would make to the letter. It is because of Luis Alberto's happy-go-lucky nature that he has many friends inside and outside of this government in which he plays such an active part as minister of development, replacing Jorge Ospina Sardi. However, it is precisely this factor that forces me to write the following, albeit with a number of cordial reservations, not about Moreno's performance as an official, but rather, concerning his unbounded--and now blatant--pro-Pastranism in his capacity as minister. Theoretically, it would all be acceptable, insofar as Andres claims that he is not a candidate and, consequently, that Moreno cannot head his campaign. However, we all know that this tactic is as shrewd as it is artful and that Andres could just as easily be a presidential candidate in a month as Luis Alberto could be his campaign director and most trustworthy alter ego. I am not saying that the minister of development is "shaking down" or blackmailing industrialists by saying that if they do not vote for Pastrana or start filling his coffers, they will not have the sympathetic ear of the business sector's representative in the Executive Branch, which is, to a certain extent, the role that a good Development Ministry should play. However, it remains to be seen how committed or uncommitted those same businessmen feel--politically and economically--toward the man who functions as their spokesman in government. Indeed, it is obvious that Moreno has never missed an opportunity to "campaign" for Andres and that more than a few institutions overseen by his ministry have become abnormally pro-Pastrana, as in the case of the Tourism Corporation and the Office of Superintendent of Companies. To draw a valid contrast, no such thing has occurred with the other Cabinet ministers, who have respected strict official impartiality. Finally, from his current office, Moreno is and will continue to be--for as long as he serves as minister--the confidant of Andres, who, even if he has never formally declared it, is for all practical purposes a presidential candidate. The straw that broke the camel's back is the report--which, if true, would be extremely serious--that as minister of development, Moreno accompanied Pastrana on his recent trip to Venezuela and was present during the hour-and-a-half-long meeting they had with President Ramon J. Velasquez, a meeting arranged by Moreno at Pastrana's request. What if any one of the Liberal precandidates had done likewise as the result of our minister of government's arrangements, for example? Would that minister not have been condemned--immediately--for openly meddling in politics and for an absolute lack of neutrality in his actions, as an employee (and not just any) of the administration? So close to elections, it would be as awkward as it would be useless to claim that Moreno should drop his pro-Pastrana stance overnight, but I do not think it would be far-fetched or bold--much less unjust--to ask him to cease being a Pastrana activist while he holds an official post that undeniably grants him powers and prerogatives he would most certainly lack without that Cabinet post. It is one that unquestionably complicates things in terms of guarantees, all the more so when certain political observers do not understand the systematic ambiguity of Pastranism that is so deeply embedded in a Liberal regime, on the one hand, while at the same time being critical, highly critical, of that same regime in various ways (witness LA PRENSA's repeated tirades). The same observers understand even less the latent accusation that, from the very center of power, support for Andres is subtly drummed up and in the form of actions which, like the one reported, are so difficult to cover up or deny.
