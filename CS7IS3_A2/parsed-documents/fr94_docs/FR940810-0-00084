FR940810-0-00084 FR940810-0-00021 Several alternate amounts of material were suggested. Christopher Corrado of the Long Island Lighting Company (Ex. 7&hyph;29), James Foley of the New York Power Authority (Ex. 7&hyph;31) and Robert Brothers of Eastman Kodak (Ex. 7&hyph;81) recommended that OSHA adopt the amounts used by New York in its small-scale definition_25 linear and 10 square feet. William Dundulis of the Rhode Island Department of Health felt that to avoid confusion, OSHA should adopt the same cutoff that EPA used in its Worker Protection Rule_3 linear and 3 square feet (7&hyph;124). Others suggested that the amount of material be defined by the amount of asbestos-containing waste generated by the activity. For example, Preston Quirk of Gobbell Hays suggested cutoff maximum of 55 gallon drum or 1 cubic yard of ACM waste material (Ex. 7&hyph;34), while OSHA witness David Kirby suggested 3 glove bags worth of waste material or 10 linear feet as the cutoff of a small-scale job (Ex. 7&hyph;111). BCTD suggested ``the lesser of (a) a yield of no more than 1&hyph;1/3 cubic feet (10 gallons) of asbestos-containing waste material, or (b) a maximum length of 2 feet or a maximum area of no more than 8 square feet of material containing asbestos.'' Noting that the amount of material covering a pipe varies with its diameter, (and the thickness of the material) BCTD calculated that removal of 1 inch of insulation from common pipe dimensions can vary from 1.37 to 5.04 cubic feet of waste. (Ex 143 at 131). Although OSHA believes that the amount of waste material generated by a job may be a valid index of its exposure potential, the Agency agrees with participants who pointed out the difficulties of estimating the amount of waste material in advance of the job. [e.g., testimony of Chip D'Angelo, an asbestos consultant, (Tr. 3086), Paul Fiduccia, representing a number of real estate and building owner interests, (Tr. 791); Paul Heffernan of Kaselaan and D'Angelo Associates, (Ex. 7&hyph;36)]. Various other quantitative limits were suggested which were tied to specific materials; (e.g. transite panels, 32 square feet (Ex. 7&hyph;94), 48 square feet (7&hyph;96). Mr. Churchill, representing the California Association of Asbestos Professionals, suggested 9 square and 9 linear feet as cutoffs for small-scale jobs (Ex. 7&hyph;95 and Tr. 3468). Charles Kelly of Edison Electric Institute asked whether complete removal of a pipe which might exceed 21 feet in length, but which involved removal of less than 2 feet of insulation at either end to enable cutting the pipe length for removal would be considered a small-scale job (Ex. 156). Many additional commentators and hearing participants discussed these issues during this rulemaking proceeding. Some commented that the duration cutoffs were not realistic or protective. Other participants asked for clarification on whether duration of the job included preparation and cleanup. Also, Captain John Collins of the US Navy felt that employers would abuse the exemption by assigning many employees to a job in order to complete it in a short time period (Ex. 7&hyph;52), and suggested that instead of specifying the number of persons and the number of hours, OSHA should set the limit in terms of man-hours [see also Churchill at Tr. 3468, ORC at Tr. 3181, Kynock of AIR Coalition (Tr. 3539)]. Daniel Bart of GTE Service Corporation expressed concern that by having a time limitation for small-scale, short duration operations in the definition, the installation of telephone cables in buildings might no longer be considered short duration (Ex. 7&hyph;87). Dr. Michael Crane of Consolidated Edison, New York objected to the requirement that an operation be non-repetitive in order to qualify as small-scale, short duration (Ex. 7&hyph;76). He said, ``(t)here are jobs *␣*␣* not part of an overall asbestos removal but are performed many times in the course of day during routine maintenance that must be done in generation stations and other utility facilities'' [see also the suggestion of Paul Heffernan of Kaselaan & D'Angelo to adopt the concept of ``functional space'' as designated under AHERA, and defining a non-repetitive operation as occurring once within such a functional space (Ex. 7&hyph;36)]. Some also asked if OSHA intended preparation time and clean-up time be included in the duration limits for SSSD (Ex. 7&hyph;108).
