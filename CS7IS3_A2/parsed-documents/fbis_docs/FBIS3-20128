Several hundred youths outside the peaceful main body of the march threw rocks and stones at police who retaliated with baton charges, making a number of arrests. Five officers were injured. Interior Minister Charles Pasqua called in 3,300 riot police after predicting there would be "1,000 trouble-makers" hidden among the peaceful protestors. Thousands of young people also turned out in provincial cities across the country, after serious unrest in the western cities of Nantes and Rennes overnight. In Lyon, eastern France, about 10,000 young people rallied, there were 4,000 at Besancon and 2,000 at Perpignan in the south-west. In Nantes another demonstration began Friday after clashes overnight between hundreds of student militants and police for the third time in a week. Thirty police, a television cameraman and at least two demonstrators were injured, authorities said. Twenty-two arrests were made. In Rennes, youths hurled rocks and bottles at police who riposted with tear gas for two hours early on Friday. Six police and one youth were injured and 11 people were arrested. In Paris, students organised their own system of guards to prevent vandalism and fighting. Shopkeepers rolled down their steel shutters and the authorities closed down metro stations on the route. A group of 50 "white helmets" were there to monitor police behaviour and the way any arrests were made, a spokesman said. The group was wearing white caps. Student anger over the government plan has been heightened by uncertainty about their future in a country that has 3.3 million unemployed -- almost 12 percent of the work force -- of whom more than 750,000 are under 25. The plan states that young people with diplomas or university degrees may be paid 80 percent of an ordinary salary for 80 percent of working time, with 20 percent of training. Students called the plan a poor reward for years of study and trade unionists denounced it as opening the way to firing older workers and replacing them with poorly-paid youths.
