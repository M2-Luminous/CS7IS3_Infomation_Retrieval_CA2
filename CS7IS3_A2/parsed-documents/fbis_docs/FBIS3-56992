Otherwise the world will continue watching the tragedy unfold, said Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin. In an exclusive interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent upon his return earlier tonight from Geneva, where another round of talks between the sides involved in the Bosnian conflict was held, Churkin said that with every unsuccessful round it is becoming more difficult to hope for success at the talks on a settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It was at the previous round of talks in Brussels last December that another opportunity to achieve accord was missed, Vitaliy Churkin added. At that moment the international community lacks determination to bring the matter to a logical end, and now it is lacking even more. Vitaliy Churkin said the next round is scheduled to take place in Geneva on 10 February. That meeting will aim to achieve more modest tasks, and it will be attended by fewer participants. Representatives of the sides will gather only to discuss confidence measures, so it will be a meeting with limited goals.
