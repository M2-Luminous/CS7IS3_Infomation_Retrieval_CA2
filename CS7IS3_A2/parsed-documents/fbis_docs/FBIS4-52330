This figure is equivalent to 10 percent of the total expenses for materials. Zexel decided to change its procurement policy of giving priority to domestically made products because quality of foreign-made products has improved, in addition to their low prices resulting from yen's appreciation. Zexel, which is a primary parts maker, mainly manufactures parts of car air conditioners and fuel injection devices, and sells these products directly to Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. and Isuzu Motors Ltd. So far, it has partially imported compressor parts of air conditioners from its U.S. office. The import volume was only 1.3 billion yen in 1993, which was less than 1 percent of expenses for material procurement. Zexel is now studying the quality and costs of resin products, castings, and forgings made by U.S. and Asian makers to check whether or not these products are usable. In the case of the resin products, they have a quality level similar to that of Japanese products, while their prices are 5 to 10 percent cheaper. Zexel is likely to start importation in the near future. On the other hand, Zexel plans to reduce the number of secondary and tertiary parts makers with which it does business. Although Zexel has a cooperative organization of subcontracting parts makers called "Shineikai," it will conduct stricter screening to decide whether to continue doing business with those companies.
