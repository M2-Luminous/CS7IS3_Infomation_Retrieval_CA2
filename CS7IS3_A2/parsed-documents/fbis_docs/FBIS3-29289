He said it was a bilateral issue and part of a series of talks under which the United States is trying to achieve concrete results in reducing Japan's trade surplus. He said the two countries adopt a common principle in trade. A source at the Finance Ministry said that there could be a short-term impact caused by speculation in the money market. He suggested that one should wait and see when the Japanese Government starts selling its holdings if the U.S. Federal Reserve buys up the money in order to reduce the impact from the yen appreciation. He does not think that there will be any impact on Thailand. [passage omitted]
