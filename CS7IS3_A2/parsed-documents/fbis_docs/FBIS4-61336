These restrictions do not affect Russians. According to some estimates there are now about 600,000 immigrants in the Kuban -- mainly from interethnic conflict zones. Only a fraction of them are registered in the kray and have residence permits. The kray administration head's decree says that the multinational stream of immigrants is posing a serious threat to social and political stability. This new state of affairs significantly restricts the categories of people who can obtain the right to permanent residence. For example, Krasnodar Kray Immigration Service is being instructed to grant the status of refugee or enforced migrant only to those who have close relatives in the Kuban who have already been living here more than five years. These same persons can register as residents of Sochi only in exceptional circumstances. Citizens from the former USSR and persons without citizenship now must have invitations, which are officially registered by the organs of local self-government, in order to enter the kray on a temporary basis. Moreover, they have to apply to the internal affairs organs within 24 hours of their arrival for registration. A one-shot fee of 20 percent of the minimum monthly wage has been imposed for the invitations' official registration. Those who are involved in entrepreneurial or other profit-making activities will have to pay the same amount, but in their case it will be payable for each day they spend in the Kuban. People visiting close relatives, invalids, students, entertainers, workers on tours of duty, and several other categories of arrivals are exempt from the registration fee. The Caucasus Special Border District's "Krasnodar" operations section of troops has been advised to hand over those who arrive in the Kuban without invitations drawn up in the prescribed manner to the Federal Counterintelligence Service or representatives of the internal affairs organs in the location where they were allowed to cross the Russian Federation state border. True, a blunder has been made. The administration head's decree mentions that the decree will come into force the moment it is published. However, a large number of the kray's inhabitants who are awaiting guests from the former USSR have only just found out about the necessity for them to have an officially registered invitation for a temporary visit.
