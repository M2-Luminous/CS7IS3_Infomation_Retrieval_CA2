They discussed at length the great theoretical and practical significance of Comrade Xiaoping's scientific concept of "peaceful reunification and one country, two systems" and held that all-level leaders and cadres should study further Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thought for solving the Taiwan question to improve work related to Taiwan and promote the motherland's reunification. Wang Zhaoguo, vice chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultation Conference National Committee and director of the Taiwan Affairs Offices, chaired the forum. He said: "One country, two systems" is a concrete application of Marxism-Leninism based on China's realities and the special features of the times; it is a product of the party's ideological line of seeking truth from facts, as well as an important component of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thought, we have scored remarkable achievements in Taiwan affairs in recent years. The party Central Committee has attached great importance to work related to Taiwan, of which General Secretary Jiang Zemin has taken a personal charge. Under the new circumstances, we should continue to diligently study and implement Comrade Deng Xiaoping's concept of "peaceful reunification and one country, two systems," adhere to the principle of one China, steadfastly safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and oppose "two Chinas," "one China, one Taiwan," or "Taiwan's independence" in any form. Wang Daohan, chairman of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS], said: The aim of ARATS, which is to promote exchanges and relations between the two sides of the strait, is a concrete form of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's concept of "peaceful reunification and one country, two systems." In view of the imminent arrival of the 21st century, the two sides should increase economic cooperation, seek to complement and benefit each other, and promote peaceful reunification. Comrade Luo Changqing, who had worked for a long time at the side of the late premier Zhou Enlai, related his personal experiences in discussing gains from studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. He said: Comrade Deng Xiaoping's concept of "one country, two systems" is an inheritance and development of the guidelines for Taiwan affairs laid down by Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou, and other revolutionaries of the older generation, as well as the basic principle guiding the party's work related to Taiwan. Comrade Yang Side, who has been engaged in work related to Taiwan for many years, said: The concept of "peaceful reunification and one country, two systems" is bold in vision, judicious in policy orientation, substantive in content, and innovative in practice. This concept has helped us successfully resolve the Hong Kong and Macao questions, and will certainly guide us in finally settling the Taiwan question and realizing the motherland's reunification. Comrade Cai Zimin, chairman of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League Central Committee, said: The people of Taiwan are imbued with the glorious patriotic tradition, and they have never reneged their affection for the motherland. "One country, two systems" takes into consideration the realities on the two sides of the strait and conforms with the Taiwan compatriots' aspiration to be the masters of their own country. This concept has received the understanding, support, and endorsement of more and more Taiwan compatriots. Advocates of "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" inside and outside the island are doomed to fail. Sun Xiaoyu, Tang Shubei, Li Qingzhou, Guo Pingtan, and other officials of relevant departments attended the forum.
