Yi alleged that Han's remarks were apparently "derogatory to the soldiers who fought in the Vietnam War for the cause of democracy." He also took issue with Han saying that "his life was saved by a North Korean soldier during the Korean War when he was seriously injured by the UN Forces' bombing." Meanwhile, a ministry spokesman dismissed Yi's criticism as "ridiculous" saying that the word "great" has widely been used to jeer Kim Il-song rather than eulogize him. Yi also denounced President Kim Yong-sam's personnel management by claiming that the government has appointed scholars holding "ambiguous ideologies" as Cabinet members, thus leaving his fellow orthodox rightists in disarray. Yi also charged that former opposition leader Kim Tae-chung, now chairman of the Asia-Pacific Peace Foundation, is seeking a political comeback despite his repeated announcement of his retirement from politics. Yi made a similar accusation Friday in a statement released in the name of a civic body he heads. In an interview with the WASHINGTON TIMES, Kim had reportedly said even if Pyongyang possessed two or three atomic bombs, it would not be much of a problem compared with the 20,000 nuclear warheads that the United States has. He also said that the United States should dispatch former president Jimmy Carter to Asia as a special envoy and invite North Korean President Kim to Washington. The reports touched off a wave of criticism from the ruling Democratic Liberal Party and the National Unification Board for distracting the government's official nuclear policy aimed at eradicating North Korea's suspected nuclear arsenal. Kim denied his remarks later, allegng that the reports were totally groundless. Kim even said that Pyongyang clandestine nuclear weapons program should be stopped at all costs and the government should be the sole channel of dialogue with North Korea.
