The notification came despite Washington's cautious optimism that the Serbs could remove all their heavy weapons from the 20-kilometer exclusion zone before Sunday. "I am cautiously, cautiously optimistic about the developments of the last few days," Defense Secretary William Perry said today. Perry is scheduled to join defense chiefs of five other European allies for a meeting on Bosnia at the Aviano Air Base in Italy on Sunday before the NATO deadline expires. The Bosnian Serbs announced that they would withdraw all heavy weapons from Sarajevo before Saturday, one day before the expiration of the NATO deadline, after Russia promised to send its troops to help implement the ceasefire in the city. Washington welcomed Russia's efforts but insisted that no extension would be allowed for the NATO deadline. "The important thing at this point is to see actions from the Serbs, because in the past we've seen plenty of words," State Department Spokesman Mike McCurry said. There are reports that the Bosnian Serbs are pulling out mortars and other heavy weapons from the capital that they have surrounded for 22 months. However, U.S. officials said reports from the ground were inconclusive and they would "wait and see" if the Serbs would indeed fully comply with the NATO ultimatum. "There is no change in the NATO ultimatum at all," McCurry said. "We will be watching very closely this weekend what the Serbs are doing to comply because they know exactly what they have to do, they know what will happen if they don't comply," he added. At the White House, Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said, "The test will be their (the Serbs') actions on the ground." "The test has not changed," Myers said. Clinton told Congress that more than 60 aircraft are available for participation in the authorized NATO missions. The formal notification followed a meeting of Clinton's top security staff at the White House on the Bosnian situation. A war powers act requires the president to notify Congress any time he sends or plans to send U.S. troops to war.
