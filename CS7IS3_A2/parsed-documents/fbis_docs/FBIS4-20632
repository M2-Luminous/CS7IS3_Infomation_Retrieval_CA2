Carbon nanotubes are expected to have a variety of properties. They can be synthesized only with high levels of impurities, therefore, it has been difficult to make precise property evaluations. They are still in the basic research stage, but nanotubes of "above 99 percent purity" are expected, according to the NIMC. The latest development is likely to attract considerable attention because it may represent substantial progress in research on the properties of carbon nanotubes. Development was carried out by Chief Researchers Morio Yumura and Kunio Uchida of the Reaction Engineering Lab at the Department of Chemical Systems of the NIMC. Carbon nanotubes are contained in the substances deposited on the cathode when the starter material graphite is heated at a high temperature by arc discharge. However, this substance contains a large amount of graphite-like material and amorphous carbon impurities in addition to carbon nanotubes. The currently known separation/refinery technology for carbon nanotubes involves dipping a coarsely ground substance in ethanol. Carbon nanotubes are recovered from the supernatant ethanol after supersonic waves are applied. However, this conventional separation/refinery method leaves impurities, and the presence of those impurities has hindered precise property evaluations. The new technology calls for further fine pulverization of the carbon nanotubes and impurities in supernatant ethanol to loosen them all up. Next, the pulverized substances are taken out of the ethanol and put into water containing dispersant and then placed in a centrifugal separator. The supernatant liquid produced at this time is put through a filter. At this stage, most of the amorphous carbon is eliminated, but a small amount of graphite-like substances remain. And so, finally, they are sintered at a high temperature, about 750ï¿½C, to eliminate the graphite-like substances. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation of the remaining substances revealed the separation of carbon nanotubes that contained almost no impurities.
