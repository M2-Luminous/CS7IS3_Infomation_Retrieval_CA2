The 31 December independent Lisbon weekly EXPRESSO published the results of an EXPRESS-Euroexpansao poll conducted between 21 and 27 December 1993 among a nationally representative sample of 481 individuals. Results showed that respondents are pessimistic about the country's economic future. When asked whether their standard of living will improve, remain the same, or worsen in 1994, 33 percent of the respondents thought it would deteriorate, 38 percent that it would remain the same and only 21 percent felt it would improve. Similarly, 79 percent thought unemployment would worsen in 1994, compared to 14 percent who believed it would not increase. Concerning the government's assertion that inflation will hover around 5 percent, 70 percent said it would be higher, 15 percent agreed with the government, and 6 percent said it would be below 5 percent. Some 82 percent thought that there would be a crisis in both the industrial and agricultural sectors, 3 percent thought it would occur only in the agricultural sector, with 1 percent picking only the industrial field; 5 percent said that neither sector would be affected. Finally, when asked whether the economy will increase at a higher or lower rate than in other European Union countries, 36 percent thought it would increase at a lower rate, 29 percent at the same rate, and 24 percent said it would increase at a higher rate. The 1 January Lisbon daily DIARIO DE NOTICIAS published the results of a NORMA-Gallup poll conducted nationwide among 7,609 individuals over 15 (no further details), which showed that 43 percent of the respondents thought 1994 will be worse than 1993, compared to 18 percent who believed in an improvement. While younger respondents between 15 and 24 were almost equally divided between pessimists and optimists (33 percent versus 31 percent), only 12 percent of respondents over 55 believed in better days to come, with 46 percent affirming the opposite.
