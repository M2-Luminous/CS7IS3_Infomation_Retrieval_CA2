S. Nekrasov, V. N. Prokopov, Kursk Polytechnical Institute; UDC 621.391.82] [Abstract] A system for autocorrelation processing of random pulsed signals is examined, and its fundamental probability characteristic is obtained. It is demonstrated that if some limited a priory information on the structure of random pulsed input signals is available, the estimates of their initial periods can be obtained by applying autocorrelation processing, while a high level of noise rejection of mutual interferences is provided. A block diagram of the system containing n parallel connected processing channels is provided, and the probabilities of correct determination of the channel number, probabilities of the signal transmission, and of false alarm were analyzed. The following conclusions were formulated: for a specified ratio f[.sub]i+1[/]/f[.sub]i[/] there exists an optimal threshold value K, where the probability P[.sub]i[/] of correct determination of the channel number is maximum, and the probability P[.sub]false alarm[/] is minimum; with increased ratio f[.sub]i+1[/]/f[.sub]i[/], when K is specified, the probability P[.sub]false alarm[/] is reduced; the increased ratio f[.sub]i+1[/]/f[.sub]i[/] may lower the threshold K, and as a consequence, increase P[.sub]i[/] for a specified P[.sub]false alarm[/].
