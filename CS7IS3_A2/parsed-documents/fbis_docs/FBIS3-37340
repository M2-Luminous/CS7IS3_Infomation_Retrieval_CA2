A draw seems to be the most likely outcome of the first round of the strike. Right until the last moment the republic authorities did everything they could to slow the strike movement down somewhat. The day before several people who distributed pro-strike leaflets were arrested by the militia. Printing of SVABODA, one of the largest democratic newspapers, was wrecked thanks to an anonymous phone call. The telephones and the heating have been cut off at the republic strike committee building itself, so strike committee representatives lack complete information at present as to what is happening on the ground. They know that some workers at Soligorsk's no. 3 mine have joined in the strike. The management of that enterprise is threatening to count strike days as absenteeism. The strike committee members consider that a reliable picture of what is happening will become clear as evening approaches, but meanwhile they could be receiving both accurate information and disinformation. Your IZVESTIYA correspondent visited several enterprises in the Belarusian capital in the morning, including notably Belvar and Tranzistor, which are the most explosive centers. But so far those plants are working as normal. They began paying out wages at Belvar at 0800 hours. By 1100 hours around 5,000 people were gathered on Minsk's main square in front of the parliament building. These included representatives of the wheeled truck tractor, automated production line, and other Minsk plants. The demonstrators were kept back from the government residence by a cordon of militiamen. A rally began at which strike committee leaders and people's deputies of the Republic of Belarus spoke. "I think that everything has begun better than could have been expected," Sergey Naumchik, one of the parliamentary opposition leaders, told your correspondent. "Those already gathered in the square and demanding the resignation of the government and the Supreme Council will be joined by others. I think that the strike will be wave-like in nature: It can fall and then rise. At any rate, the main events are due in the spring." The strike committee members who spoke in the square hold roughly the same opinion. According to them, the strike is conceived as a permanent process. They think that from today the strike movement will be in the ascendant. At the same time statements about either the success or the failure of the strike seem somewhat optimistic. On the one hand, the majority has not joined in the action so far. Thus one could say that the strike committee's efforts as of midday 15th February have not yielded great results. But the nonaligned majority has not demonstrated support for the government either but has merely exploited the situation to extract the maximum material benefit out of it in the form, for example, of wages, which many had not received for two to three months. The government's carrot-proferring tactics are undoubtedly good, but, given that the stocks of those carrots are nearing their end, it is not clear what will restrain the workers next time. The strike committees have also shouldered a burden in this situation which they will scarcely be able to deal with: It will be virtually impossible to motivate people who are in the main politically apathetic by means of purely political demands.
