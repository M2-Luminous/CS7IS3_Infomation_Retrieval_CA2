FR941007-0-00052 FR941007-0-00014 EPA reviewed DEQ's application, and made an immediate final decision that DEQ's hazardous waste program revision satisfies all of the requirements necessary to qualify for Final Authorization. Consequently, EPA intends to grant Final Authorization for the additional program modifications to Oklahoma. The public may submit written comments on EPA's final decision until November 21, 1994. Copies of Oklahoma's application for program revision are available for inspection and copying at the locations indicated in the ADDRESSES section of this notice. Approval of DEQ's program revision shall become effective 75 days from the date this notice is published, unless an adverse written comment pertaining to the State's revision discussed in this notice is received by the end of the comment period. If an adverse written comment is received, EPA will publish either: (1) A withdrawal of the immediate final decision; or (2) a notice containing a response to the comment that either affirms that the immediate final decision takes effect or reverses the decision.
