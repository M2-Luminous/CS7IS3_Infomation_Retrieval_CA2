Edouard Balladur came to power planning to deregulate the economy and reduce the burden of compulsory contributions, but he has had to bow to the fact that the economic problems were more serious than expected. He has not been able to avoid falling into a quarrel that has been going on in France for more than 10 years: After granting a number of cost reductions to enterprises, the government says it expects a resumption in hiring. That has not happened. Since last week, the misunderstanding has grown even worse, relating both to conditions that could be imposed on the reimbursement of VAT and the incentive regulation to create jobs in a number of service activities. This policy, which is, to say the least, voluntary, has the gift of annoying enterprise chiefs. Of course, the CNPF [National Council of French Employers] is taking care not to show its disappointment too abruptly, but dissatisfaction is growing in the ranks. What are the employers saying in private? First, that the government seems to have run out of imagination in the sphere of economic policy, without having obtained any notable result. Domestic demand is still lifeless. And yet its recovery is the vital precondition for a resumption in investment and employment. "We cannot see any driving force likely to revive the economic machinery rapidly," the CNPF economists say. The second main criticism the employers are making of the government is linked with the state's spending rate: It is tending to increase. "The size of the noncommercial economy in France is becoming untenable," the boss of a large private industrial group said. Without a reduction in contributions, there is no reduction in the cost of labor, and hence there is a need to resort to job cuts to remain in world competition. This is the scenario large French employers say they are "experiencing." "The economy is no longer in a position to tolerate social security contributions, which continue to increase by 6 to 7 percent each year, whereas resources are increasing by 1 to 2 percent," the latest CNPF bulletin states. There is, therefore, a risk of the government losing credibility in employers' circles. The electoral consequences of this would be nonexistent or almost nonexistent. However, 10 months after being carried to power by this country's economic leaders, this is certainly not something Edouard Balladur expected.
