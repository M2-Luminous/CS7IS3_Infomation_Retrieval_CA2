It's of course the tusk of the old Indlovu, which is elephant, in Zulu. To get back to what we are actually supposed to be talking about, we had a talk to Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] leader a short while ago and we asked him about his impressions after this election and he said he had some anxieties about the few days ahead. [Begin Buthelezi recording] ...I think the latter. I'm very anxious. I mean if I look at what has happened, you know, during the elections in some...[pauses] with irregularities that have taken place, now in my mind I sort of wonder whether -- are you going to have any of that, any things that are hanky panky when it comes to counting and so on of the elections. So I've got that anxiety about it because of what has happened during elections in some parts of KwaZulu. I'm not implying that it happened everywhere. [end recording] [Alfonso] Well the IFP leader there called it hanky panky, but there's no doubt that there has been some disorganized action here in the KwaZulu-Natal region, especially in these rural parts. This morning, of course, they had to move the ballot boxes from Ulundi to Nongoma because of possible political irregularities which some parties had raised with the IEC [Independent Electoral Commission]. The boxes were moved, but once they got to Nongoma they were also delivered at the wrong venue and only about 30 minutes ago they actually started counting at the correct venue in Nongoma, where the IEC officials are overseeing the whole process. We are not entirely sure exactly when the totals will come out, but what we do know is that the district electoral officer, Mrs. Crystal Williams, has told us that it might even take up to tomorrow evening. And on another possible point of interest, we've heard that the IFP leader, Mr. Buthelezi, has been told either by his office staff or possibly a medical opinion, to take a rest and he is sitting out at his home in Mahlabatini and having a look, of course, at what is possibly the outcome on the channel where it happens.
