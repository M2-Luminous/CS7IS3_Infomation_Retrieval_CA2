FBIS4-33344 "drlat108_m_94006" FBIS-LAT-94-108 Daily Report 3 Jun 1994 Brazil Lula Denies Party Links to Landless People's Movement Lula Denies Party Links to Landless People's Movement PY0406004494 Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 3 Jun 94 p A11 PY0406004494 Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO Portuguese BFN [Text] PT [Workers Party] presidential candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva yesterday denied any links between his party and the Landless People's Movement (MST). "I don't believe in that," Lula said while on a Brasilia-Sao Paulo flight, on his way back from a Citizens' Caravan tour of Brasilia satellite towns. "I have no information on the PT being engaged in organizing the movement." "People have no land because they have no government," he said. Lula emphasized he knows people in the landless movement, and knows they like to be independent. "They are even sectarian," he noted, adding he does not believe they would tolerate anyone's leadership. Sole Workers Center (CUT) President Vicente Paulo da Silva, aka Vicentinho, yesterday labelled "terrorist" a Strategic Affairs Secretariat (SAE) report on the MST. "To me it's an anti-Lula report," he said. "I do not believe a bit of what it says, and I will go to the places where the intelligence service has spotted guerrilla bases to prove that this is not true," he added. Solidarity According to Vicentinho, the MST and the CUT are "on good terms." "We feel solidarity for the movement, but the MST is an independent organization," he added. "The Metalworkers' Union of the Sao Paulo industrial belt has already helped the MST camps by sending them food, but the communities of the areas near the occupied zones have also provided them food and medicines." Vicentinho believes the MST has no armed structure. "I believe they are even pacifist," he said, "because they are just fighting for a piece of land and for the right to live." Vicentinho also denied charges of MST radicalism. "Saying that the MST is a leftist movement is very different from saying what the SAE report said." Doubts Acting National Confederation of Farmworkers (Contag) President Aloisio Carneiro also cast doubts on the report. "The MST is an independent organization and has nothing to do with Contag," he said, adding that "all the same I do not believe in the SAE report." Carneiro said that MST and Contag are also on good terms. "Like the MST, our congresses chose occupation as a method for action," he said. "It is a form of pressuring the government to implement land reform."
