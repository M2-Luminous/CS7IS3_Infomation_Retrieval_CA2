FBIS4-56349 "drlat085_a_94005" FBIS-LAT-94-085 Daily Report 2 May 1994 CARIBBEAN Cuba ANPP Special Session Continues in Havana ANPP Special Session Continues in Havana `Drastic' Economic Program Adopted PA0205231094 Hamburg DPA in Spanish 2127 GMT 2 May 94 PA0205231094 Hamburg DPA Spanish BFN [Text] Havana, 2 May (DPA) -- The Cuban Government today received a green light from the National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP] to implement a drastic economic adjustment program that includes an increase in prices and tariffs on various products and services, the introduction of a graduated tax system, and an eventual exchange of currency. The decision was made after two days of debates at the ANPP, which was convoked exclusively to analyze the fiscal deficit and the excess of money in circulation, problems which worsened dramatically after the collapse of Cuba's trade with its partners in the extinct socialist bloc. Jose Luis Rodriguez, finance and prices minister, announced that the measures will be gradually applied in no less than 180 days. The 600 parliamentary members unanimously approved the resolution in the presence of President Fidel Castro Ruz and also authorized an all-out struggle against black market speculators and hoarders, resorting to "exceptional measures" if necessary. The resolution was drafted as an "agreement" that was read by ANPP President Ricardo Alarcon following a two-day debate during which the participants discussed recommendations from "workers" and from Minister Rodriguez. First the ANPP asked the government to take the necessary measures to reduce subsidies that cover enterprises' losses and other budget expenditures, as well as to increase state revenues and "significantly" reduce the fiscal deficit, calculated to be 4.8 billion pesos (equivalent to a dollar at the official exchange rate) last year. The ANPP also authorized the government to seek the "stability" of funds deposited at the People's Savings Bank (BPA), calculated to be approximately 6 billion pesos, which represents 54 percent of the excess circulating money -- $11.636 million. The resolution stated that the measures adopted to eventually immobilize those funds must be "consistent with the decisions that will have repercussions on the amount of money in circulation" but "must also protect the integrity of the BPA and encourage savings." It also authorized the government to adopt measures to establish "adequate controls" on speculation with foreign currency, which increased noticeably with the recent "legalization" of the dollar, to guarantee "fulfillment of the goals for which it was authorized and which correspond to the measures adopted to put internal finances on a sound basis." Referring to prices and tariffs for products and services, the ANPP asked the government to "assess" an increase for "selected products and services," particularly those "not considered staples," including cigarettes and alcoholic beverages, and tariffs on certain services, such as restaurants, transportation, electricity, and water. The resolution did not mention gasoline and lubricants, although it is assumed that their prices will be increased as suggested by Minister Rodriguez. In another part of the agreement, the ANPP authorized the government to "gradually" implement a "new overall tax system," the enforcement of which takes into consideration "essential elements of social justice" to protect the sectors with the lowest income and to encourage work and production. The document specifically suggested considering the "selective introduction" of an income tax, excluding salaries and real estate. Although authorities said the measures will not affect the goals achieved in the education and health sector, the ANPP suggested the implementation of a "contribution" from the workers to finance social security. Regarding an eventual exchange of currency, mentioned by Minister Rodriguez as a probable weapon in the "arsenal" of measures to counter the fiscal deficit and the excess of circulating money, the ANPP recommended "examining the advisability" of its implementation as "an element to complement other measures and to be enforced when the time is right." The legislative branch virtually gave Fidel Castro's Government carte blanche by authorizing it to adopt other measures that, in its opinion, are considered "adequate and efficient" to put national finances on a sound basis. When the announcement was made the legislators said the actions to be carried out by the government, and which Castro personally considered difficult "require the understanding and support of our people" to "progressively overcome the current circumstances."
