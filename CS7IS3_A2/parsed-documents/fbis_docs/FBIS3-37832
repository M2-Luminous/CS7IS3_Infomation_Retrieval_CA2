Adamishin pointed out that the pull-out of heavy artillery and other arms from Sarajevo by Serbs and Muslims means "a serious breakthrough reached by political means." "Now it is important to fasten this initial success," he said. In Adamishin's words, Russia has a concrete program for further actions. "It provides for final demilitarization of Sarajevo. It can be fixed by the transfer of the city to UN interim administration as was foreseen almost in all the plans for a settlement," he said. "Solution of several other painful problems in Bosnia, minding the lessons of the Sarajevo crisis, can become the second step," said Adamishin. He emphasized that he does not view the course for "further ultimatums as a very productive one." "The events around Sarajevo demonstrated that the line of a political settlement of the conflict, being pursued by Russia gives the best results. But one should not be sure that all kinds of ultimatums won't appear every now and then and that Russia will be able to pull the situation away from a dead alley, this will not result in any settlement," he underlined. Adamishin expressed his dissatisfaction with the version being spread now, that "the Serbs had to go along with the NATO ultimatum one way or another and that Russia only saved their image (face), by asking that they fulfilled not NATO's ultimatum but request. Events could have taken another turn and this could have led to unexpected consequences," he pointed out. INTERFAX's interlocutor believes that such a method as "shout and everything will be done" is not the most efficient one in diplomacy. "It does not mean that Russia rejects utilization of force once and for all. Moscow has agreed that the NATO forces in the former Yugoslavia can defend themselves in case of an attack against them. There are Russian servicemen in the composition of these forces and we cannot leave them armless in this sense. The thing is that such decisions should be taken cautiously and only along one possible line, namely via the UN Security Council," he said. Adamishin spoke in favor of continuation of talks between three confronting Bosnian parties. "This is necessary in order to solve the Bosnian conflict in complex, though its solution has been already reached. But after that Muslims took a step back as they believed that they can reach more at the battlefield than at the negotiation table, said Adamishin. But as we speak about a final political settlement, Russia does not rule out that there can be introduced small and final corrections into the plan proposed by Lord Owen and Thorwald Stoltenberg, co-chairmen of the international conference on settlement in the former Yugoslavia." As the Bosnian crisis has demonstrated, Adamishin said, the West should study "a new science of cooperation more but not less than Russia." In his opinion, Russia and the West will "experience periods of definite complications because they are getting accustomed to the interests of each other." Adamishin said that Russia believes that "inevitable difference in interests should be regulated by political means, by means of discussion and partnership." "If we are pushed from such a way to look for a common denominator in the sphere of mutual interests then we shall be forced to search for other methods to defend our interests. As a matter of fact, interests will no disappear. The West is to take them into consideration this way or other," noted Adamishin. He also emphasized that "cooperation with Russia will bring greater results for conflicts' solution and establishing European security than recurrences of confrontation with Moscow reminding of "cold war."
