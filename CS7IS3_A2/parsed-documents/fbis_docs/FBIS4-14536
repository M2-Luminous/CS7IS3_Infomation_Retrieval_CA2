Every year there are about 4,000 conscripts in Estonia and they are called to join the Army twice a year, in spring and in autumn. Less than three thousand conscripts serve in the Estonian Defence Forces, the rest being professionals, volunteers, etc. Only Estonian citizens that have become 19 years old can be conscribed to military service. Reiman said that a major problem is constituted by men who have Estonian citizenship, but whose knowledge of Estonian is poor or who do not speak Estonian at all. He added that these people amounted to 10-15 per cent of the defence forces, the largest number of them in Viru and Kalevi battalions that are located at the north-eastern predominantly Russian-speaking region. Head of the Kalev battalion Alar Laneman admitted that Russians were mostly good soldiers and the authorities have tried to distribute them to the units so that they would be forced to speak Estonian to learn the language.
