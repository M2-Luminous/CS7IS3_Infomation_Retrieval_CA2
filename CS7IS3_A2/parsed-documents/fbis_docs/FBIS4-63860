At the same time, the National- Democratic Party [NDP] adheres to a different position: the holding of early elections. According to the party's leader, Giorgi Chanturia, this already means their accession to power. [Chanturia] The NDP has been ready to assume power for a long time now. There exists only one way of achieving this aim -- elections. However, there is another reason for making this demand: One cannot go on living in such a way. Dilettantism has destroyed Georgia; Parliament does not resemble a parliament. Naturally, the present authorities and their criminal policies are the result of its activities. Yet, in the final analysis, everything leads us to the electorate: Parliament is composed of members chosen by the people. It is possible to make a mistake once, twice, three times, but, in the end, we should make sure the following French saying does not apply to us: The people have the government that they deserve. Opponents are demanding the guarantee of a better choice. However, such a thing does not exist. This Parliament, in spite of its failings, is better than the former Supreme Council. Early elections will at once spare us many possible misfortunes. For example, military actions, events resembling a palace coup, and innumerable other processes. No matter how many Monday interviews [reference to Shevardnadze's weekly radio interview] and captivating smiles we give, this will not bring any results. In spite of their differing views, the people are fed up with hearing only that we have overcome provincial fascism; surely we should be doing other basic things. However, it is wholly impermissible that Eduard Shevardnadze should resign before the holding of early elections as he will be replaced by that force that is oriented toward Russia and has a lot of weapons and money. Of course, such authorities will hold unfair elections and we will be needed only to embellish the facade. In this case, of course, we will boycott the elections. [DRONI] Does this mean that, if the elections are conducted according to the "rules" of another country or if there are any military actions, the NDP will adhere to a certain neutral position? [Chanturia] When the game is lost, we always remain silent. When executive power was recently being ratified anew, the majority and minority were summoned and told that, if the government should fall, Parliament would be dissolved. Of course, we did not determine our position as this would have been in vain. At the same time, we did not vote for the government. People often talk about the transformation of the NDP and its change of position, something which has never happened. For example, the severing of relations between us and Shevardnadze came about due to a difference of opinion on several issues. As soon as he moved into the Russophile camp, our ways parted. [DRONI] If a common position is found, do you think it will again be possible to cooperate with Eduard Shevardnadze? [Chanturia] Naturally, if he conducts the right policies, we will support him. However, we will not help anyone to promote a Russian policy. I believe that, in spite of Georgia's membership in the CIS, Eduard Shevardnadze does not hold a pro-Russian stance today. Simply, he did not have enough power: The easier it is to free oneself from ideology, the more difficult it is to escape a way of life. Shevardnadze believed that it was possible to construct the country without any kind of team and by giving priority to foreign policy and on the basis of his own authority. As can be seen, this has not happened. Reforms have also not been carried out and the country has been taken over by criminal bands and corruption. However, I believe that all possibilities have not yet been exhausted. There are fairly powerful pro-Russian forces in Georgia; for example, [Parliament Speaker] Goguadze and [Socio-Democratic Party Chairman] Muchaidze are struggling against Shevardnadze for the reason stated publicly and with typical naivete by [ex-Defense Minister] Kitovani: Shevardnadze is not trusted in Russia. Incidentally, Muchaidze also said the same thing. Such a statement is a criminal offense: To demand the resignation of one's own government because it does not meet with the approval of a neighboring state. We have another wing as well; I have in mind the Liberal-Conservative coalition that apparently criticizes the head of state for being a Russophile, but believes that Georgia was too late in joining the CIS. A game is also being played here. Our politicians have acquired a simple understanding of the Russian factor and have formed queues in the waiting rooms of various special services in Moscow. Frankly speaking, these are agents, and specific measures have to be taken against them. [DRONI] Realistically speaking, to what extent was it possible to change executive power? In this regard, the general secretary of the Union of Georgia's Citizens [Zurab Zhvania] stated that not only their union but also other political forces were not ready for this change. [Chanturia] In our time, we even proposed to the authorities the composition of a coalition government and gave this list to Zurab Zhvania. However, for some reason, changes were made to it before it was disseminated and the head of state did not react to this in any way. The interests of both the majority and minority were protected in this proposal and, most importantly, a completely different mentality was taken into account. [DRONI] Don't you think that the total failure to form an opposition played a specific role in the ratification of the old government? [Chanturia] We were actually the initiators of a meeting of parties following Georgia's entry into the CIS, but several of them took such steps that there was no longer any sense even in holding consultations. I am surprised that the [Union of] Traditionalists agreed to Basilia [one of its members] becoming deputy prime minister, especially as they know very well that he can do nothing in those conditions when there is no unified team. This, in the final analysis, will bring the Traditionalists nothing but discredit. [DRONI] The view exists that Basilia's candidacy apparently was a unifying force in the matter of ratifying the government. [Chanturia] Of course. I do not exclude the existence of this factor, but everything was much simpler: It was a matter of Traditionalist votes. [DRONI] In your view, apart from the NDP, what other political force has the ability to govern the state? [Chanturia] Unfortunately, I cannot see any such serious force. I have great respect for the Republicans, but they represent more an intellectual association than a party. In this respect, the Traditionalists are closer to being a party but they are also deficient in many things. The NDP, without belonging to any coalition, is able to form a government; this team has been in existence for a long time; moreover, we also have smaller teams. Incidentally, we viewed the Union of Georgia's Citizens with great hope; we thought it could have been a worthy opponent, but it has taken the form of neither a party nor an organization. [DRONI] If the authorities decide to hold early elections, these will not take place before the fall. It is possible for the Union of Citizens to form itself into a realistic if not dominant force before then. [Chanturia] They have been unable to create structures in any region that are better than ours. The fact that they have automatically transformed gamgeobebi [local administrative boards] into regional organizations of the Union of Citizens indicates an antistructural trend, which was the undoing of the Popular Front, the Rustaveli Society, and all such mass organizations that were created on a tidal wave. [DRONI] In our country, a politician's actions are for some reason assessed by the display of positive or negative feelings toward him. You stated at a conference that, in order to satisfy such feelings, the nation needed a fatherly figure and you said that the best example would be a monarchy. If your party wins the elections, will this institution be introduced? [Chanturia] Of course, the best variant would be to have a king, although we are neither republicans nor monarchists. I believe that it is altogether too early to speak about the state system at the moment as these issues are dependent upon the regulation of the Abkhazian and Samachablo [South Ossetia] problems; that is to say, the state is dependent upon external factors. [DRONI] If the current authorities assume responsibility for the prevailing socioeconomic situation and the temporary loss of Abkhazia, don't you think that the future new authorities will be freed of such a "burden?" [Chanturia] It is impossible to relieve oneself of responsibility regarding the Abkhazian question. If the old government assumes responsibility for its loss, the problem of its return is the prerogative of the new government. However, in the socioeconomic sphere, our task will be somewhat lighter. The standard of living today is at such a low level that it cannot drop any further. This creates a fine background against which to conduct reforms. [DRONI] Kalbatoni [Georgian polite form of address] Irina Sarishvili [Chanturia's wife, leader of the NDP faction in Parliament, former deputy prime minister] has already given an assessment of that act that occurred in Parliament [on 28 April, deputy speaker Rcheulishvili, after being insulted by Popular Front chairman Nodar Natadze, retaliated by splashing a glass of mineral water in his face]. Do you think that a crisis in Parliament has begun or do you view this as one negative event in the life of Parliament? [Chanturia] Naturally, it is very difficult not to excuse Rcheulishvili from the human point of view. When you are insulted in this way, you can quite easily pour Borzhomi [mineral water] over the person and, moreover, hit him over the head with the bottle. At the same time, it is very difficult to argue against Natadze when his microphone is constantly being switched off and when he is being called an idiot or imbecile. Quite simply, we are all human beings who, on occasions, are capable of losing our tempers. However, we should not view this as one normal tense day in the work of Parliament; it is a sign of the crisis that has already begun. [DRONI] If the NDP takes part in the future elections, what will Giorgi Chanturia personally do? [Chanturia] Basically all those problems that were the reason for my not participating in the last elections have been removed. In particular, all party structures have been formed, which will give powerful assistance to [our] faction. Other party leaders have come to the fore, whereas my presence in Parliament would have delayed this process. Third, my position as a deputy would have resulted in our party losing political points. Given that a battle for survival is being waged today, I have no right to lock myself up in Diogenes' barrel. [DRONI] However, will Giorgi Chanturia be satisfied with being just a deputy? [Chanturia] If the party achieves complete victory, that hierarchy that exists in the party will be transferred to the state structure.
