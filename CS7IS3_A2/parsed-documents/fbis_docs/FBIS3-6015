The sources said Ozawa is tentatively set to arrive in Washington on March 21. Ozawa has a reputation for political savvy and has won admirers on Capitol Hill. He indicated his intention to visit Washington following the breakdown of trade talks last month that soured Japan's economic relationship with its U.S. ally. Japanese diplomatic sources said the itinerary of Ozawa's trip has yet to be finalized. Ozawa will probably stay in the U.S. for one week from March 21, meeting congressional leaders and officials in the Clinton administration. A meeting with President Bill Clinton is also a possibility, the sources said. One certainty in Ozawa's trip is a speech to be delivered at the National Press Club in Washington on March 23, the sources said. Ozawa is secretary general of Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), one of the seven parties that form the Hosokawa coalition government but he occupies no formal government position. There has been speculation in Tokyo that Ozawa may come to Washington as Hosokawa's special envoy but Japanese diplomatic sources say they are unaware of any such decision. The Japanese Government plans to unveil a package of market- opening measures by the end of this month and U.S. officials have said Washington is keeping a close watch on its contents. Trade talks between the U.S. and Japan broke down on February 11 after the Japanese Government rejected U.S. demands to set numerical indicators to measure progress in Japanese imports. Ozawa raised expectations in Washington of a possible change of heart in Tokyo with a suggestion that Japan may accept voluntary targets he characterized as "endeavor indicators" so long as the U.S. does not take them as binding commitments. House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt has expressed interest in the proposal, telling reporters Thursday he is "absolutely" comfortable with Ozawa's idea. Gephardt, who is expected to meet Ozawa, also paid him a glowing tribute, saying he has found no political leader in Japan "more forthcoming" than Ozawa. Ozawa, who wrote a best-seller calling for a restructuring of the Japanese political and economic system, also has an admirer in U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, who is fond of quoting a passage in Ozawa's book encouraging the Japanese to behave like a "normal country."
