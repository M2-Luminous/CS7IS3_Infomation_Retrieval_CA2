Minister Hofbauer had not consulted this step with him, and he personally learned about it only from the press. According to Roman Kovac, the Slovak Government has for some time had objections to the legal purity of the contract with the RFE, as well as to the nature of its broadcasts. "We do have serious reservations about the very small number of listeners of this radio station, which uses one of the best radio frequencies, reaching practically into Slovakia's every village," Roman Kovac stressed. He does not perceive this decision as a matter that would interfere with the plurality of views, but he believes that it is not good to resort to such a sharp step without previous consultations. However, he did not rule out that, following the reassessment of all of the aspects, the final verdict could be similar to that pronounced by Roman Hofbauer.
