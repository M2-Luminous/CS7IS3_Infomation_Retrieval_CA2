Sayyed Munawwar Hussein, secretary general of Jamaat-i-Islami, stated this in a meeting here today. He said that our rulers ignore the problems faced by our people just to make the United States happy. This way these rulers are used to keep the people away from Islamic movements. There is a spread baseless propaganda against these movements. Movements to help establish Islamic identity are accused of terrorism and fundamentalism. While commenting on the international situation, he said that the United States has recognized its target. It considers Islam a danger to it. Secularism cannot tolerate Muslims, and secularism, be it Western or Eastern, commits atrocities against the people. Its proof is the abominations committed day and night against the Muslims in Bosnia. About Afghanistan, he said that pro-Soviet intellectuals had advised us that this issue should be taken care of through negotiations with the Soviet Union. However, the Afghans not only embarrassed it in Afghanistan but in the whole world. It proved that the only superpower there is Allah who can make one great or little. All honors and humiliations are in His hands. Commenting on the new world order, he said the United States wants to do whatever it desires and no one should question it. That is why it makes all these plans, and that is why it sent its armed forces to Somalia. However, when its troops were being killed, it announce their recall and thus Allah made its plans fail. Those who say that Islam could not be implemented with jihad in Afghanistan and with democracy in Algeria should know that the world is changing now. The Kashmiri people are offering their lives and the Muslims in Palestine and Bosnia are bravely standing against kafirs. The Islamic laws have been implemented in Sudan and there is new awakening in Malaysia. All these point to the bright future of Islam. Hafiz Mohammed Idris, leader of the Jamaat-i Islami of Punjab; Mian Maqsud Ahmed, secretary general; and Chowdhery MPA [Member of Provincial Assembly] also addressed the meeting.
