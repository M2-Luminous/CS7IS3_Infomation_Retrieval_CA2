Microscopic observations were conducted on prosenchymal cells taken from areas near the central vascular fiber sheaf of Vallisneria leaves exposed to water samples fr 1-1.5 hours at 20�-24�C, using the chloroplasts as markers of protoplasm movement. Weak toxicity elicited 20%-50% decreases in movement or 20%-80% increases. Moderate toxicity caused decreases of 50%-80% or increases of 80%-150%. Severe toxicity was seen at decreases of 80%- 90% and increases of 150%-200%. Decreases of more than 90% and increases of more than 200% were lethal. Severe and lethal toxicity was accompanied by observable structural changes in the cells. Samples taken from the Dunay River in 1988 gave varying results, from 311% to 0. The stimulatory effects seen in the upper portions of the river were due to the presence of phosphates in the water. Tests conducted in 1991 on the Dneper Reservoir did not demonstrate any severe or lethal toxicity. Weak or moderate toxicity was characteristic of the bottom layers of dam head races, as well as various inlets small river mouths. Method response was determined as a function of the concentrations of Mn, Cu, Zn, and Ni. The data obtained demonstrate the suitability of the method for evaluating the quality of natural and waste water, as well as for screening new biologically-actve compounds.
