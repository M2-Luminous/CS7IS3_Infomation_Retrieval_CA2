FR940916-0-00071 FR940916-0-00018 9. Section 29.923 is amended by revising paragraphs (a) introductory text and (b)(1); and by adding paragraph (b)(3) to read as follows: §29.923 Rotor drive system and control mechanism tests. (a) Endurance tests, general. Each rotor drive system and rotor control mechanism must be tested, as prescribed in paragraphs (b) through (n) of this section, for at least 200 hours plus the time required to meet the requirements of paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), and (k) of this section. These tests must be conducted as follows: * * * * * (b) *␣*␣* (1) Except as prescribed in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section, the takeoff torque run must consist of 1 hour of alternate runs of 5 minutes at takeoff torque and the maximum speed for use with takeoff torque, and 5 minutes at as low an engine idle speed as practicable. The engine must be declutched from the rotor drive system, and the rotor brake, if furnished and so intended, must be applied during the first minute of the idle run. During the remaining 4 minutes of the idle run, the clutch must be engaged so that the engine drives the rotors at the minimum practical r.p.m. The engine and the rotor drive system must be accelerated at the maximum rate. When declutching the engine, it must be decelerated rapidly enough to allow the operation of the overrunning clutch. * * * * * (3) For multiengine, turbine-powered rotorcraft for which the use of 30-second/2-minute OEI power is requested, the takeoff run must be conducted as prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section except for the following: (i) Immediately following any one 5-minute power-on run required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section, each power source must simulate a failure, in turn, and apply the maximum torque and the maximum speed for use with 30-second OEI power to the remaining affected drive system power inputs for not less than 30 seconds, followed by application of the maximum torque and the maximum speed for use with 2-minute OEI power for not less than 2 minutes. At least one run sequence must be conducted from a simulated ``flight idle'' condition. When conducted on a bench test, the test sequence must be conducted following stabilization at takeoff power. (ii) For the purpose of this paragraph, an affected power input includes all parts of the rotor drive system which can be adversely affected by the application of higher or asymmetric torque and speed prescribed by the test. (iii) This test may be conducted on a representative bench test facility when engine limitations either preclude repeated use of this power or would result in premature engine removals during the test. The loads, the vibration frequency, and the methods of application to the affected rotor drive system components must be representative of rotorcraft conditions. Test components must be those used to show compliance with the remainder of this section. * * * * * 10. Section 29.1143 is amended by adding paragraph (f) to read as follows: §29.1143 Engine controls. * * * * * (f) For rotorcraft to be certificated for a 30-second OEI power rating, a means must be provided to automatically activate and control the 30-second OEI power and prevent any engine from exceeding the installed engine limits associated with the 30-second OEI power rating approved for the rotorcraft. 11. Section 29.1305 is amended by adding paragraphs (a)(24) and (25) to read as follows: §29.1305 Powerplant instruments. * * * * * (a) *␣*␣* (24) For rotorcraft for which a 30-second/2-minute OEI power rating is requested, a means must be provided to alert the pilot when the engine is at the 30-second and 2-minute OEI power levels, when the event begins, and when the time interval expires. (25) For each turbine engine utilizing 30-second/2-minute OEI power, a device or system must be provided for use by ground personnel which_ (i) Automatically records each usage and duration of power at the 30-second and 2-minute OEI levels; (ii) Permits retrieval of the recorded data; (iii) Can be reset only by ground maintenance personnel; and (iv) Has a means to verify proper operation of the system or device. * * * * * 12. Section 29.1521 is amended by adding paragraphs (i) and (j) to read as follows:
