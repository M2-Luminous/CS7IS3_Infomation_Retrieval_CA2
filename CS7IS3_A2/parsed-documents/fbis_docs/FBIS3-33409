In addition, he noted his concern that those weapons will fuel crime and international gunrunning. "We continue to insist the government has not given a satisfactory explanation of the weapons, thousands of rifles and other war material, it seized from the FMLN, which the Army has not shown nor have they allowed the government to have some control over the number of weapons," Roca indicated. Regarding FMLN concerns, he said "for us, that is very dangerous because we have learned that weapons of that kind were found in Chiapas. Weapons that the Army reported capturing from the FMLN have turned up elsewhere. We are concerned that those weapons are serving to fuel gunrunning in the region." [passage omitted] Roca affirmed international institutions share the FMLN concerns. "We have talked at length with different government representatives. We insist, however, that the Salvadoran Government, in a stubborn manner that does not contribute to peace, is refusing to allow an inspection of those weapons." FMLN leaders dismissed reports it supplied weapons to Mexico's Zapatist National Liberation Army. [passage omitted] Roca also denied there are armed groups unhappy with the elections results. Commenting on this matter, he noted that "they can say anything, but the truth has prevailed over any kind of campaign they may conduct along those lines. There are no weighty reasons that can justify the government's speculation. It will be just the opposite because the elections will hand the FMLN a significant share of institutional power, if not the majority, in the political environment, and just about all those who were active during the war and the many thousands who have joined the FMLN now as a political force know that." Roca reiterated that the weapons topic is "simply and plainly a propaganda tactic used to hurt the Front at the polls. In fact, they, the ones who are orchestrating this campaign, know full well that what they are saying is a big lie, but these people are used to conducting campaigns on what they refer to as psychological warfare. They have not given up on that effort, which is regrettable, is it not?"
