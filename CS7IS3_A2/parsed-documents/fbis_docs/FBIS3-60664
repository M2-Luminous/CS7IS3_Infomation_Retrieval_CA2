The US position as of today is that the Pressler Amendment is not going to be removed, only its debilitating effect on the US President's inherent executive powers, may be neutralised through another law. Ms Bhutto, on the other hand, has been saying that her government would keep pressing the US to dismantle the Amendment because being country-specific, it is a bad law. The law, in fact, is not only bad, it is also the only law of its kind in the US legislative history which seeks to penalise a friendly country (also its ally for a long time) and exempt from its application those who have been in the opposite camp and worked against US interests. There being a major moral anomaly involved in the application of this law, Ms Bhutto's plea makes sense. Therefore, on the face of it, there is no meeting point between the US position and that of Pakistan. Yet for all its apparent distance, the question may in its actual thrust may either be of semantics or of political tact. The US Congress, having been fed for a long time by the joint Israel-Indian lobby on the evils of nuclear technology in the hands of an Islamic country, may not be willing to countenance any move which would in effect amount to condoning Pakistan's `misstep'. Paradoxical as it may seem, the pro-Pressler lobby in the US congress believes that while Pakistan's alliance is of value to US strategic interests in that region, as was proved during the war in Afghanistan, it is less reliable than India where nuclear technology is concerned. To disabuse that lobby of this notion and persuade it to treat Pakistan and India at par, may take some time and effort. It could be that the US administration is unwilling to make that effort. It may have thus chosen the less prickly option of seeking for the President the same discretionary powers of waiver in the case of the Pressler Amendment, which he has in the case of most other US laws. On principle, the PM's stance of `no rollback' on the one hand and of protest against a bad US law on the other, is morally right. Whether that would place the US administration in a difficult position vis-a-vis its Congress, is however, another matter. Yet it is obvious that both positions have been forced on the two governments by internal considerations. With the Opposition in Pakistan shouting betrayal, Benazir is obliged to talk openly on a subject which had best been kept confidential and the US administration may have found it necessary to keep the hardliners in the Congress mollified for a similar reason. Looked at from this angle the demand in Pakistan for an open debate on our nuclear policy, may not be in the best interest of the country. An in-camera debate would be far better, if at all it is unavoidable.
