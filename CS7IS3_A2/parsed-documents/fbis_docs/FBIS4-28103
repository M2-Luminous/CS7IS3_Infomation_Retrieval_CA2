The passage of the bill at the lower house plenary session followed approval of the fiscal budget for the year that started in April by the Budget Committee of the lower house. The ruling coalition, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and new party Sakigake [Harbinger] voted for the bill, which was immediately sent to the House of Councillors. Since the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the largest opposition bloc, plans no filibuster in the upper house, the budget is expected to become law in late June. Diet debate on the budget, which was submitted to parliament on March 4, has been delayed due to a political squabble over former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's dubious financial deals in the past. Hosokawa stepped down in April amid the turmoil. The budget bill remained shelved for 80 days in the lower house Budget Committee before it was approved after 13 days of discussion. The nation's full spending plan includes 5.47 trillion yen in cuts in income and residential taxes to stimulate the economy. Despite tight fiscal conditions, expenditures for public works projects were also increased by a brisk 4.0 percent. Public works spending accounts for nearly 9 trillion yen of the 40.85 trillion yen general operating expenditures, the core part of the budget including most outlays other than debt serving costs and tax allocations to local governments. Defense spending, in contrast, was raised by a scant 0.9 percent to 4.68 trillion yen. Government operations in the current fiscal year has been financed by an 11.05 trillion yen stopgap budget that became law on April 1. The temporary budget will be incorporated into the full budget.
