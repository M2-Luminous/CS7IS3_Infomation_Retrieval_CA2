Alatas made the statement at a press conference following a meeting with Philippine President Fidel Ramos' special envoy, Raul Manglapus, who had come to Jakarta to explain Manila's position towards the privately sponsored conference. "We still believe there is a way to solve the issue," Alatas said. He said although the Philippine Government's commitment to its national constitution and freedom of speech was understandable, Indonesia was disappointed that the conference would still take place. He said in Indonesia's view the planned conference was not an academic exercise nor an event to promote democracy. Neither would it be discussing human rights in the Asia-Pacific region in general as its organizers had at the beginning claimed. "It is certainly a political campaign against Indonesia," he stressed. "The name of the conference is Asia-Pacific Conference on East Timor. How could they (the organizers) say that it will deal with human rights or democratization in the region," he said. Alatas said Indonesia was suspecting that Ramos Horta, Cecillia Jimenez, and Renato Constantino -- diehard opponents to East Timor's integration with Indonesia -- were behind the planned conference. "Claiming to be representing some obscure non-governmental organizations, they are trying to make the East Timor issue an Asia- Pacific concern," he said. Alatas warned that both Indonesia's and the Philippines' national interests would be affected if the conference went on as scheduled by its sponsors. Previously, Raul Manglapus had said it was difficult for the Philippine Government to prevent the conference from being held. "The conference is scheduled to be held in one of the universities in Manila. Some universities in my country have a certain autonomy and that's why it is difficult for us to prevent them from staging any academic event," he added. He said the Philippine Government fully supported Indonesia's effort to protect its territorial integrity. "Moreover, we have long-standing bilateral ties and live in the spirit of ASEAN," he said. He said the Philippine Government was determined to take any step necessary to prevent the conference from causing any damage to its ties with Indonesia. When asked whether or not he would visit Indonesia again if his government failed to prevent the holding of the conference, Manglapus said: "It depends on how angry your country is." "But I am hopeful that after this meeting there will be understanding on both sides. And, at least, the Philippine Government will do its best to prevent any damage (to the ties between the two countries)," said the former Philippines foreign minister.
