Reduction of the weight of agriculture in the economy calls for a directed process. The number of workers in agriculture will be declining. Existing problems will continue in agriculture throughout the 1990's, and new problems will develop and expand, including global, economic, social, ecological, and landscape-forming problems. They will impact upon the lives of people in this branch of the economy in adjacent sectors and areas and will even impact on territorial questions. The weight of the extraproduction, extraeconomic significance of agriculture will increase. Stagnation Agriculture will be primarily facing stagnation of food consumption in this country and West Europe. The stagnation of food consumption is the result of both economic and systems causes (for example, a change in the structure of expenditures by the population, temporarily lower real incomes for a significant portion of the population), as well as demographic ones (stability or decline in population numbers, deterioration of the age structure of the population). Exceptions to this stagnation will be the production of fruit, vegetables, and milk in the vicinity of large towns and agglomerations, where good sales opportunities will exist. Czech agriculture will have to deal with foreign competition to a greater extent--competition not only from the West but also from the East (for example, Ukraine). Efforts will increase to sell foodstuffs in our country that are unsalable in the West. This problem will be connected with the competitiveness of Czech exports of industrial commodities and services. The described situation will bring about the necessity for restructuring agricultural production, for limiting areas to be seeded, for changes in the structure of livestock production, etc. Restructuring Limiting cropland areas poses the question as to what is to be done with them. There is the possibility of reforestation, utilization for recreational purposes, agrotourism, energy production, etc. These directions for utilizing and modifying the landscape need not result in adequate economic effects (at least from the medium-range viewpoint); on the contrary, they will be resource-intensive. In the short period of two to four years, land left to lie fallow will be the source of a spread of weeds, will lead to higher costs in plant production and to the necessity of multiplying the use of herbicides and chemicals to care for the land. This will have an influence on the quality of the environment. For many reasons, changes in the landscape that involve complex questions with a number of tie-ins and interconnections can very likely not be left to unrestrained development. Reforestation cannot get by without a certain concept that would coordinate various interests. This process will be impossible without incursion on the part of the state. This is also necessary because this will also involve organizational and coordination tasks. Reforestation will require expenditures that will not result in a return on investment for 60 to 80 years, something that will not be lucrative for entrepreneurial entities. The establishment of water reservoirs, of small and medium-size hydroelectric and wind-driven electric power plants, can bring definite as well as economic results sooner than can be obtained through reforestation, but will be capital-intensive and, in a number of cases, not even hold a promise of average profits. But these will be projects that are socially beneficial and, in many cases, urgently needed. It will be necessary to reach conclusions as to how their realization can be assured (taxes, subsidies, grants, etc.). In a broader and longer-term context, orientation toward nonfood-industry production purposes (for example, the cultivation of biomass for energy purposes) is one of the ways in which agriculture can move. However, this is dependent upon a number of factors (technical factors, technological factors, organizational factors, research, legislative factors, capital resources). Employment In addition to questions having to do with land, it must be anticipated that the number of people active in agriculture will continue to decline. In 1970, the number of workers in agriculture in the Czech Republic amounted to 720,000; in 1980, there were 560,000; in 1990, 491,000; and in the year 2000, the number of agricultural employees could decline significantly below 300,000. (The departure of people from agriculture causes problems involving their placement and requalification.) A similar fate will befall the relatively significant number of people active in the foodstuffs industry, engineering, chemistry, and other branches that tie in with agriculture. It can be rationally anticipated that the standard of living of the population working in agriculture (cooperative farmers, private farmers, or hired help) will, when compared to other groups of the population, deteriorate relatively on the average. The problems in agriculture will influence the entire social situation. Agriculture will be a branch that will be reducing the pace of the national economy as a whole. Stagnation in the consumption of food, the minimizing of consumption on the part of the agricultural population, weakened demand for agricultural machinery, chemical products for agriculture, etc. will all be exerting their influence. There Are Not Only Economic Connections In formulating agricultural policy, it will no longer be possible to ignore the principles of food security and self-sufficiency of the Czech state. In the 1990's, international relations will also be conflicting in character. It is also not possible to exclude the occurrence of natural events or catastrophes, which could prevent the importation of foodstuffs, etc. In formulating the agricultural policy of the state, it is suitable to take into account not only the efficiency of our own agricultural production in comparison with the efficiency of exports of industrial goods necessary to assure the importation of foodstuffs, but also the extraproduction task of agriculture. It is possible that the development of production forces in Czech agriculture could result in greater economic and extraeconomic effects than could be achieved as a result of the above-mentioned export of industrial goods and services in exchange for the importation of foodstuffs. Orientation toward reducing the weight of agriculture in the national economy is a process that should be directed. The formulation of medium-term and long-term agricultural policy must be based on all decisive interconnections and not just on economic factors.
