FR940810-0-00337 FR940810-0-00022 Discussion: The Secretary believes that in the context of these regulatory amendments ``basic and more advanced skills all children are expected to master'' implies that, for Chapter 1 purposes, lower standards may be established for all children. The Secretary believes it is essential that Chapter 1 participants as well as other children be taught challenging subject matter and assessed to determine whether that subject matter has been learned. Changes: None. Comment: One commenter asked whether an LEA could be granted an exception to use a local assessment system or whether an exception could only apply to a State assessment system. The commenter believed the regulations to be unclear in this area. Discussion: The Secretary intends that an SEA may request an exception either for a State assessment system that supports statewide systemic education reform efforts or for an individual LEA that has a local assessment system that supports its local reform efforts. Changes: Sections 200.90(c) and 201.57(c) have been revised to clarify that an SEA may request an exception for an LEA that has an assessment system that supports its local systemic education reform efforts and meets the other standards in the regulations. Comment: One commenter asked whether, if an exception is granted, the alternative assessment measures may be used for determining aggregate performance under the local annual review for program improvement as well as for local evaluation. Discussion: If an exception is granted, the alternative assessment measures may be used for any purposes for which they are appropriate. Changes: None. Comment: One commenter suggested that the definition of desired outcomes in §200.6 be changed or deleted, consistent with the intent of the NPRM. The commenter objected to that portion of the definition linking desired outcomes to aggregate performance and, thus, to scores on norm-referenced tests. The commenter also contended that this definition will frustrate the intent of these final regulations because LEAs would still be required to set their desired outcomes in terms of scores on norm-referenced tests. Discussion: Changing the definition of ``desired outcomes'' in §200.6 is outside the scope of this rulemaking. To make the changes the commenter has suggested would require the Secretary to first publish an additional NPRM. The Secretary does not believe, however, that this definition will frustrate the intent of these final regulations. If a State or LEA is granted an exception to the current national evaluation standards, the alternative assessment may be used for any appropriate purposes, including determining aggregate performance. Thus, if nationally normed tests are not part of the alternative assessment, scores on those tests would not be used to determine aggregate performance or to define desired outcomes. Changes: None. Comment: One commenter recommended that the cross-reference contained in §200.80(a) to §200.35(a)(1)(ii), which relates to assessment of students' progress in the regular program, be corrected to refer to §200.35(a)(1)(i)(B), which relates to assessment of student achievement, aggregated for the LEA as a whole, in accordance with the national standards in Subpart H. Discussion: The Secretary agrees with the commenter. Changes: Section 200.80(a) has been revised to correctly reference §200.35(a)(1)(i)(B).
