(Matsushita Electric), jointly with Professor Koichi Niihara at the Industrial Science Research Institute of Osaka University, has developed new nano-composites in which nm-size, microfine molybdenum particles are uniformly dispersed in a matrix of yttria/partially stabilized zirconia (Y-PSZ or Y-TZP). With the addition of nano-microparticles of molybdenum to comparatively strong and tough PSZ to form the composite, ``the material manifested strength and toughness equivalent to those of super-hard alloys and corrosion resistance nearly equal to that of ceramics,'' according to the Functional Material Laboratory of the Central Research Institute. Within the next two to three years, Matsushita Electric plans to use the composite for electric tools' cutting edges and barber's equipment, including electric razors. Nano-composites are reinforced ceramics created by forming residual stress fields with nm-size microparticles either in the ceramic crystalline grains themselves or in their boundaries. Nano-composite research activities have flourished because drastic improvement of bending strength and toughness is possible by the formation of the composite. Previously, the research concentrated on composite materials that combined dissimilar ceramics, e.g., alumina and silicon carbide. With the aim of ``developing materials that are simultaneously strong, tough and corrosion-resistant,'' Matsushita Electric focused its attention on nano-composites containing ceramics and metal because previous nano-composites consisting of two ceramics had been poor in toughness. PSZ containing 3 mol-percent yttria (Y[.sup]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]) was chosen as the ceramic matrix material. PSZ has excellent toughness and strength, since it undergoes the structure-reinforcing phase transition of its crystalline grains from cubic to monoclinic, when external stress is applied. The actual PSZ material used was Toyo Soda Manufacturing Co., Ltd.'s ``TZ-3Y,'' with an average particle diameter of 300 nm. The research group selected molybdenum for the metal component because of its high melting point, approximately 2,600�C. In super-hard alloys, metallic properties, as opposed to ceramic, are dominant, because their metal component, cobalt, with a low melting point of 1,500�C, tends to cover the ceramic grain boundaries. Therefore, super-hard alloys have excellent toughness, but poor corrosion resistance. By using a high-melting metal, the group hoped to be able to overcome the poor corrosion resistance, the weakness of super-hard alloys. Thus, molybdenum was chosen because its readily wettable, micro-fine powder was commercially available. The molybdenum powder, ``Mo-H-D,'' made by Nippon Shinkinzoku K.K., was obtained. The powder's average particle diameter was 650 nm, and the particle size distribution curve showed two peaks, at 200 nm and 1,000 nm. For the production of the new composite, the two raw material powders were mixed and then ball-milled together for 24 hours in acetone; the blend was sintered by the hot press method for one hour at 1,400-1,600�C, under 30 MPa pressure. The resulting sinter density was higher than 99.5 percent. In the micro-structure of the sinter, molybdenum particles approximately 800 nm in diameter were seen precipitated in the grain boundaries of PSZ poly-crystals, also approximately 800 nm in diameter. Furthermore, 20- to 30-nm-diameter molybdenum nano-particles were also seen precipitated within PSZ particles. It is conjectured that PSZ crystal grains ``form nano-particles by incorporating molybdenum micro-particles inside.'' The mechanical properties of the newly developed composite are strongly influenced by the amount of added molybdenum. The composite's bending strength increases as the molybdenum addition increases from zero through 30 volume-percent, above which the strength does not change significantly (Figure 2). The composite's toughness, on the other hand, hardly increases until the molybdenum amount reaches 30 volume-percent, and rapidly increases as soon as the molybdenum amount exceeds 30 volume-percent. The explanation: ``As long as the molybdenum amount is 30 volume-percent or less, the composite's strength improvement is governed by the nano-particles. When the nano-particles precipitate inside zirconia particles, the structure of zirconia becomes finer, and the composite's strength increases. On the other hand, as more molybdenum is added, molybdenum in the grain boundaries begins to grow to become sub-�m-sized particles; hence, greater toughness. The composite's toughness becomes high because molybdenum in the boundaries can prevent the progress of any cracks that have been generated in the sinter, in addition to the PSZ's phase-transition reinforcing mechanism.'' Figure 2. Bending Strength, Fracture Toughness Values of The composite's mechanical properties, when 50 volume-percent molybdenum was added, were determined as follows: bending strength was 1,800 MPa, and toughness was 17.5 MPa/m[.sup]1/2[/]. These values were 1.8 and 4.2 times, respectively, the values with no molybdenum added. According to the group: ``We have never seen a nano-composite that has simultaneously manifested bending strength of 1,000 MPa and toughness of 10 MPa/m[.sup]1/2[/].'' The group confirmed the excellent corrosion resistance of the composite with a salt water spray test; thus, the group concluded that the material should have no problem in an ordinary environment. The group feels that it needs to improve the composite's hardness, which decreases with the increase in the molybdenum quantity. When 40 volume-percent molybdenum is added, the composite's Vickers hardness HV is only 7-8 GPa, compared with 19 GPa for alumina and 12 GPa for Y-PSZ. The reason was the hardness of molybdenum itself, which is only 2 GPa. The group plans to overcome this weakness of the composite by improving the control of the composite's micro-structure, i.e., the precipitation sites and numbers for nano-particles.
