British Prime Minister John Major and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi agreed in principle to hold the Anglo-Italian summit, though the date and place were not yet decided, British officials said. The Major-Berlusconi meeting, which took place on the sidelines of the 51st European Union [EU] summit here, lasted 75 minutes and centred on the agenda for the meeting of EU leaders, British officials said. Almost immediately after Berlusconi's nomination as the new Italian prime minister in April, British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd invited him to London for an Anglo-Italian summit. Berlusconi ruffled British feathers by instead making his first foreign outing last week to Bonn, visiting German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Earlier in June he also met US President Bill Clinton when the US head of state was in Rome on a week-long European tour to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Rome and the D-Day landings. The British and Italian leaders also discussed their position on the succession to Jacques Delors as European Commission president, the officials said, but declined further details.
