FR941004-0-00048 FR941004-0-00020 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 625 [I.D. 092694B] Summer Flounder Fishery AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Notification of commercial quota transfer. SUMMARY: NMFS announces that the State of New Jersey is transferring 23,085 lb (10,471 kg) of commercial summer flounder quota to the State of Connecticut. NMFS adjusted the quotas and announces the revised commercial quota for each state involved. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 29, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Hannah Goodale, 508&hyph;281&hyph;9101. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Regulations implementing Amendment 2 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Summer Flounder Fishery are found at 50 CFR part 625. The regulations require annual specification of a commercial quota that is apportioned among the coastal states from North Carolina through Maine. The process to set the annual commercial quota and the percent allocated to each state are described in ยง625.20. The commercial quota for summer flounder for the 1994 calendar year was set equal to 16,005,560 lb (7,260,000 kg), and the allocations to each state were published March 7, 1994 (59 FR 10586). At that time, New Jersey was allocated a quota of 2,676,928 lb (1,214,234 kg), and Connecticut was allocated a quota of 361,258 lb (163,864 kg). The 1994 quotas for several states were adjusted for overages occurring in 1993, as required under ยง625.20(d)(2), on May 25, 1994 (59 FR 26971). Since Connecticut's quota was not exceeded in 1993, its 1994 quota was unaffected by this adjustment; the New Jersey quota after the adjustment for overages was 2,533,830 lb (1,149,338 kg). The final rule implementing Amendment 5 to the FMP was published December 17, 1993 (58 FR 65936), and allows two or more states, under mutual agreement and with the concurrence of the Director, Northeast Region, NMFS, (Regional Director) to transfer or combine summer flounder commercial quota. The Regional Director is required to consider the criteria set forth in ยง625.20(f)(1) in the evaluation of requests for quota transfers or combinations. New Jersey has agreed to transfer 23,085 lb (10,471 kg) of commercial quota to Connecticut. The Regional Director has determined that the criteria set forth in ยง625.20(f) have been met, and publishes this notification of quota transfers. The revised quotas for the calendar year 1994 are: New Jersey, 2,510,745 lb (1,138,855 kg); and Connecticut, 384,343 lb (174,335 kg). This action does not alter any of the conclusions reached in the environmental impact statement prepared for Amendment 2 to the FMP regarding the effects of summer flounder fishing activity on the human environment. Amendment 2 established procedures for setting an annual coastwide commercial quota for summer flounder and a formula for determining commercial quotas for each state. The quota transfer provision was established by Amendment 5 to the FMP and the environmental assessment prepared for Amendment 5 found that the action had no significant impact on the environment. Under section 6.02b.3(b)(i)(aa) of NOAA Administrative Order 216&hyph;6, this action is categorically excluded from the requirement to prepare additional environmental analyses. This is a routine administrative action that reallocates commercial quota within the scope of previously published environmental analyses. Classification This action is taken under 50 CFR part 625 and is exempt from review under E.O. 12866. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. Dated: September 28, 1994. Richard H. Schaefer, Director, Office of Fisheries, Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;24489 Filed 9&hyph;29&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;22&hyph;P
