His address to the refugees was televised. Aliyev said that the Azerbaijani leadership had been maintaining contacts with the CSCE and the Russian leaders in order to ensure permanent ceasefire and to eliminate the consequences of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. Aliyev commented on relations with the opposition and on its reaction to the Bishkek protocol. "The leadership made the right move having signed this protocol. For Baku it meant only ceasefire," he emphasized. Aliyev condemned activities of the opposition deputies who had recently left the parliament and had organized a rally in Baku on Saturday. "Political parties should not act through rallies and mass actions of protest. They must consult the official bodies and interact with them," he pointed out. Aliyev announced that people had been sending telegrams and calling from many Azerbaijani regions asking for an opportunity to come to Baku and to settle the accounts with the opposition. He said the fear of the opposition that Russian troops could be brought to Azerbaijan was in vain. "No Russian troops will be brought to Azerbaijan," Aliyev reassured. Press Secretary of the National Independence opposition party (led by Etibar Mamedov) Rauf Mirgadyrov suggested in an interview with Interfax that after his statement Aliyev would have practically no chance to achieve any accord with the opposition.
