FR940504-2-00045 FR940504-2-00041 GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION Notice of Intent To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for the Construction of the Montgomery County, Maryland, Campus for the Headquarters of the Food and Drug Administration Pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 as implemented by the Council on Environmental Quality regulations (40 CFR parts 1500&hyph;1508), and the General Services Administration (GSA) guidelines PBS P 1095.4B, GSA and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announce their intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the acquisition of 350 to 400 acres in Montgomery County, Maryland for the construction of 2.1 million occupiable square feet (osf) of office and laboratory space for use by the FDA to house approximately 5,645 employees with 5,415 parking spaces. Acquisition of this site and construction of this facility will provide one of three campuses planned to allow FDA to consolidate its facilities. FDA is located in three buildings within the District of Columbia and 35 buildings in Maryland. In March 1994, GSA advertised for expressions of interest from potential offerors to provide the required site. The site is to accommodate the construction of a campus for the Headquarters of the Food and Drug Administration. The list of sites that will be considered as alternatives in the EIS are as follows (not listed in order of preference): •The Clarksburg Triangle Site Approximately 535 acres in Clarksburg, Maryland, (bounded by Interstate 270, Route 121/Clarksburg Road, and Old Baltimore Road). •The King Farm Site Approximately 355 acres in the vicinity of Gaithersburg and Rockville, Maryland, (bounded by Route 355/Frederick Road, Shady Grove Road, Gude Drive and Interstate 270 at Piccard Drive). •The Marriott/Milestone Site Approximately 443 acres in Germantown, Maryland, (bounded by Interstate 270, Route 118/Germantown Road, and Route 355/Frederick Road). •The National Geographic Site Approximately 380 acres in Gaithersburg, Maryland, (bounded by Route 28/Darnestown Road, Great Seneca Highway, Route 124/Quince Orchard Road, and Muddy Branch Road). The EIS will focus on the Government's programmatic needs and potential short and long-term impacts that may result from new construction. The consulting firms of Leo A. Daly and Greenhorne & O'Mara have been retained to prepare the draft and final EIS. GSA will initiate a scoping process for the purpose of determining the scope of issues to be addressed and for identifying the significant issues related to this proposed action. A public scoping meeting will be held on May 16, 1994, at 7 p.m. at Rockville High School, 2100 Baltimore Road, Rockville Maryland. A short, formal presentation will precede the request for public comments. GSA and FDA representatives will be available at this meeting to receive comments from the public regarding issues of concern. It is important that Federal, State, and County Agencies, interested individuals, and groups take this opportunity to identify environmental concerns and significant issues that should be addressed by the EIS. In the interest of available time, each speaker will be asked to limit their oral comments to five (5) minutes. Agencies and the general public are also invited and encouraged to provide written comment in addition to, or in lieu of, comments at the public meeting. To be most helpful, scoping comments should clearly describe specific issues or topics which the commentator believes the EIS should address. Written statements concerning the alternatives should be postmarked no later than June 6, 1994, to Mr. Andrew Dempster, Planning Staff (WPL) room 7618, National Capital Region, General Services Administration, Room 7618, 7th and D Streets, SW, Washington, DC, 20407, Telephone (202)&hyph;708&hyph;5530. Dated: April 29, 1994. Mr. Jack Finberg, Acting Director, NCR Planning Staff (WPL). [FR Doc. 94&hyph;10673 Filed 5&hyph;3&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6820&hyph;23&hyph;M
