We acknowledge the domestic and foreign negative effects of these events. We appreciate the noble stands of the leader of the Kurdish people, Mas'ud Barzani, leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party [KDP], to prevent an armed clash and later to stop and contain it in order to avoid bloodshed. This stand indicates his concern for the wellbeing of his people and his devotion and sincerity. Appreciating these noble stands by the KDP and its leader, Barzani, and following the approval of the guide of the Islamic Movement, Shaykh (?'Ali) al-'Uthman in accordance with his cable dated 30 December 1993, we declare that the Fifth Branch of the Islamic Movement, the (Badinan) region, will join the KDP. On this occasion, we extend our thanks and appreciation for all the good efforts that have been exerted and prevented the occurrence of problems and an armed clash in the (Badinan) area. We thank God Almighty that He enabled us to control the situation throughout the past period during which Kurdistan, with the exception of the (Badinan) region, witnessed such regrettable incidents. We thank God and the good sons of our proud Kurdish people. [Signed] The Fifth Branch of the Islamic Movement of Kurdistan [Dated] 31 December 1993
