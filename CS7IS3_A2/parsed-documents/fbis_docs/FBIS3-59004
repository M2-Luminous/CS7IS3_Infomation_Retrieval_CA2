He does not want to assume the role of a marriage guidance councilor, but he believes that Klestil should either settle his problems quickly or resign from office, he pointed out. [Haider] I believe that political reason commands him to settle his matters in a way that restores public respect. The public discussion of the private affair of an official figure should be prevented. Doing nothing would be the worst thing in the current situation. Thus, I think that the damage for the country must now be limited. This is the most important thing. Our international standing has certainly not improved as a result of this affair. For this reason, it is important to settle it quickly. I do not want to say any more at present. If he is not in a position to resolve the matter, he will have to relinquish his office anyway. Somebody else will then have to fill this position.
