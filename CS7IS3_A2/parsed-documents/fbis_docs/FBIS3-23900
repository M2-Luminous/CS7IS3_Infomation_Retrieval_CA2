This is the opinion of Sergey Bogdanov, chief of the FCS' Moscow administration. He says that the ideal solution would be for the president to come forward with a legislative initiative. Especially keeping in mind that the situation is this: Democracy needs political surveillance. [Polinin] Sergey Petrovich, frankly, the words "political surveillance" bring to mind illegal persecution of differently-minded individuals, returning us to the unpleasant times of unmasking internal enemies and dissidents. [Bogdanov] This is precisely the reaction I expected. Political surveillance, they say, is a return to 1937. All right, I have a proposal: Let us come back to this notorious issue, but a little later. [Polinin] Agreed. Then let me express hope that after numerous reshufflings and renamings, the FCS is finally left alone and given the opportunity to fulfill the functions it is tasked with, the main one of which is combating political terrorism. [Bogdanov] Correct. In this respect, I want to give you an atypical example of FCS work which, however, highlights a score of sore problems for us. Everybody remembers the sensational Rostov affair involving an attempt to hijack a helicopter at the very end of last year. The reverberations were tremendous: All of society's attention was focused on this arrogant crime; the government was in consultations round the clock. In this case there was a whole bouquet of law violations: armed seizure of an air transport vessel; illegally depriving citizens of their freedom and using them as hostages; extortion in especially great amounts. Still, this cannot be classified as a purely terrorist act. [Polinin] Many people had the impression that it is not that difficult to commit this sort of a crime, and that our enforcement structures sometimes look helpless. [Bogdanov] This is a wrong impression. Although... Let me compare the current situation with the times of the KGB and MB [Ministry of Security], when as soon as signaled that an aircraft had been hijacked, Plan Nabat instantly went into effect over the entire territory of the country. This is a precisely laid-out scheme where everybody knew what they were supposed to do: the KGB, its local spetznaz units, transportation militia, and Aeroflot. Training maneuvers were conducted annually under this system with the participation of the Alpha team. There had been practically no failures. For instance, in 1975-1985 the KGB averted about 100 aircraft hijacking attempts, including 25 at the stage of hatching the plan and about 15 instances at the stage of carrying out the crime. Over these 10 years only five aircraft hijackings were actually accomplished, and those also were foiled. [Polinin] Are you trying to say that in the Rostov case Nabat failed? [Bogdanov] In principle, Nabat still exists; however, we have to admit that this system has faltered in Russia. It so happened that just before the hijacking the president's 21 December edict came out, liquidating the MB, and this caused a certain chaos and confusion among personnel. Operation Nabat had always been spearheaded by the chief of an oblast administration--in the past of the KGB, then later of the MB. He was the main actor, a single control center. But with the MB abolished, who was to be in charge of the operation? So, complete outsiders got involved. As a result, the head of oblast administration was directing all operations. All of this resembled a situation where the "top brass" handles the job instead of leaving it to the professionals. I will reveal a minor secret: The hijackers should be given credit in that their criminal plan was brilliantly thought-through and very well executed. That the criminals have been detained, the hostages released, and practically all the money returned we should thank... weather conditions. [Polinin] Still, how can we avoid such flops in the future or at least get out of it with minimal losses? [Bogdanov] This is where we are coming to the issue of political surveillance. The task of a special service such as the FCS is first and foremost to avert a crime while it is still in the stage of conception. Roughly put, as soon as a thought occurs to a person--Should I perhaps hijack a plane?--here it is: "Knock, knock, we are your friends"; our agent shows up, and we already know everything. I want to emphasize that for people who conceived such plans or even went into preparations for hijacking, there have been no criminal law or administrative consequences. That is, they were not arrested, detained, or even summoned for an official warning. Everything was done through the existing agents, or new agents were recruited among those close to perpetrators, and appropriate pressure was brought on them. [Polinin] How? [Bogdanov] Very simply. An agent bought a case of vodka and drunk with a potential hijacker until the latter lost any desire to hijack anything. All right, this is a joke; seriously--the person was persuaded to give up his criminal plans. Naturally, for some time he continued to remain under our covert control. As a result, a person often never even guessed that the FCS had played some role in his fate. [Polinin] As I understand it, special services do not need muscle units of the Alpha and Vympel kind, is this not so? [Bogdanov] The FCS system needs to have its own, sufficiently formidable in a professional sense, antiterrorist groups. It may be only a few units, but they must be properly trained, equipped, and given a clearly defined number of tasks and the area of application. World practice shows that special units are part of special services: in Austria it is Cobra; in the United States, Delta; in Germany, GS-9. And they are directly subordinated to heads of special services. However, counterintelligence work is not directly related to these units. Combat operations are not part of "pure" counterintelligence. We have never chased shotgun-armed bandits. At the same time, life makes its own corrections, forcing us to acquire armed assault teams. Therefore, I am convinced that the FCS, which has now been stripped of its muscle structure, will in time have a special unit. [Polinin] Sergey Petrovich, I think now is a good time to talk about political surveillance. [Bogdanov] I am willing to put all the dots over the "i's." Political surveillance is not combating legal parties, movements, or differently-minded individuals who are in opposition to the existing regime (president, government, parliament). As the president's edict says, political surveillance assumes undermining illegal armed formations, as well as political organizations which covertly pursue the goal of changing the existing system by armed or violent means. The same goes for parties, movements, and individuals who covertly incite interethnic and interconfessional strife or harbor separatist intentions. We are charged with these tasks directly by the Russian Constitution, and nobody argues with it. In this sense political surveillance appears simply as an instrument of FCS operations, which has a complete right to use its special capabilities, including agents, confidential liaisons, and special equipment against organizations and persons who fall within the definitions enumerated above. Thus, the quintessence of special service's work, which applied to a full extent to the FCS, is to prevent and foil any criminal action that represents a threat to state security, before it is committed, with the help of specific means and methods.
