The order said this was necessary as preparations for the state of emergency, the Chechen State Security Department told INTERFAX. The commanders of the formations were ordered to open fire for effect without warning in case of an armed attack or resistance. Commenting on this order, Deputy Chief of the State Security Department, Ayub Satuyev, said in an interview with INTERFAX that more energetic actions were expected from Monday on the part of the opposition forces in Chechnya. He announced that a group of persons recruited for the destabilization of the situation in the Republic had been arrested. The security department formations will prevent unauthorized rallies and hostile actions against aliens. "The leadership has enough power and means to halt enemies of the people. We will undertake the toughest measures towards the opposition," Satuyev stated. He suggested that Grozny would never again allow any actions similar to the ones in April and June 1993, when the rallies lasted for weeks.
