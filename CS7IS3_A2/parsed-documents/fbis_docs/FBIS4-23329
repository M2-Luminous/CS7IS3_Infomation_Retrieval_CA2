He was commenting about Renamo advisers' remarks to the Niassa provincial governor that the process will not begin in Renamo-controlled areas if the provincial elections commission does not contact it. In Niassa Province, the voter registration process has only begun in the city of Lichinga and district capitals. A source from the provincial elections commission said the process has not yet begun in other areas because of a lack of transportation. The process has also not yet begun in Renamo-controlled areas.
