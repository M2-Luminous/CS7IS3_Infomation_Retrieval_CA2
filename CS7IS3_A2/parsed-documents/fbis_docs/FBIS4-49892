Robson Walton, whose company's retail sales volume tops 55 billion U.S. dollars annually, has arrived in Tianjin to investigate market potential. He said he is very much interested in China's huge market potential and is looking for investment possibilities in the north China port city. The chairman has inspected several large commercial centers in the city and conducted in-depth discussions with local officials.

Another large store funded by a Hong Kong company is also being constructed. Other overseas businessmen eyeing Tianjin market potentials include the Chia Tai Group company of Thailand and the Nino Textile Company of Germany, local officials revealed.
