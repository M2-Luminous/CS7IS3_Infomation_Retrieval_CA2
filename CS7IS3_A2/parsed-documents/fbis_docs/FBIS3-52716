The Arab dimension of this cause represented and continues to represent a strategic and moral weight for the Palestinian people, who will never renounce their Arab affiliation and will not allow transitory events to instill doubts in them about or weaken their faith in the common pan-Arab destiny which links them with the other peoples of the Arab nation. In this context, Palestinian-Jordanian relations derive additional importance. Jordan has been linked to Palestine with a close fraternal bond which has been enhanced socially, politically, and in terms of population. One can say, without exaggeration, that this relationship or bond has reached the stage of inter-family cohesion, whereby it seems impossible to split this link without almost fatal consequences for the two fraternal people. Although neither the Palestinian nor the Jordanian side has precisely explained the reasons for the misunderstanding between them other than what was stated in the Jordanian monarch's two speeches, from which one can discern the emphasis placed on the importance of prompt coordination between the two leaderships, apparently the speeches' reverberations invoked a rational understanding by the Palestinian side. Hence, the visit by Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO Political Department, to Amman. This visit reflects the Palestinian leadeship's eagerness to preserve the special fraternal relationship with Jordan and develop it in the interest of the two brotherly people and the future of the Arab nation. It is certain that adopting an approach of openness and frankness, overcoming the difficulties, and clarifying any misunderstandings that occur constitute a healthy and correct basis for any sort of coordination between the two parties. If at present the PLO is experiencing negotiating problems with Israel, one of the priorities of the Palestinian and Jordanian sides is to exchange views, coordinate positions in a climate of mutual trust, remove suspicions, and clear the climate. This is the only way for enhancing the two sides' negotiating stance vis-a-vis Israel with the aim of reaching a just and comprehensive settlement aspired for by the two sides and the entire Arab nation.
