Let us follow the report by correspondent Armir Shkurti. [Shkurti] At the beginning of this meeting, Luan Shahollari, chairman of the PS Managing Committee for Tirana, said that the meeting was organized to detail the questions set forward in the party's second national conference as well as to protest against the violation of basic human rights and freedoms. Mr. Shahollari stated that the PS second conference decided on a new political solution -- to hold new, early elections. Among the main questions treated in the second conference, the speaker selected the establishment of a social market economy instead of a free market, the attitude toward the national question, and the PS's international stance as a branch of the European left. At the end of his speech, Mr. Shahollari considered the solitary confinement of former Prime Minister Fatos Nano by the court to be unjust and requested his release. PS Deputy Chairman Servet Pellumbi mentioned once again early elections as a new political solution. Mr. Pellumbi called on the PS to be a force capable of stepping up the democratic processes. That is why he requested it to listen more to the voice of the opposition and practice political dialogue. Mr. Pellumbi also considered the arrest of former Premier Fatos Nano to be unjust and asked his immediate release. Later, the meeting focused only on the demand to release former Prime minister Fatos Nano. Mr. Namik Dokle mentioned documents and messages of international institutions in support of Nano. At the end of the meeting, a protest addressed to the highest institutions of the Albanian state and to international organizations was read. In the name of the PS members and sympathizers in the city, the protest considered the arrest of former Prime Minister Nano unfair. At the end, the protest declared that the PS members and sympathizers in the capital will continue to protest this case with all democratic ways and means.
