In particular, the government ordered a halt to the implementation of its own order issued on 25 November, "On the reassessment of the fixed assets of enterprises and organizations," in as much as the order concerns printing plants. In addition, instructions have been sent to federal ministries and departments with the aim of resolving the press's economic problems. The 25 November order upset Russian journalists and editors because it led to an immediate sixfold raise in printing costs. In particular, the Russian Federation Press Committee was given a month to draft proposals containing tax breaks for papers and journals, and children's, academic, and other socially significant literature. The committee must also prepare proposals on state subsidies for the printed mass media. Another order instructs the Press Committee, the State Property Committee, and other involved departments to present to the government within two months proposals on the means of privatising printing plants with the participation of editorial and book publishing staff. The November order on reassessing fixed assets almost led to a powerful protest action by Russian journalists, which would have been expressed in a temporary strike by the majority of publishing collectives. The order was the "last straw," which would have broken the financial back of the Russian press. In addition, the threat of strike forced the government to consider other problems, which have gone unsolved for years. The journalists' proposals were accepted by Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin during their recent meeting. Judging by the latest order, the government will gradually lower the tax burden placed on periodicals and socially significant literature. As far as the system of state subsidies for newspapers and journals go, it will probably be meaningfully altered. Journalists do not like the current financing system because it makes them dependent on the government. The new financing system will probably include the proposals from editorial offices, which suggest that the government subsidize paper, printing, and communication needs. The long-debated question of the participation of editorial staff in the privatisation of publishing-printing enterprises, if it is resolved in the affirmative, could enable journalists to be their own bosses instead of being hired labor. The most important accomplishment would be the destruction of the government monopoly on the country's printing base. Naturally, all of this will come into being only if the instructions given to the government departments are really carried out.
