Bataille also announced that ``everything indicates that the government will present proposals in the next few days,'' and he added that only two sites would ultimately be picked. More thorough investigations led by the Bureau of Geological and Mining Research (BRGM) are planned for 1994 in those departments. It will take another year to officially announce the two sites chosen for installing the laboratories, which are stipulated by the law of 30 December 1991. While four geological strata--clay, granite, schist, and salt--are considered suitable for holding highly active and long-lived nuclear waste, which is the most dangerous--the Bataille project has retained only the clay and granite options after reviewing the initial geological data. Bataille and his assistant, the prefect Jacques Monestier, selected six likely departments out of thirty which applied to the negotiators last year--Gard, Marne, Haute-Marne, Meurthe-et-Moselle, Meuse, and Vienne. This selection was later narrowed down to the four mentioned earlier in this article. Bataille made several recommendations in the report he presented to the ministers of Industry, Environment, and Land Management, Messrs Gerard Longuet, Michel Barnier, and Charles Pasqua. He suggested that ``the dialogue'' initiated under his authority be ``pursued at the national and local levels.'' When the time comes to build the storage facility--in 2008 at the latest--he requests that the possibility of waste storage reversibility resulting from research conducted by the Atomic Energy Commission (CEA), among others, be taken into account. Finally, according to him, the future of the laboratories once their work is accomplished should be ``guaranteed and formalized.'' Each laboratory, employing 150 people including about 30 scientists, should require an investment of one and a half billion francs and will serve for fifteen years. Operating costs for each are estimated at 70 million per year in addition to 60 million annually for local development.
