According to the talks held on 12 April between Di Tella and 'Arafat, when the PLO achieves statehood, thanks to the historic peace agreements between the Israelis and Palestinians, the bureau may become an embassy, with the appropriate powers. The establishment of an "affairs bureau," a diplomatic status below that of an embassy, has been an old goal of the Arab community in Argentina. After President Carlos Menem -- of Syrian ancestry -- was inaugurated in 1989, the Arab community in Argentina again favored this measure. [passage omitted]
