FR941019-2-00051 FR941019-2-00033 Notice of Issuance of Decisions and Orders During the Week of August 29 Through September 2, 1994 During the week of August 29 through September 2, 1994 the decisions and orders summarized below were issued with respect to applications for relief filed with the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Department of Energy. The following summary also contains a list of submissions that were dismissed by the Office of Hearings and Appeals. Whistleblower Proceeding Helen Gaidine Oglesbee, 9/2/94, LWA&hyph;0006 Helen Gaidine Oglesbee (Oglesbee) filed a request for a hearing on February 28, 1994 under the Department of Energy's Contractor Employee Protection Program, 10 CFR part 708. Oglesbee had been and is currently an employee of Westinghouse Hanford Company (WHC). She alleged that she made health and safety complaints to her immediate supervisor from December 1990 to August 1991, and that beginning in October or November 1991, she elevated these concerns to higher management officials at WHC. Oglesbee maintained that WHC took the following reprisals against her: Failing to respond to her health-related issues and denying her access to reports and analyses of those issues; removing her designation as ``lead'' secretary; issuing her a performance improvement plan; transferring her involuntarily to another WHC office; issuing her a performance expectations letter; issuing her written reprimands, and delaying promotions to Level IV Secretary and to permanent Plant Engineer. The DOE's Office of Contractor Employee Protection investigated the complaint and found that no reprisals had been taken against Oglesbee that would entitle her to relief under part 708. Oglesbee requested a hearing before the OHA, reasserting her claim that reprisals were taken against her for raising health and safety concerns. The Hearing Officer in the OHA determined that with regard to certain of the allegations raised, Oglesbee failed to meet her burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that she made substantial and specific disclosures concerning health and safety to WHC. In those instances where Oglesbee made protected disclosures under part 708 followed closely in time by adverse personnel actions, the Hearing Officer found that WHC had proven by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same actions absent Oglesbee's disclosures, or that Oglesbee had already been provided an adequate remedy for the actions taken against her. Accordingly, the Hearing Officer concluded that Oglesbee failed to establish the existence of any violations of the DOE Contractor Employee Protection Program for which relief was warranted under ยง708.10. Refund Applications Enron Corporation/Dow Hydrocarbons and Resources, Inc., 8/29/94, RF340&hyph;172 Dow Hydrocarbons and Resources, Inc. (Dow) submitted an application for refund in the Enron Corporation refund proceeding. The DOE determined that Dow used Enron propane as a feedstock to produce certain olefins, primarily ethylene, and therefore was entitled to a refund under the presumption of injury for end-users of Enron products. The total refund granted to Dow, including interest, is $409,726.
