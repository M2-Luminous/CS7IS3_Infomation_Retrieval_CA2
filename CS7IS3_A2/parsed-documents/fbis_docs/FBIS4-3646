Shouting "death with the U.S." "death with the Serbians" and "death with the Russians," the students condemned the occupation of Gorazde, a UN-declared safe zone for Bosnian Moslems and the silence of the United Nations toward the Serbian attacks them. In a resolution read at the rally, the students announced their readiness to be dispatched as Moslem volunteers to Bosnia to defend the Bosnian Moslems against Serbian attacks. They urged the United Nations and international community to accept Iran's demand to dispatch forces to the balkan republic as UN peacekeeping forces. Last year, Iran offered to send 10,000-man forces to Bosnia under the UN control to protect the Bosnian Moslems, but the offer was rejected. President Hashemi-Rafsanjani, Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati and other officials reiterated Iran's readiness to dispatch forces after the Moslem city of Gorazde was sieged by the Serbian forces. Rafsanjani Tuesday [19 April] made a telephone call to the Greek prime minister and current chairman of the European Union (EU), Andreas Papandreou, expressing concern over the tragic situation in Gorazde. He criticized the "negligence" of the United Nations toward violation of the most basic regulations by the serbs in a UN- declared safe haven. While the Bosnian Moslems are deprived of having weapons under the UN Security Council's resolution, the Serbs "are receiving all types of arms from the neighboring countries," Rafsanjani said. He noted that such situation would "lead the Europe toward racism and exerting pressure upon ethnic minorities." Also Tuesday, commander of Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) Mohsen Rezai said that Iran insisted that "the UN Security Council use volunteer forces from Iran and other countries to stop the savage massacre of the Moslems."
