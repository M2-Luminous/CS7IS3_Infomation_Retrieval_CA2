FR940920-2-00038 FR940920-2-00018 [Docket No. RP94&hyph;338&hyph;002] El Paso Natural Gas Co.; Tariff Filing September 14, 1994. Take notice that on September 12, 1994, El Paso Natural Gas Company (El Paso), tendered for filing and acceptance pursuant to Part 154 of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (Commission) Regulations Under the Natural Gas Act a Statement of Rates tariff sheet to its Third Revised Volume No. 2 Tariff. El Paso states that the tendered tariff sheet was inadvertently omitted from its July 29, 1994, filing at Docket No. RP94&hyph;338&hyph;000, which the Commission approved by letter order dated August 25, 1994. El Paso states that the tendered tariff sheet, proposed to become effective August 1, 1994, provides for a decrease of $.0013 per dth in El Paso's currently effective take-or-pay Throughput Surcharge due to the removal of the unamortized portion of certain ineligible costs resulting from the Commission's Order Affirming Initial Decision and Order on Rehearing issued concurrently on June 16, 1994, at Docket No. RP90&hyph;81&hyph;000, et al., and Docket No. RP91&hyph;26&hyph;000, et al., (June 16th Orders) respectively. El Paso states that it is requesting waiver of the notice requirement of Section 154.22 of the Commission Regulations pursuant to Section 154.51 to permit the tendered tariff sheet to become effective on August 1, 1994, in order to be consistent with the date the Commission accepted the other affected tariff sheets containing the decrease in the Throughput Surcharge. Furthermore, no party will be harmed by the waiver of the notice requirement, since the result will be a decrease in rates. El Paso states that copies of the filing were served upon all its Volume No. 2 tariff customers and interested state regulatory commissions. Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with Section 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such protests should be filed on or before September 21, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of the filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the Public Reference Room Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
