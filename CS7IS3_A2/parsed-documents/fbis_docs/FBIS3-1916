Before the fifth day of the first moon was over, however, his clamorous voice once again was heard from the southern hemisphere. It seems that Patten has not been satisfied with his unbearable arrogance toward the Hong Kong people and with his wanton disruption of Sino-British cooperation. Now, he has gone so far as to issue orders to all of Asia and has brazenly criticized the leaders of Asian countries for committing mistakes and adopting a conceited attitude. In fact, it is precisely Chris Patten himself who is extremely insolent and arrogant. Being Extremely Dishonest for Criticizing Others Without Any Reason The speeches that Patten made in Australia were the same old ones he made in the Hong Kong Legislative Council and the British parliamentary hearing, and people once again can perceive his dishonest character. He played with words, set up targets for himself, made groundless criticisms, and then extended the meanings by himself in order to refute others' views. In his speeches, he criticized Asian countries for not advocating democracy, and condemned this approach as "not only erroneous, but bearing the color of pride and racial discrimination." May we ask Mr. Patten: Which country in Asia does not openly favor developing democracy? Is it India, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, China, Thailand, Japan, or Singapore? As a political system, the democratic system emerged in a certain historical period and developed along with the advance of society. Moreover, even in countries practicing a democratic system, it can be different in forms. Take the Western countries as an example. Up to now, the UK remains a constitutional monarchy, under which the royal family not only wields power in name, but in material life still enjoys considerable privileges and is still supported by the taxpayers. The United States, however, practices a presidential system. As far as the presidential system is concerned, the one in France is different from that in the United States, as there is a prime minister in the French cabinet, while there is no prime minister in the United States. With regard to the parliament, both the UK and the United States have two houses, but the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives are different from the UK's upper and lower houses in the composition of members and possession of powers. The House of Lords in the UK, a so-called democratic state, practices an appointment system, and only those with titles of nobility can be appointed. Therefore, some Asian countries' leaders -- such as Mr. Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore and Mr. Mahathir of Malaysia -- all stressed the different conditions in different countries, and the necessity of practicing a democratic system that is suited to their own countries. What mistake have they made? There are a great variety of nationalities in the world, so differences in politics, economics, culture, languages, and lifestyles exist objectively among them. No one can deny this fact. What racial discrimination is there if various countries practice the political systems that are suitable to themselves in light of their actual national situations? What right has Patten to make such irresponsible remarks and unfounded charges concerning other countries? In his speeches in Australia, Patten once again played the part of a human rights guardian. By quoting the remarks of someone of his kind, Patten defended the Western countries' interference in the internal affairs of other countries under the cover of human rights issues. He said that "he would recognize the sovereignty of every country," but "also would worry about whether or not the rights human beings should enjoy have been confirmed and respected." As the concept on human rights is one relating to historical development, there are varying concepts on human rights in different countries. With regard to the concept on human rights in which people in the West universally believe, it was founded in the "Manifesto of Human and Civil Rights" adopted by the French Constitutional Conference in 1789. The manifesto declares that all men are born equal in terms of rights, which include freedom, possession of personal property, security, freedom from oppression, and so on. So we would like to ask Mr. Patten: Has your homeland ever respected such rights in the past and does it do so at present? It is not necessary to mention ancient times. Since 1789, how many overseas colonies has Britain founded? What rights of freedom, security, and freedom from oppression could the people enjoy in these regions under the British colonial rule? What were the human rights given by your ancestors, who traded in slaves and opium? How many people did your ancestors kill in India in the surging national independent movements in the 20th century? How many Indians and Pakistanis were slaughtered when you practiced "divide and rule" in India and Pakistan? How many people have you killed in Cyprus? Will Mr. Patten please go to have a look at the bronze statue of the independent warrior in the Cypriot capital, Nicosia! He will complain to you about the price the Cypriots have had to pay in striving for independence, freedom, and human rights! Please go to visit their museum, built in memory of their national independence! There you can see the gallows used by the Britons to suppress the fighters who resisted colonial rule in the name of national independence. Please go to see Beijing's Yuanming Garden. It will condemn the plunder caused to the most magnificent garden in China!.... These are the human rights you have been talking about! If you still want to argue that those were done by your forefathers rather than by yourselves, then please see how your own country is now treating the people of Northern Ireland who call for the reunification of north and south. When the people of your country took to the streets to protest the introduction of the poll tax, how did your mounted police dash into the crowds to trample on the masses? Again, by what virtue did you come to Hong Kong to take up the high position, issue orders, and receive an annual salary of several million Hong Kong dollars, yet without paying a cent in taxes? When Patten's pet dog was lost, he even asked the Hong Kong Police to look for it. Now he has gone to Australia with the money of Hong Kong taxpayers to talk a lot of nonsense! Are these what he calls rights of equality? Patten's dishonesty also is shown in repeatedly claiming himself to be a guardian of Hong Kong people's interests and a defender of their rights and freedoms. The ridiculousness of this really is beyond description! Obviously, he is the highest representative of colonial rule, yet he poses as a civil servant of the people! He is obviously a dictator who concentrates all powers in himself, (in this regard, even Martin Lee Chu-ming, who always gives himself the airs of a democratic fighter, also admitted this when he recently pointed out that if the political reform package adopted by the Legislative Council fails to suit Patten's taste, he will refuse to sign his approval and will dissolve the Legislative Council). Patten also pretends to be a benefactor and defender of democracy! In fact, Mr. Patten had better give up his tricks! We need not enumerate the facts one by one, but just read the memoir written by Mr. Graham, former governor of Hong Kong between 1947 and 1957, in which he wrote: "I know the officials in the Colonial Office were working sincerely, but it was just their work. When they handled the business of this colony, they did not feel they belonged to the place and were in no mood for being loyal to the local people. Although they tried their best to do their work, naturally, they still pledged allegiance to Britain. Should a conflict of interest arise in the critical juncture, they would sacrifice the interests of the colony." The disclosure was made by Mr. Graham because he was opposed to the governorship in Hong Kong being put under the jurisdiction of the British Colonial Office. However, no matter which office it belongs to, it is the interests of the British empire that a Hong Kong governor will represent. Is this not a distinctive fact? Asia is the largest continent in the world; its land area accounts for 28.4 percent of the land on earth, and its population accounts for approximately 58 percent of world population. It is the origin of the world's ancient civilized countries (including China, India, Babylon, and Assyria). The Asian people have made tremendous contributions to world development and the progress of history. Now, Asia is also the region where the economy is growing most rapidly in the world. The governments and people of various countries in Asia are completely capable of handling their own affairs, and they do not need any of Patten's lectures. Patten's ideas are those of the 17th or 18th centuries, as he even openly called on other countries to join him in interfering in the internal affairs of Asian countries, repeatedly sowed dissent among Asian countries and countries in Europe, Latin America, and Africa. His insolence, arrogance, and ignorance are, indeed, seldom seen in the world! In fact, when Patten went to Europe in the winter of 1992 to seek support from the European countries, a leader of a certain country said that Patten was a low-grade politician and did not merit people's support. So what is the use of his sowing dissent among these countries! Throwing Dirty Words on Others Only To Betray His Own Ugliness Patten admitted that he did not come to Australia by invitation. Then why did he go and talk a lot in Australia at this time? Apart from his usual practice of talking glibly to mislead public opinion and persisting in his political stand of confronting China, it is because he has been widely criticized by Australia's public opinion recently. In particular, Mr. Malcolm Fraser, former Australian prime minister, hating to see him impervious to reason, has written three articles, one after another, to criticize him. Having resented Fraser's criticism, he not only refuted Fraser by contributing articles to Australia's newspapers in the form of "letters from readers," but also made an excuse of "evading the Chinese New Year" and went personally to Australia to throw dirty words on others. This did not bring any honor to him except for betraying his baseness. He was not officially invited to visit Australia, but requested a meeting with the Australian prime minister. Later, he begged for support for his so-called political reform package. When his demand was rejected, he said he had not cherished the wish for the people's support, and that he was, therefore, not disappointed. Such "spirit of Ah Q" is really ridiculous [reference to Lu Xun's "The True Story of Ah Q," about a peasant who interprets his defeats as moral victories]. Of course, as Patten knows nothing about Chinese literature, he has no idea of what the "spirit of Ah Q" means. In order to call Fraser names, Patten had no alternative but to make use of the media in Australia. In this way, he accepted an interview one moment and made a speech the next. However, none of the Australians seemed to express appreciation for him. The press also gave him the cold shoulder, and some publications even successively criticized and sneered at him. He was supported only by a handful of his bosom friends and the like. It is all the more ridiculous that Patten went so far as to attack China's investment environment in an attempt to stop Australian businessmen from investing in China. Indeed, Patten has resorted to every conceivable means to confront China. Nonetheless, the entire world is very clear about the investment environment and the market potential in China. Can this be played down by these remarks of Patten's? As everyone knows, the economy of Hong Kong is almost merged with that on the mainland. Hong Kong has made considerable contributions to the mainland's reform, opening up, and economic construction, and in turn, the rapid economic development on the mainland has given impetus to Hong Kong's economic growth. Thanks to this China factor, Hong Kong's economy has been able to maintain powerful development momentum, given the economic slowdown in the West over the past two years. Not only is Hong Kong optimistic about China's prospects, but the industrial and commercial circles in the United States, Japan, and Europe -- including France, Germany, and even Britain itself -- all express optimism about mainland China. Patten's intention of relying on his glib tongue to defame and disrupt China's economic construction can show only his ignorance and arrogance. His disruption of Sino-British cooperation and his infringement on the interests of the British industrial and commercial circles have been condemned by people in these sectors. That is why Patten took this opportunity to vent his anger by defaming the economic construction in China.
