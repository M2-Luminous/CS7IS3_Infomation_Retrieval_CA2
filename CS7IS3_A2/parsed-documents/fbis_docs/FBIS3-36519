Around 10 of them were armed with automatic weapons, an ITAR-TASS correspondent was informed by phone today by the fleet's press center. Only restraint on the part of the command of the brigade of ships under construction and of a hospital, which the attackers penetrated, prevented a more serious incident from occurring. It says the Ukrainian side regarded as justification for these actions the fact that three officers and five warrant officers of the hospital base submitted applications with a request to serve in the Ukrainian Navy. At the same time, these Black Sea servicemen intend to move under the jurisdiction of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry together with material resources, equipment, and weapons. "The position of the Black Sea Command remains invariable: we are not going to impede those who want to serve in the Ukrainian Navy," an ITAR-TASS correspondent was told at the fleet's press center. However, all units, bases, ships and other military installations belonging to the fleet remain under the jurisdiction of the Black Sea Fleet command, as follows from the Yalta agreement signed by the presidents of Russia and Ukraine. Only the signatures of the two presidents can authorize any actions with regard to the fleet. The press center voiced its regret that the unwillingness to understand this undermined the authority of the representatives of the command of the Ukrainian Navy who have been lately talking with increasing frequency about their desire to conduct a dialogue with the fleet's command.
