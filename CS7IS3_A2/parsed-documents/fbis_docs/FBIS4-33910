The Electric Union predicts that the system will continue behaving like this until 15 June. The report also notes that the average deficit was reduced significantly between 2 and 8 June and that the electrical generating level in the last few weeks has exceeded what was expected, increasing consumption of fuel reserved for that purpose. The truth is that the situation today is very different from that in April, when the outages were prolonged due to breakdowns at power plants without adequate maintenance program. The generating capacity now increases daily. It was also confirmed that Mariel Power Plant Unit 6 has been reincorporated into the national electrical network. This unit, which can generate 100 megawatts, was off line for more than a year while Cuban specialists completed their complex reconstruction task.
