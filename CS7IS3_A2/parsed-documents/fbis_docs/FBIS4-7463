The Constitution was proclaimed at 1710 this afternoon. [passage omitted] Here is what Kresimir Zubak, the president of the Presidential Council of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, stated following the adoption of the Constitution of the federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina: [Zubak] As far as we, the Croat deputies, are concerned, this was a formal act, an act of formal recognition of what we had confirmed by our signature. [Vranjes] General Ante Roso, the HVO [Croatian Defense Council] chief of the General Staff, stated the following: [Roso] I have been a soldier, and I am going to remain one. It is certain that a new situation has been created by the adoption of this legal document. New conditions have been created. One of the bases of this document is the restoration of peace in this area. We, Croats, are ready to restore peace in a consistent and dignified way. It is beyond any doubt that this is a great event for our people, for our people of Herceg-Bosna and for the people of Bosnia in general. I hope that the Bosniak people also welcome this offer. Morale among the people has changed somewhat. People's behavior has also changed. It had been very difficult to believe this would happen just a few days ago. [passage omitted] [end recording]
