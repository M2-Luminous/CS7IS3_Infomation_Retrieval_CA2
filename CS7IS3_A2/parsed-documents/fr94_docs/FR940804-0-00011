FR940804-0-00011 FR940804-0-00006 C. Applicability. Section 182(a)(3)(B) requires that states with areas designated as nonattainment for ozone, require emission statement data from sources of volatile organic compounds (VOC) or oxides of nitrogen (NO X ) in the nonattainment areas. This requirement applies to all ozone nonattainment areas, regardless of the classification (Marginal, Moderate, etc.). The states may waive, with EPA approval, the requirement for emission statements for classes or categories of sources with less than 25 tons per year of actual plant-wide NO X or VOC emissions in nonattainment areas if the class or category is included in the base year and periodic inventories and emissions are calculated using emission factors established by EPA (such as those found in EPA publication AP&hyph;42) or other methods acceptable to EPA. The Alabama submittal waives the emission statement requirement for sources with less than 25 tons per year combined of actual plant-wide NO X and VOC emissions and has included calculations of these emissions in their 1990 Base Year Emissions Inventory. Final Action In this action, EPA is approving the Emission Statement SIP revision submitted by the State of Alabama through the ADEM. This action is being taken without prior proposal because the changes are noncontroversial and EPA anticipates no significant comments on them. The public should be advised that this action will be effective October 3, 1994. However, if adverse or critical comments are received by September 6, 1994, this action will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on the proposed rule (please see the proposed rule published, simultaneously, in the proposal section of this Federal Register .) Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1), petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by (60 days from date of publication). Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. [See section 307(b)(2) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(2)]. This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. Nothing in this action shall be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for a revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the state is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on small entities. Moreover, due to the nature of the federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. Union Electric Co. v. U.S. E.P.A. , 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. section 7410(a)(2).
