The increase in the fourth quarter, in particular, was 18.8 percent, compared to an average of 13.1 percent for the whole year. The total value of 1993 exports was 922 billion baht. He attributed the rise to the economic recovery of Thailand's trading partners, especially the United States; the removal of Thailand from the U.S. Priority Foreign Country (PFC) watchlist; and the appreciation of the yen. Phisit revealed that the total value of the country's 1993 imports was 1.143 trillion baht, an increase of 12 percent over the previous year. The value of oil imports increased slightly due to the fall in the price of crude oil. The value of non- petroleum imports was 1.0758 trillion baht, an increase of 12 percent. The target had been 11.6 percent. Meanwhile, the current account balance suffered a deficit of 2.030 trillion baht by the middle of 1993, or approximately 6.8 percent of GDP. The real deficit at year's end, however, was only 1.710 trillion baht -- only 5.5 percent of GDP -- 30 billion below the anticipated figure. Phisit said: "The increase in exports, coupled with the reduced current account balance deficit, might result in the readjustment of the 1993 economic growth rate and the prediction for this year." Phisit noted that the influx of capital funds was very high. In particular, investment capital in the stock market rose seven to eight times, from 14.104 billion baht in 1992 to 118.192 billion baht in 1993. Foreigners' baht bank accounts amounted to 109.365 billion baht, up from only 55.275 billion baht the previous year. The year 1993 saw Thai private firms selling as much as 50.579 billion baht in debentures to mobilize foreign capital, up from the previous year's figure of 2.592 billion baht. It was reported that the 7.5 percent economic growth rate calculated for 1993 has to be adjusted to 8.1 or 8.2 percent because of the increase in exports and the decline in the current account imbalance.
