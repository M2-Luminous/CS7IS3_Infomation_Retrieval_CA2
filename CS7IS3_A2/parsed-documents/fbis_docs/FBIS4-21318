Morris] [Text] Cape Town -- Two of the Green Party's (GP) candidates in the Western Cape have left the party in outrage at a manifesto which calls for the legalisation and mass production of dagga as a purportedly ecologically sound alternative resource. The GP's manifesto--with the words "Freedom of Choice printed in an arc over a dagga leaf--also calls for freedom of choice for private consumption of alcohol, tobacco, marijuana etc." Candidates Ian Williams and Zarin Thomson had no idea these were central tenets of Green policy. Mr. Thomson said: "The initial constitution which I agreed with when I accepted candidature differs significantly from the manifesto upon which the Green Party is contesting the election. The new Green Party manifesto supports the legalisation of marijuana, and advocates narcotic usage. This contrary to my personal philosophy," he said. The manifesto suggests the mass cultivation of hemp (cannabis sativa, popularly called dagga) would be good for the ecology, and the economy. It advocates the dagga plant as a "self-fertilising cash crop" with uses ranging from producing "green (ethanol) fuel" to clothing.
