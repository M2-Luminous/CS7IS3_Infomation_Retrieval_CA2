However, this cannot be confirmed at this state. According to the NATAL MERCURY, THE CAPE TIMES, and BUSINESS DAY, the decision was taken at a secret meeting last night. The papers said this development would almost certainly bring about a split among right wingers. It is reported that the front, which was registered as a party late on Friday night, will submit lists of candidates before the deadline tomorrow. The papers add that the leader of the Afrikaner Freedom Foundation, Professor Carel Boshoff, has also joined the group that is to take part in the election .
