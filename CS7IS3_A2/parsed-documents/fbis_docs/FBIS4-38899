This was said at a briefing today by Grigoriy Karasin, director of the information and press department of the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry, in connection with the killing of Colonel Yuriy Shkipkin, deputy chief of troops of the Tajikistan Defense Ministry, in Dushanbe. "There is no doubt," he stressed, "that forces that aim at further aggravating the situation in the country, which is already uneasy as it is, are behind the latest crime. It is no accident that first and foremost it is servicemen, especially ethnic Russians, who are carrying out their duty to help to restore peace and stability in Tajikistan, who are becoming victims of these obviously planned terrorist actions. An obvious aim can be traced: "To sow uncertainty and fear among the population and to provoke enmity between the peoples of Russia and Tajikistan," the Russian diplomat noted.
