The two ministers discussed relations between the Ukrainian and American armed forces, the implementation of the Partnership for Peace programme and conversion plans, including housing construction for the demobilised military. They also signed an agreement under which Ukraine will be granted 50 million dollars in addition to 135 million it is to receive under the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. The means will be used to finance the dismantlement of SS-24 missiles. Radetskyy welcomed the U.S.-Russian-Ukrainian agreement signed in Moscow as a "historic move and a way-out of the nuclear deadlock." "This step and the ratification by Ukraine of the START-1 treaty and the Lisbon Protocol as a nuclear-free state virtually removes all juridical and other barriers for Ukraine's joining the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty," he said. At the same time, Radetskyy said that "the fulfillment of obligations assumed in nuclear disarmament is a costly process." He stressed the importance of U.S. assistance for carrying out disarmament and solving social problems facing the military. "We have also reached full understanding on issues concerning the Partnership for Peace programme. We understand that Ukraine's future aims at full accession to European structures," Radetskyy said.
