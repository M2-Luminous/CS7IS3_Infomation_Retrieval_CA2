For Labor Minister Gino Giugni, the grave problem of unemployment will lessen if growth picks up and if flexibility is introduced into the labor market. Giugni was leaving for Detroit to take part in the summit of the 7 most industrialized countries (G-7), devoted entirely to employment. He is flying to the United States with a recipe under his arms: "Italy," he says openly, "is going to the summit with an original contribution. We believe that the problem of employment should be confronted either in macroeconomic terms or in terms of labor market intervention based on social consensus. An objective which we achieved in the July accord." The Minister explains: "If in the coming five years Italy is able to attain an economic growth of 3 percent, it will be possible to create 600,000 new jobs every year. Not many, certainly, but one can do more only by adopting policies of labor flexibility, and by achieving transparency of the hidden sector. In this way it will be possible to achieve European Commissioner Jacques Delors' objective of 3 million jobs." In the meantime, Finance Minister and progressive list candidate Luigi Spaventa has launched a new and concrete proposal: an extraordinary three-year plan to invest 30 trillion lira, concentrated in the transport, telecommunications, and environmental sectors. The project, to be financed by fixed-rate long-term securities issued through an appropriate agency and guaranteed by the state, would increase employment -- 300,000 jobs, Spaventa forecasts -- and would raise GDP (gross domestic product) by 1 percent a year. Investments, economic growth, and flexibility. But industrialists are asking for an additional effort to liberalize the labor market. "Development, which is necessary, is not enough on its own," Confindustria [General Confederation of Italian Industry] Director General Innocenzo Cipolletta stated. The July accord represents an income policy which has proved particularly effective for Italy. But one must push more for the liberalization of the labor market: Instruments such as part-time work and short-term contracts exist, but are exceptions. If, now that we are at the beginning of a positive phase in the economic cycle there were to be greater liberty, we will be able to create new jobs at a speed which is unknown in our country, but which is known, on the other hand, in America.
