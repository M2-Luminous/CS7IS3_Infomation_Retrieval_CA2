According to the source, 'Arafat has been maneuvering the talks on a daily basis in order to avoid reaching a final agreement with Israel because his position as talks coordinator gives him much more influence than he would have once he assumes control over Gaza and Jericho, and the problems this entails. The political source believes that once Israel reaches a significant understanding with Syria, 'Arafat would rush to conclude all the issues in dispute because he understands that after the agreement with Syria is made, agreements with Jordan and Lebanon will immediately follow, and the PLO might find itself deserted and with no international support. Another senior Israeli source who participates in the negotiations with the Palestinians also believes that Syria is the key to progress on all tracks. He maintains that only an agreement with Damascus will guarantee that the Rabin government's peace policy will become an irreversible situation. According to him, the government will not cross the "point of no return," as long as the conflict between Israel and Syria remains the same. This could lead to a situation in which, if a right-wing government comes to power in Israel, it could pull out of the peace process. The foreign minister's entourage in Davos expressed satisfaction in view of the various public opinion polls published in Israel regarding a possible peace agreement with Syria. The polls, conducted by YEDI'OT AHARONOT and MA'ARIV, show a significant majority opposing a withdrawal on the Golan Heights. Peres' men, however, claim that the polls were held before any agreement on security arrangements has been made, and before a public relations campaign explaining the advantages of peace with Syria was held. The fact that more than 30 percent support a full withdrawal and another 30 percent support a partial withdrawal indicates that the government will not find it hard to attain the support of a very large majority for the agreement -- if and when a referendum is held on this subject. Peres himself had stressed that holding a referendum is still only an option. Several officials in Davos have asked why Israel does not start discussing the permanent arrangements with the Palestinians and, instead engages in discussing border crossings arrangements which, in any event, will only last for a short period. The senior source said in response that the main reason why Israel drafted the Oslo agreement as it is pertains to the issue of Jerusalem. According to the source, if Israel were to deal with the permanent arrangements at this time, the talks would have encountered serious difficulties over the Jerusalem issue. The source stressed that, although the government enjoys the support of the majority of the Israeli public, "there are issues on which the majority is not sufficiently large, and it would not be wise to turn large parts of the public against the government." The source used the same argument regarding the issue of evacuating the isolated settlements of Netzarim and Kfar Darom in the Gaza Strip. A government source who is not a Foreign Ministry official stressed that although the issue in question refers to several dozen families -- the defense of which would entail the deploying a large number of IDF [Israel Defense Forces] troops and controlling the roads in the very crowded Gaza Strip -- Israel must show that it insists that the Oslo agreement be fully honored. According to him, the agreement that will be signed with the Palestinians is just the first in a series of agreements which will be made in the near future, and it is important to establish the principle that signed agreements should not be reopened. At the same time, sources in Davos expressed the possibility that, after the parties sign the agreement on the transfer of authorities, Israel may unilaterally decide to disband certain settlements. The sources stressed that this decision will be made by Israel alone, based on Israeli interests, and not in the framework of the negotiations with the PLO. [passage omitted]
