To participate in celebrations aimed at "peace and reconciliation," the diplomats need individual permits from Bonn. The confidential circular, whose existence was confirmed to FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU by the Foreign Ministry on Friday [4 March], mainly concerns the embassies in France and the Benelux countries. These countries will hold celebrations in 1994 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Allied forces' fight against the Germans. The major event of this kind will be the one commemorating the landing of the Allied forces in Normandy on 6 June 1944, which began the liberation of France from the German occupiers. The reason behind this ban is that Kohl is annoyed with the Allies. According to U.S. and French Government circles, Kohl had again tried informally to get an invitation this year as he had done 10 years ago on the occasion of the 40-year anniversary events. Like 10 years ago, Kohl was told this time that only the heads of government of the Allied countries would take part in this celebration. Thus, U.S. President Bill Clinton, French President Francois Mitterrand, and Queen Elizabeth II will meet in Normandy in June. According to the circular, which, coalition circles say, was produced at the chancellor's express wish, diplomats are not allowed to attend smaller events either. The reason that diplomatic circles give for this unusual ban is that many of the celebrations are purely military in character, in which one does not want to participate. According to diplomats, this circular is, however, a distinct change over previous years, when there was no strict ban of this kind. The Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] considers this circular to be a "setback" for relations with these countries. SPD Foreign policy spokesman Karsten Voigt said that "the steel helmet faction has got its way" in the Foreign Ministry and the Chancellor's Office. These people still fail to realize that "the German Reich had to take a defeat so that the German people could be liberated."
