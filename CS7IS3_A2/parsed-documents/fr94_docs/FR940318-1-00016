FR940318-1-00016 FR940318-1-00004 Cost Impact There are approximately 1,752 Boeing Model 727 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet, operated by 153 operators. It is estimated that 1,277 airplanes of U.S. registry and 54 U.S. operators would be affected by this AD. The FAA estimates that it would take approximately 4 work hours per airplane lavatory drain (2 drains per airplane) to accomplish a leak check, and the average labor cost would be $55 per work hour. For the 1,077 airplanes that have donut/cap type or other approved drain valves (excluding Shaw Aero drain valves) installed in both drain systems, approximately 15 leak checks per airplane would be required each year. For the 36 airplanes that have Shaw Aero drain valves installed in both drain systems, approximately 3 leak checks per airplane would be required each year. For the 164 airplanes that have a ball valve installed in the forward lavatory drain and a Shaw Aero drain valve installed in the aft lavatory drain, approximately 2 leak checks of the forward drain and 3 leak checks of the aft drain would be required per year. Based on these figures, the total annual (recurring) cost impact of the repetitive leak checks on U.S. operators is estimated to be $7,336,120. The 1,277 airplanes of U.S. registry have, on an average, 3 flush/fill lines per airplane. The FAA estimates that the installation cost of a level lock cap assembly would require approximately 2 work hours to accomplish, at an average labor cost of $55 per work hour. Required parts are estimated to be $275 per drain installation. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the requirement to install a cap on the flush/fill lines is estimated to be $1,474,935, or an average of $1,155 per airplane. The number of required work hours, as indicated above, is presented as if the accomplishment of the actions proposed in this AD were to be conducted as ``stand alone'' actions. However, in actual practice, these actions would be accomplished coincidentally or in combination with normally scheduled airplane inspections and other maintenance program tasks. Therefore, the actual number of necessary ``additional'' work hours would be minimal in many instances. Additionally, any costs associated with special airplane scheduling would be minimal. In addition to the costs discussed above, for those operators who elect to comply with proposed paragraph (b) of this AD action, the FAA estimates that it would take approximately 40 work hours per operator to incorporate the lavatory drain system leak check procedures into the maintenance programs, at an average labor cost of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed maintenance revision requirement of this AD action on the 54 U.S. operators is estimated to be $118,800, or $2,200 per operator. The ``total cost impact'' figures described above are based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The FAA recognizes that the obligation to maintain aircraft in an airworthy condition is vital, but sometimes expensive. Because AD's require specific actions to address specific unsafe conditions, they appear to impose costs that would not otherwise be borne by operators. However, because of the general obligation of operators to maintain aircraft in an airworthy condition, this appearance is deceptive. Attributing those costs solely to the issuance of this AD is unrealistic because, in the interest of maintaining safe aircraft, most prudent operators would accomplish the required actions even if they were not required to do so by the AD. A full cost-benefit analysis has not been accomplished for this proposed AD. As a matter of law, in order to be airworthy, an aircraft must conform to its type design and be in a condition for safe operation. The type design is approved only after the FAA makes a determination that it complies with all applicable airworthiness requirements. In adopting and maintaining those requirements, the FAA has already made the determination that they establish a level of safety that is cost-beneficial. When the FAA, as in this proposed AD, makes a finding of an unsafe condition, this means that this cost-beneficial level of safety is no longer being achieved and that the proposed actions are necessary to restore that level of safety. Because this level of safety has already been determined to be cost-beneficial, a full cost-benefit analysis for this proposed AD would be redundant and unnecessary. Regulatory Impact The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
