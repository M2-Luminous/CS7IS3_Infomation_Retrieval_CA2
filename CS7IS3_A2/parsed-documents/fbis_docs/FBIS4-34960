According to AEC President Carlos Martinez Salsamendi, this will be Cuba's door to its incorporation into the international economy. During an interview with PRENSA LATINA, the official underlined the Caribbean market's importance for his country, which enjoys comparative advantages in the subregion in the fields of industrial development, health, and even tourism. He said that Cuba exports cement, salt, construction materials, and technical services of various types to the Caribbean. With the incorporation of Mexico, Colombia, and Venezuela into the AEC, Cuba will be able to export oil, minerals, raw materials, and commercial services to these countries also. From Guyana, Cuba buys minerals and lumber. Salsamendi said that five years ago the 13 Caribbean Common Market [Caricom] countries regarded Cuba as a potential competitor in tourism and for supplies of some traditional Caribbean exports. Cuba is now considered a complementary economy, even regarding tourism. There are travel packages that include Jamaica and Cuba, as well as Mexico and Cuba in the same packages. In addition, air and sea travel agreements have been established to improve tourism development in the area. This improved relationship includes a growing interest in Caribbean business meetings and the Caribbean Exposition, which have been held since 1993 and 1992, respectively. These events are sponsored by the Chamber of Commerce. This year, the events will precede the signing of the AEC Charter by the heads of government. The second meeting of Caribbean businessmen will be held in Santiago de Cuba on 27 and 28 June. Expocaribe '94 will be held in this same city in Cuba's eastern region from 28 June to 3 July. In the 1993 exposition, Expocaribe gathered 11 companies from nine countries. Presently, 15 countries and 32 firms have been registered for this year's exposition, the Chamber of Commerce president has reported. The exposition grounds are small and, consequently, we have had to keep the number of participants low, Salsamendi said. Cuba will be represented by 195 enterprises, all of them established in the five easternmost provinces of the island. These provinces are destined to lead in trade and relations with Cuba's southern neighbors. Representatives from outside of the region, including executives from Canada, France, and Spain, have also confirmed their participation in the businessmen's meeting. The meeting will include a discussion of Cuba's commercial policy toward the Caribbean. There will also be a discussion of business opportunities in each of the five eastern provinces of Cuba. For this discussion, a catalog has been prepared showing the idle industrial potential of this region of the island. Local industrial potential includes the poligraphic industry, and nickel, copper, chromium, iron, and manganese mining. There is an abundance of reserves of these minerals in Cuba's eastern region. The meeting will also discuss the Cuban economy and its prospects, as well as the possibilities for foreign investments in the country. Salsamendi explained that the new opening to foreign capital has brought to the Chamber of Commerce host province increasing activities. Because of these increasing activities, the Chamber of Commerce will have to open two subsidiary sites this year. One of these sites will be in Santiago de Cuba and the other will be in Matanzas. All commercial delegations and investors go through the Chamber of Commerce. So far this year, the number of foreign businessmen who have dealt with the Chamber of Commerce exceeds the number of foreign businessmen who did business with the Chamber of Commerce in 1993. This year, the Chamber has handled the creation of one combined enterprise or economic association every week, which is twice the amount of last year. According to the Chamber of Commerce president, foreign capital investments have been increasing, not only in oil prospecting and exploitation -- a sector in which Total of France, Sherrit of Canada, and Taurus of Sweden, among others, with their Cuban counterpart Cupet, participate -- but also in the nickel industry, by Inco of Canada; in cement, by Cemex of Mexico; and in the telephone industry, by Domos International. In the area of cosmetics and perfumes, the most recent association agreement was signed with Unilever of Great Britain, one of the world's leading companies in this industry. According to Salsamendi, Cuba conducts its trade according to market economy rules after three decades of operating with a long-term system of commercial agreements and equitable prices, which was used in the old Socialist field. He said that Cuba is not yet prepared, but it is learning to negotiate without maladjustments, and it is maintaining the social equity principle.
