The letter to the CE says that Slovakia is not observing its commitments towards the CE regarding ethnic policy, Csaky reported. This statement is exemplified by the shortcomings in the adopted laws on names and surnames, anomalies in the names of Hungarians communities in south Slovakia and the discriminatory language law, Csaky said. The so-called alternative educational system, which assumes that vocational subjects should be taught in Slovak, is a "well-thought out attack on the system of the Hungarian schools," Csaky stated. Chairman of the opposition Democratic Left Party (SDL) Peter Weiss said that the demands voiced in Komarno (during a meeting of ethnic Hungarian representatives on January 8) are "exaggerated and tactlessly articulated." They served the governing coalition because they deflected public attention from the growing economic and social problems, "created the picture of an enemy, and pushed the poorly working process of privatization to the margin of interest.
