Good day to you. Previously Georgia was associated with the sea, fruit and loving brunettes. Now life is tough in this country. Average wages amount to approximately 3-4,000 rubles a month. Prices are almost the same as those in Moscow. People do not venture into the streets after 1900. Lord knows how they manage to live here. Nobody has given us a clear answer to this. Georgia is actually standing on the edge of the precipice, and that is why the people were expecting a miracle to happen after President Yeltsin's visit. A person writing to a local newspaper said that he was waiting for Yeltsin's visit more than for one from his own mother. [Video cuts to show Svanidze interviewing Eduard Shevardnadze in a room] [Svanidze] Georgia is in a very difficult situation. President Yeltsin paid a visit to Georgia. A whole package of documents was signed. What will change now if something is expected to change? [Shevardnadze] A lot will change for the better if we really get down to implementing all that was discussed and signed, and if this process is not dragged out. [Svanadze] The living standards are far higher in Russia compared with those in Georgia. So, was the aim to tie up with Russia? [Shevardnadze] The matter was about restoring the economic ties between enterprises, towns and regions that had been set up during many decades and the two past centuries. I think that the breaching of those ties was an anomaly. There was that naive approach toward this matter. [Svanadze] Did you always think like this? [Shevarnadze] I always thought like this. [Svanadze] What is your attitude toward the expansion of the ruble zone into Georgia? [Shevardnadze] This issue has not yet been examined. We are having extensive debate on this issue. First, I am not sure that Russia will simply open the door and that tomorrow we will find ourselves in the ruble zone. [Svanadze] Would you like this to happen? [Shevardnadze] One will have to think about that. If we strive to achieve, and achieve the revival of economic life -- this should be virtually achieved in matter of several months -- then there will be a better picture on whether the national currency has any prospects. Naturally, the present financial situation is deplorable; this was inevitable. [Svanidze] What made Boris Yeltsin sign the treaty with Georgia at this particular moment? [Shevardnadze] In connection with the Georgian-Ossetian and the Georgian-Abkhazian conflicts, some of the Russian leaders thought it was necessary to retain this lever for exerting pressure on the Georgian leadership. They meant that this is in Georgia's interest, while Russia could live without a treaty. We have lost a great deal by not signing it earlier. I am convinced that if a year ago we had signed a large-scale treaty, a major agreement, and all the documents on military cooperation we have signed now, perhaps it would have been possible to avert the Abkhazian tragedy. [Svanidze] I know that when Sukhumi was virtually on the brink of capitulation, Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev proposed that you introduce a considerable contingent of Russian troops -- up to two divisions, as far as I know -- in order to help you to take the situation in control. You refused then. Now, under the present treaty, you are in fact agreeing to more than just that. Do you think you then made a mistake? [Shevardnadze] Yes, that's true, the question then was whether we would manage to defend Sukhumi, because considerable forces were advancing, including not only Abkhazians, but mercenaries as well. At the time I did not act with sufficient firmness of principle and courage. There were my young colleagues at my side and I was told that if this happened -- I mean if the two divisions were brought in -- they would resign. If this demonstrative resignation had taken place, it would have had a very negative effect on the then situation in Georgia. Therefore, I started looking for some compromise solutions, but Pavel Sergeyevich Grachev found them unacceptable. Several days later the situation became aggravated. I think this was a miscalculation on my part. I should have done it, although the Georgian people were not ready for this, so to speak. [Svanidze] Are they ready for it now? [Shevardnadze] I think that if one takes the whole complex of agreements, which had already been signed, the majority of people approve of them. Approximately 70 percent of the population now support my line, as it were, as far as this matter is concerned. [Svanidze] During his meeting with you, President Yeltsin spoke not just about establishing friendly relations between Russia and Georgia but also about becoming allies. What does it imply for Russia and Georgia? It means the construction of a network of military bases on the territory of Georgia. Officially, they are talking about three bases, but as far as I know they are talking, in fact, about the creation of seven military bases. This would mean that -- bearing in mind the difference in population and might of the two countries -- Georgia becomes Russia's outpost in the Caucasus, and if one were to call things by their own names these relations will acquire a vassal nature. Are you happy with this scenario? Don't you think that this treaty is a diplomatic defeat for Georgia? [Shevardnadze] As for the military bases -- and you are saying there might be up to seven -- we have them in approximately three locations. They already exist. We really ought to be talking about the duration of the stay of the Russian Army in Georgia. There is a division stationed in Batumi. There is another division stationed in Akhalkalaki. There are also military units near Tbilisi and in some of the Tbilisi districts. There is a Russian battalion in Sukhumi and there is another one in Gudauta. So if one looks at the present state of things they will not really change much. Our relations are being put on a civilized footing. [Svanidze] Incidentally, you have just counted five locations. [Shevardnadze] Uh? [Svanidze] You have just counted five locations. [Shevardnadze] No, I do not think that you can count Sukhumi and Gudauta as bases. There are units which are stationed there temporarily. They can be moved to Batumi, or if we do not agree to it...[pauses] But we are more likely than not to agree because their future presence here is simply necessary. Let us see if there are other options. Where Georgia's interests lie, so to speak? Just now we have looked into Russia's interests. Yes, naturally, Russia is interested in having its armed forces here in Georgia, in the Transcaucasian region. It is interested in this -- again, for the sake of stability in the southern part of the country, a large part of it -- and the question, as you know, is not that simple. And Georgia? I have already spoken about stability in general. How Georgia will build its own army if there is no proper support from Russia. [Svanidze] Speaking about this treaty: In the view of the conditions put forward initially, who gets the best deal as a result -- Russia or Georgia? [Shevardnadze] I think that so far Russia has got more out of it. But in the long term I think Georgia will get what is due to it. [Svanidze] Is it true that you have on several occasions suggested to Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin that you will be prepared to resign from the post of head of the Georgian state in the interests of improving relations between Russia and Georgia? [Shevardnadze] I have always said and will say it again -- I am ready to do so. If Russia is not unequivocally happy with Shevardnadze as a political figure, and if, as is in some circles, he is even viewed with hostility -- I am prepared to leave. I have tried to do this before. Unfortunately, I did not succeed. [Svanidze] Am I to understand then that the question of whether you remain head of the Georgian state is mainly determined by Yeltsin? [Shevardnadze] No, that is not so. It is not Yeltsin who decides this, but I am prepared, all the same. If Russia believes that Shevardnadze can be an impediment to the development of normal, good and neighborly relations between the two states, I am prepared to leave. Even now, right after this conversation is over.
