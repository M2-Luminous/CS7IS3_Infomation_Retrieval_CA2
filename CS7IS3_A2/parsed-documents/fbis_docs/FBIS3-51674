This is the worst carnage so far this year in Antioquia's Uraba region, the authorities noted. They explained that approximately 20 FARC men armed with rifles and machine guns fired indiscriminately on sympathizers of the Hope, Peace, and Liberty group composed of former Popular Liberation Army guerrillas, who three years ago demobilized and returned to civilian life. According to initial investigations by the Antioquia Police, the rebels, who wore army and police uniforms, appeared in the La Chinita neighborhood, where a party was going on, and opened fire.
