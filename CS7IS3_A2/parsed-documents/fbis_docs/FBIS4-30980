The Bosnian Serb delegation also includes Bosnian Serb Vice President Nikola Koljevic, Parliament Speaker Momcilo Krajisnik and Foreign Minister Alkesa Buha. The Commander of the Bosnian Serb Army General Ratko Mladic and his associates also arrived with the political delegation. In his statement to TANJUG Koljevic said that the proposal of U.N. special envoy for former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi on the delimitation of the territories between the warring sides is expected to be tabled at the talks which are scheduled to begin Thursday afternoon. The proposed model is very similar to the one applied in the disengagement of the forces of Croatia and the Republic of Serb Krajina (RSK), Koljevic explained. The buffer areas will perhaps be called gray areas in which peacekeepers would be deployed. U.N. special envoy Yasushi Akashi, international mediators Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] commanders for ex-Yugoslavia and Bosnia Generals Bertrand de Lapresle and Michael Rose have also arrived in Geneva but there is still no confirmation about the arrival of the Bosnian Moslem delegation which is supposed to be headed by Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic. The Croatian delegation headed by Kresimir Zubak has also arrived in Geneva. The beginning of the conference is still uncertain due to the absence of the Moslem delegation, all the more so since the head of the Moslem mission in Geneva Mustafa Bjedic announced two hours before the talks were due to begin that the "Moslems would boycott the gathering because Serbs have failed to withdraw from the Gorazde area (Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia) as requested". Conference circles do not consider this to be a final decision yet by there is reason to fear that Silajdzic and his delegation will really not arrive to examine Akashi's ceasefire plan. If a ceasefire accord is reached the Serb delegation is ready to immediately start talks on territorial delimitation. Well-informed circles at the conference report about the possibility of the meeting on territorial delimitation, scheduled for June 6 and 7 in Talloires (France), being transferred to Geneva if the warring sides previously reach a ceasefire agreement.
