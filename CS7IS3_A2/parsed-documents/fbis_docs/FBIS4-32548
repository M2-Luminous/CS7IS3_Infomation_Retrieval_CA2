Weizsaecker, whose visit to Poland is his last as president, then presented Lech Walesa with the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit, the highest German decoration. Lech Walesa said: "In my country, you are considered a great friend of Poland and the Poles. You have always supported friendly relations, as well as understanding and neighborly cooperation. You were one of the first to speak out in favor of overcoming our difficult past and removing the barriers dividing our states and nations. It was you who said: Let us learn to live not against each other, but together. You said that at a time when admitting friendly feelings toward Poland was unpopular." The president stressed that Richard von Weizsaecker is a politician who "wanted to use traditional Christian values such as truth, respect, love, and good as a measure for mutual interstate relations." "You also wanted these values to become a foundation of future Polish-German neighborliness. This has made you a worthy successor of the Konrad Adenauer idea. You believe, as he did, that the new Germany will become a good neighbor of Poland," Walesa added. Weizsaecker said that, during his entire political life, relations between Poland and Germany "have been particularly close to my heart." "I would like to thank you and your fellow citizens for the leading role played by Poland under your leadership in gaining freedom for Europe," he told Lech Walesa. "While not forgetting the past, let us create the future together," the German president said. Richard von Weizsaecker will be a guest of a conference on "A New Germany in a New World," organized by the Stefan Batory Foundation, the RESPUBLICA NOVA monthly, and the Robert Bosch Foundation.
