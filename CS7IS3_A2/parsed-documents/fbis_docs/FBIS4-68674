Kosolapov, Chelyabinsk: "My Radio Telephone Started Ringing: a Modern Communications Network System Has Been Created in Chelyabinsk"] [Text] "If you want to, we can call a foreign country. Would you like to call Germany, for example?" My conversational partner picked up a touch-tone telephone with a short antenna, and quickly ran his fingers over the keyboard: about twenty seconds later, I could hear coming from the other end of the line the voice of a woman who was speaking in German. The audibility was excellent, just as though we were not thousands of kilometers apart: there was no interference, no noise, or crackling. "The automatic international responder," it was explained to me, "tells whom to call, how to call him, where to go for advice or the necessary information.." Possibly for a businessman in Hamburg or North Rhine-Westphalia this is an everyday occurrence -- communication with a subscriber located even a tremendous distance away, almost instantaneously -- but I, a person unspoiled by domestically produced communications equipment, perceived everything that happened as a minor technical miracle. Obviously I had seen radio telephones, which practically every militiaman carries nowadays, and, in addition, important managers have been installing them for many years in their official cars, but I myself did not have any contact with this kind of progress. "Now everyone who concludes a contract with our organization will have the opportunity to become a subscriber to the mobile radio telephone system," A. B. Blinov, technical director of the Radiotelefon AO [joint-stock company] says. "Today I signed an official order concerning the completion of preliminary tests, and a week or two will go into bringing the entire complex to a steady, stable state, and in late April we shall begin working at full strength." But how does the mobile radio telephone communications system operate? The Chelyabinsk system has two main centers: one is situated in the oblast radio teletransmitting center, and the other in Metallurgicheskiy Rayon, in the ATS-21 [dial telephone station No. 21] building. Relay communications have been installed between them. Both centers are switched into the city, long-distance, and international automatic-dialing system. Therefore there will be no problems in reaching a subscriber located anywhere on the planet. Calls have already been made to the United States, Finland, and even Australia, without any problems. And I myself could talk to Germany, if there was anyone I wanted to talk to. Incidentally, the city network is not limited for the radio telephone to the territory of Chelyabinsk. The signal extends to a radius of 30 kilometers from the telecommunications tower and gets as far as Kopeysk and many suburban settlements and villages. Simultaneously with this, the telephone can be extremely selective. It can connect with just one mobile-communications subscriber, if that is what you want. Provision has also been made for other services, which we previously have not even dreamed of: you can indicate the number of a subscriber from whom you do not want to get calls, and he will not be able to connect with you. If what you need is only one-sided communication, you can make the call, or if not, there is nothing complicated about this -- that is how it will be. If you are talking too long, the telephone will indicate to you at the proper time that your money is running out... Chelyabinsk is the fourth city in Russia where a mobile radio telephone system has been created. A year ago the system was activated in Moscow and St. Petersburg, then, quite recently, in Nizhniy Novgorod. The fact that our city proved to be among the pioneers in the communications sphere is definitely not accidental. For many years the oblast center has housed the Scientific-Research Institute of Measurement Technology (NIIIT) previously was kept extremely classified and which specialized in developing electronic systems for the navy, aviation, and space travel. Hence the high proficiency level of its workers, and their initiative and ability to make contact with their partners. The basis of the Radiotelefon AO, which is headed by V. O. Lenkevich, is made up of people from NIIIT. Also, many production orders for the manufacture of equipment are also executed by former work associates. However, the main supplier of the modern technology is the Swedish Ericson company. The first consignment of equipment was delivered from Scandinavia in January. A month later five more tons of freight arrived. Simultaneously, the installation workers arrived, and, incidentally, not all of them are necessarily Swedes. Currently, for example, two people are working here: one is from Malaysia, and the other is from Mexico. They have not yet become fluent in Russian, but they have watched the "Simply Mariya" television series and have suffered through a lot with the characters. The first phase of the system is planned for 2000 subscribers, and the maximum capacity is 12,000. The experience gained by foreign countries indicates that, on the average, in an ordinary city one percent of the people use mobile telephone communications. The capacities that the Radiotelefon AO is proposing for Chelyabinsk are apparently completely adequate. Although it is difficult to know: in Finland, the country in the world that is most densely saturated with radio telephone communications, three percent of the population prefer mobile communications. In our oblast the new system, it seems to me, has rather good prospects: currently the NIIIT specialists are working on the introduction of radio telephone service in Miass. The telecommunications tower possibilities have been studied, and contracts have been concluded with enterprises, including such an important one as UralAZ. According to the plan, the installation of the equipment will begin at the end of the second quarter. The reception zone will include the city of Chebarkul, and all the sanatoriums situated in its environs. In parallel with this, preparatory work is under way to introduce mobile communications in Magnitogorsk. Whoever possesses modern communications, possesses the world...
