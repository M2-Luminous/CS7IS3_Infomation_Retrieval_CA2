As he reported in an interview with INTERFAX before his departure, at that meeting in Warsaw he intended to focus on the slow progress with lifting "glaring discriminatory restrictions against Russian commodities" on Western markets. In his words, damage from these restrictions totals three billion dollars a year. He intends to suggest that a group of experts specially meet at the economic forum to tackle this problem. He emphasized that Russia had been adopting effective measures to improve the investment climate for foreign businessmen. By some Western estimates, he continued, Russia "could annually absorb 40-50 billion dollars in foreign investment." There were 13,500 joint ventures involving foreign assets in Russia by the end of the first quarter of this year. This year's direct investment in the Russian economy amounted to 2.6 billion dollars.
