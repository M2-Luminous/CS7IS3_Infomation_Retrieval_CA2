This measure, which bans all public demonstrations, is accompanied by a curfew that will be in force from 2200 to 0530. The decision was made yesterday at an extraordinary cabinet meeting following violent incidents that occurred in Libreville at the beginning of the strike launched yesterday by the Gabonese Free Trade Unions Federation to demand salary increases after the devaluation of the CFA franc. The strike quickly turned into riots. Demonstrators of imprecise political or trade union affiliations took to the streets, stoning taxis and erecting barricades in working class districts. For the Gabonese Government, this represents a takeover of the strike action by opposition parties. Here are more details with Patrice Nziengui, communication minister and government spokesman : [Begin Nziengui recording] The cabinet, while recognizing the right of trade unions' to go on strike -- a right that is essentially aimed at defending workers' rights and industrial interests -- deeply regrets the political maneuvers underlying these demonstrations. The Gabonese people have witnessed, notably in Libreville, the magnitude of the pernicious consequences of this political manipulation by the opposition. Barricades were erected in various streets of the capital thus preventing people from circulating in the city and, consquently, preventing Gabonese from going to their work places. Vehicles were burned in various areas and public buildings were set on fire, notably police stations. People were abducted and detained against their will. Violence and all sorts of exactions were perpetrated against them. Firearms were used against security agents and other citizens. Therefore, in order to put an end to this situation, which Gabon does not need because of the negative international and national economic and political crisis, the government has decided to reestablish the state of warning as of tonight, 21 February from 2200 to 0530. [end recording] The state of warning includes a number of practical dispositions, notably, the imposition of a curfew and the restriction of certain liberties. These additional measures are given here by Defense Minister Martin-Fidele Magnaga: [Begin Magnaga recording] First, all people who will be considered a threat to public order will be arrested. Second, restrictions have been placed on certain rights, including freedom of gathering and freedom of movement of property and people. Theaters, bars, and places of meeting of all sorts are ordered closed. Finally, a curfew has been imposed and firm directives have been given to the security forces to strictly enforce these measures. [end recording]
