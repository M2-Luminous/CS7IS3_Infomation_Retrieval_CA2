In so doing, the organization is violating its principle of lying low in election movements. In a so far unknown letter to Social Democratic Party leader Ingvar Carlsson, the chairman of the association Bo Rydin writes that the Social Democrats' policy jeopardizes economic recovery in Sweden and risks leading to higher interest rates, reduced investment, and undermined confidence in the budget policy. "Rydin's violent attack shows that the Industry Association apparently is turning more and more into a propaganda organ. I see a connection between the campaign by the Taxpayers' Association and the attack by the Industry Association," replies Ingvar Carlsson through his press secretary Gisela Lindstrand. Bo Rydin is one of the absolute top people in Swedish business and industry. Among other things, he is chairman of the board of SCA [Swedish Cellulose Company] and Industrivarden. In the letter to Ingvar Carlsson he criticizes point by point the proposals that the Social Democrats presented in their shadow budget earlier this year. Good Relations With that Bo Rydin and the Industry Association are heading into the beginning election campaign. "We are worried about the Social Democratic proposals. This has nothing to do with party policy but about wanting to protect Swedish industry," says Bo Rydin. In the letter to Ingvar Carlsson, he voices harsh criticism of the Social Democratic proposals for raised income taxes, raised taxation of capital, retaining personal property taxes, and reintroducing double taxation for business profits. He also strongly questions whether the Social Democrats' proposal to introduce direct write-offs for machinery investments will have any major effects. "Normally, we lie low when it is an election year, since we are careful to maintain good relations with both the government and opposition," says Bo Rydin. "But this year we will abandon our principle of being quiet, although this could be perceived as going against the Social Democrats. We believe that these are such important issues that we must act." Has Not Received an Answer The letter to Ingvar Carlsson is dated 24 February this year. Bo Rydin has not yet received an answer. Magnus Lemmel, the managing director of the Industry Association, recently launched an attack on the Social Democrats in a "Focal Point" article, and the fact that Bo Rydin's letter has now been made public is extremely irritating to Ingvar Carlsson. "The Social Democrats were praised by the Industry Association when we pushed through the tax reform. Now that we are sticking with the reform, it is apparently not worth anything," he says. "I am prepared to take up a factual discussion with the Industry Association both publicly and as an answer to Rydin." Greater Uncertainty In his letter to Ingvar Carlsson, Bo Rydin writes that the Social Democratic proposals would shortsightedly lead to a further budget weakening "conservatively calculated at 10-15 billion kronor." This means greater uncertainty regarding Sweden's capability of improving state finances and risks leading to "renewed financial concern," in Rydin's opinion. He writes: "The interest rate increases that could be the result further exacerbate the government's financial situation and risk throttling the recovery that has now begun." Undermines Confidence Bo Rydin argues that "in a situation where an upturn in the Swedish economy has been initiated, the additional incentives that are proposed are highly dubious from a purely economic aspect as well as from the aspect of confidence. A further underbalancing of the budget also undermines confidence in the long-range budget policy." The anticipated growth effects in the Social Democratic shadow budget are also too optimistic, says Bo Rydin. "A 10-billion-kronor larger budget deficit is expected to raise domestic demand by not quite 40 billion kronor for the 1994/95 fiscal year, that is to say a multiplier of four, which is not realistic," he writes. The calculated increase in employment by 90,000 people in the Social Democratic proposal is primarily accounted for by postponed layoffs in the municipal sector and incentives for construction, Rydin says. "In no case is it a matter of long-range, stable jobs, but it merely involves postponing a necessary adjustment," he writes.
