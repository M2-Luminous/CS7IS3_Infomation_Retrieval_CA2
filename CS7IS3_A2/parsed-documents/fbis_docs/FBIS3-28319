Among the 1,500 participants in the "Northern Territories Day" rally at Kudan Kaikan in central Tokyo were Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and Koshiro Ishida, head of the Management and Coordination Agency. A slide presentation on visa-free exchanges between Japan and the islands, which were initiated in 1992, and a signature drive for a petition demanding the return of the islands are scheduled for Monday afternoon. Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan and the Habomai group of islets were seized by Soviet troops at the end of World War II. Japan has refused to sign a peace treaty or normalize relations with Moscow without a resolution of the islands issue. February 7 was the date of the signing of the 1855 Russian-Japanese treaty of commerce, navigation and delimitation that set the border between Japan and Russia between the islands of Etorofu and Urup in the Kuril Archipelago.
