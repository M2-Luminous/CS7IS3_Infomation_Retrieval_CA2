The "pirated CD phenomenon" that has recently become rampant on the mainland is a case of such business. On this matter, the vice minister of China's Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television recently stated that China supports the crackdown on pirating records and audio tapes. People hope that the mainland authorities will vigorously and speedily clean up the pirated CD's and not let bad elements ruin China's national reputation. The pirating of CD's on the mainland has indeed aroused much concern. According to an unofficial estimate, there are 25 manufacturers of original CD's in various parts of the mainland. They have 30 production lines, with an annual production capacity of 60 million CD's. Some people think this is an overestimation and that the actual production capacity is under 30 million. Even by the minimum estimate, the mainland's CD output exceeds demand. According to statistics, the mainland public actually owns less than 7 million CD players. Given that three CD's are purchased for each CD player per year, the annual sales volume on the mainland market is about 21 million. In addition, the prices of the mainland's original CD's are on the high side, often going up to 200 or 300 yuan each. A large proportion of CD owners can only afford one or two CD's a year. Estimated this way, about 10 million CD's are sold annually, which is one-third of the annual production capacity. But pirated CD's, costing only 20 or 30 yuan each, can be sold in the tens of millions. As a result of the excess supply of original CD's, either the manufacturer goes bankrupt, or is tempted into illegal pirating. It is said that some audio industry businessmen from Hong Kong and Taiwan have spotted the mainland's enormous potential for manufacturing CD's. They rope in people in charge of CD factories on the mainland, give bribes to local cadres, and ask factories to produce pirated audio tapes and CD's semi-overtly. The reason that some mainland factories knowingly violate the law is because they cannot resist the temptation of staggering profits: Each CD brings 10 yuan in processing fees, and if they produce 3 million a year, they can make 20 to 30 million yuan. This is a huge profit after the costs, outlays, equipment depreciation, and management expenses are deducted. Most of the pirated disks made by such Hong Kong or Taiwan businessmen in conjunction with mainland factories are for the domestic market. Some of them are smuggled to Hong Kong and Taiwan for sale or for reselling to other places. For example, Hangzhou's Huadie Guang Dian [5478 4308 0342 7193] Company imported Taiwanese equipment for producing audio tapes last year with a 110,000 pound sterling investment from a Taiwan firm. It produced 1 million pirated foreign music tapes in a year, most of which were smuggled abroad. Because a foreign firm lodged a complaint against this company not long ago, the city authorities of Hangzhou took action and ordered the company to suspend production and rectify itself. The Taiwan businessmen involved were also detained for interrogation. In fact, most pirated audio tapes and disks are for the mainland market. While original CD's or even audio tapes are too expensive and slow-moving on the market, pirated ones sell very well among those in the lower class. With 20 to 50 yuan, one can buy the CD's of Hong Kong and Taiwan singers and famous foreign singers. In Guangzhou and Shenzhen, the record shelves are packed with audio tapes and CD's of stars from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and other countries, most of which are pirated copies. Each tape sells for 20 yuan and a CD only costs 30 to 50 yuan. Because the International Federation of Producers of Phonograms and Videograms (Hong Kong) lodged a complaint, the mainland recently stepped up the crackdown on factories that produce pirated audio tapes and CD's. Shenzhen authorities have conducted five cleanups so far, confiscated large quantities of pirated products, and punished two pirating companies. The mainland has also cooperated with the Hong Kong side in tracking down smugglers of pirated goods. Any Hong Kong citizen discovered by customs to be carrying pirated cassette tapes or CD's into the territory is subject to a penalty.
