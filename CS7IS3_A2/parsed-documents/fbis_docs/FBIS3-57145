In his interview with Interfax Friday, Abdulatipov expressed the opinion that Yeltsin decided to give up further radicalization of reforms because these moves could pose a threat to economic transformations themselves. He also pointed out that the monetarist policy pursued from Moscow irrespective of regional peculiarities, including republics within the Russian Federation, threatens Russia's integrity. "Both the prime minister and the president understood this principal issue. That is why they have corrected the composition of the government, and, God bless them to correct the reform course," said Abdulatipov. Abdulatipov believes that Gaydar and Fedorov specifically slammed the door before their resignation in order to have "a site" to return to the government. He explained that according to experts' forecasts, 1994 will be a year of hard consequences of the errors in the sphere of economic reforms "and both Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fedorov know this quite well." "That is why Yegor Gaydar will be able to say six months from now, `it was better when I was in power,'" he said. To this effect Abdulatipov declared that neither Yegor Gaydar nor Boris Fedorov had enough courage "to face" these problems. "That is why they have placed all expected difficulties on Viktor Chernomyrdin's shoulders, a bull carrying the Russian economy," he underlined. Abdulatipov indicated that the period to verify reformers' honesty had started after Yegor Gaydar's resignation. "If they (leaders of Russia's Choice) are in favor of reforms they will occupy the most constructive position with respect to the Cabinet's activity. If they are not interested in the reforms' success and attempt to impose their representatives on the reformers' group, then Russia's Choice could become a wild critic of Chernomyrdin's government," declared Abdulatipov.
