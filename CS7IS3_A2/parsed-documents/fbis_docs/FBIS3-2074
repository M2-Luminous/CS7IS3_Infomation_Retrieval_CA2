He stressed the need to uphold high standards in the army's anticorruption and clean-administration work. He called on leaders at all levels, senior cadres in particular, to strictly enforce rules and regulations formulated by the CPCCC and CMC on party style and clean-administration building; and to become models of whole-heartedly serving the people and abiding by discipline. Liu Huaqing said the Third Plenary Session of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection was a very important meeting at which General Secretary Jiang Zemin delivered an important speech. The CMC decision to call the All-Army Discipline Inspection Work Conference was aimed at the timely study of General Secretary Jiang's important speech; implementation of guidelines set forth at the plenary session of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection; and further strengthening party style and clean- administration building in the army in line with the arrangements worked out by the CPCCC. Liu Huaqing expounded the achievements the army has scored in party style and clean-administration building in 1993. He said that as a result of making a conscientious study of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's expositions on enhancing party style and clean- administration building, CMC Chairman Jiang Zemin's relevant instructions, and the CMC's decisions, the army has increased awareness on combating corruption and clean-administration building. Party committees at all levels have extensively strengthened ideological work and improved workstyle, carried out in-house checks and self-correction, and conscientiously investigated and dealt with some major law-breaking and discipline-breaching cases; thereby educating servicemen, helping to improve leadership style, and promote army building in all areas. Liu Huaqing pointed out the need for all comrades in the army to have a profound recognition of the long-term nature and arduousness of strengthening party style and clean-administration building. This year, the army will resolutely implement the CPCCC decision on the anticorruption struggle in party style and clean-administration building. He called on the army to gain a new and heightened ideological understanding, and gain new breakthroughs in investigations and dealing with major and important cases; to devote more efforts to important parts and important links; and to make new strides in the areas of establishing systems, and of supervising and checking these systems. Liu Huaqing said with the powerful ideological weapon of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the strong leadership of the CPCCC and CMC with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core, and cooperation from everyone in the army, our army's anticorruption and clean- administration building work will surely achieve new results. Liu Huaqing stressed: Under the new situation, our army shoulders a major historical mission: It must provide a strong and forceful security guarantee for the state's reform, opening up, and modernization construction. This requires us to make ourselves very strong so we will be able to accomplish the tasks given by the state under any circumstances. The fact the CPCCC set clear demands on the army to stand at the forefront of building socialist spiritual civilization demonstrates a high degree of trust in it. The CPCCC set very high demands on army building. As party style and clean- administration building are important for building spiritual civilization, it is natural for the army to do an even better job in this area. Therefore, party committees and leaders at all levels must uphold high standards, make strict demands, and further enhance their awareness and sense of responsibility in fighting corruption and building a clean-administration. Liu Huaqing pointed out: The party committee is the key to doing a good party-style job in a unit. If a party committee is strong, it will be able to consolidate the fruits of the anticorruption and clean-administration efforts; even if problems arise, a strong party committee will solve them easily. Criticism and self-criticism sessions should be conducted within the party. We should oppose liberalism [zi you zhu yi]. Opposition to liberalism is the excellent tradition of our party and our army, and we must continuously carry forward that excellent tradition under the current new situation of anticorruption and clean-administration building. It is necessary for party committees at all levels to implement the party's system of democratic centralism and organizational life. Party secretaries and deputy secretaries of party committees must uphold principles, take the lead in stressing party spirit, and in organizing criticism and self-criticism sessions. When touching on the need for leading cadres to set exemplary roles in party style and clean-administration building, Liu Huaqing said senior cadres in the army must foster the concept of taking the interests of the whole into account and strictly abide by political discipline. They must resolutely implement all decisions reached by the CPCCC and CMC; absolutely refrain from doing things which are definitely banned by law; honestly execute whatever the system dictates; and genuinely speak and act in line with the CPCCC politically, ideologically, and in action. Leading cadres, senior cadres in particular, must be consistent in their speech and behavior when it comes to the matter of honestly fulfilling their official duties and of practising self-discipline; they must practice what they advocate. They must strictly enforce systems and regulations worked out by the CPCCC and CMC on party style and clean-administration building; they must be models of whole-heartedly serving the people and of enforcing discipline. The All-Army Discipline Inspection Work Conference opened on 25 February in Beijing. The major purpose of the conference was to sum up and analyze the army's anticorruption and clean-administration building work in 1993, particularly its experience in implementing the arrangements mapped out by the CPCCC and CMC on anticorruption and clean-administration building work; and to study and arrange the anticorruption and clean-administration building work for the army in 1994. Zhou Ziyu, secretary of the CMC commission for discipline inspection and deputy director of the People's Liberation Army [PLA] General Political Department, delivered a work report. Zhang Zhen, Chi Haotian, Zhang Wannian, Fu Quanyou, and others attended today's meeting. Also attending today's meeting were responsible comrades from the major units of the PLA General Staff Department, General Political Department, and General Logistics Department in Beijing; discipline inspection commission members from the military system; discipline inspection commission members from the CMC; major units from the army; and secretaries and discipline inspection heads of the discipline inspection commission of the armed police units.
