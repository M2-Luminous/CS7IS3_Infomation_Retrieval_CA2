During the meeting Aliyev said that the Azeri side comes out for the solution of the Karabakh conflict by means of international organisations and welcomes the presence of international forces. Aliyev pointed out that "once Baku realised the importance of reconciliation, one can say that we have approached a final solution of this problem." Aliyev pointed out the importance of the realisation of the closeness of positions on concrete matters which recently appeared, taking into account the complexity of the situation for each side concerned. The Azeri president expressed satisfaction at close interaction between Russia and the CSCE. For his part, Eliasson said that they are as close to the settlement of the Azeri-Armenian conflict as never before. It is important not to miss the chance, he said. In his opinion, there are a number of factors offering a real chance for the settlement of the conflict: There is a good alliance of leaders capable of taking bold decisions; CSCE streamlines cooperation with Russia in the negotiating process, in particular, as far as the deployment of observers in the zone of the conflict is concerned; the activities of the Minsk Group are supported by CSCE countries. Eliasson believes it is important to strengthen the regime of the ceasefire by means of a mechanism of monitoring with the CSCE participation, to work out joint measures for the comprehensive implementation of given tasks. All this was reflected in the document worked out by the Minsk Group, which was submitted to the Azeri and Armenian sides, taking into account Azerbaijan's proposals.
