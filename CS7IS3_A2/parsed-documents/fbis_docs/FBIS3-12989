Demonstrators called on the government to evacuate Jews from Hebron, to take steps to renew the peace talks, and to lift the closure on the territories. The demonstration was organized by Peace Now and Arab local council leaders. [passage omitted] PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat's adviser Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi says the evacuation of Jews from Hebron is a necessary first step to the renewal of peace talks. Al-Tibi was asked by our correspondent Dani Gur-Arye at the demonstration in Tel Aviv last night when the PLO will agree to return to the bargaining table: [Begin recording] [Al-Tibi] I don't know, it depends on the decisions of the Government of Israel. The most and cardinal issue now is security for Palestinian civilians. It was proven that Palestinians are exposed to attacks by settlers, massacred, and this issue -- security for Palestinians -- should be immediately treated. Settlements and settlers should be disarmed and dismantled immediately, especially settlements inside the heart of the Palestinian population. This is a good message, a good signal from the people here in Israel, both Jews and Arabs, for the government of Israel, that it should do what she can do to immediately evacuate Jews from inside Hebron as a first step in order to improve the atmosphere for peace talks. [Gur-Arye] You are talking about the dismantling of settlements, but that certainly isn't a precondition for the renewal of talks. [Al-Tibi] The massacre created new conditions. Palestinians are exposed now for another massacre. Can anyone guarantee that the Palestinians could not be massacred again? Nobody. That's why we are asking for new guarantees for the Palestinian civilians. The Palestinian leadership is willing to continue the peace talks because it is committed for the peace process, but new circumstances had been created and a new measure should be done immediately.
