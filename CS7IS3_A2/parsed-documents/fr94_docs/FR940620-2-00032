FR940620-2-00032 FR940620-2-00020 2. Tuberculin Skin Testing Demonstration Projects . The purpose of this project is to: (1) develop model tuberculin skin testing programs in health departments and health care facilities, (2) track and monitor tuberculin skin test data and TB infections among health care workers, and (3) pilot a microcomputer software system developed by CDC to assist in the collection, tracking, management, and analysis of occupational TB exposures and infections. Program Requirements In conducting activities to achieve the purpose of this program, the recipient shall be responsible for the activities under A. (Recipient Activities), and CDC will be responsible for the activities listed under B. (CDC Activities). 1. Study on Hospitalization of TB Patients A. Recipient Activities 1. Implement a research protocol jointly developed with CDC for the study of hospitalization for TB. This study will be a prospective study of hospitalization of TB patients. The subjects will be all the incident cases of TB entered in the TB case register during a period of six consecutive months, or the first 200 cases entered in the register from the beginning of the study period, whichever comes first. The grantee will be responsible for appointing someone with public health experience, (e.g., public health advisor, nurse, medical student) to enroll the patients in the study and gather the following information: (1) determine if and when the hospitalization took place, (2) establish contact with hospital clerks to facilitate abstraction of hospital records, (3) obtain informed consent and/or release of record information forms, if applicable, and (4) complete a data extraction form for each patient. CDC will provide training on uniform data collection procedures to be employed in the protocol. A minimum of 80% of the patients enrolled in the study should be followed for a period of 1 year after their enrollment or until completion of treatment, whichever comes first. All of the patient's hospitalizations during that period should be documented. Data to be collected on enrollment include: (a) age, (b) sex, (c) race/ethnicity, (d) country of origin, (e) history of substance abuse, (f) anatomic site of TB disease, (g) HIV serostatus, (h) income, and (i) housing status. Data to be collected for each hospitalization include: (a) admission date, (b) admission diagnoses, (c) indications for hospitalization, (d) type of hospital, (e) days in acid-fast bacillus (AFB) isolation, (f) discharge date, (g) discharge diagnoses, (h) reasons for extended length of stay (if applicable), (i) patient disposition upon discharge, (j) hospital charges, (k) charges per service, including isolation, and (l) third party payer. 2. Develop procedures to adequately monitor patient enrollment and follow-up, data collection, and data management. 3. Develop and implement a quality assurance plan to monitor the effectiveness of protocol implementation. B. CDC Activities 1. Jointly develop a research protocol for the study of hospitalization for TB. 2. Train health department employees in protocol study procedures and data collection forms. 3. Develop a plan for data management, specifically, the methods for data transfer. Develop a timeline for data transfer and submission of quarterly reports. 4. Review site performance and ensure compliance with the study protocol. 5. Conduct data analysis and summarize and present findings. 2. Tuberculin Skin Testing Demonstration Projects A. Recipient Activities 1. Conduct a tuberculin skin test (TST) program for health department personnel with direct patient contact or contract with a hospital to perform tuberculin skin testing of hospital employees. If contracting with a hospital, the hospital should have reported at least 50 cases of TB within the preceding year. In conducting the program the applicant will perform skin testing at one or more health department facilities or hospitals where health care workers (HCWs) are potentially exposed to TB. Where employees have been exposed, the applicant will: a. Perform contact investigations of HCWs exposed to an infectious TB patient who was not recognized and appropriately isolated. b. Collect information on the circumstances surrounding these HCW exposures. c. Initiate appropriate TST for exposed HCWs, including baseline and follow-up testing. d. Clinically evaluate all employees with a TST conversion.
