Nobel laureate in Physics Dr. Arno Penzias, who is vice president of AT&T and in charge of the company's research work, briefed the Chinese guests on basic research and new product development of the Bell Laboratory. Dr. (John Mayo), director of the laboratory, accompanied the Chinese guests to tour the sites of the laboratory where materials such as laser semiconductor, optical fiber, and submarine optical cable were developed. At noon, Zou Jiahua went to Park Ridge, headquarters of AT&T, and met with Robert Allen, president of AT&T. They attended a signing ceremony of an agreement in principle on implementing the memorandum for a comprehensive and long-term cooperation between China's State Planning Commission and AT&T. They agreed that the signing of this agreement would lay a foundation for long-term and friendly cooperation between relevant Chinese departments and AT&T.
