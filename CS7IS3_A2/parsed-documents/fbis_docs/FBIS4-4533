This was decided at a ministerial meeting in response to a request by Economic Planning Agency head Manae Kubota that rate hike moves be screened carefully by the ministries concerned. Kubota said rate hikes should be restrained particularly at a time when the domestic economy is showing signs of recovery, adding that the government should lay down a "unified view" regarding the range and timing of rate increases. Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi urged the government to make clear its stance on the matter, the officials said. Local pay telephone call rates went up Friday along with medical charges. Public housing, highway and subway corporations have announced plans to raise charges in the near future. An advisory panel to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa cautioned last week against indiscreet public utilities rate hikes. Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told an afternoon news conference that the government will study proposed hikes in public utilities rates in line with the expected consumer price rise of 1.5 percent for fiscal 1994. "The government should make efforts to prevent easy rate hikes from leading to the rise in overall consumer prices," the top government spokesman added. Takemura said the government will draw up, possibly next week, a unified view on a host of plans to raise public utilities rates.
