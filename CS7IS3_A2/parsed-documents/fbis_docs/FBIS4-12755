These heroic martyrs fell after they killed more than 15 of the U.S.-Zionist enemy troops and their agents in a direct battle that came in response to the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. Having carried out their combat mission, our heroes were targeted by enemy artillery and air raids while they were returning to their bases. Other members of the group managed to return safely to base. Heroic martyr Khalid Muhmmad Hilal, also known as Abu-Sakhr; heroic martyr Muhammad Mahmud al-Nu'aymi, also known as Abu-Iskandar 'Umar; and heroic martyr Ahmad Nasr Ibrahim, also known as Abu-Iskandar Ahmad, were laid to rest at the Martyrs Cemetery at the al-Yarmuk Camp [near Damascus] this afternoon. The funeral procession was led by Ahmad Jibril, PFLP-GC secretary general; Talal Naji, PFLP-GC assistant secretary general; Fadl Shururu, secretary of the PFLP-GC Political Bureau; and 'Umar al-Shihabi, member of the PFLP-GC Political Bureau. Also leading the funeral were a number of representatives of the Alliance of Palestinian Forces, the martyrs' relatives, a number of the PFLP-GC Central Committee members, and a large crowd of the masses of our Palestinian and Syrian Arab people. [passage omitted] Meanwhile, in a funeral unprecedented since 1982, the body of the heroic martyr 'Awni Muhammad Manna', also known as Abu-Nasir, the commander of the heroic al-'Ayshiyah operation, was laid to rest at the 'Ayn al-Hulwah camp following the noon prayers yesterday, Monday. [passage omitted] Our correspondent in southern Lebanon reports that in an attempt to disrupt the funeral, members of the 'Arafat clique assassinated a member of their own clique. However, this did not prevent the masses of our people from continuing participation in the funeral of heroic martyr Abu-Nasir.
