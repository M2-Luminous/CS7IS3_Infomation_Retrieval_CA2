And I'm never going back there again!' Those words ended the interview given to American and Russian newspapers by Academician Aleksey Abrikosov, the head of the theoretical group at the (Argoni) national laboratory in the United States, and the former head of the High Pressures Institute in the Moscow suburb of Troitsk. Of course, the job of heading a famous institute is much more prestigious than that of heading a small group consisting of 14 persons. But all this, in the scientist's opinion, is in the past. What prestige can we be talking about if, during the last years before his emigration, the academician met with his renowned associates Roald Sagdeyev and Yakov Sinayev most frequently while waiting in line for groceries? Add to that the incomparable difference in the "equipment level" (expressed that way, in parentheses) between our own laboratories and the American laboratories with regard to computer technology, instruments, and materials, as well the tremendous difference (by a factor of many times) in the salaries, and you will get the answer to the question of "Why do these and other scientists now meet one another at conferences in German and American institutes?" Because the number of specialists from the Institute of Theoretical Physics imeni Landau and the Leningrad Physical Tekhnikum imeni Ioffe is so large that scientific arguments begin in English, but end up in Russian. One would scarcely expect a meeting like this to occur in any Texas supermarket... As Mikhaylo Lomonosov said (incidentally, he too did probationary work abroad), if you lose something in one place, you will invariably gain something somewhere else. The largest "gain" occurred in Germany, Israel, and the United States: many personnel problems were also resolved at the expense of Russian scientists in Greece, Australia, Finland, and Canada. But it is one thing when our professors, like poor relatives, leave no stone unturned at various companies (in the United States approximately one-half of the Russian scientists do not have a permanent job). One can in this instance act a bit arrogantly and offer an academician the job of junior scientific associate. But it is a completely different thing when the same "oppressed and outraged" individual is invited to take a managerial chair somewhere in a "threshold" country (that is, a place where nuclear weapons are being developed). Of course, the number of people who have set out for the "threshold" third countries is definitely not a million (the Americans were afraid of that number) or even a thousand: last year Iran "bought" approximately 50 specialists for $5000 a month to assemble nuclear warheads; Libya "bought" specialists from the Kurchatov Institute to work within the confines of one project near the Gulf of Sidra for $100,000; Algeria, Ukrainian specialists to develop a nuclear power plant... They barely managed to remove from an aircraft a group of engineers who were departing for North Korea to work in accordance with a contract... According to evaluations given by the RAN [Russian Academy of Sciences] Institute of Comparative Political Studies, the intellectual migration from Russia in 1993-1995, with various alternatives in the development of the political and economic situation in the country, can constitute from 90,000 to 600,000 specialists with higher education. We might note that this is with higher education in general, where there already a million nuclear scientists (although just one smart professor, by his departure, can considerably mix up the politicians' cards). At the same time the internal drain, the move of former scientists into commercial kiosks, shops, and simply to the church porch, will be several times greater --from 300,000 to 2 million. That is, at the maximum we can lose during that three-year period no more than 2.6 million scientists, and as a minimum... just 390,000? "Rumors about the demise of Russian science are greatly exaggerated. But it actually has been knocked flat on its back and is scarcely breathing" -- one can understand the restrained "optimism" of I. Goldmen, the general director of the international ScienceInform Agency, since, with the favorable development of events, Russia may end up, as a result of the "brain drain"... on the positive side of the ledger! It is expected that from 200,000 to 500,000 Russian-speaking specialists from the near abroad will emigrate to Russia, but "nowhere farther than that." True, for us there is no hope that at least they will self-relentlessly throw themselves into the breach in Russian science. Intelligent planning does exist in a free market economy: relying on forecasts of a Russian "brain drain," a number of countries have already reduced the number of students studying a number of specialties. Why study for five to ten years and spend money on a young specialist, when you can get, from distant and mysterious Russia, one who is already more experienced and also... a bit cheaper? This is also, of course, a counteraction to this process: hundreds of Russian scientific "masters" are already getting salary increases as a result of their title and also "for nondeparture," and thousands of scientists of a slightly lesser rank are receiving money from the state budget, while the scientific institutions themselves are attempting at any cost, by using true statements or false ones, to get bank credit. But how serious are these actions? According to evaluations made the European Council's Commission on Education, the loss from the "brain drain" will constitute for Russia $50 billion! In the meantime, however, in order to avoid those losses, we have expended amounts of money that are smaller by a factor of hundreds or thousands. That means that, with the passage of time, we will be like the miser in the famous saying, and will end up paying twice as much. But even this is not the most important thing. If, for a long, long time you remove from any country the most intelligent people, as a result of the process of selection you will have a situation in that country in which, as the Europeans say, "the only thing left between their ears will be hair!"
