Lopo do Nascimento was in Namibia to discuss military cooperation. Last week, the governor of Jamba said the Namibian Government had installed a Soviet-made radar system along the border with Angola. Asked to comment whether those developments posed a threat to the region's stability, a source with the General Staff of the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola said: We will continue to follow a policy of good neighborliness. We will not interfere in the domestic affairs of sovereign governments, though provocations will never be tolerated. The source urged the Namibian people not to allow circles in the Government of Namibia to plunge their country into a senseless war.
