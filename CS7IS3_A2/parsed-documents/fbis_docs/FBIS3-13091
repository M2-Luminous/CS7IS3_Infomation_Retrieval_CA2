The sources told AL-DUSTUR that Fatah and the Palestinian Democratic Party have adopted a common stand that is being enhanced and which affirms that the resumption of the negotiations requires suspending settlement activities, finding the appropriate monitoring means, divesting the settlers of their weapons, expediting the discussion of the issue of settlements, and dismantling settlements that are direct hotbeds of tension.
