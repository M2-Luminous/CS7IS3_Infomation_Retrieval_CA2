FR940810-0-00310 FR940810-0-00021 Sampling Pump Flow Rate Corrections This correction is used if a difference greater than 5% in ambient temperature and/or pressure is noted between calibration and sampling sites and the pump does not compensate for the differences. E:GRAPHICSER10AU94.036 Where: Q act =actual flow rate Q cal =calibrated flow rate (if a rotameter was used, the rotameter value) P cal =uncorrected air pressure at calibration P act =uncorrected air pressure at sampling site T act =temperature at sampling site (K) T cal =temperature at calibration (K) Walton-Beckett Graticule When ordering the Graticule for asbestos counting, specify the exact disc diameter needed to fit the ocular of the microscope and the diameter (mm) of the circular counting area. Instructions for measuring the dimensions necessary are listed: (1) Insert any available graticule into the focusing eyepiece and focus so that the graticule lines are sharp and clear. (2) Align the microscope. (3) Place a stage micrometer on the microscope object stage and focus the microscope on the graduated lines. (4) Measure the magnified grid length, PL ( m m), using the stage micrometer. (5) Remove the graticule from the microscope and measure its actual grid length, AL (mm). This can be accomplished by using a mechanical stage fitted with verniers, or a jeweler's loupe with a direct reading scale. (6) Let D=100 m m. Calculate the circle diameter, d c (mm), for the Walton-Beckett graticule and specify the diameter when making a purchase: E:GRAPHICSER10AU94.037 Example: If PL=108 m m, AL=2.93 mm and D=100 m m, then, E:GRAPHICSER10AU94.038 (7) Each eyepiece-objective-reticle combination on the microscope must be calibrated. Should any of the three be changed (by zoom adjustment, disassembly, replacement, etc.), the combination must be recalibrated. Calibration may change if interpupillary distance is changed.
