FR941206-0-00006 FR941206-0-00001 Starting Materials The starting materials from which the meat from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and meat recovery systems results are intact livestock bones with adhering skeletal muscle and other soft tissue. While it has been reported that it is possible to use whole carcasses, the raw materials for this type of processing generally are parts of carcasses with skeletal muscle attached. Adhering skeletal muscle tissue usually varies in amount, depending on the anatomical origin and size of the bones. Typically, the livestock bones with adhering skeletal tissue applicable to the advances in meat recovery are those where the adhering tissue cannot be efficiently or effectively removed by traditional hand-deboning techniques, and the bones are of sufficient hardness and of appropriate size compatible with the operation of the advanced meat/bone separator and meat recovery system. It is FSIS' understanding that the advanced machinery is capable of handling medium to smaller size bones, e.g., rib bones, button bones, loin bones, and feather bones. The fact that no bone crushing, grinding, or pulverizing occurs limits the types of bones that are used. The bones must be hard enough to emerge from the process essentially intact and in natural physical conformation. In the traditional mechanical deboning process, described in the 1982 final regulations on MS(S) (47 FR 28214), it is possible to use whole carcasses; however, generally, the raw materials for the conventional process are parts of carcasses from which most of the skeletal muscle already has been removed by traditional hand-deboning methods. With the mechanical deboning technology described in the regulations on MS(S), these bones are broken up and pushed under high pressure through equipment with apertures that allow a small amount of powdered bone to pass through with the soft tissue. Characteristics and Composition of Meat FSIS has determined that the resulting product derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and meat recovery systems is comparable to meat derived by hand-deboning techniques, including the use of high-speed mechanical knives and that, as such it warrants classification as ``meat.'' FSIS has also determined that current relevant Federal meat inspection regulations on labeling meat should apply and, as such, the product derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems may be described by any term that accurately reflects it as ``meat.'' Advanced meat/bone separation machinery and meat recovery systems apply a process mechanism that shaves, presses or scrapes adhering tissue from the surface of livestock bones. The machines do not grind, crush, or pulverize bones to separate muscle tissue, and the bones and the interconnecting soft tissues that link bones emerge from the process in a manner consistent with hand-deboning operations that use knives. Meat products derived by advanced meat/bone separation are characterized by identifiable muscle fiber structure, visible differentiation of lean and fat, and components normally associated with and expected in meat obtained by hand-deboning, including that obtained by using mechanical knives. The advanced recovery systems produce distinct whole pieces of skeletal muscle tissue with a well-defined particulate size similar in consistency to (species) trimmings derived by hand-deboning and used to formulate processed meat products. The color of the meat derived from these systems is similar to that of (species) trimmings. 4 As such, the meat derived from the advanced meat/bone separation and recovery systems conforms to the definition of ``meat'' because it has the functional and chemical characteristics of meat; there are no powdered bone or constituents of bone, e.g., bone marrow, that are not in conformance with the definition and expectation of meat or that which would render the product adulterated or misbranded under the regulations. FSIS has determined that, unlike MS(S), consumer expectations of ``meat'' are met with regard to the product obtained from the advances in meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems, because the product's characteristics, in terms of appearance and texture, and its composition are similar to those of ``meat,'' as currently defined in 9 CFR 301.2(rr). 4 Data provided to the Agency by Millbank Processing Machinery Inc., Englewood, Colorado, are available for public inspection in the FSIS Docket Clerk's office. In contrast, MS(S) differs from hand-deboned meat and the meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation due to its highly comminuted, spread-like consistency and its content of varying amounts of bone, including bone marrow, and certain minerals, as well as muscle tissue. MS(S) is amorphous and lacks the characteristic components seen in meat, e.g., muscle fiber, the presence of connective tissue fibers in the way they occur naturally, and distinct lean and fat components. These characteristics render the product materially different than meat.
