The meeting, which is being held in the significant year marking the 30th anniversary of the publication of the socialist rural theses, is a historic meeting that proudly sums up the great victory in brilliantly implementing the tasks presented by rural theses and demonstrates the correctness of the theses and the vitality of our country's socialist rural economic system. It is also a glorious meeting that demonstrates the heroic spirit of our people and agricultural working people, who are vigorously advancing with the revolutionary banner of chuche, and the invincibility of socialism of our own style. [applause] The Central Committee [CC] of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] extends ardent congratulations to all working people and members of three-revolutions teams movement of the agricultural sector, and all participants who are present at the meeting with the pride of accomplishing great feats in the struggle to implement the socialist rural theses with ardent loyalty to the party and the leader. [applause] To properly solve socialist rural problems is an important issue concerning the destiny of the socialist cause. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has for the first time in history set forth all theoretical and practical problems arising from solving the socialist rural problems and vigorously inspired the entire party, the entire country, and all the people to the implementation of the rural theses by presenting the theses on our country's socialist rural problems. He wisely led the struggle to accelerate socialist rural construction and develop agricultural production by personally creating the chuche-based farming method and continuing on-the-spot guidance. With a firm chuche-based position, our party set forth new theory and policy to better solve rural problems in conformity with the demand of the reality to deepen and develop socialist construction; had the entire country seethe with the struggle to implement the theses; vigorously carried out three revolutions--ideological, technological, and cultural--in rural areas; and energetically led agricultural workers to achieve ceaseless innovations in rural works by demonstrating the spirit as masters. Because the chuche-oriented socialist rural theses were implemented in practice under the wise leadership of the party and the leader [suryong], a brilliant example has been created in solving the rural problems, and a change of the century has been brought about in the rural areas in our country. [applause] An ideological revolution has been vigorously carried out in the rural areas, and, as a result, a great change has taken place in the agricultural workers' ideological and spiritual state and the way they work and live. Our agricultural workers have considered loyalty to the party and the leader [suryong] to be the most valuable thing and are preparing themselves as chuche-type revolutionary warriors who breathe and wage struggles by following the party's intentions. Highly aware that they are masters in the rural areas, they have been sincerely working for their fatherland, people, society, and group under the slogan "One for all, all for one." The party's plan to carry out a technological revolution in the rural areas has been carried out successfully, and, as a result, the task to build irrigation systems in the rural areas has been completed on a high level and the task to use electric equipment in farming has been realized brilliantly. Great progress has been made in mechanizing farm work and using chemical fertilizers in farming, and, as a result, our peasants who had to transplant rice seedlings and weed rice paddies by hand and do toilsome work are now doing farm work easily and efficiently. Because the chuche-oriented farming method was implemented, agricultural production has rapidly developed based on modern science and technology. Because a cultural revolution was carried out in the rural areas, agricultural workers' level of general knowledge and their technological and cultural levels have improved significantly, the ranks of agricultural technicians and experts have increased, a great change has taken place in conditions for cultural lives in the rural areas, and the rural areas in our country have turned into civilized and abundant socialist cultural rural areas. Based on the new agricultural guidance system, guidance and management on the rural economy has been improved and strengthened endlessly; the leading role of all-people ownership in relation to cooperative ownership has been enhanced; and, as a result, major progress has been made in overcoming the differences between the urban and rural areas in terms of types of management and ownership. Counties across the country have been built strongly and are excellently carrying out their mission and role in carrying out the three revolutions. They are also excellently carrying out their mission and role as bases that link cities to rural areas. The socialist rural theses gave our people and agricultural workers the great honor and pride of having pioneered the only correct road in solving rural problems and gave firm belief in the victory of socialism to progressive mankind and vigorously inspired them to the struggle. In the past 30 years, our agricultural working people have contributed greatly to the prosperity and development of the country and to providing better happiness to the people by blossoming new socialist living on the fatherland with a firm belief in socialism and through devoted struggle and creative labor. The victory of socialism of our own style is being reliably guaranteed because we have the most advanced socialist rural economic system and large contingents of heroic agricultural working people, which are being strengthened and developed every day, upholding the leadership of the great leader and the great party with the strong support of chuche-based industries. [applause] The WPK Central Committee highly appraises our agricultural working people for achieving great labor feats in the struggle to complete the tasks presented by the socialist rural theses upholding the leadership of the party and the leader. [applause] To further vigorously carry out the socialist rural construction is an important requirement for highly displaying the superiority of our country's popular masses-centered socialism and successfully completing the chuche-oriented socialist cause. All the party members and working people of the agricultural sector should wage a more vigorous struggle to effect a new upsurge in rural construction and agricultural production upholding the historic letter "For the Ultimate Solution to Rural Problems Under the Banner of Socialist Rural Theses" sent to this meeting by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: The three revolutions -- ideological, technological, and cultural -- is the basic content of revolution to be practiced by the party of the working class after the socialist system is established, and to be continued until the construction of communism. The basic key to win a greater victory in the socialist rural construction is to thoroughly carry out the three revolutions -- ideological, technological, and cultural -- in rural communities in conformity with the demands of a new higher stage. [applause] By deepening the ideological revolution, first of all, party members and working people should arm themselves with a great chuche idea and party's chuche-oriented rural construction idea to vigorously carry out the work of revolutionizing farmers. By strengthening the indoctrination of the chuche idea, agricultural working people should think and act as demanded by our party's chuche idea and chuche-oriented idea for rural construction. They should also deeply grasp and further glorify the proud history in which the world has began under such a chuche ray. Agricultural working people should become deeply aware of the greatness of the party and the leader [suryong] by continuously and vigorously carrying out the indoctrination of loyalty. As a result, they should possess the spirit -- the spirit of endlessly following the party and the leader while sharing their fate of life or death with the party in any difficult situations -- as their first revolutionary trust and hold as their firm faith the truth that our socialism, which is leading the great party, will surely win victory by smashing any challenges and obstructive maneuvers. Along with this, they, by further deepening the class indoctrination, should not forget the class stand but instead strongly keep it all the time as they enjoy their happy life with each passing day. Also, for a society and collective, they should work and cooperate with each other, overflowing with a revolutionary zeal. By vigorously carrying out the technological revolution at a higher level, agricultural working people should further strengthen the material and technological foundation of the rural economy and effect a constant upsurge in the agricultural production. Also, they should promisingly solve the increasing water problems by further increasing irrigation facilities and by consolidating the operation of the already established irrigation system and make the grand circle-style irrigation system -- which was established in our country -- effect a greater upsurge in agricultural production. At the same time, they should actively accelerate field irrigation construction. Along with this, they should properly prepare power production bases, stabilize production, accelerate ongoing power plant constructions, and build many small-, and medium-sized power plants everywhere throughout the country by conducting mass-oriented campaigns. As a result, they should more satisfactorily meet the increasing demands of electricity from rural communities. Today, rural technological revolution is faced with the major task of further enhancing the industrialization and modernization of agriculture. In order to outstandingly carry out the general mechanization and scientification of the rural economy, we should produce more farming machineries of various kinds, such as tractors, and more chemical fertilizers, highly effective agriculture chemicals, and herbicides and send them to rural areas. We should further develop our socialist rural areas to become ideal villages to work and live in by actively expanding the rank of technicians of the agricultural sector through a more vigorous cultural revolution, upgrading the technological and cultural standard of agricultural working people, who are directly in charge of agricultural production, and by establishing production culture and living culture. The entire party, entire country, and all the people should further vigorously push ahead with the struggle to complete the historic task to turn farmers into working class, and industrialize agriculture, while filled with pride and confidence in achieving a great victory in solving the rural problems. [applause] The industry-first policy is the most correct policy that enriches our people's dietary life and embodies our party's idea of strengthening and developing socialism of our own. [applause] Functionaries and working people of the agricultural sector, who have walked along the rewarding road of socialist rural construction while courageously overcoming severe trials and difficulties following the leadership of the party and the leader, should uphold the party's revolutionary economic policy and display the sense of revolution and combat capabilities in the struggle to implement the agriculture-first policy. All the agricultural working people should deeply bear the responsibility of the master who makes sure the nation's rice granary is full and effect a great upsurge in agricultural production by methodically and tenaciously carrying out all farming works in accordance with the demands of chuche-based farming method. Guiding functionaries in the rural economy sector should highly demonstrate the superiority and vitality of chuche-based agricultural guidance system by embodying the demands of the great spirit of Chongsan-ri, the methods of Chongsan-ri, and should be deeply involved with farmers, share joys and sorrow with them, solve their problems with responsibilities, and lead them to implement the party's agricultural plan by setting examples and showing practices. With the principle that industries help agriculture and urbanize rural areas, all masses should efficiently support rural areas so that the party's agriculture-first policy is thoroughly implemented. Rural party works should be more vigorously carried out in conformity with the developing reality. Party organizations should carry out work with human beings and political work, firmly bond the agricultural working people around the party, further strengthen our party's rural bases, enhance our role in socialist rural construction by all means, and firmly guarantee our party's leadership in rural construction. Based on the accomplishments already achieved in socialist rural construction, party organizations and functionaries should diminish the differences between industrial and agricultural economic management standards, and correctly carry out the work to gradually transform cooperative ownership to all-people ownership in rural areas. It is a proud revolutionary trait of our people and agricultural working people to courageously overcome difficulties and trials they are faced with and continue to innovate, to advance toward new victories following the leadership of the party and the great leader under the banner of self-reliance and fortitude. The WPK Central Committee firmly believes that all our agricultural working people would excellently repay the party's trust and expectation by resolutely continuing the struggle to firmly defend and further elucidate socialism of our style under the banner of the chuche idea while firmly uniting around the party and the leader. [applause]
