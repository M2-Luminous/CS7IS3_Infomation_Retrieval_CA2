The letter answers Sobchak's request for additional powers in the fight against crime. But, Lobov said, the Ministry of Internal Affairs must authorize the use of troops under its control. According to Lobov, President Yeltsin was working on a decree on immediate moves for the protection of the citizens' constitutional rights and freedoms from criminal attacks. The decree would lay a legal foundation for the use of army units in anti-mafia operations and in a bid to maintain law and order. Bodies of the executive branch would enjoy the right to commit troops to action. The decree would also grant the executive branch additional powers for controlling internal migration. Draft bills which introduce tougher penalties for unauthorized entry and stay in the Russian Federation, had been prepared and sent to the government. According to Lobov, the Mayor of St. Petersburg can, in his capacity as the chairman of the anti-crime and anti-corruption commission, coordinate moves by law and order bodies and plan long-term and immediate anti-crime actions in the region under his control.
