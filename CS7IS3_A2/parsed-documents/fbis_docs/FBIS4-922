FBIS4-922 "drafr076_c_94006" FBIS-AFR-94-076 Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Urges IFP Support for Election Urges IFP Support for Election MB1904200294 Johannesburg SABC TV 1 Network in English 1800 GMT 19 Apr 94 MB1904200294 Johannesburg SABC TV 1 Network English BFN [Text] The demonstration against the election turned into a celebration near Ulundi today. There was jubilation in the area when thousands of people realized they will be able to vote. In an exclusive interview with the SABC, King Zwelithini said all Zulus should go to the polls next week. Gary Alfonso compiled this report. [Zwelithini] A process has begun which will address the serious concerns of the Zulu nation and of the Zulu monarch, and that the Zulu nation should now fully support this process, including participation of the election in the hope that our claims and demands will be finally fulfilled [sentence as heard]. [Alfonso] Earlier in the day near Ulundi a Zulu and IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] crowd came to the area to demonstrate. They had previously been told not to vote, and to ignore the state of emergency, and to continue their defiance campaign until the IFP's demands were met. But when the large crowd heard the news that the IFP was in the election fold, demonstrators turned into supporters and toyi-toyed [political dancing] in celebration. In probably the party's first election address, IFP Central Committee member Albert Mxwango said his party's performance in the elections would surprise friend and foe. By late afternoon many people in towns around Ulundi had not heard the news. Those who had were carefully optimistic. While most people in the Nongoma/Ulundi area appear positive about their new option, there is still a feeling of pessimism in party ranks that there may not be enough time left to canvas votes, and they says pol?tical activity in the area had been sadly lacking and voter education had suffered directly as a result of that. We just heard that thousands of IFP supporters have converged on Durban city center in what appears to be a spontaneous celebration of their party's participation in the election. It's understood the IFP supporters are to hold a victory march in central Durban in a short while.
