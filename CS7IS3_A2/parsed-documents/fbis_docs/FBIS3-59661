This equipment is a facility equipped with the world's first medical dedicated use accelerator that will irradiate cancer-afflicted areas by accelerating helium and argon ions. Construction has been completed with a total contribution of investments of ¥32.6 billion since FY87. In the future adjustments will be made to the beam line, and this highly advanced device will go on line from March 1994, when clinical therapy will begin. Cancer therapies include surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and while these aim at extermination of the cancer, they are still not decisive. This new device represents the most advanced technology for radiation therapy, and it can treat cancer while sparing normal cells by narrowing the target to the cancer-afflicted portion only. Currently, the Heavy Particle Beam Therapy Network Conference, of which NIRS is a participant, is making progress in planning for the treatment of cancers afflicting specific areas, and treatment of the brain will begin in March. Next, manuals for the treatment of the lungs and the central nervous system will be made, and actual treatments for all three areas will begin in FY94. In 1998, it is hoped that there can be treatment for cancer afflicting 10 different areas. For this purpose, the STA has plans to construct a custom hospital which will be an approximately 100-bed facility that has five stories above ground and one below ground. The STA expects to invest ¥12.9 billion in this, and begin construction in FY94. Also, a Heavy Particle Beam International Clinic Joint Use Center that aims at international joint research will be completed by FY96 with the intention of providing an international base for heavy particle beam therapy. Design funds for the Center will be appropriated in FY94, and construction will begin in 1995. The plans are to encompass 150 researchers at all times by providing a conference room, joint research labs and individual research labs. Along with this, in FY94 the NIRS will begin heavy particle project research which will heighten the therapeutic results of this equipment. Studies are being conducted to initiate four research groups: a three dimensional CT development and heavy particle beam therapy research group; a diagnostic research group; a research group to physiologically investigate the mechanisms for the treatment of cancer; and a physics and engineering research group to physically investigate these mechanisms.
