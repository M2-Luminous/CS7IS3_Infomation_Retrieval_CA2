Thus, Montepaschi [the Monte dei Paschi di Siena banking group] lent a helping hand to a dubious enterprise. With no guaranty and... He was an untouchable. A businessman feared and respected by everyone, beginning with politicians, bankers, and magistrates, on both sides of the Atlantic, in Italy, in the Antilles, in Venezuela, and in the United States. Over a period of more than 20 years, Rosario Spadaro, a Sicilian from Messina, Saro to his friends, had built himself a fortune: casinos, hotels, tourist centers, a small air fleet. All of this at Saint Martin, a small Dutch West Indies island where he had settled in 1979. A few weeks ago, the 60-year-old Spadaro reached his high-flying journey's end. A police boat patrol boarded his yacht off the Antilles and the Messina-born entrepreneur ended up in handcuffs. The Dutch magistrature has opened an inquiry on Spadaro and his activities. But the Italian magistrates also have many questions for him. Last September, in Messina, a pool of investigators conducting an inquiry into an international arms traffic operation served him with due notice of investigation. The charges: Criminal association and corruption. Spadaro has long been suspected of ties with the Mafia. The Sicilian businessman who had settled in the Antilles was well acquainted with Nino Salvo, Cosa Nostra's collector, who was killed in an ambush in September 1992. Spadaro also had ties with Gaetano Corallo and Ilario Legnaro, Catania boss Nitto Santapaola's lieutenants, who, on several occasions, like Salvo, had visited Saint Martin, a tourist paradise that has always been deemed a perfect island for laundering dirty money. Thus, Spadaro, who has always proclaimed himself to be simply an "honest and rich Sicilian," ended up in the sights of the Italian magistrates. Mafia of the Casinos In 1985, Spadaro was questioned by Milanese Magistrate Paolo Arbasino, who was conducting an inquiry on the mafia of the casinos. Meanwhile, Giovanni Falcone was investigating ties between Messina-born entrepreneur Spadaro and Catania-born builder Gaetano Graci. But Spadaro's recent arrest brings another event into the spotlight. A story as complicated as it is mysterious, that, four years ago, triggered the investigation of the Antimafia High Commission. The Commission was headed at that time by Domenico Sica. It all started with a $40 million (over 60 billion lire) public-works contract for the expansion of Saint Martin's airport, a deal in which Spadaro and his friend Vincenzo Bertucci, a consultant of Calabrian origin, based in Rome, were actively involved. There was talk of kickbacks and mafia ties. Several wiretaps revealed that Spadaro associated with Claudio Ciampi, an official of the BNL [National Bank of Labor] in New York and son of Italy's present prime minister, who at that time was the governor of the Bank of Italy. The inquiry ended up buried under proclamations of innocence by those under suspicion, and polemics regarding the wiretaps ordered by Sica. In the wake of the Tangentopoli [Bribe City] cyclone, however, that episode has now resurfaced. In addition to Spadaro, Bertucci has also had trouble with the law. His name has now joined the other names in the caldron of those under investigation in connection with the SACE [Export Credit Insurance Agency] scandal. But there is more. The documents that IL MONDO has been able to examine show that the contract for the Saint Martin airport was financed by the ICLE [National Credit Institute for Italian Works Abroad], which is controlled by the Monte dei Paschi di Siena banking group. To the ICLE, operations like the Saint Martin one were not new. From the investigation of the SACE being conducted by the Rome magistrature, the fact emerges that the Monte dei Paschi group's ICLE, which merged last year with Mediocredito Toscano, played a central role in the financing of many works projects for small Caribbean republics. For example, ICLE had strong ties with Spartaco Ghini, the recently bankrupt Perugia-based builder accused of fraudulent bankruptcy. Ghini was very active in the Caribbean where his enterprises operated for years building hotels and tourist centers, always covered by SACE policies. Among other things, Ghini too had chosen Bertucci as his trusted consultant for these operations. In Saint Martin, however, Bertucci had applied his efforts to favoring Spadaro's friends. But, for ICLE, the airport operation proved a disaster. Actually, work under the project, initially awarded to the Messina-based C&D Construction Company, never even got started. In 1990, a year after the signing of the contract, Saint Martin's governor revoked the work order. Result: The first tranche of the financing disbursed by ICLE, in the amount of $13.5 million or almost 20 billion lire, became an uncollectible debt. Meanwhile, ICLE had paid $175,000 (over 250 million lire) to a Panamanian company, Spantax Holding. The identity of the real beneficiaries of this sum, paid out as a brokerage commission, remains a mystery. In order to reconstruct the succession of events it is necessary to take a step backward in time, and specifically, to the summer of 1989, when a Saint Martin government delegation landed in Catania. It was met by Bertucci, by Spadaro's son, and by representatives of builder Graci. The same delegation also visited ICLE in Rome. On that occasion, the final details of the agreement were ironed out. The ICLE, which had joined the orbit of the Monte dei Paschi group a short time before, undertook to finance the airport construction project in the amount of $35 million. The operation was shepherded for ICLE, whose general manager was then Cesare Brogi, by Raffaele Gambardella, one of its high officials and member of the Christian Democratic Party (for as long as the party existed). Destined for a successful career, he is currently the general manager of SIMEST, the state financial intermediary for support of joint ventures abroad. Bertucci, with his Exen, a Rome-based service company, acted as the middleman. Bertucci being, as he was, in a position to vaunt his first-rate relations with the top officials of ICLE as well as those of SACE and of the Foreign Trade Ministry, his presence in the deal was by no means a casual one. The contract signed, the project was initially awarded to a small Messina enterprise, the C&D Construction Company, with a capital of only 60 million lire. The company was run by an engineer from Messina, Roberto Caligiore, but, according to wiretaps conducted four years ago by Sica's investigators, half the company's capital was in the name of Spadaro's wife. After a few weeks, C&D formed an ad hoc consortium, the Juliana Airport Consortium. For this purpose, C&D allied itself with AICO, another small construction company, headed by a certain Ugo Tortella. Caligiore and Tortella, together with Manlio Bertucci, brother of Vincenzo, were members of the board of directors of the consortium, 15 percent of which was controlled by AICO. This share was later increased to 25 percent. On paper, work was to have started during the first months of 1990. ICLE did its part, disbursing the first tranche of the loan, $13.5 million. The disbursement was cashed directly by the Italian consortium as a down payment on the project. But on the other side of the ocean there had been a change of mind. Via a letter dated 15 November 1990, the Princess Juliana International Airport, the client public-sector company in the deal, notified the ICLE that it had no intention of honoring the contract initialed the year before. The Antilles airport company's board of directors had changed since then and the new board members, according to their statements, had discovered numerous irregularities in the agreement with the ICLE. Cited among these was the fact that Bertucci's Exen had furnished erroneous data on the volume of the work involved. "In the course of the investigation," the 15 November letter states, "the board of directors has further found that ICLE has made payments totaling $13.5 million to the Juliana Airport Consortium. Let it be understood that in the future the airport cannot assume any responsibility with respect to these payments." This amounted to saying that the Antilles government had no intention of paying for the work order, which it deemed irregular. In a subsequent letter, dated 6 December 1990, Saint Martin's representative stated that ICLE had authorized the loan without seeking any information on the financial solidity of the borrower company. A peculiar proceeding, to say the least. ICLE, through its attorneys, formally challenged all the accusations, but to no avail. The contract was broken and the work order revoked. The Princess Juliana Airport Consortium remained de facto a phantom company. A phantom that had walked away with $13.5 million. Without having done anything.
