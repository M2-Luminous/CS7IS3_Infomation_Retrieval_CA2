Until now the main police precincts subordinate to the General Department of Specialized Police [DGPE] have been included on this monthly payroll. There was money enough for the capital's precincts, as well as for those in Baixada Fluminense [region of poor satellite towns on the outskirts of the capital] and in the interior of Rio de Janeiro State. In addition, money was given to the Military Police [PM] barracks and to some sectors of the Federal Police. According to the illegal game accounting, the Civil Police leadership have their monthly earning ensured. The list is so well detailed that it includes all the police inspectors who have occupied important positions in the Police Secretariat. Under Secretary Joel Vieira, for example, had his name included up to October 1993, when he left his position and was replaced by Police Inspector Frederico Henning. Inspectors Paulo Emilio (former director of the capital's General Police Department, who was replaced by Jorge Mario Gomes), and Elson Campello (former DGPE director who was replaced by Marta Rocha) are also included on the list. Rocha's name is not included on the payroll, but the main police organization is included under the acronym DPE [expansion unknown]. The name of the former DGPE chief of staff, Inaldo Santana, is also on the list. Other inspectors who have occupied important positions in the Civil Police, such as Helio Vigio, Antonio Nonato da Costa, Roberto de Castro, and Mauro Magalhaes, were included on the list next to the amounts they allegedly received from the illegal game kingpins. PM Colonels Anani, Arouca, and Lages, in addition to the members of the PM Public Relations Department and of the operations nucleus, are mentioned on the list of those who received bribes.
