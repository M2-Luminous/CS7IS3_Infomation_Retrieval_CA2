According to the Foreign Secretary, Mr. J.N. Dixit, a stalemate persisted on the Kashmir issue during his talks which concluded in Islamabad on Monday. India does not look at the Indo-Pakistan relations through "one prism" of Kashmir issue, though Pakistan considers Kashmir as the "core issue." India is committed to continuing peace process without any preconditions for resolution of all bilateral disputes between India and Pakistan, since geographically the two countries will have to live together as neighbours. This was the approach which India adopted at the seventh round of India-Pakistan Foreign Secretary--level talks that concluded on Monday in Islamabad, according to Mr. Dixit, who led the Indian delegation to the talks, at a 45-minute press conference here on Tuesday. Conceding that there were basic differences on the Kashmir issue, Mr. Dixit stated that there were issues like Siachen, stabilisation of situation along the Line of Control, measures of confidence building problems of nuclear and conventional arms proliferation, maritime boundary, issues of economic cooperation, all these issues were to be tackled for mutual benefit. India offered to prepare a position paper covering all these issues which would be considered at the next round of the Foreign Secretary-level meet. India suggested that the eighth round of the Foreign Secretary-level meet to take place within a period of four months. But Pakistan preferred to keep it "open-dated" and dates to be dependent on "visible Indian response on ground." The position paper would also be presented to Pakistan also on the basis of "realities on ground," Mr. Dixit said. Thus this also has become "open-dated." The position paper would deal with demarcation of boundary in Sir Creek area, deployment in Siachen area. Mr. Dixit said that India did not and would not give up "peaceful process" for resolution of all outstanding problems between the two countries and would continue to pursue that process.
