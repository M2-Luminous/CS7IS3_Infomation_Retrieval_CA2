On 12 May, Minister Olechowski is supposed to deliver an official speech in the Sejm in which he will present the goals of our country's foreign policy. The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MON] stated that one of the main goals of the Polish diplomatic service is to make the Polish defense system compatible with that of NATO as soon as possible. He said that, in its striving for EU membership, Poland intends to take advantage of the period in which the EU will be chaired by Germany. It will want to obtain further commitments concerning Poland's admission to the "Twelve." While speaking about Eastern policy, Olechowski, who has left on a private visit to Moscow, stressed the need to enliven Polish-Russian contacts, so that they could reach the level of development that has been achieved with Western states. Olechowski expressed the view that it must be agreed with Russia that "we disagree on global issues" and that we must try to cooperate in all other areas. The minister also emphasized that Poland is satisfied with the level of cooperation within the Visegrad Group. In reply to a question concerning the chances of Marek Siwiec (of the Democratic Left Alliance) filling the post of deputy foreign affairs minister, the MON head revealed that he likes this candidate for the position. While speaking about changes in the organization of the ministry, Olechowski said that people in the posts of deputy ministers will create foreign policy along with the head of the ministry and will fulfill representative functions in both Poland and abroad. They will not, however, steer the ministry or "any of its sections." Committee Chairman Bronisaw Geremek divulged that one of the problems of Poland's Eastern policy is the stand on the possibility of a conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Geremek said that, on this issue, the opinions of the committee's members are divided. Some of them believe that, if such a conflict erupts, we should keep out of it. Others believe that if Ukraine's independence is jeopardized, it will prove that Russia's imperialism is reviving. Therefore, the committee chairman stated, it is necessary to closely follow developments in the CIS. Geremek stressed that the session of the committee and the forthcoming debate in the Sejm prove that the discussion on our country's foreign policy is becoming increasingly more democratic. Asked why the meeting of the committee was closed to the press at the last moment, the chairman stated that the minister had requested it because he wanted his Sejm speech "not to lose the charm of freshness."
