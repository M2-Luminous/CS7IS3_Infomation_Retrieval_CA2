FR940304-1-00031 FR940304-1-00008 Response: Customs agrees that the ``time of separation'' coincides with the ``manufacturing period''. Therefore, proposed §146.92(p) (now redesignated as §146.92(k)) defining the time of separation has been modified accordingly. Comment: Most commenters favor deletion of proposed §146.92(q) which defines the term ``unique identifier'' (UIN) because this term is already defined in §146.1(b)(19). Response: Customs agrees and, therefore, this definition has been deleted. Comment: Most commenters proposed eliminating proposed §146.93(a)(1) regarding the use of the UIN (unique identifier) because this matter is already covered elsewhere in part 146. Response: Customs agrees that existing §146.22 adequately addresses this matter, and, therefore, paragraphs (a), (a)(1) and (a)(2) of proposed §146.93 have been eliminated. Comment: A number of commenters suggested that proposed §146.93(b)(1) be deleted because zone admittance is already covered in subpart C of part 146. Response: Customs agrees. Proposed §146.93(b)(1) has been deleted. Comment: Most commenters suggest deletion of the requirement that domestic feedstock be assigned a UIN, as provided in proposed §146.93(c)(1), because existing regulations do not require that a Customs Form (CF) 214 be filed on domestic feedstocks. Response: Customs agrees that a CF 214 is not required, and, therefore, proposed §146.93(c)(1) has been deleted. Nevertheless, it must be noted that a domestic feedstock must be assigned a UIN under existing regulations. Comment: A few commenters suggested that references to T.D. 66&hyph;16 concerning the attribution of final product to given feedstock be eliminated from proposed §146.93(d)(1) because this is already discussed elsewhere in the proposed regulations. Response: Customs agrees and, therefore, the proposed language has been duly modified and the section redesignated as proposed §146.93(a)(1). Also, proposed §146.93(d)(2) (now redesignated as §146.93(a)(3)) dealing with attribution using alternative inventory control has been revised to make reference to the use of FIFO; the use of FIFO is illustrated in an Appendix which has been added to the revision of proposed subpart H. In addition, proposed §146.93(d)(3) dealing with ``stock in process'' has been deleted, in concert with the deletion of this term from the definition section; in its place, a new proposed §146.93(a)(2) makes reference to the use of actual production records in attributing product to feedstock. Comment: Commenters suggested that products consumed within the zone should be included in proposed §146.93(e). Response: This suggestion has been incorporated in proposed §146.93(e) (now redesignated as §146.93(b)). Comment: Commenters objected to the language of proposed §146.94(a) regarding the introduction of feedstock into the refining process because they believe it requires a direct identification system. Response: The commenters have misread this section, the purpose of which is to establish the amount and identity of the feedstocks available for attribution during each manufacturing period. The proposed language has been modified to eliminate any such misunderstanding. Comment: Most commenters suggested deletion of the sentence, ``This date establishes the end of the manufacturing period.'', in proposed §146.94(b). Response: Given the proposed definition of ``manufacturing period'' this suggested change has been adopted.
