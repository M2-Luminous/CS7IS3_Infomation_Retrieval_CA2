The president said he was interested in the "peaceful outcome of the war, unleashed by Armenia". He said that "the liberation of the occupied lands is the sacred duty for each soldier". IF Note: The visit by Geydar Aliyev to the frontline zone started last Sunday. According to a spokesman for the defense army of Nagorno-Karabakh the day was marked by the intensification of the offensive by the Azeri Army in the zone of conflict. The spokesman said that Azeri air raids against the capital of the self-proclaimed republic, Stepanakert, three persons were killed and nine wounded [sentence as received]. A source in the Azeri Defense Ministry said that yesterday Armenian units attempted to attack at the southern part of the front in the Fizuli and Beilagan areas of Azerbaijan. Reports from Baku say that the offensive was stopped and the Armenians retreated to the initial positions. Baku observers say that Aliyev's schedule indicates that the Azeri leadership does not stake exclusively on the military solution of the problem. It is expected the subject of the political settlement of conflicts in the region will be one of the central ones during the visit of the Azeri leader to Tbilisi scheduled for Tuesday. The agenda of the talks between Aliyev and Eduard Shevardnadze is expected to include the forthcoming Moscow summit of the CIS leaders on April 15. It is likely that in discussing the problem of a regional safety different versions of the implementation of the CIS collective security treaty may be under discussion. Earlier, Aliyev spoke much about the document's inefficiency within the context of the continuing hostilities in the zone of the Karabakh conflict which provided grounds for speculation on the republic's possible withdrawal from the CIS. A reliable source in the president's administration called those suppositions groundless. He said that Baku intended shortly to urge that the CIS mechanism for curbing external and internal aggressors be put into action.
