Bundles of microelectrodes were used to simultaneously register the activity of several single neurons (up to four) of the monkeys' visual cortex. The pulse activity of each neuron was registered over several hours. At each stage of the visual recognition process, the average frequency of neuronal activity and other statistical characteristics were calculated, and graphs of auto- and cross-correlation functions of neuronal activity were plotted. The number of correct decisions made by the monkeys and their motor response times were recorded. During the course of the study, 212 visual cortex neurons were registered. The motor response times and skill of the three monkeys in differentiating the colors of test rectangles varied greatly. The response time of monkey 1 was 1.5 to 2 times faster than those of monkeys 2 and 3, and before the oxymetacyl injections, monkeys 1 and 2 were could not correctly differentiate colors with a frequency greater than that of random guessing after delays of 4 seconds, whereas the ability of monkey 3 to successfully differentiate colors did not deteriorate to the frequency of random guessing until the delay was increased to 32 seconds. Despite these significant differences between the individual monkeys' skill levels before receiving injections of oxymetacyl, they all manifested identical behavioral and neurophysiological responses to the antioxidant. With rare exceptions, the likelihood of all of the monkeys making a correct color decision increased at all the delay times tested. In the case of monkeys 1 and 2, their duration of short-term memory of information after the oxymetacyl injections increased by a factor of 2 to 4. The time required for a correct motor response after the oxymetacyl injections also increased significantly in the case of all three monkeys. A corresponding significant decrease in time required for the monkey to make an incorrect decision was also noted. All of these changes in behavioral characteristics after the injection of oxymetacyl were accompanied by significant rearrangements of the pulse activity of the neurons of the visual cortex of all three monkeys in all four stages of the color recognition process. The study results were interpreted as an indication that oxymetacyl possesses nootropic properties. The observed behavioral changes following the injection of oxymetacyl were attributed to oxymetacyl's ability to increase the efficiency of control processes such as selective attention and motivation.
