Advani, said today India must convey a "clear and loud message" to all concerned, including militants, Pakistan and international community, that "Kashmir is an inalienable part of the country and is non-negotiable." Addressing a press conference here soon after his arrival from New Delhi, Mr. Advani said "we must tell the United States, which has been trying to pressurise India into making some concession on Kashmir, that India regards accession of Jammu and Kashmir to it as final and irrevocable. He said the BJP was bringing a resolution in the Parliament in this regard and expected unanimity of all members of the Parliament on Kashmir issue. The country as a whole has to dispel the impression of international community that it could pressurise India on any count with regard to Jammu and Kashmir and the countrymen have to see that any compromise on Kashmir will have adverse effect on the country's integrity and unity, he said. The BJP leader criticised the Centre, particularly the external affairs ministry, for its failure to present properly the Indian case relating to Kashmir before world fora. The United States, which favours the idea of independent Kashmir for its own interests, has been making unfriendly pronouncements and so there was no reason why the Centre should not take them seriously, Mr. Advani said. The external affairs ministry could not afford to ignore the statement of United States' officials, including President Bill Clinton, who has virtually endorsed Pakistan's viewpoint on Kashmir, he said. He said the biggest misnomer with the international community was the identity of Kashmir with a section of population in Kashmir valley without realising that Jammu and Kashmir comprises three regions with different religious and linguistics groupings. The Central government should have brought it to the knowledge of the international community along the plight of nearly 2.50 lakh [250,000 thousand] displaced Hindus from Valley due to the proxy war waged by Pakistan. "There cannot be greater case of suppression of human rights that almost entire minority community of Hindus from Kashmir has become refugees in their own country and still the Centre keeps speaking on human rights in an apologetic way," he said. Pakistan is responsible for violation of human rights in Kashmir where so many thousands of people got killed due to sponsored militancy from across the border and security forces were fighting this proxy war with tight hands. Mr. Advani said he met recently two British ambassadors to India and Pakistan in New Delhi and explained them his party's viewpoint on Kashmir. Replying a question on Kashmir, the government, headed by Mr. Narasimha Rao, should quit in view of, what he called, its failure on the Kashmir issue, Mr. Advani said. However, he blamed the Centre for its policy on Kashmir from the late 1989 when the first episode of kidnapping of Dr Rubiya Sayeed, the daughter of the then home minister, Mr. Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, took place. He alleged even on the Hazratbal issue, the Centre acted badly by releasing militants, including Pak officials. Asked if Dr Farooq Abdullah could play a positive role in the present situation, Mr. Advani said "the basic issue is absence of policy and perspective and not the individuals, bankruptcy of policy could lead to more complications as it has been happening all these years," he said. *
