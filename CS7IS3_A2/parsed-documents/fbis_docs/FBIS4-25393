Speaking at a press conference following an one-day NATO foreign ministers meeting, Sergio Balanzino, deputy NATO secretary-general, said that Russia has a special position in Europe and a good cooperationship between NATO and Russia is very vital to the stability and security of Europe. Balanzino said that the alliance welcomes Russia to sign the Partnership for Peace, but he reaffirmed that NATO will not give "the special position" to Russia. He said that the program of the Partnership for Peace will come true, and it is a very satisfying matter for the stability and security of Europe. The Partnership for Peace program provides for broad political and military cooperation, including joint maneuvers and NATO help in defense planning and in converting arms industries to civilian purposes. It stops short of providing any security guarantees, but will allow for eventual NATO membership for some East European nations. If Russia signs a basic partnership agreement, NATO would be ready to broaden cooperation into such areas as nuclear arms and safety and European security issues. The joining of the Partnership for Peace by he former East Block countries will strengthen not only the political relationship but also the military cooperation between the two sides, said the official. In a joint communique released at the end of the NATO meeting, the ministers agreed to develop "constructive relations" with Russia, which they believe can make important contribution to European stability and security. "We wish to develop constructive relations of mutual respect, benefit and friendship between Russia and the alliance," said the communique. During the meeting, a number of other regional issues, including tensions in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in southern Caucasus and NATO's relations with other international institutions, were also discussed. Foreign ministers from 41 member states of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council will meet here Friday [10 June] to discuss the partnership between NATO member states and newly jointed countries.
