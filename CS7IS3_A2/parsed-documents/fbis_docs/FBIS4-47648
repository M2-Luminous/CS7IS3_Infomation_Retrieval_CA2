FBIS TRENDS-27MAY94-IRAQ-YEMEN Baghdad Supports Salih Victory in Yemen Baghdad Supports Salih Victory in Yemen SUMMARY Iraqi leaders and media have vigorously supported Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's use of force to crush the forces of Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bidh, and have blamed the fighting in Yemen on a U.S.-Saudi-Kuwaiti conspiracy to break up Yemeni unity. President Saddam Husayn's perception of the intra-Yemeni war as a proxy conflict with Saudi Arabia, in which his personal prestige and Iraq's strategic interests are at stake, is reflected in the strong and unprecedented public riposte that his half-brother Barzan received for expressing a lone dissenting view on Yemen. END SUMMARY Baghdad signaled its position on 18 April, ten days before the first Yemeni battle on 27-28 April. The Iraqi News Agency (INA) cited a Salih emissary to Saddam as saying that Saddam "had a distinguished role in the realization of Yemeni unity, and that his excellency is still extremely interested in safeguarding this Yemeni Arab achievement" (18 April). Within days after major fighting erupted on 4 May, and within a day of the south's secession on 21 May, Baghdad authoritatively expressed its unreserved support for Salih against al-Bidh in statements by the ruling Ba'th Party National Command and the foreign minister, respectively: -- The Ba'th Party informed "genuinely patriotic and pan- Arab" Yemenis that "we support you in confronting this danger" and in ending "the sedition and conspiracy against unity." The Ba'th Party also rejected "every reason, act, or justification that encroaches on the entity of unity" (Baghdad radio, 8 May). -- Foreign Minister Muhammad Said al-Sahhaf said Iraq "emphasizes its full support for the territorial and popular unity of sisterly Yemen and supports the legitimate and constitutional authority in Yemen, led by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih." He added that "we strongly condemn the ugly secessionist action carried out by 'Ali Salim al-Bidh and his group," which he also characterized as "the renegade and backward forces" (INA, 22 May). Iraqi media blamed the fighting primarily on alleged U.S., Saudi, and Kuwaiti efforts to destabilize Yemen. For example: -- An editorial in the Information Ministry's daily Al- Jumhuriyah claimed that the killing in Yemen had been "arranged" by the United States and its "reactionary" Arab "satellites" -- an unmistakable allusion to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait (INA, 7 May). -- An article in Babil, the daily of Saddam's son 'Udayy, claimed that the United States "provides weapons to, and protects, the separatists in southern Sudan, northern Iraq, and southern Yemen," thus promoting "the spilling of Arab blood" (INA, 24 May). -- In another Babil article, Information Ministry First Under Secretary Nuri Najm al-Marsumi accused "the Saudi and Kuwaiti rulers and the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa" of "involvement in a multi-chapter conspiracy" against Yemeni unity. He charged the Yemeni socialists with "coordinating" with Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and forgetting that they are "no more than tools to destroy their homeland and future" (INA, 26 May). Barzan's Heretical Analysis In contrast to the officially approved propaganda line in Iraqi media, Barzan -- who is an adviser to Saddam as well as the Iraqi ambassador to the UN institutions in Geneva -- presented a totally different analysis in Al-Jumhuriyah (8 May). Without blaming any external forces, Barzan described the fighting in Yemen as "the result of a relationship between two contradictory regimes, which were placed within the framework of unity." Seeming to question the judgment of Saddam, who was the strongest non-Yemeni promoter of this framework, Barzan added that "many people all over the Arab homeland seeking or opposing the concept of unity voiced their doubts" about the project. Barzan's main thesis was that Yemenis have two reasonable alternatives, each of which is far superior to the current war: "Either [incomplete] unity that respects everyone and guarantees mutual rights, or a return to the state of separation and the previous situation." He argued that the Yemenis had made an "impulsive" and "emotional" choice for unity "without paying heed" to "the reality of internal political divisions" and without sufficiently exploring "whether each party is willing to make concessions . . . in order to achieve unity." Seeming to criticize Salih and his supporters, Barzan said the situation developed into "an all-out war" because "some people think it is either full unity or an all-out war," a view he described as "wrong." Apparently showing some understanding for the position of al-Bidh and his followers, Barzan said that "no one can ignore certain realities in Yemen's unity, namely, that some leaders who were addicted to authority found themselves after the unity in secondary positions and were stripped of their actual authority." Barzan added that "any belief by any party that the unity can be saved by force will deepen the wounds and increase the destruction and will make unity a dream that will never see the light." On the other hand, "returning to the situation that prevailed in 1989 means there will be a relationship based on mutual respect and a hope that unity will be achieved one day." Response to Barzan Although Barzan has published unorthodox views in the past, this article is the first to elicit a monitored hostile response. Published in Babil just one day after Barzan's article, the response was almost certainly approved at the highest level since its author, using the pseudonym "'Umar al-Kazimi," was evidently given access to Barzan's article before its publication and would not have dared to attack Barzan without Saddam's backing. Al-Kazimi claimed that it had gradually become clear from Barzan's writings that he has acquired ideas "different from our way of thinking in Iraq" and has moved "closer to the inclinations of persons who live abroad" -- a very serious charge in Baghdad's political lexicon. Denying that Yemen has "two conflicting regimes," al-Kazimi said that "when Iraq was strong . . . Yemeni unity was a model," but that since then "one Yemeni side" succumbed to "Saudi intrigues" and started to move "in the direction of the sides that were hostile to Iraq" in the Mother of Battles. Al-Kazimi placed this change in the context of a decrease of Arab support for Iraq, citing Morocco, Tunisia, and Jordan as countries that have become less neutral or less pro-Iraqi than they were in August 1990. In contrast to Barzan, Al-Kazimi claimed that "the plan being carried out in Yemen today is not just an outcome of the conflict between Yemenis, but also a plan drawn up and studied abroad to divide Yemen." Indirectly emphasizing the conflict's strategic and ideological significance for Iraq, al-Kazimi said that "the existence of a strong Yemen south of Saudi Arabia and a strong Iraq north of it constitutes a strategic danger to the ruling family in the Arabian Peninsula," and added that both Iraq and Yemen cherish "pan-Arab aspirations." In contrast to Barzan's opposition to achieving unity by armed force, al-Kazimi claimed that "no Arab unity has been achieved without the use of armed force" because it is the only way to deal with "egotistical Arab individuals who love shaykhdoms and being a shaykh." He commended Salih for rejecting mediation, which al-Kazimi claimed would have led to Yemen's division. He called the war in Yemen "a full liberation war" and compared it to "the period of treachery and treason" in the spring of 1991, which he depicted as an attempt to divide Iraq into three states. Taking Barzan's statement that "the dream of unity has . become a nightmare, and not just in Yemen" as intended to apply to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and its current domestic situation, Al-Kazimi replied, "No. Never" and claimed that unlike the attempted union of Syria and Egypt (1958-61), Iraq and Yemen each possess "real unity" and that "the firm conviction" of unity will never be shaken. He added, "we totally disagree" with Barzan's thesis. Al-Kazimi seemed to presuppose that Barzan regarded the Mother of Battles as an aberration and Iraq's fault. Thus, he took Barzan to task for saying that 20 Arab states have managed to coexist without fighting by responding that "half of the regimes of the nation turned their armies" against Iraq. He concluded by praising the Yemeni "unionists" and claiming that Yemen can be "redeemed" only by "bloodshed" and "sacrifices." Background The line that Saudi Arabia and the United States are seeking to destabilize Yemen has appeared in Baghdad media since 1992. For example: -- In May 1992, the party daily Al-Thawrah claimed that as part of an "American plan" to "punish Yemen for its support of Iraq," Washington's "main agent [King] Fahd" was working "to destroy Yemen politically and economically" (INA, 20 May 1992). -- In May 1993, an editorial in Babil accused Saudi Arabia and the United States of "systematic and comprehensive action to remove the Yemeni leadership and undermine Yemeni unity so as to enable reactionary forces linked to them to seize power" (INA, 2 May 1993). -- In November 1993, an article in Al-Qadisiyah claimed that Saudi Arabia had spent large sums "in bribes" for "the perpetration of crimes aimed at igniting sedition" in Yemen (INA, 11 November 1993). Throughout this period, Baghdad has proclaimed its support for Yemen. For example, member of the Ba'th Party Command 'Abd-al-Ghani 'Abd-al-Ghafur, speaking to a visiting Yemeni politician from Salih's party, "reasserted support for, and solidarity with, fraternal Yemen in its confrontation against Saudi plots in an effort to safeguard its national unity, stability, and sovereignty" (Baghdad radio, 8 June 1992). Baghdad has also indicated willingness to show its support for Yemen in a practical manner. After a trip to Yemen in January 1993, Vice President Taha Yasin Ramadan said he had informed his Yemeni interlocutors of "Iraq's constant readiness to meet Yemen's needs in terms of the necessary technical assistance and consultations in all spheres so that Yemen's potential for development and progress may be enhanced." He added that he had discussed "areas in which we could enhance bilateral cooperation to foster a unity of views and close the doors and loopholes to . . . the malicious plots targeting Yemeni unity" (Baghdad radio, 2 January 1993). Implications Saddam's reported statement to Salih's emissary that he is "extremely interested" in safeguarding Yemen's unity -- as well as the unprecedented appearance of a quick rebuff to Barzan's heretical views on Yemen -- reflects Saddam's investment of his prestige in the cause of Yemeni unity and his desire to thwart the Saudi ruling family, which he views as a strategic and ideological enemy that is at odds with a country he regards as a strategic and ideological ally. The Iraqi regime seems to perceive the Yemeni conflict as a continuation within the Arab context of the divisions manifested in the Mother of Battles and would therefore regard a Salih victory as being a victory for Iraq as well. While Barzan's dissent on Yemen cannot be taken as a signal of disloyalty to Saddam, the public airing of such differences within the regime is bound to be noticed by politically astute Iraqis and raise doubts about the ultimate survivability of the regime.
