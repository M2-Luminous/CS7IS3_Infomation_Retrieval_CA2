Sun made the announcement after a joint meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Transportation and Communications Committee and Ways and Means Committee resolved Friday that Sun should resign from his post to take political responsibility for the crash, the worst in CAL history and the 10th worst in the world. Sun said he would be pleased to resign, but argued that he is in no way responsible for the crash. Sun refused to admit negligence on his part and refuted legislators' charges that he has worked for increased profits for CAL, noting that the airline has paid higher interest rates for its aircraft since he assumed office 14 months ago. Sun said that the CAA only plays a judicial role in airline safety and has no control over the competence of pilots. "Regulating pilots is the responsibility of the airline companies," he said. Minister of Transportation and Communications Liu Chao-shiuan did not comment on Sun's resignation, but will have to accept the resignation for it to become effective. Meanwhile, compensation for the crash is turning out to be a thorny issue for CAL. If human error caused the crash, as many experts speculate, families of the victims would be eligible for much larger sums of money from CAL, sources said. Although initial reports have pointed at human error, the true cause of the crash will not be known for two to three months, after an international investigation team completes analysis of the aircraft's flight and voice recorders.
