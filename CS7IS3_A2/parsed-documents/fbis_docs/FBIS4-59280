It set aside a special place for daily meetings at the embassy and appointed an intelligence team that tells the queuing petitioners every morning that "any Iraqi with important information to declare should step forward?!" Eyewitnesses said three Iraqi women stepped out of a queue of 150 persons when they heard the question and were immediately taken into the embassy. That day only these three women were granted visas while all other applications were rejected. An applicant said the U.S. Embassy introduced two surprising articles and questions into the amended visa application forms. These are: Do you have important information [to declare], and do you know anything about underground and terrorist organizations and their places? Applicants say Palestinians, too, might be asked these questions.
