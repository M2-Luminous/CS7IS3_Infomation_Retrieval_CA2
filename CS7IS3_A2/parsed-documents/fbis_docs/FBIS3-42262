The information was conveyed to the security authorities after the recent assassination of the Jordanian Embassy first secretary in Beirut by the Palestinian organization, Hamas [Islamic Movement]. The Hamas organization proceeded with this action after Jordan deported 24 Iranians. However, because of Jordan's stance on the Israeli-Palestinian talks on the Middle East issue, fears are expressed that the incident will not end there. This is why the Cyprus authorities have increased security measures at the Royal Jordanian Airlines offices in Nicosia while police patrols in the surrounding area have also been increased and the police guards have strict orders to keep their eyes open. Measures have also been adopted at other "targets." As is known, Jordan does not have an embassy or any other diplomatic mission in Cyprus but it has a person who functions as a representative. The police have heightened vigilance to avert any possible criminal acts.
