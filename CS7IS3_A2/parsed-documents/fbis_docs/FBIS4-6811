In Kap Choeng District, they were received and given a briefing by Major General Sanan Marangsit, commander of the Suranari Force. According to the briefing, the Suranari Force is responsible for security along the Cambodian border in five Thai provinces: Surin, Buriram, Ubon Ratchathani, Sisaket, and Amnat Charoen. The border in this area is about 800 km in length. The Lao border also makes up part of this length. The border problems in Surin mainly concerned damage from shells from the fighting in Cambodia. Recently, nearly 200 artillery shells landed in Thai territory during the clashes in that country. There were also nine incidents of border encroachment. The Suranari Force has informed the agencies concerned of these incidents in order to protest to the Cambodian Government. There were also 21 incidents of vehicles being hijacked near the border, 19 of these incidents being solved. Interrogation showed that Cambodian soldiers participated in the car hijacks. The Suranari Force commander said trading activities along the Surin border have slowed considerably. The Chong Chom pass in Kap Choeng Distric remains closed. Thai officials have been providing safety for Thai people along the border. It is expected that fighting along the border will continue as long as problems in Cambodia remain unsolved. The foreign minister then proceeded to inspect the situation in Chong Chom pass. He also met with Cambodian vendors selling Thai goods on the Cambodian side of the pass. The vendors wanted Thailand to reopen the border for trading as soon as possible. The foreign minister assured them that if fighting in Cambodia subsides, the Thai Government is likely to reopen the pass. The foreign minister said he will use information obtained during the current trip to improve the overall situation.
