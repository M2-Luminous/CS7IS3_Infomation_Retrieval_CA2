The Romanian side stressed the importance it attaches to developing privileged relations with Germany and showed gratitude for the support that this country granted Romania within the European Union and the G-24 in financial and economic areas, as well as for the support granted to German ethnic communities in Romania. According to information from our correspondent Doina Saiciuc, the German guest stressed that the governmental framework accord on technical cooperation between Romania and Germany that he will sign with Romanian Minister of Finance Florin Georgescu is the first of this kind with a country in Central and Eastern Europe. One wishes to intensify the support granted by Germany to Romania to enable Romania to overcome the difficulties of transition and accelerate the passage to the market economy. Spranger conveyed the German Government's wish to intensify cooperation with Romania in various areas and remarked on the increasing importance that the German Government grants to relations with our country. The guest referred to the visits that the German minister of defense and the federal foreign minister plan to make to Bucharest in the near future. In connection with some opinions that have been circulated lately which reintroduce the idea of differentiation of treatment applied to associated states in Central Europe and which imply discrimination against Romania, the German minister mentioned that the integration into the European Union of associated countries should take into account economic performance criteria and not criteria regarding their association with one group or another. In a statement after his talks with the Romanian foreign minister, Spranger stated that his visit to Romania is an expression of the importance that Germany gives to relations with our country and of the wish to further expand these relations. Referring to the visit he is going to make to projects achieved within the framework of Romanian-German cooperation program in Sibiu and Arad, where he will hold talks with representatives of the local authorities and of the German minority, Spranger noted that discussions will not focus only on German minority issues but will also take into account the interests of Romania in general. A short while ago our correspondent accredited to the government informed us that a technical cooperation accord was signed at Victoria Palace between the Romanian and German Governments. The accord establishes the unfolding of nonrefundable economic assistance granted by Germany to our country. The volume of this assistance is about 250 million German marks. The document was signed by Spranger and Mircea Cosea, minister of state and chairman of the Council for Coordination, Strategy, and Economic Reform.
