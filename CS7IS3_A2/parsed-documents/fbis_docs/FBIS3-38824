In the meantime, the foreign ministers of the European Community are asking that the siege of the city be lifted using any means possible, including air strikes. However, the war is continuing and images of death are continuing to arrive from Bosnia. Antonio Foresi reports from Brussels. [Foresi] It a was long and difficult debate, where moral indignation was not only evident, but also the belief that not replying to the massacres taking place in Sarajevo could lead to a dangerous future for Europe. The conclusion is this: The request that the siege of Sarajevo be lifted immediately, that heavy artillery be confiscated from all the warring sides, and in order to ensure that this happens the request that any means necessary would be used, including air strikes. The European Union has left the task to NATO of serving the disarmament ultimatum and ensuring that Sarajevo becomes a neutral city under an international administration. The terms of the ultimatum, that is the expiry date, the terms and intensity of the armed reaction, and the observance of these terms by the Serbs and the other sides, will be decided by the Atlantic alliance either today or tomorrow. The work will be difficult and complex, and must take into account the land conditions and the dramatic, complex problems surrounding Sarajevo. [passage omitted] We asked Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta if all this would be enough to stop the carnage. [Begin Andreatta recording] I believe that we have got off on the right footing. Naturally as always, when one uses arms or has the possibility of using arms, then one is faced with a difficult and very painful risk. [end recording]
