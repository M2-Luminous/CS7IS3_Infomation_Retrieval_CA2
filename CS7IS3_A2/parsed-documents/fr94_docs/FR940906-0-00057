FR940906-0-00057 FR940906-0-00019 Response. Section 313(e) of the Magnuson Act requires the Secretary to review the feasibility of establishing a risk-sharing pool to provide insurance coverage for vessels and owners against liability from civil suits by observers. This feasibility study will include a cost analysis and a review of potential impact on vessel owners, observer contractors, and observers. The Secretary will not establish a risk-sharing pool if his review shows that comprehensive commercial insurance currently is available for all fishing vessels and processors required to have observers, and such insurance will provide a greater measure of coverage at a lower cost to each participant. As noted in the response to Comment 37, the Council took action at its June 1994 meeting to establish a technical committee to address this issue. Comment 39. Identification should be required for observers at shoreside plants (e.g., vest, tag, ID card), to facilitate their access to confidential information (fish tickets, data on plant production, etc.). Response. NMFS agrees and presently is investigating the feasibility of supplying observers with an ID card that would either replace, or be in addition to, the present letter of certification. Comment 40. NMFS should be more effective in dealing with observer harassment issues as reported by observer contractors. Response. Contractors currently have the ability to deny observer coverage to vessels that have had continuing problems with harassment of observers. Under the fully implemented Research Plan, vessel or processor owners no longer will be the clients of the contractors and NMFS will have greater ability to ensure that harassment situations are handled in an appropriate manner. NMFS Enforcement will continue to investigate reported instances of observer harassment and will take action where warranted. Comment 41. Observer duties should remain unchanged under the Research Plan and should not become more enforcement oriented. Response. Existing observer duties will be unchanged under the Research Plan. Comment 42. NMFS should assess an observer's performance through survey information collected from the industry. Response. At present, members of the fishing industry can and do comment on an observer's performance by calling or writing to the NMFS Observer Program office. NMFS recognizes the need for a more formalized process for providing feedback, and is in the process of designing a questionnaire. Such questionnaires would need to be approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act, even though responses would be voluntary. Comment 43. The Research Plan must be implemented to provide for greater NMFS oversight over the relationships between observers, observer contractors, and fishing interests. Currently, these relationships are compromised and NMFS and the Council have failed to oversee properly the integrity of these relationships. Instead, observer contractors continually exhibit interest in profits before either data quality or observer security. This situation reduces the collection of scientific data by observers to a vendor activity, jeopardizes the safety and well-being of observers, and undermines the credibility of the scientific data collected by observers. Response. The expected change in the relationships between observers, observer contractors, and fishing interests with the full implementation of the Research Plan is one of the most important reasons for implementing it. Under the Research Plan, money for observer coverage will be distributed through NMFS, and NMFS will exercise more oversight through contractual relationships with the observer contractors. Comment 44. NMFS and the Council should analyze the usefulness and economic efficiency of observer contractors. These individuals serve as a third-party conduit of financial payment for observer coverage and the financial resources distributed to them could be more constructively channeled. Response. Under the Research Plan, NMFS could fund Federal employees to serve as observers. NMFS is presently evaluating the feasibility of having Federal observers serve at least some of the observer needs. However, many obstacles exist to implement such a proposition, notably the present effort to reduce the Federal work force. Comment 45. Nonpayment of contractors and observers has been a problem since 1991. NMFS' inaction in not decertifying contractors who do not pay their observers allows these contractors to essentially loan observer coverage to the fishing industry. This situation seriously undermines the credibility of the observer program and requires greater oversight by NMFS. Response. Under current regulations, vessel and processor owners contract with observer contractors to provide observer coverage. NMFS is not a party to those contracts, so has limited ability to enforce contracts between vessel and processor owners, observer contractors, and observers. Under full implementation of the Research Plan, contractors will be paid from the Observer Fund and NMFS will be in a much better position to investigate and act on cases of observer nonpayment by contractors. Changes in the Final Rule From the Proposed Rule This final rule has been revised from the proposed rule to address public comment on the first year of the Research Plan. Neither the Council nor the general public supported the proposed first-year program that would have provided rebates to vessel and processor owners for observer costs, because (1) persons would have experienced delays from the time they paid for observer coverage until they were reimbursed for these costs, and (2) rebates would have been based on standardized costs per observer day. This final rule implements an alternative program for the first year of the Research Plan that addresses these concerns based on the following assumptions and criteria:
