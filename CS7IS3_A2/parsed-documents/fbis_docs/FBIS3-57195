The right-wing opposition, which had been demanding a declaration of intention to join NATO, was somewhat stunned by such a decisive step from the current Lithuanian leaders who, from their point of view, have pro-Russian sympathies. What made the Lithuanian leadership, which is distinguished by a sober, well-considered approach to issues, a habit of not hurrying, and an emphatically good-neighborly attitude to Russia, become the first of the Baltic countries to request NATO membership? What is this: pressure from the political opposition? A change in the political situation in connection with the elections in Russia? Undoubtedly all these factors played a part. Lithuania, irrespective of prevailing conditions, had to choose with whom it wanted to be, and say "yes" or "no" to the North Atlantic alliance. After long hesitations clarity has been introduced, positions have been refined, and the time of uncertainty is at an end. Russian troops are stationed in Latvia and Estonia; hence they are refraining at the moment from officially applying to NATO for membership. Lithuania has nevertheless chosen the path of solidarity with these states. The "Partnership for Peace" program has not been entirely accepted in Lithuania. And many politicians saw in it no guarantees of national security, although President Algirdas Brazauskas has given every support to this initiative, which is based on gradual entry to NATO structures. Lithuania realizes that the republic will not become a NATO member for a long time, that this road is very difficult and full of pitfalls. The Lithuanian statement bears a highly political, even symbolic character, and it would be fundamentally incorrect to see it as a manifestation of some kind of anti-Russian stance. A hardline reaction from Russian representatives will only distance the amicably disposed Lithuanian leadership still further. Politicians from the camp of left-wing forces, especially from the ruling Democratic Labor Party, advocate all-round cooperation with Russia, especially in the economic sphere, and support a balanced, cautious policy toward West and East. The right-wing opposition, which is headed by former parliamentary speaker Vytautas Landsbergis, accuses the ruling party, President Algirdas Brazauskas, Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys, their "associate" Kazis Bobelis, chairman of the Seimas Committee for Foreign Affairs, and certain other influential Lithuanian politicians of excessive tractability vis-a-vis Russia, and even of a secret desire to join the CIS. It is on this line of disagreements that considerably earnest passions are beginning to rage. On the one hand, ardent charges of selling out the motherland and independence are heard, on the other -- categorical assurances of the complete absence of such base designs. The opposition sees the shadow of the Russian bear even in the creation of joint enterprises. The Right's campaign for a reassessment of foreign policy was stepped up after the elections in Russia. Vytautas Landsbergis stated: "The new authorities have tried to reorientate Lithuania's policy toward the East, and now we see just what this East is like." Does the opposition understand that its rhetoric only provokes Russia's radicals? The Left believes that the intransigent Right, which whips up anti-Russian sentiments, acts on the principle of "the worse, the better." In the Right's opinion, this tactic accelerates their accession to power in Lithuania. Algirdas Brazauskas is perhaps the only political leader in Lithuanian whom political opponents are reluctant to criticize. This is the effect not only of Brazauskas' personal prestige but also of reverence for the presidency. That same Landsbergis of the malicious tongue understands that a restrained tone toward the president and his post could perhaps enable him to avoid indiscriminate criticism in the future, should he suddenly become president... Under the Constitution it is the president who is answerable to the country for the state's foreign policy activity. It was Brazauskas together with Yeltsin who, during the recent meeting in Moscow, got the stalled Russian-Lithuanian talks moving again and so enabled a whole package of important agreements to then be signed. As advisers Brazauskas chose Justas Paletskis -- a former professional diplomat and his comrade in arms in the Lithuanian Communist Party Central Committee, where he supervised ideology and culture -- despite the fact that in the difficult days of the former Communist Party he joined the social democrats' party and apparently betrayed his former views. The son of a well-known Lithuanian party figure who was for many years chairman of the Lithuanian SSR [Soviet Socialist Republic] Supreme Soviet, Paletskis is very cautious and adopts a well-considered approach to any problem; in short, he acts according to the principle "Measure your cloth 10 times..." Just as Paletskis was one of the most consistent supporters of transforming the Communist Party into a party of the social democratic type. Paletskis is generally considered a firm advocate of good relations with Russia. His influence on the president is very great. But, as the saying goes, render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's: The president elaborates the strategic directions of Lithuanian diplomacy with his chief foreign policy adviser, but, as a rule, very seldom interferes in the specifics of foreign policy. This is typical of Brazauskas in general. Unlike his predecessor Landsbergis, who wrote his own speeches with his own hand, since he did not like anything that was outside his own direct control, and who liked to give interviews to journalists almost every day, Brazauskas does not tolerate excessive surveillance over anyone, grants more independence, shows trust, and never bothers with trifles, or rather, never expends his energies on affairs not worth his while. Many a politician in Lithuania was greatly surprised when Povilas Gylys, a Vilnius University professor and a man on the whole remote from foreign policy, was promoted to the post of chief of the foreign policy department. In recent years he had headed the department of foreign relations [as published], but he had not made his mark in big-time politics. However, it quickly became clear that the president had made the right choice. Gylys clearly adheres to the foreign policy cause elaborated by the Democratic Labor Party, does not indulge in unnecessary dabbling or "meddling," and has even several times successfully cut down to size impolite right-wing oppositionists from the Seimas rostrum. Gylys is also numbered with the "Russophiles," and is also charged with secret plans for Lithuania to join the CIS and with certain separate deals with Russia. The bitter battle for the foreign political heights in Lithuania is also reflected in the fate of the current chairman of the Seimas Committee for Foreign Affairs (Kazis Bobelis -- yet another highly influential politician). A Lithuanian American, a doctor by profession, who lived in the United States from 1944 through 1992, he returned to Lithuania on the eve of the parliamentary elections. In emigration he headed the Main Committee for the Liberation of Lithuania, an extremely prestigious organization in emigre circles. The committee was dissolved with Lithuania's acquisition of independence and the chairman decided to return to his homeland. His homeland welcomed him unenthusiastically. Bobelis was betrayed by the American habit of calling a spade a spade. He allowed himself to speak scornfully about certain third-wave "Sajudis" people who considered themselves the only Lithuanian patriots. The Right at once recalled his U.S. citizenship, insisting that Kazis Bobelis, as a citizen of the United States, had had no right to take part in the Seimas elections in which he had won his seat. However, the former emigre stood his ground and in the presidential election last February he, the number one staunch anticommunist, supported the former number one Communist Brazauskas. This deepened the split between himself and the right-wing radicals still further. Kazis Bobelis has earned the reputation of a man who is decisive and independent. Not everyone is capable of leaving a home in Florida, where Prime Minister Slezevicius and his family spent the Christmas holidays with him, and moving to cold Lithuania, which at the time was enduring a power supply crisis. As a sensible man, Bobelis cannot fail to see how pernicious the course advocated by some right-wing politicians seeking confrontation with Russia would be for Lithuania. If republic Prime Minister A. Slezevicius, Seimas Chairman C. Jursenas, National Defense Minister L. Linkevicius, and J. Bulovas, leader of the working group for talks with the CIS, are added to the list of major protagonists in Lithuanian foreign policy, the composition of the new coordinating council for foreign policy becomes clear. It is these "magnificent eight" who today determine Lithuania's strategy, coordinate the actions of all institutions of power in the foreign policy sphere, resolve cadre questions, and guide the work of all Lithuanian embassies, six missions, and several consulates general abroad.
