It is the first diplomatic post of this rank in the Kaliningrad Oblast; a German consulate is supposed to be opened there in a few months. On the same day, Foreign Affairs Deputy Minister Iwo Byczewski and Kaliningrad Oblast Mayor Yuri Matochkin signed a document on the establishment of a Polish-Russian Council for Cooperation Between Poland's North-Western Voivodships and the Kaliningrad Oblast. The council will start work in March. The Kaliningrad Oblast, part of the Russian Federation located farthest west and the most militarized area in Europe, aspires to become a Russian Hong Kong. New prospects for Western investors arose in December of last year, when a decree by Russian President Boris Yeltsin exempted their goods from the customs duty. The decree also exempted them from paying taxes for four years. Polish companies are most numerous as far as foreign capital enterprises in the oblast are concerned. However, German investors have invested the greatest amount of money there. According to Polish entrepreneurs working in Kaliningrad, the gap between German and Polish capital is steadily increasing.
