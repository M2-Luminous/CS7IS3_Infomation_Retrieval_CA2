There emerges a strange phenomenon of IOU slips of five different colors prevailing in the realm of circulation. These slips have become the lubricants in China's financial sector just next to the renminbi as a secondary instrument of payment. As an economic center and hub, China's financial sector was quite abnormal this summer. There was a shortage of cash and funds. There emerged a phenomenon of so-called, "All five sons passing civil examination with flying colors" -- namely, white IOU slips, red IOU slips, green IOU clips, yellow IOU slips and black IOU slips. For a short period, these slips have become the lubricants in China's financial sector, next to the renminbi as a secondary instrument of payment. White IOU Slips Owe Peasants Several Billion Yuan 1. White IOU slips. These are IOU slips issued by the state in lieu of cash when it purchases farm and sideline products from peasants. In recent years, the purchasing departments in China's rural areas, particularly the grain and cotton producing districts in Central Plains, are short of funds. They have issued a large number of white IOU slips. When the purchasing of summer grain crops started in June this year, a large amount of funds earmarked for the purchasing of grain crops did not arrive on time. Misuse of state funds is everywhere. The 11 billion yuan earnest money needed for the purchasing of grain crops and cotton in the country fail to arrive on time. According to statistics compiled by the Bank of Agriculture in May, only six billion yuan in cash are available. Since ancient times, the symptom of peasants selling grain to the state but failing to get paid has always indicated that troubled times are coming. News of small scale riots stirred up by peasants to buy chemical fertilizer in panic keeps pouring in from various localities. In this connection, the State Council held a special telephone meeting demanding that the local authorities ensure that funds for the purchasing grain and cotton arrive on time and that the phenomenon of issuing white IOU's must be eliminated. Liu Jiang, Minister of Agriculture, said that all the funds from the central authorities have already arrived. Wherever IOU slips appear, the responsible persons there will be severely punished, he added. Green IOU's Owe Recipients of Postal Remittance Debts 2. Green IOU's. These IOU's are issued by post offices to postal remittance recipients for the money they owe. Such green IOU slips began to appear in Central South, Southwest and North China at the beginning of 1993. They reached a peak during the Spring Festival. For example, a large number of civilian workers from Sichuan, Guizhou, Hunan and other localities rushed to the coastal areas of Guangdong and Fujian to find jobs. When they earn money, they remit money back to their home towns. The amount of such remittances is on the increase every year. As a result, post offices at and below the county level are unable to pay cash to the recipients of such postal remittance because of shortage in funds. Whenever there is a trade fair, peasants often gather around the post office to withdraw money, but the post office is unable to pay in cash. Peasants in some localities are so angry that they break into post offices and beat up the postal clerks. According to a CHINA DAILY report, the situation whereby peasants attack post offices prevails in 11 provinces. A survey shows that there are 200 million green IOU's in Hunan, 300 million green IOU's in Sichuan Province, and each IOU owes 500 renminbi in average. The main reason for this is attributed to the unreasonable form for settling accounts for postal remittance. Due to the fact that various departments fail to recognize the use of post offices as a main channel of fund circulation and that the banks cannot meet the demands of rural post offices in drawing money to pay for the post remittances, postal office have no other choice but issue more green IOU slips. Red IOU's Owe Worker-Investors Debts 3. Red IOU's. These are receipts with red stamps issued by the enterprises and institutions in various localities when they borrow money from their staff members and workers. This is a form of fund-raising from staff members and workers in one's own unit. Officials point out that there are more and more red IOU slips in various localities throughout the country. No one can accurately compile statistics in this connection. In 1992 alone, the total amount of money raised in society reached more than 50 billion yuan Renminbi. It was as high as 20 billion yuan during the first quarter of this year. Due to the fact that red IOU slips constitute an internal fund-raising form in an enterprise or institution, the interest rate is usually higher than that paid by the bank for saving deposits or bond dividends by a large margin. Various units try their best to extend their tentacles to all sectors of the society. The most common form is to exploit peasants. For example, a factory in a certain city in Sichuan Province used the hiring of workers as a bait. As long as a peasant can pay 5,000 yuan, he or she can work in the factory. As a result, it raised more than 300,000 yuan in a few days. This constitutes an irresistible temptation to peasants who are unable to work in the cities for generations. The trend of internal money borrowing is like the Eight Immortals crossing the sea, each one showing his or her special prowess. Some enterprises issue bonds among the workers, while others ask workers to buy shares. Still others pay high interests to borrow money within one's own enterprise. An expert points out that red IOU slips are attractive, but they are extremely risky. Once the borrowers lost their investments, who is going to pay for these valueless IOU's ? It is reported by newspapers that many people have suffered losses in investing their money in private fund-raising campaigns launched by various enterprises. The main reason is that the fund-raising companies make careless investments and fail to retrieve their capital, let alone make profits. There were scores of state organizations and journalist units raised funds within its own organization or unit to make investments in the so-called "Production Enterprises for New Products" and "Bases for Farm and Sideline Products." As a result, they failed to recover their capital. Many of them also used funds to illegally buy and sell foreign exchange, real estate and stocks and shares, and suffered losses. China's largest financial fraud -- the "Great Wall" fund-raising case -- was exposed in July this year. It was a major case involving red IOU slips. More than 100,000 people were hoodwinked, and over one billion yuan renminbi were illegally seized and squandered. The kind of stupidity and frenzy driven by money shocked many people. It was rumored in Beijing that the "Great Wall" fraud was a major case involving high-ranking leaders of the central authorities including Premier Li Peng and his wife and some ministers. Yellow IOU Slips Owe Bank Customers Debts 4. Yellow IOU Slips. These are slips issued by the bank to its customers, when it fails to make payments at their request. Since the beginning of 1993, the amount of savings deposits in rural and urban areas in the country fluctuated enormously under the influence of the fund-raising campaigns, the flourishing stock market and the high inflation rate. A sign of negative growth which was rarely seen for many years has appeared, causing "extracorporeal circulation" of funds and a tight money situation. As a result, it takes more than 20 days to normally transfer funds from one bank to another in the same city. Under the pressure of increasing demands for money and in order to alleviate the situation in fund shortage, the bank does not hesitate to sacrifice its own credit to procrastinate the check clearance procedure. Meanwhile, it issues yellow IOU slips to its customers who wish to draw money from the bank, trying to shift its own difficulties to other banks. As a result, it causes a chain reaction, forcing many banks to fail in meeting their payments. Right now, a "debt chain" has been formed among the banks throughout the nation. Although banks use fines as a principal measure to strictly restrict the issuance of yellow IOU slips, some of the banks still cannot meet the payments, because they cannot receive money they expect to receive on time. Thus it is quite difficult to impose fines on banks under such circumstances. Due to the fact that the bank is unable to collect the large amount of money receivable, it has to extend the number of days needed to deposit the money into its customer's account. It has greatly lowered the rate of fund utilization and economic efficiency. As a result, the credit of the bank suffers a disastrous decline. Thus, in order to ensure smooth production, some of the enterprises, on the one hand, keep a large amount of cash on hand for emergency use, while on the other hand, they try their best not to settle accounts through the banks. They often pay cash to do business among themselves, making the banks even more difficult to operate. Black IOU Slips Owe Debtors of Underground Private Banks 5. Black IOU Slips -- Right now, the industrial and commercial organizations, public security organs and banks have different views on whether or not pawnshops, private banks and private financing groups should be considered as members of the financial sector. As a result, these "financial institutions" have emerged with a legal status of people-to-people loaners. They have become a fashion for a time. People call the deposit slips of these highly risky and speculative "underground banks" as "black IOU slips." Let us take Shanxi Province as an example, pawnshop business booms, and pawnshops mushroom in many counties and cities. According to a rough estimate, there are more than 20 large pawnshops in the province with their branches spreading over 70 percent of the villages and counties in Southern Shanxi. Pawnshops not only attract a large of deposits by paying interests higher than the banks, but also extend loans in various forms. They directly collide with businesses of the local banks. In fact, they have created a situation of "private banks" monopolizing the financial sector. For example, a private bank in Wafangdian, Liaoning Province, has attracted more than 100 million yuan deposits since 1991 in the legal form of people-to-people loans. "Bank Director" Chen Shulan's financial strengths and capabilities to make payments are far greater than the local banks. Even the local state Bank of Agriculture is affected by this private bank. Its customers withdraw as much as over 50 million yuan from the bank. Trying their best to lure deposits with high interests, this kind of private banks are becoming larger and large in scale. However, they often make unhealthy investments, and they have no regular income to pay the interests. Investors often find their deposits irretrievable, causing disputes and leading to murders. Tear down west wall to repair the east wall, they love to play money games of a vicious cycle. Once the dominoes fall, a large number of people with black IOU slips will lose everything they have.
