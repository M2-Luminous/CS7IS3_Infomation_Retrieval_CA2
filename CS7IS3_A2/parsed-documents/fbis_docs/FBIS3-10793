The arrest of former President Luis Garcia Meza has been officially confirmed. The news has shaken the country. The capture occurred in Brazil. But I would prefer that Minister of Government German Quiroga inform you himself, through a special note prepared by Gabriela Orosco at Government Palace. The minister made official what we advanced at noon today. This is the official communique, read around 1230. [Begin Quiroga recording] The government reports to the public the following: 1. Citizen Luis Garcia Meza, former de facto president of Bolivia, who was condemned by the Supreme Court to 30 years imprisonment without pardon, was captured early today in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo. 2. Citizen Garcia Meza surrendered without offering resistance. He was captured while returning to his residence. Garcia Meza was staying in that city with false documents. 3. This has been an operation coordinated by Bolivian and Brazilian authorities working together. 4. The Foreign Ministry is taking steps before the Brazilian Government to extradite Garcia Meza to Bolivia. This is all the information we can release at this time. Thank you. [end recording] This was what the minister of government said in making official what was learned unofficially through the state channel at noon today. Let us ratify the information. Luis Garcia Meza was arrested at Guarulhos Airport -- one of the two international airports in that important Brazilian city -- by the airport police at around 0800 this morning. At the time of his arrest he was accompanied by Gualberto Rico, who was one of his assistants during his 1980-1981 dictatorship. Rico was arrested for carrying false documents. The airport police arrested Garcia Meza on charges of carrying false identity documents. Two possibilities are being studied: first, his extradition; and second, that he be expelled to Bolivia. Apparently the Brazilian Government does not want anything to do with Garcia Meza; it does not want to hold him a single minute longer than necessary, and it might want to deliver him to Bolivian authorities immediately.
