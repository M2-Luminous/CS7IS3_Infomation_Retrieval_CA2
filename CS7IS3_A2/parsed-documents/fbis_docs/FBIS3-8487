What did you begin with? [Wilecki] We deliberated very thoroughly the issue of our country's defense philosophy, alliances, and security systems, and, of course, we also used our national tradition as a basis. It is the General Staff's view that Poland needs an army consisting of conscripts and of professional military, with the length of the basic military service being of one-year duration in the future. As a general rule, our goal is to extend the popular duty of defense preparation to all citizens, and that goal is expressed in the draft of a future law on the popular defense duty. [Lentowicz] Does it mean that you [General Staff] intend to cut down on the current list of possibilities for using postponements of military service again? [Wilecki] We intend to reduce the list radically. It is obvious that some exceptions to the general rule of popular military service must be allowed for purely humanitarian reasons. But what is happening today proves that the law-making agencies that enacted the current provisions, in our view, committed a strategic error. Fifty percent of Polish youth manage to avoid military service for various reasons. [Lentowicz] Professionalization is the other issue.... [Wilecki] We want to achieve a considerable degree of professionalization of the service. Therefore, we will have soldiers of a professional service, a contract service, and an over-the-time service. At the end of 1995, we should reach the level of 16,000-20,000 over-the-time soldiers. That would make it possible for us to assign experienced "experts" to the most modern combat equipment units. When it comes to military units today, only every tenth person who would like to do so has the chance of remaining in the service longer--that is, for another two to four years. When one looks at current price lists, about a trillion zlotys [Z] will have to be spent from the state budget for making all over-the-time contracts operational. By the end of June--that is, after the experiment is over--we will know how to go about creating an image of that kind of service and also how to provide financial incentives for people to serve there in the most unrewarding kinds of posts. [Lentowicz] The Vienna treaties imposed an obligation on us to further cut down on the size of the Army, which now stands at 250,000. How many officers will simply be deprived of their jobs? [Wilecki] Reaching a specific size of the Armed Forces (234,000) and also limitations regarding military equipment also largely determine the future of the internal structures in the Army. One had to come up with new, better, and more effective kinds of measures, and also to see to it that the necessary combat readiness of detachments and subdetachments be maintained during restructuring. As early as 1997, an organizational framework of the Armed Forces will be set up, with the Army's final form being reached in 10 years. We will then have a smaller Army but also a more professional one, and it will also have greater combat and maneuver possibilities. One cannot avoid cuts that will occur on the way to reaching that goal. We must give up the professional cadre, especially in the Army administration and in "logistical" support--that is, quartermaster, medical, and commissary services. Many posts currently occupied by officers will be taken over by ensigns and noncommissioned officers. We are approaching difficult transformations in the most rational manner possible. Reductions in officer surpluses are facilitated by a new law on retirement pensions, which makes it possible to leave the service sooner. Besides, the changes will be spread over many years. [Lentowicz] So we do not face the danger of a rebellion by unwanted officers? [Wilecki] I do not think we so. In the Polish Army, there is no problem with lack of discipline or insufficient subordination. The fact that currently there are 20,000 members of the cadre awaiting apartments or improvements in their housing conditions or that there are many military families whose members do not live together did not have an impact on the needs of the service, either. If only other state structures were in as good condition as the Army, I think our country's situation would be much better. [Lentowicz] During the times of the Warsaw Pact, the Polish Army was supposed to be a home front for Soviet fronts. Right now, getting rid of the asymmetrical dislocation of forces established at the time is a problem. What will change after "Wilecki's model" is implemented? [Wilecki] The backbone of our Armed Forces is made up of land forces that in peace time are concentrated in four regions. The fact that they will be organized into corps-division-brigade structures will make these forces more mobile and also more easily maneuverable and logistically supplied. Air forces are another important element--these are supposed to perform the role of an umbrella for the Republic of Poland during peace time, and they are supposed to be a "shield and sword" in wartime. Unfortunately, that type of military unit costs a lot--supplying new missiles or aircraft means enormous expenditures. [Lentowicz] And yet you began the process of strengthening air forces with cuts and reductions precisely in the area of aerial military units. [Wilecki] As recently as a few years ago, we had almost 1,000 aircraft. Currently, in accordance with the Vienna agreements, we can have 460 at most, so it would be hard to imagine maintaining entire technical supply units or the elaborate services supporting the aerial equipment. [Lentowicz] These days, no one any longer wants buildings and other items left behind by the Army, whereas the Army made a decision, for instance, to give up 20 of its airfields.... [Wilecki] We have addressed supreme authorities to prepare the territorial government administration to receive not only that part of the legacy. It would be a shame if the entire infrastructure were to go down the drain. [Lentowicz] What is the current value of the so-called superfluous military property? Has anyone tried to calculate that at all? [Wilecki] What we intend to transfer to the national economy this year and next is, according to our calculations, worth Z80-90 trillion. That comprises 10-15 percent of the entire military property: garrisons, airfields, and training fields' infrastructure. There are also serious problems. As late as a few years ago, local authorities were pressuring us to eliminate garrisons; they demanded an immediate transfer of military sites, and we defended ourselves. Today, the situation is different: Demands are being made that the Army be present in every small town, every gmina [small administrative units] and voivodship [administrative units]. [Lentowicz] Is there a fear? Of what? [Wilecki] This is not just about anxiety. Apart from a certain stabilization and contributing to a sense of safety, an army is also a factor contributing to the establishment of new cities and towns. It creates "civilian" jobs, and, in small centers, it occupies a significant position on the market in terms of being a purchaser. However, we cannot afford to maintain a military infrastructure this huge. So we are gradually eliminating garrisons in the country's central regions. Last year, we completely eliminated 11 garrisons, five airfields, and seven testing grounds. This year, another 13 garrisons will be eliminated, including some with a substantive historical tradition. We must dissolve 25 garrisons in total and reduce the number of troops in many others. [Lentowicz] Do the cadre, the officers in the units affected, have a clear vision of the future? Do they already know where they will be assigned next? [Wilecki] The answer is yes with regard to a substantial proportion of units that are being established on the basis of the new structure, while the remaining officers will be learning about that in due course. [Lentowicz] Do you not think that the youngest cadre, in particular--that is, officers dating back to the 1980's--who are largely the result of a negative selection, will be able to influence the cadre's quality shortly, and that they perhaps will fail to meet challenges a modern army creates? [Wilecki] Every now and then I hear about this negative selection theory. I am hereby stating officially that there has never been any negative selection in the Army with regard to cadre selection. At least as far as I am concerned, I cannot agree with such statements. You can never tell whether a young man age 20 something will definitely become a general or whether he will burn himself out in the Army as a captain. An army is a tough school of life, and often we are not the ones who decide personally where to go next. During 30 years of service, I have already changed my residence 11 times. [Lentowicz] And yet, many military, in accordance with the spirit of the time, are beginning to regard the Army not as a vocation but as a profession. [Wilecki] I do not think there is anything wrong with that. But still, my experience is that I do not come across subordinates who tell me that they only work until 1500.... That is, I have not come across them from the time I first put on my uniform. [Lentowicz] Army restructuring makes it imperative to make choices. So who will be treated preferentially in terms of jobs or finances? [Wilecki] Reconnaissance and radioelectronic fight units are priorities, as well as commanding systems and those systems that secure the Army's functioning under combat conditions. We will enlarge the entire antiarmor branch and also the antiaircraft branch, the so-called small technologies. We are also concerned with building a popular defense system that would be based on territorial defenses, among others. [Lentowicz] And a Krakow district will have new experiences in that field? [Wilecki] A new military district of Krakow will be the experiment's main site. Within three to five years, we will test new corps-brigade structures in the district, as well as a model of land forces, where air forces would have a significant contribution. We intend to secure maximum aerial mobility and maneuverability of the troops in the region by equipping the units there, among others, with Polish-made helicopters produced by the Swidnik plant. [Lentowicz] That is if appropriate finances can be found for that. [Wilecki] The final say has not been proclaimed yet with regard to the state budget. If the budget really stays the way it is now, including the rigid formula for expenditures that have been imposed upon us, we will have to make substantial changes regarding our purchase plans. That would consequently mean a withdrawal of orders, which have already been submitted to some factories, especially orders for armored weaponry, antiarmor and antiaircraft means, and also other means of a so-called small combat technique. By the way, I cannot reconcile myself with the fact that, through a vote by this or that Sejm deputy who cares only for his factory, we are forced to make purchases of items we do not really need. To make IRYDA the kind of equipment that would make us happy, one must still make a lot of changes in it. For the moment, the aircraft does not meet our expectations. Right now, we are waiting for a satisfactory final offer from Mielec. [Lentowicz] Does the present budget make it possible for you to take any steps aimed at modernizing the Army? [Wilecki] The time has finally come for radical decisions and measures. Our military technology is to a large extent decapitalized. We have argued for a long time now that a budget that equals 3 percent of the GDP would allow us to begin modernizing the combat equipment. We are still looking for internal reserves; however, tightening one's belt is possible to only a certain extent. [Lentowicz] Today it is not only the extra parliamentary opposition that keeps saying that the Army is "becoming increasingly autonomous." You yourself keep the General Staff away from the press--that is, from the judgments of public opinion. Does the head of the General Staff feel that he is fairly controlled by the civilians? [Wilecki] I think the political practice in the recent period has been healthy and rational. If we look at it through the prism of accepted customs here, we can say that the control is full. It is exercised by the president with his office, by the parliament with the Sejm National Defense Committee; the Supreme Chamber of Control has proved its competence for years; there is also my superior, the civilian minister of defense, with his entire very significant apparatus. The spokesman for civic rights also comes to visit our units. Therefore, I believe that there are enough controlling establishments. We propose, however, that these controls be followed by responsible and concrete decisions. This calls for appropriate provisions in the Constitution and other legal solutions. You can be certain that, if the head of the General Staff--let us call him "the first soldier"--has influence on the Armed Forces, all of the important decisions he makes are consulted with his superiors. [Lentowicz] How often do you consult the president? [Wilecki] Not very often. Let us say, as often as is needed. [Lentowicz] Is this the result of the fact that the commander in chief trusts you entirely? [Wilecki] We value the friendliness and understanding of the president toward the Army. The president has done a lot for the Army, and we are grateful that the atmosphere he has created allows us to carry out the transformation of the Armed Forces without any interruption. [Lentowicz] Military people are saying many bitter words about parliament members. The present Ministry of National Defense [MON] head has reiterated them many times in public. Is this not going to be detrimental to the interests of the defense system in the Sejm? [Wilecki] The previous and the present National Defense Committee are making efforts that must be appreciated. I am more critical of various groupings that, in a political fight and to achieve some temporary goals, exaggerate some problems, which are usually of secondary or even less importance and claim that they are strategic issues. This is not conducive to building the image of the Polish Army in the world. I am also often utterly upset by statements of irresponsible, accidental persons, who have not served in the Army and sometimes have had only a fleeting contact with our ministry. I also often reiterate that, in the area of defense, there are issues that are better discussed in the recess of an office, at a closed parliamentary session; we should not reveal our greater or smaller defense weaknesses at an international forum. Interesting is the fact that, whenever we meet with our partners abroad, the Polish Army, not an exaggerated courtesy, by any means, is perceived as a strong, responsible, well-organized partner. Actually, we are cooperating with all of our seven neighbors in the border areas. On the continent, we are looked upon as a considerable, medium-size European army that has temporary problems with technical equipment but that has valuable soldiers at its disposal. In comparison with some NATO armies, such as the Turkish, Spanish, and Italian Armies, we really should not be ashamed. All of those armies, apart from ultramodern technology, have equipment of previous generations; one can even find older tanks, aircraft, or drawn artillery there. [Lentowicz] How should we explain the recent measures that practically subordinate the Military Information Services (intelligence and counterintelligence) to the General Staff and thus deprive the civilian minister of some of the powers he had before? [Wilecki] Special services are an element of reconnaissance, and they are supposed to provide the Armed Forces with all of the necessary information and data. Military intelligence and counterintelligence must first of all be included in the state's defense system--that is, serve the purpose for which they have been established. [Lentowicz] The case of the Military Information Services, transferring educational issues to the General Staff, as well as other steps of this kind lead one to believe that increasingly more prerogatives of the civilian head of the ministry are now being taken away from him and given to the military segment. [Wilecki] There is no use exaggerating this problem. It must be remembered that, in the area of legal regulations, we have not done anything special thus far. In place of a totalitarian military commander, the head of MON, with enormous prerogatives and powers, we once put a civilian person who was entirely unprepared for that. It could be seen every single day that the duties were greater than the capabilities of those people. Thus, every single day people in uniform had to explain certain issues, so obvious to them, to the inexperienced politicians. We lost a lot of energy explaining issues of secondary importance to them; there were many clashes, whereas the main problems remained unsolved. Therefore, I believe that first the powers must be divided very precisely "in high places"; they should be regulated by laws. I want to know exactly what my responsibility is in the area of the state's defense, of which the Army is only a fragment, and what the responsibility of the minister, as well as other cabinet members, is. [Lentowicz] The new bill on the general duty of defense has been prepared in the General Staff, so it does reflect your viewpoint. [Wilecki] This is really a dilemma of our times. However, who else should have drafted this law? The problem was that no one else was ready or able to deal with this matter. We propose that the solutions that have been arrived at in the General Staff now be discussed by politicians. Perhaps we will avoid a legislative catastrophe, which came in the wake of the recent amendment of the Law on General Defense Duty, the programmatic content of which was at that time not discussed with the military. Only now can we evaluate that the authors were guided by wishful thinking, emotions, and not by the desire to approach the building of a new defense system rationally. Instead of a comment, I will only say that, when last year we volunteered to provide politicians particularly interested in these issues with the most fundamental knowledge about the Army and the state defense system, and even prepared for that in the National Defense Academy, no politicians accepted the offer. [Lentowicz] The Army does not willingly accept changes; it has always been a slightly conservative establishment. However, soldiers in barracks have for too long been waiting for new regulations--disciplinary regulations, for instance--that determine the life of military communities in units. [Wilecki] I do not want to make my subordinates happy by force; they were brought up in a certain tradition. I do not want to do that by means of solutions that would not be accepted. The proposals of regulations are currently being consulted on a low level. Now, as for the conservatism, with which the Army feels quite good, I will only say that other armies as well as our state establishments envy us that. In opinion polls, in which the Army has been in the lead for a long time now, this pinch of conservatism is obviously approved of by the people as well. [Lentowicz] What do you think of the political games aimed at introducing another "coalition" deputy minister to MON? [Wilecki] The structures of the ministry cannot be built for the people who come there. [Lentowicz] Does the Army now have any concrete plans concerning the "Partnership for Peace" initiative? [Wilecki] We are now getting down to the practical dimension, related to the implementation of bilateral and multilateral political agreements. In the middle of this year in Denmark and Germany, there will be exercises with the participation of Polish soldiers; toward the end of the summer, maritime exercises will be conducted. Staff discussions on these issues have already begun. We are also planning joint training with the French Army. Today my French counterpart is beginning his visit to Poland.
