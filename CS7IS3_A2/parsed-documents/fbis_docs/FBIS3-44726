They studied and probed into the major plans for accelerating the economic development of the region. Wu Yongshi, president of the municipal science and technology association, chaired the forum. Gao Dezhan extended greetings to the delegates before the forum started. He said: The symposium held by the science and technology associations of various provinces and municipalities and Tianjin is a very good opportunity for us to learn from others. As Tianjin's work still lags behind others in various aspects, we should modestly listen to the opinions of the experts and scholars from various localities. At the forum, experts, scholars, and leading comrades from other provinces and municipalities aired their views freely and, from the perspective of integration of theory with practice, offered many constructive theses on the economic advantages and development prospects of the coastal region of the Bohai Sea; ways of using geographical advantages to strengthen economic cooperation and achieve common development; development of scientific and technological advantages to create new growing points of the economy; and ways of cooperation to open up a new situation. The forum proceeded in a vivid, lively, and warm atmosphere. [passage omitted] Gao Dezhan listened attentively to the opinions of the experts and opinions. He said: The opinions of the experts and scholars have greatly inspired me and helped me broaden my thoughts. I feel very thankful to the experts and scholars for their concern about the development of the coastal region of the Bohai Sea and the development of Tianjin. He said: The municipal party committee and government attached great importance to the symposium on the scientific, technological, and economic development of the coastal region of the Bohai Sea. Accelerating the economic development of this region is a correct policy made at the 14th party congress after a scientific analysis of the overall trend of China's reform, opening up, and economic development. We shoulder heavy responsibility to turn the region into one of the regions to by and large achieve modernization ahead of others. Therefore, we should cooperate to achieve common development. We sincerely hope that other provinces and municipalities will look for more areas where they share common interests in addition to accelerating their own development. These areas will be the starting points from which the development of the coastal region of the Bohai Sea will be accelerated. Cooperation will enhance strength and yield efficiency. Through cooperation, we should supplement each other with our respective advantages and pursue common development. Tianjin has three ideas for the economic development of the coastal region of the Bohai Sea. First, we should learn from the opening up and development of Shanghai's Pudong new area to accelerate the opening up and development of the new coastal areas of Tianjin. Second, Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei should cooperate to build a "Beijing-Tianjin large economic ring." Third, we should expand service to facilitate the development of the coastal region of the Bohai Sea. To accelerate development, Tianjin should provide good service in all fields, promote cooperation through the service, achieve development through cooperation, learn from other provinces and municipalities in the process of service and cooperation, and win others' support and assistance in the process of service and cooperation.
