At a press conference following the rejection of the government-sponsored package of four bills by the House of Councillors, Hosokawa said he will do his utmost during the remaining days of the Diet session to have the package passed. Hosokawa said he has no plans to dissolve the House of Representative for a snap general election or resign over his failure to have the bills clear the Diet. The premier has repeatedly suggested he would step down or dissolve the lower house if he failed to get the political reform bills enacted. Hosokawa said he will seek the enactment of the reform bills through a joint meeting of representatives from both chambers. Under Article 59 of the Constitution, the lower house can call such a joint meeting to reach a compromise on bills rejected by the upper house. The 252-member upper chamber voted down the bills aimed at introducing a election system combining single-seat constituencies and proportional representation in the lower house and changing the system of political fund-raising. The bills cleared the lower house on November 18. A total of 17 upper house members of the Social Democratic Party [of Japan], the largest force in the coalition government, voted against the bills in defiance of the party line.
