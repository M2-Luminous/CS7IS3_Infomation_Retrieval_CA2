FBIS4-15690 "drsov069_v_94007" FBIS-SOV-94-069 Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 Lithuania Board Seeks Funds To Transmit Ostankino, Mayak Board Seeks Funds To Transmit Ostankino, Mayak WS1104091494 Vilnius ELTA in English 2114 GMT 8 Apr 94 WS1104091494 Vilnius ELTA English BFN [From "News Bulletin" No. 474] [Text] Vilnius, April 8, ELTA -- Lithuanian radio and TV board has appealed to the government asking to allot money to re-transmit "Ostankino" TV and "Mayak" radio programmes in Lithuania. The board chairman Gediminas Ilgunas confirmed this in a news conference on Friday [8 April]. If the government approves the offer, "Ostankino" programme would be seen shorter than previously: daily from 18.00 until the end or 45 hours a week. It would cost about 800,000 Lt [litas] a year, Ilgunas said. Programme of "Mayak" radio is suggested to broadcast only in ultra-short range daily from 7.00 to 24.00. Shortening of the programme or refusing it is determined by the fact that "Ostankino" company that had earlier paid for re-transmission of its programmes in Lithuania now refused to do that. At the moment, the company is heavily indebted to Lithuanian communication services. Free time of the 2nd TV channel where only "Ostankino" programmes had been shown is planned to lease for private TV companies in a competition.
