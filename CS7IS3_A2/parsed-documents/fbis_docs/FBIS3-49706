Only if the project were joined by Russia, some security zone could be envisaged, Miklosko said. If, however, the situation in Russia radicalizes through an increase in Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's power, the joint security project would be just a formality again, Miklosko stated. The fact that British Prime Minister John Major and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl failed to mention Slovakia among candidates for NATO membership was not accidental, Miklosko said, adding that conflicts with ethnic Hungarians, political instability, some statements by politicians, in particular by Premier Vladimir Meciar, and Slovakia's endangered democracy are the reasons for this. The opposition Alliance of Slovak Democrats (AD SR), however, assesses the Prague meeting of the Visegrad Four with Clinton positively, AD SR Chairman Milan Knazko told journalists today. He said that he did not conceive Partnership for Peace as a final solution, but as a great opportunity for the future, since cooperation by the Visegrad countries could speed up their admission into NATO. Knazko also said that statements such as that by Transport Minister Roman Hofbauer, published in the pro-Meciar daily REPUBLIKA, "the Czech Republic is changing, whether it wants to or not, from the European heart into the final part of the European digestive tract," do not help improve Czech-Slovak relations. Knazko noted that the AD SR would support the effort by the KDH to dismiss Hofbauer.
