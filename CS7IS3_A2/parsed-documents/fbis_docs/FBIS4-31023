Andrejcak made his comments during an interview with the Slovak regional daily LUC, which carries it today. The changes mean that the ministry's contribution to the funding of the Partnership project will now be up to 4.5 percent instead of the originally envisaged one per cent, Andrejcak says. The promise to send more troops to ex-Yugoslavia and to set up a stand-by battalion available to UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] at short notice will cause extra arms and equipment expenditure, and might compromise the Slovak Army's readiness for battle, Andrejcak says. "Some army functionaries take advantage of Mr. Kanis' unfamiliarity with army codes and customary procedures," he says. In the case of the crash of the Slovak Army's SU-22 military plane in April an investigation report calculated the financial loss and clarified the disaster's causes. "I believe that in this very case some functionaries have tricked the minister (Kanis) as a way of finding an easy way out," Andrejcak says in LUC.
