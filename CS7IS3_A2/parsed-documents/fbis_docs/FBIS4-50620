Both are claimed to be the biggest in the country in the cereals trade and commercial businesses. Addressing the inaugural meeting of the two groups, Minister of Internal Trade Zhang Haoruo said that the two state-owned groups will be the main forces in helping the central government exercise effective macro-control in the two trades. He pointed out that the establishment of the two groups was of great importance to stabilize commodity prices, and to the smooth carrying out of the "vegetable basket" project and grain-supply project -- the two government plans to provide enough food for the people. Zhang said that the Zhonggu Group will mainly conduct trade in cereals and edible oil. It has more than 100 subordinate enterprises. The central enterprise of Zhonggu claimed a registered capital fund of 200 million Renminbi yuan. Businesses conducted by the Zhongshang Commercial Enterprise Group will cover retail sale, wholesale and all other commodity distribution businesses. It has 18 closely-related subordinate enterprises and hundreds of loosely-controlled enterprises. The whole Zhongshang Group reported a total capital of more than two billion yuan, and the enterprise at the core has a registered capital of 150 million yuan.
