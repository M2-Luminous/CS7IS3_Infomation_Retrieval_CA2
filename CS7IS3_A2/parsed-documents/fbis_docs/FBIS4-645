The paper said that senior Ugandan officials had been in a meeting to discuss the possibility of sending troops to Rwanda to halt the anarchy in that country. In a statement issued in Kampala today, the Office of the President made it crystal clear that this is a total fabrication. Uganda, like the other neighboring countries in the region, the statement said, is ready to assist in any way possible in the restoration of peace and stability in the region. However, the statement adds, we stand by our strongly-held view that any involvement in Rwanda by elements other than Rwandan, must be arrived at through either a regional or an OAU decision. This, the statement goes on, is underlined by the recent regional summit which took place in Dar es Salaam on 6 April 1994, when the regional leaders discussed the crisis in Rwanda and Burundi. Uganda, which has always taken a neutral stance in the crisis in Rwanda, the statement declares, will continue to do so. Should we be called upon to assist, it adds, we shall act only in concert with the regional countries or with the OAU. There has therefore been no meeting to discuss the possibility of sending Ugandan troops to Rwanda. The Office of the President appealed to all journalists reporting on the events in Rwanda to desist from the temptation to thrive on the miseries of their African brothers and sisters by using the tragic event in that country to make money through fabricated stories.
