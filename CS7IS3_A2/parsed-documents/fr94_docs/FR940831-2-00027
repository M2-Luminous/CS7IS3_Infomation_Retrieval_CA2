FR940831-2-00027 FR940831-2-00020 •Better serve the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS) by providing inputs at a finer geographic level (Census Division) for two-digit and selected four-digit Standard Industrial Classification codes •Enable the MECS to publish reliable population counts of manufacturing characteristics collected on the MECS forms •Improve the reliability of estimates. As in previous versions, the 1994 MECS will contain five sections: Section I, Non-Combustible Energy Sources; Section II, Combustible Energy Sources; Section III, Fuel Switching Capability; Section IV, Estimated Percent Consumption by End Use; and Section V, Establishment Checklist. In addition, the 1994 MECS will collect minimal information to determine the operational status of the manufacturing establishment for purposes of statistical sampling. As in the 1991 survey, separate forms will be used to meet the special needs of three major groups of manufacturers. EIA&hyph;846A will be sent to the majority of the manufacturing establishments; EIA&hyph;846B will be sent to establishments in SIC 2911 (Petroleum Refining); and EIA&hyph;846C will be sent to all other establishments in SIC 29 (Petroleum Refining and Related Industries), as well as establishments in SIC 24 (Lumber and Wood Products), SIC 26 (Paper and Allied Products), SIC 28 (Chemicals and Allied Products), and SIC 3312 (Blast Furnaces and Steel Mills). EIA&hyph;846A is the most general form and collects the basic consumption and fuel-switching data. EIA&hyph;846B minimizes burden for the refining industry by taking advantage of data already collected by other EIA surveys. Finally, EIA&hyph;846C is very similar to EIA&hyph;846A except that it collects additional information on energy source shipments. Specific changes in data items from the 1991 MECS are discussed section by section below. Section I (Noncombustible Energy Sources): This section will not differ among the three forms. The noncombustible energy sources (electricity, steam, and industrial hot water) will remain as the column headings with desired quantities forming the rows of the table. One question, a checkbox for the source of renewable electricity generation, will be added for 1994. Proposed to be dropped from the 1994 MECS Section I is the requirement that establishments that received transfers of noncombustible energy sources from outside establishments indicate the name, address and telephone number of the supplier. This will result in the removal from the MECS of Form EIA&hyph;846D, a questionnaire that was sent in 1988 and 1991 to company-owned electric generating plants serving manufacturers. The institution and further development of Form EIA&hyph;867, ``Annual Nonutility Power Producer Report'' made the EIA&hyph;846D redundant. Section II (Combustible Energy Sources): In 1994, the MECS will contain revised wood- and biomass-related energy source categories to agree with respondent and data-user understanding of these energy sources. Specifically, •The category ``Roundwood'' will be expanded to explicitly include any wood product (roundwood, wood chips, and bark) generated from harvested trees. •Wood Waste will be termed Wood Residue and it will include byproducts from mill processing (bark, slabs, sawdust, shavings). •``Waste Materials'' will be more specifically defined as wood/paper related refuse. Natural gas is another energy source that will be modified in 1994 to reflect the deregulation of the natural gas industry and emerging purchasing patterns of manufacturers. The MECS will collect natural gas purchases and cost data within the major categories: •Local Distribution Company/Utilities (LDC) •Other Sources (Pipelines, Brokers, and Other). For LDC purchases of natural gas, the 1994 MECS will collect purchases and expenditures for three natural gas service rates: Firm, Interruptible, or Other. For other sources, the quantity of purchases will be collected but not subdivided. However, costs will be collected for three components of the Other Sources purchases total: cost of supplies, cost of transportation, and unspecified costs. Section III (Fuel Switching): Previously, fuel switching data were restricted to fuel switching capability, rather than actual fuel switching experiences. This section will continue to collect information on the capabilities of a manufacturing establishment, however, it will be enhanced with questions pertaining to actual fuel substitution. These questions for each fuel are: •Number of times substitutions occurred •Primary reason(s) for substitution, such as: supply shortage or curtailment of this fuel, down-time caused by maintenance, less expensive substitute, environmental restriction on emissions or waste •If ``less expensive substitute'' was chosen as a primary reason, the respondent is asked to supply a range that contains the difference between the alternative fuel price and the current fuel price as percentage of the current price.
