Kanther condemned the attacks by racist skinheads on foreigners last week. They are a "shame" for the country. However, the interior minister refrained from criticizing the work of the police in Magdeburg on Monday. President Richard von Weizsaecker stated during the weekend that he does not understand why the criminals who were detained in Magdeburg were released again immediately. Kanther pointed out that the draft of the coalition on internal security is designed to accelerate legal proceedings with conclusive evidence. According to domestic-policy experts among the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] and the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP], the so-called summary proceedings will be used both in the fight against violent crime and for the "extension of the reason for detention because of the danger of recurrence." Kanther announced that the law on custody will be more effective in the future. The legal rules on incitement to hatred and violence against segments of the population and on instigation of racial hatred will be expanded. The use of Nazi symbols will be punishable. The law on bodily injury will be tightened. The first and third reading of the draft law will take place at the Bundestag on Friday. In a speech at the Konrad Adenauer Foundation in St. Augustin near Bonn, Kanther described internal security as a precondition for freedom and internal peace. There is no easy solution in the fight against crime, he emphasized. New forms of crime must be combated with additional legal rules. Kanther regretted the fact the package of the coalition does not include the CDU/CSU demand for the permission to tap private residences in the fight against organized crime. "I regret that, but I hope that the coalition partner will one day see the need for this measure." Kanther stated that the government and the coalition are making efforts to adopt a new law on the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation and to amend the law on the Federal Border Police before the end of the legislative period. The cabinet approved the draft last week. However, there are doubts among the coalition that there will be enough time before the Bundestag elections to comprehensively amend the legal basis of the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation. Kanther announced that the "preconditions for practical cooperation among the security authorities" should be improved during the German presidency of the European Union in the second half of 1994. Europe's integration must not have the effect "that borders fall for the criminals but continue to exist for the investigating authorities," Kanther pointed out. If border controls are eliminated, compensatory measures must be adopted. Otherwise there is the danger that "new obstacles" are being created at the borders of the national states. Cooperation with the police in the East European states must be improved. It must primarily be designed to enhance the fight against organized crime, drug trafficking, and car thefts. Smugglers of refugees are to be treated in the same way as drug dealers because "they are driving other people into misery because of pure greed for profit," Kanther stressed.
