During a meeting with the Babil deputy governor today, Halasah indicated that stepped-up hostile conspiracies against the march of great Iraq were the inevitable outcome of the growth of Iraq's pan- Arab role in the efforts to rehabilitate the Arab nation's values and principles and confront external ambitions in the region. The Jordanian minister visited the historical city of Babylon and acquainted himself with its archaeological and historical sites.
