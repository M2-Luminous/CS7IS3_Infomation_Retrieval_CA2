This year alone more than 180,000 officers will be leaving the army, and each subsequent year the plan is to cut 50,000 officers. The independent trade union's task is to uphold these people's interests and provide them with social and legal protection. An agreement of this kind has been signed not only with the Defense Ministry, but with other power ministries as well.
