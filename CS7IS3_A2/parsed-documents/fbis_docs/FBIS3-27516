On the last day of a three-day regular session of the Vienna-based UN organization, Ronald Walker, the chairman of the IAEA's board of governors, said that the IAEA also welcomes DPRK's February 15 agreement to let IAEA inspect seven of its nine nuclear facilities. Meanwhile, a DPRK spokesman told the press here that DPRK's agreement on nuclear inspections has pre-conditions, and that his country definitely rejects inspection of the other two nuclear facilities located in Yongbyon. The DPRK has delayed the issuing of visas to IAEA inspectors because of what it called position shifting by the United States. The DPRK and the United States have been holding talks on DPRK's nuclear issues in New York.
