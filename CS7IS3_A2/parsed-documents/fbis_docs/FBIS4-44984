Political observers point out that the emergence of the new party is the logical culmination of the contradiction within the IUML which has been persisting for quite some time. Over the past two years Mr Sait, who had reigned supreme as the IUML president since 1973, seemed to his party colleagues to be a leader out of touch with reality. The Kerala IUML's objection to Mr Sait's approach and politics have been articulated by the state unit president, Mr Thangal, from time to time. The split, observers feel, was a foregone conclusion after Mr Sait's replacement by Mr G.M. Banatwala as party president in February this year. Holding the Prime Minister and the Congress responsible for the demolition of the Babri-masjid, Mr Sait had been insisting on the withdrawal of the IUML from the Congress-led coalition government in Kerala. But IUML MLAs [members of Legislative Assembly] believe that snapping the alliance would be impolitic as losing the Muslim support would leave the Congress free to woo the majority community more aggressively. Besides, they argued why should they agree to end the marriage of convenience that provided them control of 65 percent of the state's budget and plum ministries, including industry and education. But Mr Sait who had little at stake in the UDF [United Democratic Front] coalition dismissed them as power-hungry politicians and severed his ties with the IUML to set up his own party. In a bid to don the secular mantle, Mr Sait dropped the word Muslim and chose to name his party Indian National League. The party's professed aim is to break out of the minority cocoon and join the secular mainstream and fight the fascist forces gaining ground in the country. But there are very few willing to accept Mr Sait's professed secularism at its face value. Especially in view of the inaugural charter of demands raised by his party which include the formation of a ministry of minority affairs at the Centre, reservations for Muslims in government jobs, dialogue between the administration and the Kashmiri people for a political solution, the disciplining of anti-national forces like the RSS [Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh] (organization of service to the nation), the inclusion of wakf land and graveyard in the Babri masjid site and protection of the mosques in Mathura and Varanasi. These have raised eyebrows in political circles and already cast a shadow on the nascent organisation's professed secular aim. Says Mr Tariq Anwar of the Congress: "If Mr Sait thinks that he can ensure his political survival by keeping the Ayodhya issue alive, he is being foolish. The recent assembly elections in six states have proved that Muslims do not want to submit their destiny to religious leadership and will not follow their diktat." According to Mr Anwar, organisations like the IUML, have ceased to have any relevance and if a united IUML could not progress beyond the backwaters of Kerala, to expect its decimated avatar to make an impact is being plain unrealistic. While agreeing with Mr Anwar that there is no scope for a communal party in national politics, the Janata Dal MP [member of Parliament], Syed Shahabuddin, is not entirely dismissive of Mr Sait's new outfit. Says Mr Shahabuddin, "In so far as it is the launching of a secular party I welcome Mr Sait's initiative. But given his background, Mr Sait will have to prove his secular credentials to be accepted into the national mainstream which does not however mean that he has to stop advocating the legitimate causes of the Muslims. However, we must wait and watch the party's performance before passing any judgment on it." A pertinent question being raised by critics is can a party whose very genesis is based on a religious issue like the Babri masjid be expected to follow a secular path? Mr Sait counters the contention vociferously. "The demand for rebuilding of the Babri masjid is not a religious demand. The demolition was a severe blow to the secular fabric of the nation. To reduce it to a Hindu-Muslim issue is mischievous," he says. As for the other demands, Mr Sait says none of them can justifiably be called sectarian or communal. For instance, the Kashmir issue, the demand for reservation for backward sections of society are national and societal issues and have been raised by other secular parties as well from time to time. "Then why is it that when we raise these issues it is branded communal sectarian demand," he asks. But as rightly pointed out by Mr Shahabuddin it is not IUML's raising these issues but its concentrating only on them in its inaugural convention which has raised doubts about the parties secular intentions. But how does the former IUML patriarch propose to reconcile the party's professed secular ideals with the conservatism and fanatical outlook of the fundamentalists, who form the majority of Mr Sait's following? Mr Sait refutes the fact that the majority consists of extremists. He cites the overwhelming youth presence at the party's convention in Delhi last week as evidence of his support among the younger generation of Muslims which according to Mr Sait is neither fundamentalist nor communal.
