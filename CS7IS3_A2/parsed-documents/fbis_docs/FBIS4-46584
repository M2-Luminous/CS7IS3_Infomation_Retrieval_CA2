In literally one year, the domestic "Cosa Nostra" has progressed from minor stabbings and senseless random shootings to surprisingly accurate explosions in offices and residences, to contract killings carried out with a sniper's precision, to highly sophisticated criminally planned motor vehicle accidents. It appears in general that the amateurs have been replaced by professionals, ones carrying out, rather than merely organizing, the crimes. This has been accompanied by another trend: a lowering of the average age of the criminals. Just how is the youth of the criminals carrying out crimes associated with professionalism? The answer to that question is unbelievably simple. Shadow structures are attempting to involve in "business" the engineer troop, Marine, airborne trooper or, in a word, specialists who have received a particular kind of training in Army service. This is not only a simple solution, but also an inexpensive one, so to speak. Although much has been said about the criminal world's increased interest in servicemen, very few details have been made known. Conventional wisdom has it that the only thing the Armed Forces have that is of interest to the Mafia is weapons. This being the case, preventive measures in effect in units, if any are applied, are based primarily (if not exclusively) on this aspect of the problem. Nonetheless, presently targeted by the Russian "camorra" just as intensively as the above is the Army's cadres. In this connection, criminal agents do not limit their efforts to enlisting the aid of men already discharged into the reserve. Several examples follow. Cadet N. (whose investigation is still in progress) of the Pacific Ocean Higher Naval School acquired the habit of taking his automatic rifle from the weapons room, once a week over a period of six months, with the purpose being - of all things! - providing guard service to narcotics traffickers. Outrageous? This unfortunately is not an isolated case, since other military schools are experiencing this kind of occurrence. This falls under the category of individual "creative activity." Incidentally, there also exists a group activity. It came to light that, until recently, representatives of regional groupings of organized crime were holding conferences on Tuesdays in a Vladivostok stadium. One item unfailingly included on the "agenda" was the question of utilizing Marine servicemen and subunits. Marines specially selected because of their remarkable physical conditioning were tasked with blackmailing competitors, often with the use of force. Made on the Tuesdays was a decision of how to deploy the "rapid deployment group" for the next job. Other examples could be cited. The essence of the activity consists of effective organization, ease of finding willing participants, and relatively low cost of the "workforce." In addition, there is the possibility of using standard issue weapons. The foregoing inspires the domestic variety of the "Cosa Nostra" to mount ambitious searches for enlisting the aid of the man in uniform. Just how is "recruitment" carried out? My work involves meeting various officials, including representatives of the military procuracy. They state that organized crime employs a widespread network of informants and doers. First on the targeting list are persons who have a criminal record prior to entering military service. The number of this kind of person in some units is as high as 20 percent, meaning that the supply of persons is large. Let us assume (theoretically) for the moment that in a particular regiment there is not a single person bearing a criminal past. Let us assume that. However, trying to imagine that in the regiment there is not a single serviceman dealing in fuel, canned meat, condensed milk, and other "small items" in our country is an exercise in futility. The "recruiter" will get to them, also. Take the case of Private Ishin, who was stationed in a unit of the Far Eastern Military District. As his term of service neared completion, the soldier started to sell fuel "on the side." Representatives of shadow structures provided him with an easy and lucrative business. They later ordered some kinds of spare parts and once more paid him well. Ishin by that time had been discharged, but he did not depart from the unit, in that he was hired as a civilian driver. That is how he earned extra money, based on his friendship with the "authorities." The logical conclusion of this friendship was his receiving an order to steal weapons, an act which caused his "downfall." Generally speaking, few servicemen who become involved with criminals realize the full seriousness of their actions. They often rely on their contacts and an unreal conviction in imagined benefactors. A major group at risk in this connection are the so-called "runners," soldiers who absent themselves from their unit without official leave. To find such persons, the "Cosa Nostra" has special intercept persons who station themselves at railroad stations, bus stations, and airports. The deserters possess no money, as a rule. All of a sudden, present on the scene is a "savior," who offers the deserter an opportunity of earning the price of a ticket. What comes next? Nothing less than slave labor, languishing in some warehouse, a bed consisting of boxes, poor food. Subsequently, the "runner" is told that he has done nothing for which he can be paid, and that, on the contrary, he has fallen into debt. A system of fines spread throughout the criminal medium imposes monetary deficits, with the cause cited - for example - of taking up space in a warehouse in which the deserter does not belong (not an exaggeration). It is possible to turn off the "meter," partially at least, but only at the cost of sinking even more deeply into the quagmire. There exist many instances of that. Take another case of a regimental headquarters of a military builders' detachment. Local mafiosi made duty Sergeant M. (whose investigation has not yet been completed) an offer to sell drugs. They quoted a sum of money they intended to receive, one considerably less than the going rate. This duty soldier, with the smell of easy money in the air, gave his assent. He did this a couple of times. Then he was told: "Young man, you are in this over your head. There is no way you can get away from us." The drug dealer, working in his profession of a "condemned man," was active for several weeks, then he was arrested. Meanwhile, a search was on for someone else who would like to "earn some money." Especially alarming is how easily taken is the bait - first sweet promises, then abject bondage - by officer cadres, not only enlisted personnel. There is a disciplinary battalion stationed on Russkiy Island. It is a restricted post. It does not appear to have any ties to the mainland. Nonetheless, rumor had it that a man arriving from the "big land" had given away a considerable sum of money "out of friendliness." To whom? To officers awaiting discharge. Why had he done this? To pave the way for future cooperation in the civilian sector. The interested officers were told the details. The offer was tempting: It involved vessels of the merchant fleet performing primarily "Japanese" voyages. Foreign-made goods may be brought in. Some persons agreed to participate. Only later was it determined that the first three motor vehicles were intended for a "sponsor." But the deal had already been concluded. We cannot be remiss by not mentioning how the Mafia deals with people who are stubborn, violate the "rules of the game," or outlive their usefulness. Agencies exercising jurisdiction over these matters are of the opinion that it is fairly difficult to help people who become deeply involved. However, it is possible (and necessary) to do something else: Warn anyone having any thoughts of taking advantage of the "unselfish" help offered by "friends" in a regimental headquarters. Finally, is everything clear? If someone steps on a rake, he will undoubtedly be struck in the head, no matter how carefully he does the stepping. That is how the tool is made. Therefore, does it not make sense to do some thinking about this beforehand?
