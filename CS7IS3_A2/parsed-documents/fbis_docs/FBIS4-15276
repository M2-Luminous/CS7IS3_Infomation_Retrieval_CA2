Things are not as bad as they once looked, and once again the prophets of doom have been proved wrong. So far the new Russian parliament is working much better than the old Supreme Soviet. It consists of eleven relatively cohesive groups with a degree of party discipline. Businessmen are no longer able to buy individual deputies. The parliament's power is balanced, because the new constitution has introduced a normal distribution of power. The old Supreme Soviet had an overwhelming majority of red-browns, but they have only 34 percent of seats in the new Duma, and they are respecting the parliamentary rules. Zhirinovskiy's closest allies are already beginning to abandon him. The four democratic groupings are well represented with 35 percent of seats. In practice a number of centrist groupings are dominant. The system of parliamentary compromises has begun to work. Regional leaders have taken their places on the Federation Council, the parliament's upper chamber, the trend toward dissolution inside Russia has softened considerably since the new constitution was adopted. Even stubborn Tatarstan has come to an agreement with Moscow. Despite the fact that Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin was not a candidate in the elections, he appears today to be the most powerful politician. He has a strong power base in the state machine and heavy industry, at the same time that he represents the parliamentary center and can play democrats against the red-browns. In practice it is not President Yeltsin but Chernomyrdin who has come to exercise the strong executive power which the constitution gives to the president. As is well known the change in the economic system has progressed far too slowly in Russia. In addition the democrats have failed to get their message to the broad masses of the people. That is why the old establishment has been given a breathing space in which to recover. Its more progressive wing led by Chernomyrdin has now won power. The KGB and other sinister sections of the old Soviet establishment have in their turn had time to reshape themselves into crime syndicates because the process of liberalization has progressed so slowly. Democracy has grown stronger and crime rates have fallen in countries where the transition from one system to another has been more radical and consistent, such as Poland and the Czech Republic or Estonia and Latvia. In addition the social costs of the change of system in Russia have been much larger than they need have been. Now that the alarm over the elections results has abated, what is most surprising is how much has actually been achieved through the change of system in Russia. Today Russia has a market economy, even though it suffers from some distortions and a high degree of lawlessness. Deregulation has largely been implemented. More than half of those Russians in work are now working in the private sector. The main question is how high the level of inflation will be. In January there were many of us who were worried by the fact that Chernomyrdin sounded as if he intended to abandon all policies of stabilization. Now, with hindsight, it seems as if he was indulging in some opportunistic hot air, partly to escape criticism, and partly to force the liberal deputy prime ministers, Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fedorov, to resign for political reasons. In practice Chernomyrdin has now taken over their economic policies. Since October Russia has actually had an extraordinarily tight monetary policy, which has forced down inflation to a level of 11 percent in February. Since market interest rates are at all of 20 percent per month (800 percent per year) Russia has the world's highest level of real interest. The budget deficit is still on the large side at 9 percent of GNP, but IMF chief Michel Camdessus was nevertheless sufficiently impressed by the Russian attempts at a policy of stabilization to agree -- on certain conditions -- to sign a new stabilization agreement with Russia and grant Russia new credits. Today's official targets are to bring inflation down to 7 to 9 percent per month by the end of the year, against last year's average of 20 percent per month. The battle against inflation ought to be more ambitious, in order to make possible economic recovery, and the excessively hesitant anti-inflation policy increases the cost to society. However, the tough monetary policy has begun to bite on large enterprises which refused for as long as they could to adapt to the laws of the market economy. In general bad enterprises with no demand for their products do not go bankrupt, nor do they fire employees. They simply scale down activities until they are almost at a standstill. Salaries fall behind inflation and are often paid three to four months late, so employees seek jobs with better enterprises if they can. Almost all Russian enterprises are now demanding advance payment from each other. However, many enterprises are now experiencing great demand and their biggest problem is that they are unable to increase their production because of the combination of high inflation which undermines their working capital and the high real interest rates which mean that they cannot afford to take credits. These enterprises are no longer calling for subsidized credits but, on the contrary, for a stricter budgetary policy so that real levels of interest rates fall. The standard picture of Russia is of a country with plummeting living standards, but this picture is false. After a large fall in 1992 the recovery began in 1993. It is true that official GNP fell by 12 percent in 1993, but remarkably enough the population's income rose by all of 9 percent. One explanation is that the share of private consumption rose from a low of 36 percent in 1992 to 41 percent in 1993, while two thirds of the GNP of Western countries goes to private consumption. When the share of private consumption is so small, the trend of developments in GNP is not that important, but the Russians' living standards are likely to rise sharply over the next few years because consumption's share of GNP should increase considerably. Another explanation is that much of private production cannot be measured because of tax evasion, while state production was exaggerated under communism. In addition it can only be good for living standards if the production of nuclear arms, for example, decreases, even if GNP then falls. Also, a properly functioning market produces a much better distribution of resources. The most remarkable result is that this year Russia looks as if it will be self-sufficient in grain, while people were worried about starvation in Russia in the winter of 1991/92. Today a large number of import goods which raise living standards -- particularly medicines -- have penetrate the whole of Russia. Despite everything the Russian economy is on a pretty safe track. Swedish businessmen are noticing this. In the first 11 months of 1993 Sweden's exports to Russia increased by a total of 56 percent. Russia is in fact our most rapidly growing export market. What has frightened the West most since the Russian parliamentary elections is the new Russian foreign policy which asserts Russian interests with a ruthlessness that is new and also reminiscent of the past. In the most recent edition of the periodical, FOREIGN AFFAIRS, former U.S. security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski has criticized the U.S. administration for pursuing a foreign policy that is too Russocentric and the administration already seems to have changed its foreign policy along the lines demanded by Brzezinski. Brzezinski does not oppose the U.S. attempts hitherto to support the economic and political stabilization of Russia, but he advocates two important complementary policy strands. The first is to incorporate the successful central Europe (and this should include the Baltic region) into the West. As an American Brzezinski advocates NATO membership, but EU [European Union] membership is a natural alternative. Brzezinski's other complementary strand is that the central objective of a farsighted Western policy in the region should be "to consolidate geopolitical pluralism inside the former Soviet Union." His central thesis is: "Russia can either be an empire or a democracy, but not both." I personally believe that the fears that Russia will engage in activity that will destabilize Eastern Europe are exaggerated. Russia has had enough of the torment of the former Soviet Union and its actions in Bosnia are most likely to teach the West the lesson that Russia is a great power with its own national interests which intends to play an active role in the field of European security policy. Eastern Europe should, however, be integrated into Europe if the sort of feeling of national security which leads to stability is to be achieved. Russia's policy toward the former Soviet republics, on the other hand, gives cause for concern, but there still are strong forces in Moscow which are working against attempts to reincorporate former Union republics, since this would destabilize Russia both politically and economically. A telling example is how a potentially destabilizing currency union between Russia and Belarus recently came to nothing. The more successful the fight against inflation in Russia, the stronger grow the anti-imperialist forces in Russia. This is why it is important for the rest of the world to support a stabilization of the Russian economy. If former Soviet republics collapse, however, it will be extraordinarily difficult for a government in Moscow not to intervene. It is difficult for the rest of the world to criticize Russia's involvement in civil-war-torn Tajikistan and it has no alternative to Russian "peacekeeping" forces in the Caucasus. Economic destabilization is probably a serious threat. A total of nine out of fifteen former Soviet republics suffered hyperinflation -- more than 50 percent inflation in any single month -- in 1993. Among the other former Soviet republics only the three Baltic republics have been more successful economically than Russia. Veritable shock therapy as in Estonia and Latvia seems to produce the best results, but attempts to carry out a radical change of system are the next best thing. Things are worst when countries like Ukraine try to carry out a gradual change of system. The worst threat to European security is the far-reaching destabilization of the Ukrainian economy. In time Ukraine's hyperinflation must lead to both social and political destabilization, and regardless what government is in power in Moscow Russia will be unable to remain an onlooker. This is why the collapse of Ukraine could also be a catastrophe for Russia and the rest of the world. The central objective for the West's security policy should therefore be to work to prevent the collapse of the Ukraine. The main problem is that the whole of the Ukrainian political leadership with President Leonid Kravchuk at its head seems to be totally irresponsible and corrupt, while the Ukrainian population is embarrassingly passive. However, the Ukrainian parliamentary elections may have made a democratic revolution possible. The West's first priority should be to contribute to enlightenment in Ukraine and make it clear that it is possible to achieve Ukraine's economic salvation through a radical change of system. At the same time the West must alleviate the shock by making substantial credits available if Ukraine initiates a credible change of system.
