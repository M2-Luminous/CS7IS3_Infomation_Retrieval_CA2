It is hard to say what this is largely due to--naivete or ignorance. It is just that Russians displayed the wisdom of mature and sober-minded people. They know that 90 percent of the enterprises that provide jobs for the people were built during the Soviet years, and that social benefits that previously did not exist in any country of the world date back to the same time. All this is now being destroyed at a rate unheard of in peacetime. The president himself believes that the patience of the people has to a considerable degree run out. Therefore, there is no point in looking for the causes of this distribution of votes in the "estrangement" of the democrats and so on. Something else is more important at present: finally beginning genuine people's reforms. The prerequisites for this already exist. The first of them is the new constitution, which proclaims a "social" state, which means a state in the interests of all the people. The obvious failure of Gaydar's course of economic transformations is the second prerequisite. After all, reforms are customarily interpreted as transformations of aspects of public life without destroying the foundations of the social structure, and in political and economic practice they are interpreted as positive restructuring. So, the supreme organ of representative power should begin to act proceeding from these goals. In our opinion it is necessary first of all to throw up legal obstacles to all destructive transformations that are not confirmed by world and domestic experience and are not in line with the specifics of the Russian state. This should also be codified in the constitution. In Russia, important affairs of the state have been frequently made the domain of a narrow circle of individuals, and not discussed by the people at all. Meanwhile, according to the constitution we have people's power in the country! This is why a mechanism for upholding the guarantees in question is needed. A preliminary, highly professional public expert review of major political and economic innovations with the participation of authoritative scientists and economic managers could be one of the elements of this mechanism. Upon the findings of this competent organ, the parliament would adopt a relevant act that would be referred for endorsement to the president, and subsequently to the government for execution. Some decisions may be put to popular referendums. Therefore, the compulsory monitoring of reforms would appear, together with timely adjustments in their course, and strict accountability, including criminal, would be established for violating laws concerning reforms. Such violations should be added to the list of unconstitutional actions. By way of "insurance," it would be worthwhile to introduce parliamentary verification of the competency level of all candidates for supreme state positions, as some Western countries have. At present, furious attacks are being registered against state structures and their representatives, scientists, and practitioners who come out (albeit with a delay) in favor of making the market purposeful and organized in nature. However, does the reaction indicated not testify to the obvious incompetence of the opponents, their lack of a notion of modern market relations? It has been said time and again that the plan and the market are not opposites; at present, nobody successfully operates on the market without a plan. Both the Japanese automotive plant that produces on its assembly line dozens of modifications of a car for specific consumer-customers who are known in advance and the local Fedorov's Scientific-Technical Complex "Microsurgery of the Eye" with branches all over the country were created and operate according to their own plans, while providing incentives to their employees by market-economy methods. Unlike Russia, almost all other states of the CIS have preserved planning in the national economy as a means for organized transition to a market economy. Those that have energy and raw materials available have secured particularly weighty results in conducting economic reform by combining plan and market methods. Those who complain that free enterprise is undermined when markets are regulated proceed from technical considerations. In the environment of the contemporary social division of labor even within the borders of an isolated country, the number of production, scientific-technical, financial, and other links goes into billions and trillions. To advocate such "freedom" means dooming manufacturers to a pernicious blind cruise in a boundless sea of market elements. Contrary to their own will, supporters of this approach come out as adversaries of the market because they doom it to failure when they call the champions of the opposing view antimarketers! Genuine rather than illusory market freedom is found in an opportunity for each manufacturer to voluntarily select his effective "niche" on the all-Russian, interstate, and even regional and local markets within the system of organized economic space. Without infringing on the freedom of entities in the marketplace, a market orientation model which takes into account the feasible sequence of the territorial assignment of a group of consumers to a group of suppliers is capable of ensuring not only maximum profits for them but also perceptible benefits for the entire society, for example, by preventing nonrational hauling which places a heavy burden on the state budget. Understandably, economic space may only be organized at the all-state level, using principles and methods of rational planning, the development of indicator charts for production and sale zoning and normal flows of freight, a system of incentive and prohibitive transportation tariffs, and so on. Incidentally, the now common attempts to provide market information to consumers in the form of all manner of "registers" of enterprises, etc., are clearly inadequate. Fundamentally different market data banks are needed that would be capable of truly assisting in making relations rational as goods, capital, and labor move freely. We must say that the best conditions for the organization of highly efficient economies have emerged precisely in the states of the former USSR, primarily in Russia. This is possible through combining the methods of purposeful, planned economic operations (national economic plans--projections, programs, projects) with a mechanism of market-based incentives (prices, taxes, credit, and so on) while drawing on our domestic planning experience and the world practice of an organized market economy. The natural, geographic, historical, and other specifics of the country influence socioeconomic development substantially, and it is impossible not to reckon with them. The authors of the well-known "Economics" textbook, K. McConnell and S. Brew, were among the many prominent authorities who warned about this. On the basis of generalizing the experience of the world, they maintained: "The best way of resolving the `unlimited needs-scarce resources' dilemma in one economic system may turn out to be unsuitable in another." This is why it is simply inexpert to blindly borrow the Western monetarist reform scenario without taking into account other foreign experience (for example, the Chinese) and, most importantly, Russian specifics. Does the following question not provide food for thought: Why do influential circles of the United States and Germany approve a market-based model in Russia that is completely different from the one used in their countries to overcome grave crises? In conjunction with this we must acknowledge that the term "market economy" (like "mixed economy," "economic democracy," and so on) does not reflect the essence of the phenomenon quite correctly. First, in its contemporary interpretation this phenomenon is not reduced to the processes of distribution but deeply affects the sphere of material production acting as a universal method for its effective development. Second, elements of a market exist in any economy; we also had them under directive planning. Third, as has already been noted, the normal market has long been identical with the organized rather than free market, and calls for extensive state regulation; therefore, this condition of the economy cannot be considered market-based. Three common forms of rational economic operations are known in the world economy--free market, planned, and regulated-market. Each of them emerges, develops, and is progressive at certain historical stages. It is no accident that our methods of planned development once showed advantages over foreign market-based methods, in particular in the rates of economic growth, the resolution of social issues, and so on, and were extensively borrowed abroad. Against the background of the failure of the current "reform" course, attempts to ignore and even reject our former accomplishments are no accident. This was manifested even in the replacement of the symbols and power structures of the strong but Soviet state with those of a weak but prerevolutionary one. One would think that the specifics of the historical development of Russia would make it possible to assert in our country not just a regulated market economy but a higher stage of it--a planned market economy. This should be a synthesis of indicator planning, economic optimization programming, and a mechanism of market-based self-regulation in the economy. The fine-tuning of this model holds the promise of a tremendous, previously unparalleled effect. This is why a well-thought-out scientific concept of economic reforms is necessary.
