President Kim Il-song in the work declared that since the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula has been raised by the introduction of nuclear weapons by the United States into South Korea and it has emanated from the United States' hostile policy towards the DPRK, it must be resolved through dialogues between the DPRK and the United States. Noting that it is the consistent stand of the DPRK to resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula through dialogues, President Kim Il-song said pressure can never be a solution to the problem and it is a miscalculation to think that the United States can bring the Korean people to their knees by means of pressure and force.
