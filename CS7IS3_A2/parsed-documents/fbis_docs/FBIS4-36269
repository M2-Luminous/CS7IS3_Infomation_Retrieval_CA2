How would you describe Hizballah's experiment in the past decade through its resistance operations in the south and its association with the notion of martyrdom? [Nasrallah] From the start, Hizballah was established as a jihad movement, and it operated on this basis. Certainly the conditions prevailing at the time of its establishment were very hard and tough. The Israeli occupation forces were occupying much of the Lebanese territories and were allied with some of the right- wing parties. Multinational troops were present in Beirut. The Palestinian forces, which had been confronting the Israeli enemy, were defeated. Later, the PLO left Lebanon and many slogans were abandoned. The only choice left at the time was confrontation; confrontation of the hegemony, domination, occupation, arrogance, and Israel's legendary aura and of the state of frustration, despair, defeat, and capitulation that prevailed in Lebanon. A strong shock had to be administered to awaken the Lebanese people from their slumber and point to the major elements of power inherent in them. We were in need of a new method to restore confidence to the people and at the same time convince them that the enemy can be defeated. There were several accumulated complexes; superiority, weakness, and humiliation complexes and the feeling that the other party is stronger and undefeatable. In those days, I remember the arguments between the young strugglers and those who called themselves realists, who thought that our movement was unrealistic and illogical; in other words, a movement of crazy people!! Today, all of them say that the only realists and logical people at the time were us. The most prominent aspect of Hizballah movement is the jihad aspect. After three years, the movement managed to prove its credibility. So it is not a coincidence to see the current massive popular rallying around us. During those three years, we managed by means of martyrdom operations to force the Israeli troops to withdraw from al-Biqa' and Beirut and to keep them confined to the currently occupied border zone. The Israelis withdrew unconditionally and without any security arrangements. This is because the casualties they sustained generated popular pressure inside the Zionist entity that led to the withdrawal of the Israelis, after the withdrawal of the U.S. and British troops, who knew that they simply could not stay longer without suffering casualties. Thus, we believe that our jihad experiment has been successful. We also managed to identify many sources of strength in our people. We managed to stimulate our people. Proof of this is that the resistance enjoys popular, official, and partisan support throughout the country. Undoubtedly, the resistance operations and martyrs in Lebanon have had a major influence in stimulating the Palestinians in the occupied territories, and the leaders of the Palestinian intifadah admit this. These operations proved that the Israeli is weaker than we believe and is not what we imagine him to be. The Koran testifies to their cowardice. They are too weak to get involved in face-to-face confrontations. We believe that this jihad movement, which is still continuing, could develop further and could be generalized, and this is what we are looking forward to. We want to see this resistance in all the cordon states around the Zionist enemy. [Ahmad] With the liberation of all the Lebanese soil, will the suicidal performance of the Islamic movement in the south be affected or will it continue in various forms until Palestine and Jerusalem are liberated? [Nasrallah] In fact this question has been the focus of interest in many circles. One thing is clear in all cases. When the Israeli enemy withdraws from the Lebanese territories, the resistance will stop at that level. As for the rest of the question and the types of action, this is premature; the matter will be subject to developments and the situations that might arise. As far as principles are concerned, we believe that Palestine is an occupied land, that Israel is a usurper entity, and that the Palestinians are primarily responsible for liberating this land. They are entitled to support from all Arab and Muslim nations until all the land is liberated. As for how and through which methods, this will be determined in time. [Ahmad] This takes us to negotiations, the so-called settlement, and the fantasies of the Middle East market. We want to hear your views in this matter in general. [Nasrallah] Hizballah has declared its clear and determined stand since the invitation to the Madrid conference. We refused to take part. In other words, we reject negotiations with the Israeli enemy. We believe that the American and Israeli enemies want to seize this opportunity to force their plans on the entire region. We are going through a stage that lacks international and regional balance, after Desert Storm and the frustration and despair it created. Therefore, they are trying to force the formula or the settlement that suit their interests. The American and Israeli enemies are serious about a peaceful settlement according to their own terms at this particular time, where conditions are favorable. They know very well that the future involves many risks and they have to cope with that future. But can these negotiations achieve results or not? As far as the Palestinian track is concerned, the situation is clear. I believe that it is possible to agree on signing the details of the Declaration of Principles, because 'Arafat is prepared to sign anything. When he took that course, he did not do so in order to go back to armed struggle later. He took it to finish it to the end whatever the price. The concessions he made are unimaginable. Even those who mistrusted 'Arafat to the maximum did not expect that many concessions. Through their intifadah, the Palestinian people expressed their rejection of the Palestinian- Israeli Declaration of Principles. As for the Jordanian track, matters are almost settled; they are waiting for the other tracks. The major obstacle lies in the Syrian and Lebanese tracks. The Israelis want to reach some solution with Syria or Lebanon. But President al-Asad's personality and his determination to hold on to the established principles he declared-- when the Israelis cannot make real concessions--lead me to believe that it is not possible to achieve any result on that track. This is at the official level. But our own vision is that negotiations-- regardless of their results--will not be able to force on the region the formula, the shape, or the substance Israel and America are pursuing. We are strongly convinced of that and are very optimistic about the future. We believe that the people of the region will not tolerate coexistence with this imposed formula. At any rate, the Egyptian people have become an example that conciliation with Zionists concerns the regimes; there will never be a conciliation as far as the people are concerned. This is the actual reality after all these years since the Camp David Accord was signed. The Egyptian people have not accepted normalization or coexistence with the Zionist enemy. This is what makes us optimistic. We say that any result reached will be limited to the regimes, which will not be able to protect that result or force it on the people. [Ahmad] What is your opinion about some Islamist religious leaders who have recognized, advocated, and legalized the idea of recognizing the Zionist entity? There are some Islamic edicts in this regard which appeared in some of our Islamic countries (no names mentioned). What is your opinion about this matter (the recognition)? [Nasrallah] Historically speaking, there are scholars who are known as the court scholars. The scholars under the various governments that ruled the Islamic countries in the past were divided into three categories: One group adopted the people's cause, rejecting the ruler's oppression, tyranny, and injustice. The second group supported the ruler, and were called the court scholars. This group was also called by Imam Khomeyni the sultan's preachers. The third group was impartial and regarded what happened as of no concern to it. It is also known that the court scholars issued Muslim religious edicts contrary to Islamic principles which require that any such edict be rooted in the Koran, the Prophet's tradition, or evidence adopted in Islamic jurisprudence. History books relate such actions. Such scholars cannot deceive anyone. They may at one point mislead the simple people. But they are eventually exposed. We currently witness such scholars, and we will continue to see such types of scholars who are alien to the Islamic awakening. [Ahmad] Let us move on to the Lebanese issue. I have recently noticed some changes in Lebanese society. I want to ask: Do you see in this the start of Lebanon's revitalization or the start of new problems and fresh internal conflicts? [Nasrallah] A series of events have recently taken place, some of them devoid of wisdom. Lebanon is almost at the threshold of the unknown. For example, the present government has adopted several security, media, and political measures. These measures have interacted. Some conditions have been exploited to push through plans that had been prepared before. This is a serious action. The Lebanese understand this easily. This government has been working since its establishment to change the nature of things in Lebanon. This government cannot claim to have established domestic peace. Domestic peace was accomplished before, thanks to the direct Syrian effort and the agreement of the Lebanese people to support and embrace the process of domestic peace. The present government was established against the background of domestic peace and a bad economic situation. Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri had something to do with the bad economic situation through what is called the dollar game, the banks, and so forth. This government came to change the conditions in a way not so familiar to the Lebanese. The prime minister tried in various ways to dominate all the media--the press, radios, and television stations--by buying some of them and exerting pressure on the rest. The government adopted measures on other levels, such as banning trade union demonstrations. There was also an attempt to control the banks. We, as a movement for resisting the occupation, believe that any security measure to control the groups cooperating with Israel and its tools is perfectly sound. But we are against the exploitation of security measures to push through plans pertaining to the media, trade union freedoms, and public freedoms in general in order to transform Lebanon into an emirate or shaykhdom. [Ahmad] This takes us to the parliamentary experience and your assessment of it. Some Islamic movements in other countries reject the idea of the parliamentary experience for several reasons, including reasons that have to do with jurisprudence. What is your assessment of this experience in terms of jurisprudence, as well as actually and politically in Lebanon, particularly after Hizballah's entry into the parliament and its becoming the biggest partisan power in the parliament? [Nasrallah] Islamic movements all over the Islamic world must agree in their goals and principles. But they do not necessarily agree in their approach. Every country has its unique situation and conditions. For example, the Islamic movement in Iran--which led to the revolution and the overthrow of the shah's regime--did not adopt the military approach. It adopted the popular approach, using strikes, demonstrations, and clashes of a popular nature in the street, away from the military and security approach. The situation was different in Lebanon's case. Under occupation, it is not possible to stage demonstrations that inflict harm on the people more than they harm the occupiers. Therefore, conditions are unique to each country. It follows that Islamists should not be rigid in their methods, tactics, and approaches. We have to select the legitimate approaches instead of insisting on one rigid approach. We now come to the parliamentary experience. When we entered the parliamentary battle, we had a set of objectives and goals. We said that participation in the parliament would not change the system. This was unprecedented frankness with the Lebanese people. Among the goals of participation in the parliament was that of solidifying our jihad and political existence. The West and arrogant powers tried to picture Islamists in Lebanon as security organizations, armed gangsters, and terrorist groups that have no intellectual, cultural, or organizational presence. They sometimes said that these Islamists were a bunch of Iranians who came to Lebanon. We sought elections as a means of demonstrating our volume, presence, and scope. Many were surprised to find that Hizballah enjoyed all that popularity. On the other hand, we wanted to have a voice in the parliament to call for resistance. Our priorities in Lebanon are different from other Islamic movements elsewhere. Some Islamic movements give priority to overthrowing the regime and establishing an Islamic state. Accordingly, they move in that direction. We believe that our top and dominant priority is to fight Israel, expel the Israeli occupier, and arouse the nation to establish a major popular, Islamic resistance that restores Jerusalem and rids the nation of that cancerous growth. Hence, we are primarily concerned with enhancing efforts in the direction of that priority at all the political and legal levels. This requires being within an institution that is capable of providing some kind of support to the resistance movement. Therefore, we endeavored to support the resistance after entering the parliament. In that context, we developed other objectives, like defending the victims of injustice from within the parliament and providing better conditions for our people through submitting bills and discussing government plans and budget. From the viewpoint of Islamic jurisprudence, our participation in the parliament was given deep thought by a group of jurisconsults. It was not only a political decision. A distinction may be drawn between participation in the parliament and participation in an executive authority. The parliament is a legislative, not an executive power. It allows some sort of political influence on the course of things in Lebanon. In the parliament, I can say my mind, oppose, and discuss. I can oppose the laws I do not like. I exercise my freedom, and I do not have to accept just anything presented to me. In the parliament, we discuss and oppose. At the end of the day, we may not support this program or that, and then we will not be partners to the consequences. In the parliament, I can say, for example, that I reject the demolition of these houses, and then I spare myself the blame. I also can confront these things in the parliament. No one can impose on me anything I do not believe in; I express my opinion in full freedom. On the other hand, when I become part of the government, that is, part of the executive power, I cannot do that because the minister, at the end of the day, is committed to the policies of the government. The deputy is not committed to the policies of the parliament. This means that when the Islamists enter the parliament, they are religiously not blamed for any negative consequences. Yes, things may sometimes and in certain cases reach a point where participation in the parliament may strengthen or cover up a serious situation or one that strategically conflicts with the objectives and inclinations of the Islamic trend. In this case, the deputies may resign and totally exempt themselves from the responsibility. But this always needs a study from the religious point of view. [Ahmad] Do you see Hizballah playing a role in future Lebanese and Arab affairs? What shape and size will this take? [Nasrallah] Generally, we are optimistic about the future of the Islamic movement in Lebanon and the region. I even tell the Western ambassadors who visit us that the Islamic movement and the Islamic awakening in our Islamic world are no longer an option, but a fate they must recognize. Hizballah is part of this bigger Islamic movement, affecting it and being affected by it. There is something like a unified destiny and a unified future. On the Lebanese level, we are not worried. On the contrary, the movement is growing and developing every day, and the line adopted by Hizballah--a jihad and political line--is logical and convincing. you will certainly find people in Lebanon who disagree with us or reject our thought and inclinations, but even these people respect our jihad and sacrifices. This is taken for granted. When Hizballah Secretary General 'Abbas al-Musawi was martyred--and he was the first secretary general or leader of a party or movement to be martyred by the Israelis in Lebanon--all Lebanon was shrouded in sadness. We are a resistance movement whose leaders, not only ordinary fighters, are killed and martyred by the sinful Israeli aggression. Contrary to the image that foreign media are portraying, we in Lebanon talk about resistance and liberation of the land, practice resistance sincerely, and are concerned about civil peace. Many people thought that when the government in Lebanon tried to strengthen civil peace in the country, it would clash with Hizballah. They thought Hizballah would reject the moves to cancel armed appearance or abolish some military barracks, or that it would not accept certain measures. But they were mistaken. In past years, some press analysts used to say a major battle between the Lebanese state and Hizballah would break out once the first asked the latter to do this or that. These analysts were surprised to find that we operate with a different mentality. We believe that civil peace in Lebanon is in the interest of our people. It is not the authority that matters; it is the people. We oppose the authority, but we care about our society and our people because we know that going back to the civil war in Lebanon would serve Israel's, not the resistance's, interests; the interests of the enemies of Lebanon, not the people of Lebanon. We are open to all sects, trends, and movements present in Lebanon with which we may differ in religion, creed, or political ideology. I may even claim that we as an Islamic movement are more open to our surroundings and to the currents, parties, and personalities operating around us than any other movement. Day after day, our roots go deeper in the Lebanese ground. I can even add that one can find Hizballah's movement in the minds of children. It is no longer a movement that belongs to one generation, but several generations. Thus, the movement cannot be uprooted by striking at its key symbols, figures, or one of its generations. To uproot this movement is to strike at several generations, and I do not believe anybody could do so to uproot a movement of such magnitude. Hizballah is no longer a transitory or unusual movement. It is a genuine part of this society; one that goes into the people's homes, neighborhoods, cities, and hearts. It is a deep- rooted movement that goes deeper and grows more day after day. Thus, as far as Lebanon is concerned I do not believe we have a problem. I personally am optimistic about the future of the Islamic movement, and that of Hizballah precisely, in Lebanon. Hizballah's role, and I am not trying to brag about myself here because Hizballah's decision is a collective decision and Hizballah is not led by a single individual, is a thorough and realistic one that takes into consideration all circumstances and developments and can face the challenges. As far as the region is concerned, of course Hizballah has reached the point of providing a special moral influence. Through the contacts we make abroad we realize that to the Muslims in the world Hizballah has represented the nation's symbol of confrontation against Israel in the past 10 years. Unlike their regimes, the Muslim peoples are siding with this confrontation. The party that has reflected the ambitions, aspirations, and convictions of these peoples in the past 10 years is Hizballah. Now we have partners, and we are happy about this partnership. The Islamic movement in Palestine has surfaced and become a major and important symbol in the heart of the nation. The fact is that when we see an Islamic movement, whether in Palestine or elsewhere, that has adopted the jihad course and made considerable progress in it we do not feel sad, even if we were to become in the second or third place. On the contrary; we actually would see this as a fulfillment of the goals we set out to achieve. This is because we are not partisans. We have an organization and formations, but we do not operate with a partisan mentality. We believe that our movement is not serving the goals of a party but of a whole nation. Thus, we extend the hand of help and solidarity to any faction in this nation, even if we differed or if it were not Islamic. We will cooperate with any national or pan-Arab faction with a creed different from our Islamic creed or that differs from our political line in some details but at the same time is ready to confront Israel and the U.S.-Israeli plans of hegemony in the same way we would cooperate with any Islamic movement. This is because we are aware of this priority and we are sincere to this nation. Accordingly, and as part of the optimism of the Islamic movement throughout the region, I am optimistic about the future of Hizballah. In any case, we believe in the Koranic promise. All expectations, prophecies, analyses, and facts indicate that our Islamic world, whether the major powers and the ruling regimes in our countries like it or not, is the future for the Islamic movement. I and many others from our generation may not be alive then, but undoubtedly the future will be for this movement and its various and successive generations that will take charge of our Islamic world's affairs. The Islamic future in this region is no longer a choice, but a destiny and a predetermined heavenly will, and nobody, God willing, will be able to change this.
