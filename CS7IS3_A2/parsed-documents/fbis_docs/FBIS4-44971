He contributed the following bitterly satiric article reviewing the war of words that went on from the beginning of the crisis until its eruption in total war. What does unity have to do with a sandwich? You have a right to ask this question at this particular time: for the Yemen crisis is at its most critical juncture, and the battle is at its fiercest between proponents of unity and supporters of tashtir ("slicing in half"). The latter term, which has engaged the attention of Yemeni politics for a long time, comes from the world of the Classical Arabic sandwich. The term is one of the achievements of the Arabic Language Academy, which decided once upon a time to Arabicize the foreign word sandwich and came up with the phrase,"top slice and bottom slice with a filling in between" [al-shatir wa al-mashtur wa al-kamakh baynahuma]." The phrase never caught on anywhere in the Arab world, except in Yemen, where the blundering of the shatir [a pun on three meanings: "divider," "shrewd person," and "withdrawer"] and the injustice to the mashtur ["that which has been divided"] have brought the country to the verge of tashtir ["cutting in half"]; and this at a time when unity and secession have come to mean the same thing to grieving citizens, who go to sleep with an old promise and wake up with a new lie. Apart from the term tashtir ["cutting in half"], all the terms of the Yemen crisis invite deep philosophic reflection. Everyone is fighting to defend "legitimacy," which in the South means "party legitimacy," and in the North means "tribal legitimacy." The only term stranger than "legitimacy" is the phrase "foreign fingers" [i.e., foreign influences], which shifts meaning from day to day. Sometimes it refers to legitimate aid; at other times it refers to objectionable interventions. To these terminological marvels you may add the phrase "national dialogue." Everywhere else it means the need to use the tongue; here, however, the politicians love to dialogue with cannons, swords, tanks, and land, naval, and air weapons. As for the tanks that fueled the latest battles, observers have been at a loss about how to categorize the Southern brigades located in the North and the Northern brigades located in the South. Were these forces positioned to defend unity, or were they hostages in the hands of two sides who deal in every coin except good faith? Although military thinking says that tanks require a large crew, technicians, and supplies, here tanks were like trucks running aimlessly at the whim of their drivers, who drove them until the fuel ran out and then went looking for someone to tow them to the nearest station. If no one could be found, the driver would go off to his fate and leave the tank to its fate of becoming an ideal storage bin for fodder. Something laughable in our country--how many things there are in it to make you laugh until you cry!--is that the military brigade is no better organized than the tank. Theoretically a brigade consists of about 10,000 persons--except here, where a brigade consists of a few hundred, sometimes a few dozen. They swear allegiance to the state, but in a pinch they follow instructions emanating from the province or tribe. The purpose of the Pledge and Accord Document, the most recent Yemeni term before the fighting, was to prevent militarization of the crisis. Now the document is fulfilling precisely the opposite role, accelerating the factors that would make for a military resolution. It is as if its signatories had promised and agreed not to implement a single letter of the document; which they indeed have done, in accordance with the principles of our way of promising and agreeing--especially when the agreements and promises are under Jordanian sponsorship. Although the concept of "association of ideas" [tada'iyat] belongs to the novel, particularly the stream-of-consciousness novel represented by Virginia Woolf, the Yemen crisis, which has used up almost all the technical terms of literature, has also commandeered this term among others. The term tada'iyat is now being used in the sense of "developments." The term is being so used by all the parties, who fight with one hand and with the other hand draft communiques demanding a halt to military and media tada'iyat. What is so beautiful about Yemeni feuds is their polished style. Your foe charges you with lying, cheating, thievery, and treason, but he does not forget to add the title "brother" to your respected name, so that you become "Brother Cheater," or "Brother Traitor," or any other kind of brother plus epithet. None of these epithets has anything to do with the concept of brotherhood, which the fraternal enemies in Yemen have worn out in ways never imagined by the Brothers Karamazov or by Dostoyevsky, who could add 10 volumes to his immortal novel merely by paying a short visit to the land of fraternal enemies who never tire of talking about the concept of the rule of law--in a country desperately seeking law.
