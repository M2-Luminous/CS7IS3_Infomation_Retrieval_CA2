The minister naturally referred to the dramatic outcome of the Belgian participation in the UN peacekeeping force in Rwanda. Claes believes that future UN missions should be more clearly defined and the Blue Helmets should be better armed. After the end of the Cold War, "peacekeeping operations seemed to be the answer to all kinds of crises, ranging from humanitarian aid situations to the difficult implementation of complex peace accords," Claes stated. Hence their proliferation. "Peacekeeping operations normally begin following previous authorization from all the parties concerned," the minister said. "But the Security Council has initiated a number of operations without the prior consent of all the parties to a conflict." The minister referred to Bosnia and Somalia. However, Claes stated that "there was no ambiguity in the case of Rwanda: There was a political agreement and both parties had given their express assent to the UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda] deployment." The large number of peacekeeping operations is making it increasingly difficult for the United Nations to obtain the required number of soldiers. Another problem Claes raised was the "chronic deficiency of the UN budget for peacekeeping operations, due to the failure of a number of member states to pay up on time." As a result, it is not certain that it will be possible to provide the United Nations with its own standby forces. Claes also believes that the UN Secretariat lacks a structure with responsibility for military operations. "The feeling at the moment is that the Security Council should better assess a peacekeeping operation's chances of success within the overall framework of efforts to restore peace." The mandate for a peacekeeping operation must, the minister believes, be "precise and flexible." He believes it must describe the objectives of the operation and must be clear regarding the different elements of the mandate, such as the disarming of the militia in Somalia. Once defined, the mandate of a peacekeeping operation must be correctly implemented. Rapid Review According to Claes, the United Nations should be able to rapidly review the mandate of a peacekeeping operation, when necessary. This requires "a serious improvement in communications between UN troops in the field and UN headquarters." The mandate should also be limited in time. With the exception of UN operations under Chapter 7 of the UN charter, Blue Helmets may only use their weapons in self-defense. This limits the ability to respond to direct threats. "I believe we must stop the practice which only allows UN soldiers to bear light arms: They must be sufficiently equipped, not only with a view to their specific mandate but also so that they are able to respond to changed circumstances and effectively defend themselves." After the problems encountered by U.S. soldiers during the UN operation in Somalia and after the death of Belgian Blue Helmets in Rwanda, "governments are now going to find it much more difficult to win domestic support for participation in peacekeeping operations," Claes stated. "This also relates to the difficult balance between national responsibilities with respect to UN troops and the recognized authority of UN commanders in the field. UN commanders must not be hindered by the interference of national commanders. On the other hand, national governments must remain responsible for assessing the safety of their soldiers and must be able to withdraw them." Claes said that "although the idea of the United Nations having its own force may seem attractive, it is still a long way from being realized."
