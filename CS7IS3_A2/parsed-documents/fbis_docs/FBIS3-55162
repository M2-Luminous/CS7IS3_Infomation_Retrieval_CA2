The union threatened to go on strike several times last year, but every time a compromise was reached after the negotiations with the government. The main demand presented by the organizers of the strike is to increase produce purchase prices, to solve the problems of settlements with processing enterprises and their monopoly. Professor Jonas Ciulevicius, chairman of the union, said that a quarter of 4,000 agricultural companies should go bankrupt this year because of the high purchase prices. "The preparation for the strike have brought some positive results. Some milk processing enterprises pay the prices we required, however, this is not the achievment of the government. We will try to influence the government through the milk processing industry in order the demands of farmers to be fulfilled", Ciulevicius said. The questions of supplying hospitals and kindergartens with milk and its products during the days of the strike were discussed at the meeting of the union.
