This year, various CIS nations have experienced difficulties and frustrations to varying degrees, resulting in changes in the relations among the members. For quite some time, generally, the economies of the CIS member nations have had many problems, with serious production setbacks. While some nations have experienced prolonged war, political instability, and fierce internal struggles, others have been mired in nationality and territorial disputes. Confronting all sorts of real-life, serious difficulties, CIS nations are adjusting their own policies. If seeking their own futures soon after the disintegration of the Soviet Union had been the main goals of various CIS nations last year, this year should be the one during which they gradually regain their consciousness "from the intoxication of going their own way" and start exploring new cooperative means among themselves in a bid to overcome political, economic, and social crises. The signing of the "CIS Constitution" among leaders of seven nations, including Russia, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan, in Minsk in January this year, that binds all member nations, signified a temporary end to the year-long CIS "uncertainties." In May, leaders of nine CIS nations signed in Moscow a declaration on the establishment of an economic alliance among CIS nations. The declaration explicitly called for the setting up of a CIS common market where there will be a free flow of merchandise, labor services, capital, and labor forces within the unified economic area. Ukraine did not sign the "CIS Constitution" but signed all documents from that meeting. In September, leaders of nine nations further signed the CIS Economic Alliance Treaty, under which member nations will grant each other the most-favored-nation treatments and formulate a unified credit policy. Although their actual implementation remains considerably distant and the possibility of future changes is not excluded, the declaration and the treaty they signed reflected the urgency and wishes of the contracting nations in seeking cooperation. In the military field, the relatively prominent feature for this year has been the CIS August decision to establish a unified defense force in Tajikistan, consisting of troops from five nations -- including Russia and Kazakhstan -- to jointly deal with the opposition armed forces in Tajikistan and the Afghan guerrillas along the Tajikistan-Afghanistan border. Russia has played an important role in establishing this unified force. In addition, what is worth mentioning is that, with the addition of Azerbaijan and Georgia in the latter part of this year, the number of CIS members will reach 11. Factors leading to the formation of the trend of cooperation within the CIS have been many and varied. Despite CIS nations' desire for independence, the political, economic, and defense relations among them, developed over a long period, are difficult to cut off. They are well aware that relying on the Western developed countries to solve important economic, nationality, and territorial issues will be difficult, and that the CIS is needed to solve them. Georgia's final change of attitude and application for CIS membership was an obvious example, as it has to rely on other CIS nations, Russia in particular, for the supply of natural gas, petroleum products, materials, and merchandise. It also has to pin its hopes on CIS military and political support in solving conflicts in Abkhazia. Meanwhile, Russia has taken advantage of its military and economic strength as well as its vast superiority in resources to intensify diplomatic activities among other CIS nations. Russian leaders have openly repeated that Russia has its own strategic interests in certain CIS nations and have exerted influence over the development of certain local events. However, as the CIS itself is a product of the drastic change and integration of the Soviet Union, relations among member nations are bound to be complex. Currently, wars in the Transcaucasus have not ended, with bloody conflicts reported here and there, while Azerbaijan and Armenia still see each other as enemies. Ukraine, a European country, and Russia remain widely divided over the handling of nuclear weapons and the Black Sea Fleet. Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan in Central Asia decided to issue their own currencies in November this year after rejecting Russia's conditions, forcing the near abandonment of a proposal by six CIS nations in September for establishing a new type of ruble zone. Some foreign forces have also taken advantage of the situation to intensify infiltration and instigation. All of this shows that there will be contradictions, difficulties, and struggles among CIS nations in the process of cooperation. Overall, CIS nations, while preserving their independence, are looking for closer cooperation. How to handle contradictions arising from the clash of these two tendencies will remain an acute issue they must face. With certain major domestic and foreign policies needing adjustment, the development prospects for many countries have not been clear, adding further complexities to the relations among CIS nations.
