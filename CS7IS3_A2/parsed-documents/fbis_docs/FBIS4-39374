Some media reports that such subunits have started to arrive at the Georgian-Abkhaz line of confrontation are not true. The ITAR-TASS correspondent has learned this at the press office of the Abkhaz Supreme Soviet today. As everyone knows, the legislative bodies of the CIS states have not yet made any decision on the introduction of peacekeeping forces into the zone of conflict. In accordance with the Georgian-Abkhaz agreements on a cease-fire and separation of the forces, which were signed in Moscow on 14 May, the peacekeeping forces will be deployed in the 12-kilometer-long strip of the security zone. The agreement also provides for the opposing sides to deploy armed formations, except for heavy combat machinery, in the zone where a limited range of arms is permitted. The peacekeeping forces will be expected to patrol the Kodor gorge as well. As the press office has noted, following the arrival of the peacekeeping forces, the UN observers can leave the security zone, if necessary, provided they agree on this with the leaders of the opposing sides. [Tbilisi CONTACT INFORMATION AGENCY in Russian at 1310 GMT on 7 June carries a similar report stating the following: "Russian mass media reported today, quoting Abkhaz sources, that the deployment of CIS peacekeeping forces in the conflict zone in Abkhazia has already begun. However, this was not confirmed by the Georgian Defense Ministry."]
