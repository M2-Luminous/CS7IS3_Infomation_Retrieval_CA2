Lucio Noto, chairman and chief executive of Mobil, said this recently in Beijing in an interview with XINHUA. The company began its China business by establishing the first China representative office in Shanghai in 1894, and it was famous for introducing kerosene to China. Noto, who came solely for the centenary celebrations, said that this was his first overseas trip since he took over the top slot last March. "I want to express our willingness of furthering cooperation with China," he said, adding that Mobil would take the opportunity to probe the possibility of more cooperation. The chairman disclosed that several cooperative projects were under discussion between Mobil and China, and it was possible that an agreement to establish a joint venture in north China's Tianjin would be reached within a few months. "The setting up of joint ventures would both enable Mobil to provide better service to its Chinese customers, and benefit the development of China's economy," he said. "the cooperation is beneficial to both sides." Noto also said that his company was interested in recovering and processing petroleum in China, including in the South China Sea and north-west China's Tarim Basin, and a team would be sent to China shortly to do research. "We would not lose any good business opportunity here," he added. To mark the 100th anniversary, Mobil has set up a fund of 500,000 U.S. dollars to help develop China's education. The company presented 100,000 U.S. dollars to the National Academy of Education Administration as the first installment of the fund, in support of the academy's efforts to upgrade the training facilities and programs for education administrators. Noto said that his company had become one of the largest foreign suppliers in China, providing lubricating oil to various industrial fields of the country since it re-entered the Chinese market in 1974. That same year this second largest oil company in the United States became the first foreign oil company to import Chinese oil, natural gas and fuel for aircraft into the USA. It was also the first foreign company selling oil products in China. In 1983, it set up a filling station in south China's Shenzhen, thus becoming the first Western oil company of this kind. In 1986, the company began cooperation with Shanghai in producing lubricating oil for ocean shipping and automobiles.
