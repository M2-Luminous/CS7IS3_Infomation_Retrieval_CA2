FR940707-2-00059 FR940707-2-00037 Acid Rain Division [FRL&hyph;5008&hyph;4] Acid Rain Provisions AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: EPA today announces the allocation of allowances to small diesel refineries for desulfurization of fuel from October 1, 1993 through December 31, 1993. The eligibility for and calculation of allowances to small diesel refineries is in accordance with Section 410(h) of the Clean Air Act, implemented at 40 CFR part 73 subpart G. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kathy Barylski, EPA Acid Rain Division (6204J), 401 M St., SW., Washington DC 20460; telephone (202) 233&hyph;9074. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: EPA's Acid Rain Program was established by Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) to reduce acid rain in the continental United States. The Acid Rain Program will achieve a 50 percent reduction in sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) emissions from utility units. The SO 2 reduction program is a flexible market-based approach to environmental management. As part of this approach, EPA allocates ``allowances'' to affected utility units. Each allowance is a limited authorization to emit up to one ton of SO 2 . At the end of each calendar year, each unit must hold allowances in an amount equal to or greater than its SO 2 emissions for the year. Allowances may be bought, sold, or transferred between utilities and other interested parties. Those utility units whose annual emissions are likely to exceed their allocation of allowances may either install pollution control technologies or switch to cleaner fuels to reduce SO 2 emissions, or buy additional allowances. Section 410(h) of the Clean Air Act provides allowances for small diesel refineries which desulfurize diesel fuel from October 1, 1993 through December 31, 1999. Small diesel refineries are not otherwise affected by the Acid Rain Program and do not need the allowances to comply with any provision of the Clean Air Act. Thus, the allowances serve as a financial benefit to small diesel refineries desulfurizing diesel fuel. The following table lists the allowances to be allocated to each eligible small diesel refinery for desulfurization of fuel from October 1, 1993 to December 31, 1993: ‚ê£ 1Refiner 1Refinery /Location 1Allocation Cenex Laurel, Montana 682 Ergon Vicksburg, Mississippi 11 Frontier Cheyenne, Wyoming 813 Gary Williams Bloomfield 306 Giant Ciniza 300 Holly Lea 275 Holly Navajo 367 Kern Oil Bakersfield, California 432 Lion Oil El Dorado 216 Paramount Paramount, California 555 Pennzoil Atlas 369 Pennzoil Roosevelt 82 Powerine Santa Fe Springs, CA 595 Pride Abilene, Texas 365 Sinclair/Little America Casper 349 Sinclair Sinclair, Wyoming 592 Sinclair Tulsa, Oklahoma 1174 U.S. Oil & Refining Co.

Allowances for desulfurization which occurs from 1994 through 1999 will be made annually. The allowances listed above will be placed in the refiners' accounts in the Allowance Tracking System (ATS) this fall. Until that time, the refiners can trade their allowances but the trades cannot be recorded in the ATS. Allowances allocated to small diesel refineries in 1994 (for 1993 desulfurization) and 1995 (for 1994 desulfurization) will have a compliance year of 1995, the first compliance year of the Acid Rain Program. The compliance year of allowances allocated subsequent to 1995 will be the year the allowances are allocated. Dated: June 19, 1994. Paul Stolpman, Director, Office of Atmospheric Programs.
