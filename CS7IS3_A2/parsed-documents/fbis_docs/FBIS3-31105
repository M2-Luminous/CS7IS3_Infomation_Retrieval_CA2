Jahorina, near Sarajevo, to mark 10th anniversary of the Sarajevo Olympics: [Begin Krajisnik recording] The international community -- the same one that 10 years ago, with its call for peace, entrusted to us the holding of the greatest international sports competition -- is today calling for bombing and war. It is threatening us, without any reason. It is threatening us because we are to blame for opposing denigration and destruction. We are guilty because we wanted, like all other peoples of the former Yugoslavia, to preserve our freedom and state. We will reply to their ultimatums in the same way as our forebears did. We do not accept the ultimatum. We want freedom and peace. We have opted for freedom and are resolved to defend the honor of the Serb nation with all available means. [end recording]
