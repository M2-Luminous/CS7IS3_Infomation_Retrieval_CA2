FBIS3-49142 "dreeu004__a94019" FBIS-EEU-94-001-A Document Type:Daily Report 6 January 1994 ANNEX HUNGARY Paper Views Reduced Defense Spending AU0401155394 Budapest MTI in English 1209 GMT 31 Dec 93 AU0401155394 Budapest MTI Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Budapest, 31 December (MTI) -- Hungarian defense spending has dropped by almost half in real terms since 1989, with its share in the gross domestic product [GDP] down from 2.5 percent to 1.88 percent, a recent publication entitled HONVEDSEG '93 (Home Defence '93) reveals. The Hungarian Army consists of exactly 100,000 people at the end of 1993. Of these, 13,700 are officers, 8,500 other ranks, 52,340 private soldiers, and 25,660 civil employees. Three years ago the number of people employed by the defense forces totalled 143,200. The Army currently has 1,229 tanks, 1,296 armored vehicles, 1,023 pieces of artillery, 171 fighters, and 39 attack helicopters. (The air defense units come under Army control in Hungary.) Tanks numbers have been reduced by over 100 in the year, with armored vehicles numbers down by more than 400. Currently only the number of tanks exceeds the limit fixed at 835 by international agreements. As the defense budget has been decreasing in real terms for several years, there is an ever tighter rein on money for development, which represented 19 percent of all spending in 1990, but a mere 7.6 percent this year. The defense forces consider 30-40 percent budgeted for development would be ideal.
