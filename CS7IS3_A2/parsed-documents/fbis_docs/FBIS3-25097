Speaking to the Portuguese news agency, LUSA, Goncalves said: The two sides are cooperating and trying to ensure the continuity of the process. On 13 February, Gen. Goncalves, a Brazilian, ends his 12-month contract with the United Nations. He noted that he would only request an extension of his mandate if there were a crisis in the Mozambican peace process. He said the Mozambican process differs a great deal from the Angolan. Goncalves said Mozambicans are anxious about peace, the former warring factions no longer receive foreign assistance, UN troops are in place, and the Mozambique National Resistance is not the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola.
