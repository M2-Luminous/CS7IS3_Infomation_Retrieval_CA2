Foreign Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen and Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto, Finland's negotiators, are to sit at the negotiation table with ministers from the European Union. The Finns will officially receive the EU's new offer on agricultural subsidies and regional policies. The ministers did not wish to make much comment on the offer before the negotiations. According to them, it is a starting paper for negotiations. Early this evening, the EU ministers completed a new offer to Finland. In that offer, agricultural subsidies and regional subsidies were gathered together in a package. According to the new offer, the EU permits a widening of subsidies to unfavorable farming areas in such a way that the subsidies will cover 85 percent of Finland's arable area. Regional structural subsidies are offered particularly to those regions that remain outside farming subsidies. In the EU's view, its offer of farming subsidies and regional policies creates the basis for a soft adaptation of Finnish farming to the Union's farming. The EU offer mentions that in serious situations of difficulty, direct national subsidies may be considered. A subsidy for a northern region may be offered in the same way as the previous subsidy north of the 62d parallel. The EU does, however, permit some small additional regions nearby to be included within this subsidy. The northern subsidy would be a part of the national subsidies. The EU still requires a direct transition to the EU's producer prices. The Finnish Government met this afternoon to study the situation in the EU negotiations. The government will convene anew at 1000, i.e., a few hours before the deadline set for the negotiations. According to reports from Brussels, the European Union has come somewhat closer to Finland. More information is expected in the course of this evening of the European Union's latest offers.
