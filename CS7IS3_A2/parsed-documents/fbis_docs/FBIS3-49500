FBIS3-49500 "dreeu007__a94005" FBIS-EEU-94-007-A Document Type:Daily Report 11 January 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic Paper: FSIS Worked Against Clinton Election AU1001192094 Prague CTK in English 1725 GMT 8 Jan 94 AU1001192094 Prague CTK Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Prague, Jan 8 (CTK) -- Former Deputy Director of the Czechoslovak Intelligence Services Jaroslav Basta said that his organization had actively worked against Bill Clinton during the 1992 presidential election campaign in the United States, according to today's MLADA FRONT DNES. According to Basta, the Czechoslovak intelligence services provided incumbent President George Bush's election staff with information about Clinton's stay in Prague in 1970 and interviewed his acquaintances in Prague looking for information to discredit him. A former employee of the Federal Security and Information Service (FBIS) [FSIS], who was not named, told the paper that the FBIS has worked for George Bush's staff during the election campaign. He said that information was to be recorded for Bush's staff not only regarding the fact that Clinton had visited Moscow shortly after the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia by Warsaw Pact troops, but also regarding details about Clinton's hosts in Prague. At the end of 1969 and the beginning of 1970, Clinton travelled through Scandinavia to Moscow and from there through Czechoslovakia to Great Britain, where he was studying at Oxford. He stayed in Prague for about six days with the family of Jan Kopold, a fellow student at Oxford and grandson of Jan Sverma, a pre-World War II communist leader who was killed in the Slovak National Uprising against the Nazis at the end of the war. Kopold's father Bedrich allegedly worked for one of the security sections of the communist regime and his mother Jirina was registered as an agent of the Secret Police under the code name Jirka, the paper writes. The former FBIS employee said that the intelligence services were to hand over the information about Clinton in the fall of 1992 to members of Bush's campaign staff, who were to come to Prague. Another version, however, alleges that the information was to appear first in the Czech media and be taken by Bush's staff from there. Basta did not rule out the possibility that both methods were used. The paper writes that Bush's staff apparently also obtained information on Clinton in the Soviet Union and Great Britain. Interior Ministry Spokesman Jan Subrt told MLADA FRONTA DNES that Interior Minister Jan Ruml had no comment on the matter, as the FBIS had already been an independent organization at the time of the alleged activities. Premier Vaclav Klaus's spokeswoman Klara Pospisilova said that he had "never heard anything of the sort, so he would not comment on it." Petr Cermak, who was federal interior minister at the time, said that he did not know anything about the alleged activities. "It seems absurd to me. I do not rule out the possibility that it could have happened, however," he said.
