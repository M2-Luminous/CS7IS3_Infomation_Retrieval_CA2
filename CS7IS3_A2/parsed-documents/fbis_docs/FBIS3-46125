The scheme, aimed at developing upgraded new and high-tech products, is expected to help enterprises in the province to survive fierce competition on the international market. The scheme engages in new and high-tech development including micro-electronics, computer software science, new materials, automation and robotics, biological and oceanic engineering, energy saving, environmental protection and transportation. The plan will help the province, one of the most important industrial bases in China, to frame the future expansion of its leading industries, a government official said. The province, now dominated by energy-consuming industries, is expected to shift to technology-intensive production with the implementation of the scheme. Four engineering centers concerning the development of new materials, industrial robots, special integrated circuits and biological technology will be set up in the province around the year 2000. More than 3,500 series of products will be developed, of which 70 to 80 percent will be put into production. The provincial government will work out special policies to promote research and development programs in basic sciences and technology and help to put them into industrial production, the official said. Major programs will seek overseas cooperation so as to speed up the industrial production of new and high technologies, he added.
