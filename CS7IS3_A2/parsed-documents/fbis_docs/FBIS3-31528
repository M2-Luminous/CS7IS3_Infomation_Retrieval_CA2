[Gyuricza] In the spring of 1989 the sober majority voted for pure democracy, and not for anarchy or the patching up of the defeated system. And the question now is whether democracy will remain, whether the pure system, whose foundations were laid by the Hungarian Democratic Forum together with the coalition partners, will continue, Lajos Fur said, thanking the National Convention for its trust. He described fidelity [hueseg] as an important expression of our day. He recalled that four years ago a promise was made to remain faithful to the spirit of Lakitelek, to its declaration, to the MDF. Now there must be a pledge to remain faithful to the traditions, and at the same time, also to modern democracy, to social market economy, faithful to social justice, to the idea of the nation, to Hungarianness [magyarsag], MDF Chairman Lajos Fur said. [Schranz] At the news conference tonight, weighing up the 1994 elections, the MDF chairman said it would be ideal if the party gained as many seats in the parliament as in the 1990 elections. But Lajos Fur also added that he is certain that the MDF's share in the election will be between 20 and 30 percent. Sandor Lezsak, MDF deputy chairman and Presidium member, said in answer to a question: The MDF will not conclude a coalition just to be able to take part in government. It seems, continued the party's executive chairman, that the policies of the Hungarian Socialist Party and of the Alliance of Free Democrats are irreconcilable with the MDF's program.
