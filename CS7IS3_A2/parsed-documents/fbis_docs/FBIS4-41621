He explains to electorates that Ukraine cannot survive without close ccoperation with Russia. "One can hate the Russian autocracy, Stalinstic terrorism, but what it has got to do with contemporary economic cooperation with Russia," Leonid Kuchma said. "I am against dictatorship of Moscow, but for equal and mutually beneficial relations," he said. It is difficult to say, how far effective this appeal will be. West Ukrainian electorates sympathize with current president Leonid Kravchuk. Three years ago at the first presidential elections they had opposed Kravchuk, and had supported his only adversary Vyacheslav Chernovil. Now there mood has taken a 180 degree turn. Undoubtedly, West Ukrainian votes won't be decisive in Sunday's presidential elections, but they can have a significant effect on the fate of one or the other candidate.
