French scientists were recently successful in developing a silicon-germanium alloy which can be used for bipolar transistors with a limiting frequency of more than 50 gigahertz. According to the journal SEMICONDUCTOR INTERNATIONAL (Vol. 17, 1994, No. 1, p. 18), the laboratories of the National Center for Telecommunications Studies (CNET) of France Telecom have already exceeded a value of 100 gigahertz. Pierre Noblanc of CNET explains that the high frequency output is said to equal that of gallium arsenide transistors. The alloy of about 70-percent silicon and 30-percent germanium is used as a base for Bicmos products with structural widths of 0.25 micrometers. Production is to begin in 1996. Advantages are anticipated for bipolar, Mosfet and Bicmos products. He said that in Great Britain the company GEC Plessey Semiconductor in Swindon is likewise working on silicon-germanium alloys, but with the proportion of germanium 10 to 20 percent.
