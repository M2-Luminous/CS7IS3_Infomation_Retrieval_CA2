Rather, the scenario for the further course of events will essentially repeat the patterns of the cabinet's collaboration with "non-nomenklatura" economists: Some of their proposals will be incorporated into the government action plan while the alternative programs themselves are in for protracted discussions in parliamentary committees and at party caucuses, to be subsequently buried in oblivion. This is a win-win scenario for the government. On one hand, the leading members of the cabinet stress that the reform program in effect since last August will not be canceled under any circumstances. On the other, it is admitted that to overcome the economic crisis it is necessary to go outside the framework of purely monetary methods of economic regulation. It is expected that the main directions in economic policy adjustments will be promulgated at an expanded government session on 17 February (the president's speech to the Federation Council scheduled for 18 February, however, can shift the date of this event somewhat). In this case the incorporation of some provisions from the alternative programs (at present there are three: a memorandum by a group of academicians led by Stanislav Shatalin; a program by Sergey Glazyev and Dmitriy Lvov; and the "heterodox" plan by Yevgeniy Saburov) will allow the government to avert possible accusations from its opponents of monopolist practices in working out an economic course. As for the fate of the "academic" reforms as a whole, speaking at yesterday's press conference, Economy Minister Aleksandr Shokhin stated that all of them will be considered at a State Duma session today, together with the forecast for Russia's sociopolitical development in 1994 prepared by his ministry and a report by the State Statistics Committee -- which could well become the beginning of a lengthy process of coordinating these programs, which differ substantially. Usually the search for such compromise formulas ends inconclusively. Even so, as an Economy Ministry official said after the collegium session, any programs drawn up now have very little chance of being implemented -- regardless of their quality. This is primarily due to the fact that in today's Russia any prediction of socioeconomic development becomes outdated and unrealistic very soon. Furthermore, the experience of implementing such plans shows that they -- even judging by the number of corresponding government documents adopted -- are implemented by less than half. Thus, for instance, the August plan of government actions in the sphere of financial policy was fulfilled by 20 percent (out of the required 15 documents a mere three were adopted); in the sphere of institutional changes, out of 19 resolutions, five were approved; in structural policy, only one-third of the documents planned were signed. In addition to these, the ministry official singled out yet another fact: In spite of the reorganization of the government structure, it has proved impossible to overcome the "redundancy of decisionmaking channels" -- the majority of government members are busy "putting out fires" involved in the operation of particular branches and enterprises, which does not allow the government to attend to strategic planning. Main directions of action by the Russian Federation Government in 1994 creation of a commission on economic reform under the government chairman; rigid state regulation of monopoly activity, including control of prices for their output; enhancing financial settlement discipline: all enterprises must submit information about all of their bank accounts; elaboration of several models of government actions contingent on the actual situation; elaboration of a system of limit indicators in the social sphere which must be exceeded; implementation of institutional transformations aimed at promoting competition on the domestic market; lifting export quotas on a number of goods beginning in the second half of the year.
