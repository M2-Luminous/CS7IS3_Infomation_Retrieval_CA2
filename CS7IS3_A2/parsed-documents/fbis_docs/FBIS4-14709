FBIS4-14709 "drsov064_s_94017" FBIS-SOV-94-064 Daily Report 1 Apr 1994 Georgia Ardzinba Regrets Continued Russian Sanctions Ardzinba Regrets Continued Russian Sanctions LD0104183494 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1636 GMT 1 Apr 94 LD0104183494 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] The Abkhazian Supreme Soviet Chairman, Vladislav Ardzinba, told Interfax today that the current non-official consultations between representatives of Sukhumi and Tbilisi did not mean the renewal of Georgian-Abkhazian negotiations. Ardzinba said this would require cancellation of the Georgian parliament's resolution on the dismissal of the Abkhazian parliament which had in fact broken the negotiations. Ardzinba also expressed his regret due to continuing economic sanctions against Abkhazia which had been imposed by Russia. "The Abkhazian population has suffered from the burden of the war and is now restoring the republic. However, it has been deprived of the most necessary things. Primarily, this concerns the mainly urban Russian-speaking population," Ardzinba stressed. Ardzinba pointed out that Abkhazian society was indignant about the Russian sanctions. "Instead of friendly assistance they are trying to starve us," Ardzinba said. He suggested this was the policy of a certain Russian department which often spoke in defense of Russian-speaking populations living abroad. However, this did not seem to be being put into practice. Ardzinba stressed that rail transport through Abkhazian territory could be renewed in spite of all difficulties. "We guarantee the security for the movement of both people and goods," he pointed out. Commenting on the situation in the Kodor Canyon and on the Abkhazian-Georgian border formed by the Inguri River, Ardzinba said it was in general stable. The Georgian military formations which had occupied the village of Lata since autumn 1993 had been forced to retreat to the mountains. "Abkhazian armed forces control the situation on the Inguri River," Ardzinba emphasized. The Abkhazian Press and Information Ministry told Interfax that the situation in the Kodor Canyon villages was normalizing. The UN mission of military observers in Abkhazia visited the villages of Lower Lata and Upper Lata on March 31 from where Georgian troops have been forced. The head of the UN mission said in an interview with Interfax that he would inform the UN Security Council on the last events in the Kodor Canyon.
