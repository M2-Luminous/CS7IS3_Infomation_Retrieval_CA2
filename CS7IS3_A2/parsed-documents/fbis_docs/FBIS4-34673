One of Bolanos' bodyguards was killed in the attack, which occurred as Bolanos traveled along the Panamerican Highway in Usulutan. The attack, which occurred at the Mercedes Umana turnoff yesterday morning, happened when seven individuals riding in other vehicles attacked Bolanos' car by surprise. Bodyguards accompanied the director of the ANSP, which trains National Civil Police [PNC] agents. The criminals fled after realizing the attempt on Bolanos' life had failed. Therefore, all PNC offices in the Eastern Zone began an operation to find those who executed the attack. One of the vehicles in which the assailants rode was found in Berlin, where police clashed with the criminals. One of Bolanos' bodyguards, whose identification was not disclosed, was killed in this incident. After this clash, PNC agents and some of Bolanos' bodyguards began to chase the criminals and caught up with them on 4th West Street and 7th Northern Avenue in the neighborhood of La Merced in Usulutan, where an armed confrontation took place. Two criminals were killed, and one was wounded in this clash. One of the dead was identified as Luis Alberto Ostorga Mejia, a 44-year old from Estanzuelas, Usulutan. More than 1,000 colones were found in his possession, money that was presumably stolen. The other dead man was not identified. According to the subcommissioner in charge of the operation, however, he was approximately 30 years old, wore blue pants, a white shirt, and tennis shoes. He had 3,000 colones, a watch, a chain, and a yellow ring. The suspect who was wounded was not identified. He was taken to San Miguel Regional Hospital under police custody. The three suspects were riding in a white Toyota van, license plate No. MI-2416, presumably stolen. They carried no auto ownership papers, and the vehicle was identified as a van owned by an international mission. A Motorola radio, an AK-47 rifle, a Bronix weapon, and a sawed-off Uzi machine gun were found inside the vehicle, but none of them were registered under the criminals' name. PNC sources consulted in San Salvador confirmed the attack and stated a team is already investigating it.
