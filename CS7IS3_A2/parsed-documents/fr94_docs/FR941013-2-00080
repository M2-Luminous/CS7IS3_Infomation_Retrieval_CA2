A report will also be prepared for consideration by the Secretary of the Interior, the President and Congress, who will determine whether or not the withdrawal will be continued and if so, for how long. The final determination on the continuation of the withdrawal will be published in the Federal Register . The existing withdrawal will continue until such final determination is made.
