Joke, currently president of the Revenue Court of France, said previous decisions to sell arms to Taiwan were natural and necessary decisions. The French Government approved the sale of Lafayette-class frigates and Mirage fighter planes to Taiwan during Joke's service as defense minister. Joke noted that when the French Government approved the arms deal, it knew that it would be a long-term cooperation project. Joke also said that when the Francois Mitterrand government was weighing the possibilities of selling arms to Taiwan, he submitted a report to Mitterrand based on his experience in the Air Force. He explained that the arms sale would not just include one purchase, but also follow-up purchases and parts maintenance, which require long-term cooperation. He said that there is still plenty of room for Taipei-Paris cooperation, especially in culture and trade. Joke arrived here last Saturday. He will leave on Friday. During his weeklong visit in Taiwan, Joke met with Vice Premier Hsu Li-teh, presidents of the Control and Legislative Yuans, and other officials. He also visited the National Palace Museum.
