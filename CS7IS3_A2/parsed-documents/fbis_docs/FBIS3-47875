Commenting on the question of whether the stimulus package includes the income tax reduction, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii told a news conference on the evening of 19 January: "The Economic Consultative Council (chaired by Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and foreign minister) of the ruling parties will be asked to discuss the question. In my view, it is desirable that the additional package of stimulus measures include the income tax reduction." As for the question of how to make up for a fiscal shortfall incurring from cuts in the income tax, Mr. Fujii said: "I think the council also will be asked to discuss the question." Asked to comment on reports that Japan-U.S. finance ministerial talks would be held on 23 January, the finance minister said: "Although there has been no formal request for the talks from the United States, I will have to positively consider holding the talks if the United States makes such a request." Asked about the future of political reform at the news conference, the finance minister declined to specifically mention a schedule for carrying out the political reform, saying: "I am not in a position to predict how the political reform will be carried out in the future." Referring again to the additional package of stimulus measures, Mr. Fujii said: "Now, government ministries, especially the Economic Planning Agency, are working on the package and substantial progress has been made. I think that they will map out the package before long." At the news conference, he repeated his view that the Economic Consultative Council will discuss ways in detail for the income tax reduction. On the Japan-U.S. finance ministerial talks, Mr. Fujii said the United States had not formally sounded out Japan about holding the talks, but added: "I understand that Treasury Secretary Bentsen will stop in a Tokyo suburb for his plane's refueling on 23 January on his way back to Washington from his visit to China."
