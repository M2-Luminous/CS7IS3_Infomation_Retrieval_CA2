However, is it not that we entertain happy illusions about it, while the central authorities are determined not to give away their power to the so-called lower reaches--that is, local self-government bodies? [Kulesza] It is precisely as you suggest. The central authorities are very attached to their positions, and this is not a phenomenon that suddenly developed after 19 September [1993--parliamentary election]. The conservative nature of political structures is a general feature in world politics. Centralism is a common disease of politicians, although, in the West, for example, a decentralization campaign was launched as a conscious and deliberate decision many years ago. [Zajac] Do you not believe that the handing down of power is impeded by the fear and traditionalist mentality of the politicians at the top, whereas, if we consider it objectively, they would actually be able to get rid of the responsibility for many problems? [Kulesza] Handing over a certain proportion of their responsibilities would be more advantageous to them in objective terms, but it would not be as simple as all that. When you try to jump onto a moving streetcar, there is a moment at which you are no longer running but are not yet riding the streetcar. This situation is something we can quite realistically fear. All of the noncommunist governments we had since 19 September were doing something--well or less well, wisely or not very--to promote the cause of a reform of the central administration system, which aimed, among other things, at a decentralization of power. We even arrived at a stage, during the Suchocka government, where everything was already prepared for a reform, and the only thing needed was to simply launch it. It so happened that I was at that time responsible for the administrative reform, and I remember clearly that there was also a very obvious public need and desire for such a change. The following may be an extreme example, but people really did offer church services for the success of the new districts scheme. So what happened instead? We now have the very first government that commands an unquestionable majority in parliament but has absolutely no political willpower to reform the administration system. The conditions and opportunities are there, but there is no will to carry out the reform. [Zajac] The price of the reform is another subject of public debate. Critics claim that the new districts will simply be too expensive. [Kulesza] I disagree. The cost of the administrative reform will come to approximately half a trillion zlotys [Z]. An election costs as much, to reach for a topical example. The costs of relinquishing the plans for the reform will be much higher. [Zajac] How would you answer the argument that, in fact, a reform that reinforces self-government structures and hands over power to "lower," local structures is needed by politically bankrupt politicians rather than by our society? [Kulesza] Such an objection is simply stupid. I will answer it with a simple example: If you are buying a car of a particular make, you are not interested in its finer construction details because that is a job for the engineering designer. Similarly, the design and implementation of local self-government reforms are jobs for politicians. You simply want to drive your new car in comfort, while society wants to see efficient and effective administration, competent police, and good hospitals and schools--that is, everything that can be designed and executed by the "political engineers." [Zajac] Does this mean that politicians know better what the public wants? [Kulesza] Politicians must know better because that is what they are elected for. They are responsible for setting up all of the mechanisms in the state so that these work well and are of benefit to the public. [Zajac] How should this local self-government "automobile" look? [Kulesza] Local communities should assume control of everything that is required to meet the collective needs of the local population--for example, education (primary as well as secondary), health care and social services, the police, the fire-fighting forces, culture and the arts, and so on. At the same time, we must remember that we cannot hand over power and responsibility without money. [Zajac] Let us move from theory to practical considerations. Our own backyard in the tri-city [Gdansk, Gdynia, Sopot] conurbation surely provides an interesting example of local self-government run actively by the local community, with all of the advantages and drawbacks that this entails. [Kulesza] The tri-city is in a rather fortunate situation. The conurbation, whose size equals other major cities in Poland, is divided into three sectors, each with its own self-government bodies. This is all working well, even as the decentralization reform in Warsaw, which is devised along the same lines, is encountering very considerable resistance. [Zajac] To conclude, let us attempt a recapitulation of the situation. Although, admittedly, the administrative reform and the associated "handing down" of power to local structures has been halted, the last word in the reform process has not been said yet. Are you an optimist or a pessimist when it comes to assessing the future of that process? [Kulesza] That depends on how the three parties involved--that is, the Democratic Left Alliance, the Polish Peasant Party, and the Union of Freedom--act now. However, it is difficult to ward off pessimistic reflections about the future of the reform. [Zajac] Thank you for talking with us.
