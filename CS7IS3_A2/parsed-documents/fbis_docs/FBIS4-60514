The process as a whole is considered an extremely important historical turning point. The Palestinian people are aware of their duty to ensure the success of this process, because the cost of failure, God forbid, would be extremely tragic. The Palestinians' task at present is to establish the organs and cadres of the Palestinian Authority, on the one hand, and to keep the wheels of government turning, on the other, in order to provide the necessary services to the citizens and create jobs for tens of thousands of unemployed workers. This demands the establishment of industrial and agricultural projects in the areas of the transitional authority to absorb these workers as soon as possible. There is no doubt that ensuring security and peace is considered one of the main challenges and difficult tests facing the Palestinians. In view of these difficulties and obstacles, the Palestinians must make greater efforts and sacrifices to overcome them. The states that have pledged to provide economic aid to the Palestinians are called upon to fulfill their commitments. Numerous dangers are threatening peace. Time is definitely one of the factor endangering the peace process and Palestinian aspirations.
