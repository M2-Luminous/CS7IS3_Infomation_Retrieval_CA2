The proposal condemns parity exchange between the dollar and the real, (that is, $1 for 1 real). PT presidential candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva told O ESTADO: "We do not agree with the dollarization of the economy." Instead of backing the new currency with dollar reserves, the PT will propose creating a national currency back up fund based on the patrimony of Brazilian economy. The alternative PT project has been under study for the past three months. It will be made public before the end of the month, that is, 30 days before the real comes into circulation. It clearly has a political and electoral purpose: to state Lula's position regarding the government economic program which is the basis of Fernando Henrique Cardoso's candidacy. "If we have 40 percent of the voters' preference and if we are ahead in all polls, we must say what we think of the economic plan that, for better or worse, we will probably inherit," Lula told O ESTADO. PT government platform coordinator Marco Aurelio Garcia said: "A frozen exchange rate could have serious consequences and may harm the start of the PT administration if we win the elections," adding: "This is why it is important to establish our position regarding the third stage of the government economic plan." Economist Paulo Nogueira Batista Jr. suggested a plan, which is being analyzed by a group of PT experts, to establish a special mortgage in the Central Bank on private and public, foreign and national companies with a net patrimony above a certain level. The mortgage would be used to back up the new currency. The companies "would be urged" to establish such mortgage. The PT is also discussing the possibility of using workers' assets, like the Severance Pay Fund [FGTS], to back up the new currency. As a counterpart, companies and workers could be represented in the Currency Stabilization Council and participate in the results of issuing the real [as published]. In both cases, Paulo Nogueira Batista Jr.'s proposal foresees issuing a security that would be the only one to pay monetary correction and a reasonable interest rate. The new currency then, could be converted to this security. The mortgage on the companies' patrimony would have a expiration date which will be defined by the PT. "When the stabilization process concludes, the companies would not suffer losses and their patrimony will have not lost its value," said PT Senator Eduardo Suplicy, one of the economists studying the alternative PT economic project. "In this manner, companies would be very interested in the success of the stabilization project," he added. Beside this, on the grounds that Lula is currently the favorite to win the elections, he intends to negotiate with President Itamar Franco on access to the administrative apparatus during the election campaign. The PT wants access to the figures and data used inside the government to obtain a clearer and more objective notion of what awaits it in case it wins the elections. "We will ask for access to all the available information in order to prepare our government programs," one of the main national PT leaders told O ESTADO. The PT proposal, which is being prepared by a group comprising Paulo Nogueira Batista Jr., Paul Singer, Deputy Aloizio Mercadante, and Suplicy, still generates conflicting opinions. Some really want to present the document as an alternative government project, while others want to simply express the opinions of the PT, without it being a formal counterproposal. It has been decided, however, that the document will condemn backing the new currency with the dollar reserves. "We do not want to receive the government with a dollarized economy," said PT national President Rui Falcao. PT economists are scared of the possibility that the dollarization of the economy may kill Brazilian industry as it did in Argentina. The party has not decided yet how to present its proposal: Through its congressional bloc, or by Lula himself to mark the party's political stance. Either way, the document will be announced amid great publicity to gain points in a month of poor election campaign performance and when the public's attention is concentrated on the upcoming world cup soccer.
