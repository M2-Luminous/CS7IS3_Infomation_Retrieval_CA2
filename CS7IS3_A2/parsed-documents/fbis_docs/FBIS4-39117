The decision was assumed to realize the last-year September 14 agreement "On economic reconstruction of region in the zone of Georgian-Ossetian conflict". However, as SNARK reporter was told in the International Economic Relations Department of Georgian Foreign Ministry, the Russian side has not yet allocated the 5b rubles promised for reconstruction. Also the decision on Russian 20b credit to Georgia for 1994 has not been made yet, though the corresponding agreement was reached during Boris Yeltsin's visit to Georgia. Russian side, the department says, puts forward the requirement that Georgia should liquidate the 10b debt by credits granted to her last year.
