FR940217-1-00023 FR940217-1-00005 During the review of these cost estimates, it appeared to the Commission that the magnitude of the cost may be dependent upon the type of business conducted by a broker-dealer. The SIA acknowledged that broker-dealers with large retail client bases, branch networks, or widely marketed clearing services would be more likely to have implemented an order match system as a necessary cost of doing such business. Conversely, broker-dealers that primarily have institutional clients and few branches would be less likely to have automated order match systems and the ability to enhance their automated systems in a cost-effective manner. The commenters also indicated that ``average price'' trades and accounts compound their execution time concerns exponentially. 62 In addition, the commenters noted that a Commission request for transaction reports would likely come at times of severe market stress, which typically stretch broker-dealer trade processing capabilities to their limits. Finally, as a result of the proposed next business day reporting time frame, the commenters indicated that automation would be the only feasible means to assure compliance. 62 Average price trades usually entail the execution of one large order, for one or more customers, through many small trades at varying prices throughout a given day. Customers who employ a broker-dealer, bank, or trust company as their centralized custodian and agent for settlement typically request that trades be confirmed and submitted for settlement as one trade at an average price in order to minimize the ``ticket charges or fees'' levied by the custodian. For example, a 150,000 share order may be filled through the execution of 100 trades of 1,500 shares each, at 50 different prices, and beginning at 9:30 a.m. and ending at 4:00 p.m. This average price trade may be posted to the customer account, and settled, as one ``ticket'' for 150,000 shares at an average price, without any indication of the many smaller lots, different prices, or actual execution times. A few commenters suggested alternatives for reducing this burden that included requesting execution times on a need-to-know basis, lengthening the reporting time frame, and postponing the effectiveness of the requirements to see how frequently the data would be required. From the outset, the Commission has sought alternative solutions that would minimize this burden while achieving the fundamental purpose of the large trader reporting provisions of the Market Reform Act. The Commission staff, SIA, and SIAC have not identified existing industry systems that would gather execution times for investor trading activity in a simple and accurate manner. Three alternatives that would require the development of new systems, however, were proposed. First, it was suggested that ``branch or DOT'' sequence numbers could be used in conjunction with SRO audit trail data. While this suggestion appeared to be workable with respect to ``system orders,'' 63 the SIA and SIAC agreed that this proposal would still require some form of automated order match system and may be considered by some broker-dealers to be equally as burdensome with respect to ``manual orders.'' 64 63 ``System orders'' are those orders that are routed and reported through SRO order routing systems and are automatically posted to back-office accounting systems by the system. These orders, generally, may be characterized as orders for small individual investors or program trades. 64 ``Manual orders'' are those orders that are routed and reported manually over the telephone or telegraph and are manually posted to back-office accounting systems by broker-dealer personnel. These orders, generally, may be characterized as large block trades for institutional investors. Second, after acknowledging that system order execution times did not pose a significant problem, the SIA proposed the development of computer algorithms that would match ``order entry times'' with SRO audit trail data to determine the execution time of manual orders. Third, the Division of Market Regulation proposed a hybrid of these alternatives that bifurcates the execution time reporting requirements along the lines of system and manual orders. 65 65 See Memoranda to SEC File No. S7&hyph;24&hyph;91 from the Division of Market Regulation dated April 16, 1992, May 7, 1992, and June 11, 1992 outlining meetings where these proposals were discussed. After carefully weighing costs and benefits, the Commission has decided to repropose the Division's alternative for reducing the burdens of the execution time reporting requirements. The reproposed reporting requirements are found in new paragraphs (e) (3) and (4). Paragraph (e)(3) of the reproposed rule would provide that with respect to system orders, all transaction information required to be maintained under the reproposed rule, including execution time, would be required to be reported to the Commission or an SRO designated by the Commission before the close of business on the day specified in a request for such information. As indicated in the Proposing Release, the Commission would not require reports to be submitted prior to trade comparison and would consider pertinent market conditions as well as the capabilities of the industry's trade processing facilities. 66 Moreover, under the reproposed rule, the Commission may require the transmission of transaction reports after final settlement because of the inclusion of cancellations and corrections within the definition of a transaction. 67 66 See Proposing Release, 56 FR 42557, at n. 84 and accompanying text. 67 See supra Section III.A.1.e., for a discussion of the definition of a transaction. Paragraph (e)(4)(i) of the reproposed rule would provide that with respect to manual orders, all transaction information required to be maintained, except execution time, would be required to be reported before the close of business on the day specified in a request for such information. Lastly, new paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of the reproposed rule would provide that the execution times of manual order transactions, which were initially reported without execution times, would be required to be reported within 15 calendar days after a subsequent request for such information. It should be noted that the Commission may request that broker-dealers provide such information for entire transaction report submissions, individual transactions, or a group of related transactions. Further, these manual order execution times would be required to be transmitted electronically, in machine-readable form, with all of the previously reported information regarding each of the manual order transactions for which execution times were requested.
