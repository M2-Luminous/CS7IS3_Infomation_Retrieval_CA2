FR940720-2-00138 FR940720-2-00077 [Release No. 34&hyph;34376; File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;94&hyph;12] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc., Relating to Modification of Fees for Failure To Observe OEX RAES Requirements July 14, 1994. On April 1, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposal to amend CBOE Rule 24.17, ``RAES Eligibility in OEX,'' to change the eligibility standards under which individuals, member organizations and joint accounts may participate in the CBOE's Retail Automatic Execution System (``RAES'') for Standard & Poor's 100 Index (``OEX'') options. Among other things, the CBOE proposes to eliminate the automatic disqualification provision from CBOE Rule 24.17 and replace the rule's current $500.00 fee for failures to comply with RAES log-on and log-off requirements with the following fee schedule: a $100.00 fee for each of the first three failures to comply with the log-on or log-off requirements in one calendar year; a $250.00 fee for each of the fourth through sixth such failures in one calendar year; and a $500.00 fee for all subsequent failures to comply with the log-on and log-off requirements in one calendar year. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1982). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1993). Notice of the proposed rule change was published for comment in the Federal Register in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34128 (May 27, 1994), 59 FR 28907 (June 3, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal. In May 1993 Exchange Rule 24.17 was amended to establish, among other things, more rigorous log-on and log-off requirements for participants in OEX RAES. 3 For example, group members who previously were logged on automatically by the Exchange must now log on at their own initiative each time they enter the trading crowd. Likewise, members who previously were not required to log off the system each time they left the trading crowd must now do so. 3 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32248 (April 30, 1993), 58 FR 27596 (``RAES Approval Order''). In view of these additional log-on and log-off requirements, the Exchange believes that the $500.00 fees currently due from members who do not log on or log off as required are excessive. The proposed rule change therefore establishes a new graduated fee schedule, under which the fee amount will increase in relation to the number of times within any one calendar year that a member does not log on or log off as required. Specifically, during each calendar year, a $100.00 fee will be due for each of the first three times that a member fails to observe the log-on or log-off requirements; a $250.00 fee will be due for each of the fourth through sixth such times; and a $500.00 fee will be due for all subsequent times. In addition, the CBOE proposes to assess a $500.00 fee on any member participating in a joint account or nominee account held by a member organization if the member logs onto OEX RAES but thereafter terminates participation prior to the next succeeding expiration date without either joining another OEX RAES account or terminating membership on the Exchange. In addition, the CBOE proposes to eliminate the automatic disqualification provisions in CBOE Rule 24.17. Specifically, the Exchange proposes to delete the provisions which provide that a individuals's, participating nominee's, or joint account member's failure to meet his RAES obligations will disqualify him from signing onto RAES for such time period as the OEX Floor Procedure Committee (``OFPC'') determines. The CBOE also proposes to allow an individual required to sign onto RAES immediately prior to expiration to apply to the OFPC for prospective relief from the log-on requirements during a particular expiration cycle. The proposal states that in deciding such applications, the OFPC may limit the grant of relief by imposing time periods during which the applicant will not be eligible to participate in RAES.
