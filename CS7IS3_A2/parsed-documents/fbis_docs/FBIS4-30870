It is supposed to be an unofficial visit even though Croatia has tried, with the statements of its ambassador in Ljubljana, Miljenko Zagar, to portray it as official talks between Presidents Kucan and Tudjman. We have learned unofficially that in a letter to Prime Minister Dr. Janez Drnovsek President Kucan warned that it would be good if all offices responsible for Slovene foreign policy were to reexamine the purpose of his visit to Zagreb together with the government. In mid-May, after President Kucan received the invitation from Zagreb, the Slovene foreign minister was still in favor of the visit. However, since then circumstances have changed. In the letter to Drnovsek, Kucan warned that since October 1992, when he and Croatian President Tudjman last met, there have been no meetings at presidential level. Despite this, the question arises as to what the scope of Kucan's visit to Zagreb could be, since the latest events have shown a lack of any sign of mutual desire to resolve outstanding problems between the two countries through consensus. In his letter, Kucan cited the example of Secovlje and the construction of a border crossing there in spite of the protest by Prime Minister Drnovsek to Croatian Prime Minister Valentic. A decision about the visit will be known in the next few days when the government's official position becomes known. President Kucan and Prime Minister Drnovsek discussed this subject this afternoon.
