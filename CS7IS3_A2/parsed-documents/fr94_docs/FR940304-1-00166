FR940304-1-00166 FR940304-1-00014 The net present value analysis, a measure of the net savings to society, indicates that standard level 1 would produce a net present value of $22.3 billion to consumers. The corresponding net present values for levels 2 and 3 are $25.4 billion and $27.3 billion, respectively. See Technical Support Document, Table 3.6. C. Energy savings. As indicated above, standards will result in significant savings of electricity consumption for fluorescent lamp ballasts. D. Lessening of utility or performance of products. As indicated above, DOE established classes of products in order to assure that the standards analyzed would not lessen the existing utility or performance of fluorescent lamp ballasts. E. Impact of lessening of competition. The determination of this factor must be made by the Attorney General. F. Need of the Nation to save energy. Fluorescent lamp ballasts use electricity directly. In 1987, 27 percent of commercial sector source electricity (or 2.17 quads) was accounted for on a national basis by fluorescent lamp ballasts. In addition, decreasing future energy demand as a result of standards will decrease air pollution. See Technical Support Document, Appendix D of Volume A. 45 Decreases in air pollution will occur for sulfur oxides (listed in equivalent weight of sulfur dioxide, or SO 2 ). For fluorescent lamp ballasts at standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated SO 2 reduction would be over 2,417,000 tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of SO 2 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in the United States is 1.20 percent. For standard levels 2 and 3, the reductions are 2,797,000 tons and 2,986,000 tons, respectively. The highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 1.47 percent. 45 See footnote 37. Standards will also result in a decrease in nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated NO 2 reduction would be 2,218,000 tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of NO 2 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in the United States is 1.19 percent. For standard levels 2 and 3, the reductions are 2,566,000 tons and 2,739,000 tons, respectively. The highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 1.47 percent. Another consequence of the standards will be the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated CO 2 reduction would be 1,174 million tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of CO 2 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in the United States are 1.17 percent. For standard levels 2 and 3, the reductions are 1,358 million tons and 1,450 million tons, respectively. The highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 1.44 percent. Decreasing future electricity demand is also likely to result in reductions in the demand for oil used in electricity generation. Because virtually all sources of oil, on the margin, are foreign, any reductions in oil demand are likely to be reflected in reductions in oil imports. For standard level 1, the estimated decrease in oil imports is 230.41 million barrels over the years 1996 to 2030. For standard levels 2 and 3, the reductions in oil imports are estimated to be 266.97 and 285.05 million barrels, respectively. 5. Conclusion Section 325(l)(2)(A) of the Act specifies that the Department must consider, for amended standards, those standards that ``achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency which the Secretary determines is technologically feasible and economically justified.'' Accordingly, the Department first considered the max tech level of efficiency, i.e., standard level 3 for amended fluorescent lamp ballast standards. Of the standard levels analyzed, level 3 will save the most energy (17.0 quads between 1996 and 2030). In order to meet this standard, the Department assumes that all fluorescent lamp ballasts will be electronic rapid or instant start. After carefully considering the analysis, the Department is amending the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act&hyph;1988 imposed 1990 standard for fluorescent lamp ballasts with standard level 3 for fluorescent lamp ballasts. The Department concludes that standard level 3 for fluorescent lamp ballasts saves a significant amount of energy and is technologically feasible and economically justified.
