FR940127-1-00066 FR940127-1-00017 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Parts 285, 630, and 678 [I.D. 011294A] Atlantic Highly Migratory Species; Receipt of Petition for Rulemaking; Correction AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Correction to notice of receipt of petition for rulemaking and request for comments. SUMMARY: NMFS corrects the notice of receipt of petition for rulemaking on issues relating to Atlantic highly migratory species published on December 22, 1993 (58 FR 67761). The National Fishing Association (NFA) petitioned NMFS to restrict commercial net fishing in certain months in five special management zones defined in the petition for the offshore waters of the northwest Atlantic Ocean. The petition also requests mandatory logbooks for recreational vessels fishing for certain highly migratory species and a revised definition of a commercial fishing vessel. This document corrects the longitude and latitude coordinates of the restrictive fishing zones. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Rebecca Lent, 301&hyph;713&hyph;2347. In the notice of receipt of petition for rulemaking published December 22, 1993, which was the subject of FR Document 93&hyph;31277, on page 67761, the table is corrected to read as follows: ␣ 1Zone 1Area 1Restricted period 1Coordinates 1 W.
