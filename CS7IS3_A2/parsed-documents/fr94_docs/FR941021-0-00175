The Wireless Cable Association International (WCAI), the National Telephone Cooperative Association (NTCA) and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), urge that the Commission adopt rules that will provide adequate compensation to ITFS/MMDS operators for costs associated with improving their transmitters to comply with any stricter out-of-band emission requirements. 202 WCAI also notes that broadband repeaters used by some ITFS and wireless cable system operators to relay signals into areas that would otherwise be unreachable could pose a threat to MSS downlink operations at the upper portion of the 2483.5&hyph;2500 MHz band. 203 202 WCAI Comments at 3 and 6, NTCA Comments at 2&hyph;3, and CPB Comments at 6. 203 WCAI Comments at 4. 156. LQP, in contrast, does not believe that interference is a significant problem. It conducted a study to assess the impact of ITFS/MMDS out-of-band interference to MSS downlinks in the 2483.5&hyph;2500 MHz band and concluded that no harmful interference to MSS operations will result from ITFS/MMDS, including operations of ITFS/MMDS booster stations, and that stricter standards on ITFS/MMDS out-of-band emissions are not necessary. LQP maintains that: (1) MSS downlink operations below 2488.75 MHz will not experience interference from ITFS stations, (2) in urban areas, where ITFS transmitters are prevalent, MSS dual mode transceivers can be used to switch customers to existing terrestrial cellular radio facilities, and (3) MSS user transceivers operating in the highest channel frequency in the 2483.5&hyph;2500 MHz band within an ITFS coverage area will be able to operate satisfactorily in all but a few extreme situations by rejecting the ITFS visual carrier and other out-of-band emissions. 204 204 LQP Comments, Technical Appendix, at 27. 157. TRW urges that the LQP study ``may have taken an overly optimistic view of the interference situation.'' 205 TRW also contends that MSS systems using wider CDMA channels (e.g., 5 MHz or wider) may not have the flexibility to move to a lower frequency channel and that until further required measurements are taken and MSS system designs are finalized, the impact of ITFS/MMDS out-of-band interference is not certain. 206 205 TRW Reply Comments at 79. 206 TRW Technical Appendix to Reply Comments at A&hyph;24. 158. Upon review of the technical information in the record, we see no significant threat of harmful out-of-band emission interference into MSS from ITFS/MMDS operations above 2500 MHz. Well designed CDMA receivers should mitigate the effect of out-of-band emissions from ITFS/MMDS. Additionally, a MSS user transceiver's dynamic channel switching capability should reduce any adverse affects from ITFS/MMDS. Further, our intra-service sharing plan allows enough 2.4 GHz band spectrum for MSS operators to avoid ITFS/MMDS out-of-band emissions in the upper portions of the allocation. Consequently, we will not initiate a proceeding to restrict further the out-of-band emissions on ITFS/MMDS at this time.
