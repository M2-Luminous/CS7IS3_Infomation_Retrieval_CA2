Sionil] [Text] The Philippines' foreign debt stock hit $34.1 billion as of end-September 1993, up by more than 10 percent from $30.9 billion in 1992. Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) [Central Bank of the Philippines] Governor Gabriel Singson assured, however, that the $3.2 billion expansion of government's foreign liabilities should cause no alarm because of the improvement in the country's "ability to pay." The bigger debt stock was caused by the continued appreciation of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar, in which the bulk of the country's foreign indebtedness is denominated. The debt pile-up was also brought about by the additional availments of loans from multilateral creditors. "Some critics are quick to point out that the foreign debt has continued to expand. Indeed, it has grown... but the country's ability to pay has been more than enhanced," Singson told members of the Philippine Association of Finance Companies, Inc. To prove his point, Singson cited the country's lower debt service ratio or debt service payments as a proportion of exports of goods and services as below the 19 percent compared to a high of more than 20 percent the previous years. He pointed out this debt service ratio was "well within internationally accepted norms" as pointed by the World Bank. In fact, the country's debt service ratio is significantly "better" than the ratios of Latin American and the neighboring countries such as Argentina at 35 percent, Brazil at 24 percent, Indonesia at 32 percent, and Mexico at 44 percent. Also, in his speech, Singson reiterated plans to bring down further the level of reserve requirements on bank's deposits and deposit liabilities. He pointed out that the "progressive easing of reserve requirements augured well for the financial market."
