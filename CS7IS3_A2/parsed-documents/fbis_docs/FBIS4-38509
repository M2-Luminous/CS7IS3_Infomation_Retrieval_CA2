This is said in a statement issued by the faction. The faction believes that Burbulis insulted millions of people who on December 12 voted for the new fundamental law. "The Agrarian Party was firmly against the adopted version of the Constitution. Mr Burbulis must have forgotten the vigour and persistence with which the presidential team, in which Mr Burbulis had no last role to play, was pushing through its draft of the fundamental law," said the statement. The document also mentions "Mr Burbulis's sinister role in the history of Russia of the recent period".
