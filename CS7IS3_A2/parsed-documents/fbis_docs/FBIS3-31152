An address of the KNSB Executive Committee to the parliamentary factions says that the passage of the 1994 budget in its present form would place the socially weak strata in an extremely difficult situation and would result in unwarranted cuts in social expenditures. The independent trade unions insist that parliament urgently pass acts to regulate the social funds and provide moderate protection for Bulgarian industrial and agricultural production. The KNSB is for revising the unreasonably high taxes and fees payable by private entrepreneurs and leaseholders, the document reads. This trade union amalgamation wants the cabinet to set up a 500 million leva (about U.S.$12 million) fund for extending credits at moderately preferential terms to managers and workers to facilitate their participation in privatization. The KNSB also demands the passing of an act restituting the property of juristic persons the economic activity of whom was terminated by the communist regime after September 9, 1944. The KNSB has moved in parliament a package of proposals and projects comprising fundamental principles of bills regulating the setting up and management of a special "social assistance" fund and the election of representatives of the insured in the management of different social funds. A declaration of the executive committee of the confederation regarding the property of the former trade unions by the end of 1993 proposes that this property be used in setting up a fund for the social assistance of the poorest strata of the population, controlled jointly by state and public organizations. Over 2.5 billion leva (about U.S.$75 million), the sum at which the KNSB estimates the property of the former trade unions, are actually frozen, a letter of the KNSB to the National Assembly reads. By the end of the week this trade union amalgamation intends to hold meetings with representatives of the parliamentary political forces, Prof. Krustyu Petkov said at the briefing. The meetings will discuss issues related to the draft budget and the funds allocated to education, health care and the municipalities in this country, the trade union leader added.
