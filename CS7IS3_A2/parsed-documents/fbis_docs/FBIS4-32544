As the autumn parliamentary elections approach, Vasic writes, some examination of how to finance them should be made. The parliamentarians, however, have set aside consideration of the draft law on political parties, which is supposed to regulate financing, as well as the law on parliamentary elections, until the very end of their term of office. The elections are supposed to take place within six months, Vasic says, and the issue of financing the electoral campaign is crucial, especially for the extraparliamentary parties, because they will not get much help from the state budget. According to the proposed law, 30 percent of the funds budgeted for the election are intended for the parties that received at least 3 percent of the votes in the last general election, held during October-December 1990. The remainder are to be distributed to the parties currently in parliament according to the number of seats they hold. It remains to be seen whether the funds will be available for use before the electoral campaign begins, Vasic states. He notes that this is not the only "card" the parliamentary parties can play, since they already have sizeable funds at their disposal, as well as donations from abroad. Whether that money will suffice, however, is debatable, Vasic observes. According to Vasic, the Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia (SDSM) is financed by membership dues, income from the "Demokratija" publishing house, and donations. This party, which is in the governing coalition, would like to have the draft law passed in its current form, without setting spending limits, he adds. In practice, the SDSM will attempt to respect the prohibition on money from abroad, says Danco Petrovski, chef de cabinet of the presidency of the SDSM, writes Vasic. The VMRO-DPMNE (Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity) interprets the lack of progress on the law on political parties as an indication that the government is intentionally blocking the resolution of the issue of party financing in order to restrict political activity by the opposition, reports Vasic. He cites Dosta Dimovska, the party's deputy chairman, "The parties in the governing coalition have an extensive source of financing through the property that they have at their disposal, from dark recesses in the budget, and from their control over enterprises, but they block adoption of the law on political parties." According to Vasic, the VMRO-DPMNE sees limitations on donations as unnecessary. It considers that enormous amounts are necessary for campaigns and that there should be a way to equalize resources. Although the VMRO-DPMNE receives occasional gifts, the party has no foreign donors. Dimovska also says: "As far as sympathizers in the business community are concerned, we keep their identity secret because of government repression." Vasic reports that the Liberal Party, another member of the governing coalition, is preparing its strategy and is concerned that contributions to political parties might lead to certain groups or individuals having undue influence. Ace Kocevski, the Liberal Party secretary, says there is a need for a precise law. Civic Liberal Party Chairman Boris Geraj comments that extraparliamentary parties do not have a chance in the area of financing. He believes that budget funds should be distributed equally or not at all. "Some go on foot, others in Ferraris," Geraj points out. In his opinion, business interests are self-serving and financing from them should be excluded.
