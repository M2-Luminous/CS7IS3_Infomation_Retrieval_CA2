ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The United States Forest Service proposes that a 100-acre withdrawal for the Baldwin, Water Canyon, and Monica Administrative Sites in the Cibola National Forest continue for an additional 10 years. The lands will remain closed to mining, but have been and will remain open to mineral leasing. DATES: Comments should be received by May 9, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be sent to State Director, BLM New Mexico State Office, P.O. Box 27115, Santa Fe, New Mexico 87502, 505&hyph;438&hyph;7502. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Georgiana E. Armijo, BLM New Mexico State Office, 505&hyph;438&hyph;7594. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The United States Forest Service proposes that the existing land withdrawal made by Public Land Order No. 3378, be continued for a period of 10 years pursuant to Section 204 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, 43 U.S.C. 1714 (1988). The lands are described as follows: New Mexico Principal Meridian, Cibola National Forest, Water Canyon Administrative Site T. 3 S., R. 3 W., Sec. 23, W1/2SE1/4NE1/4 and E1/2SW1/4NE1/4. T. 4 S., R. 6 W., Sec. 18, SW1/4NE1/4SE1/4 and SE1/4NW1/4SE1/4. T. 1 S., R. 10 W., Sec. 33, NE1/4NW1/4. The areas described aggregate 100 acres in Socorro and Catron Counties. The purpose of the withdrawal is to protect the Baldwin, Water Canyon, and Monica Administrative Sites in the Cibola National Forest. The withdrawal segregates the lands from location and entry under the mining laws, but not the mineral leasing laws. No change is proposed in the purpose or segregative effect of the withdrawal. For a period of 90 days from the date of publication of this notice, all persons who wish to submit comments in connection with the proposed withdrawal continuation may present their views in writing to the State Director in the New Mexico State Office. The authorized officer of the Bureau of Land Management will undertake such investigations as are necessary to determine the existing and potential demand for the lands and their resources. A report will also be prepared for consideration by the Secretary of the Interior, the President, and the Congress, who will determine whether or not the withdrawal will be continued and, if so, for how long. The final determination on the continuation of the withdrawal will be published in the Federal Register. The existing withdrawal will continue until such final determination is made. Dated: January 27, 1994. Carol L. Sampson, Acting State Director. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;2625 Filed 2&hyph;4&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;FB&hyph;M
