FBIS4-57675 "drlat099_f_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-099 Daily Report 18 May 1994 CENTRAL AMERICA El Salvador ONUSAL Chief Cited on Completion of Peace Agreements ONUSAL Chief Cited on Completion of Peace Agreements PA2105021994 San Salvador LA PRENSA GRAFICA in Spanish 18 May 94 p 4 PA2105021994 San Salvador LA PRENSA GRAFICA Spanish BFN [Text] Enrique Ter Horst, chief of ONUSAL [UN Observers for El Salvador], said he believes the peace agreements could be mostly implemented by 1 June so as to "clear the table" for the next president. Ter Horst said hard work is being done to conclude this week the rescheduling of the agreements, the fulfillment of which have been delayed. "Efforts are being made to finish the discussion of the topics that are still pending," he said. "The effort to reschedule the implementation of the agreements between the government and the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] is aimed at clearing the table. We have made great progress and we hope to finish this week," he said. UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, in his report to the Security Council that was revealed on Monday, made reference to the situation. He said he was concerned because some aspects of the peace agreements require special "urgent attention." Butrus-Ghali made specific reference to the topics of public security, return of former fighters to civilian life, and land transfers. In view of the negotiation of dates, Ter Horst said that once an agreement is reached the only thing pending would be the operation mechanism, which will be up to the government of Armando Calderon Sol, who will be sworn in on 1 June and who has expressed his commitment to the agreements. The ONUSAL chief admitted the delays and said "much remains to be done," but said "great progress" has been made and that the parties involved are willing to fulfill their obligations. The viewpoint of the ONUSAL chief contrasts with the report released by Butrus-Ghali, which points out that after 1 June "much will remain to be done" to complete the implementation of the agreements. In the report, Butrus-Ghali lists the topics that are still pending such as the complete deployment of the National Civilian Police (PNC) and the demobilization of the National Police; land transfers; the program for the return of the former fighters to civilian life; and the implementation of the recommendations of the Truth Commission. Butrus-Ghali said the agreements called for the complete deployment of the PNC by the end of September 1994, but the government said the National Police will not disappear until March 1995 because the new police corps cannot yet face the high crime rate. Butrus-Ghali also said there are imbalances within the PNC that violate the letter and spirit of the peace agreements because military as well as former National Police officers were included in numbers that were higher than what had been agreed. As for land transfers, Ter Horst said important progress has been made and that the second phase has already begun, which will allow the authorities to hand out land title deeds by the end of the month. This phase also saw the incorporation to the program of another 7,200 beneficiaries for a total of nearly 25,000 persons. Likewise, Ter Horst praised the progress made in applying the Truth Commission recommendations, especially regarding judicial reform matters, even though he regretted, on behalf of Butrus-Ghali, that the duties of the Supreme Court have not been decentralized. As for public security, the ONUSAL chief coincided with Butrus- Ghali's report when he confirmed that irregularities have been detected in the hiring and transfer of personnel to the PNC.
