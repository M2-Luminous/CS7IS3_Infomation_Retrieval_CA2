The most popular television game shows, starting with the well-known "Field of Miracles," are precise copies of their U.S. or European originals. The serials "Trifles of Life" or "Goryachev and the Others" are pale imitations of their "soap operas." Last Saturday the prominent Ostankino Television Company's main news program joined the ranks of the "copycats." Now "Novosti-Plus" will appear once a week instead of "Novosti." Just like in Paris on their Channel Five. The presenter of the first broadcast did not explain the advantages of this innovation very intelligibly. It seems that common-or-garden news will be supplemented by analysis and summaries. A few hours before the program aired there was another airing -- this time for the amnestied inmates of Lefortovo. The program had a splendid opportunity to demonstrate its new principles. But nothing of the sort: Ostankino's journalists did not dare analyze the incident straightaway. They were afraid. You may retort: I thought the times had gone when television operated on instructions from on high. Now if it is dependent on anyone it is only on our tastes and requirements as viewers. But no. On the Wednesday that the Duma voted in favor of the amnesty -- it was Fatherland Defenders' Day -- the Russian Television [RTV] schedule included P. Todorovskiy's excellent film "Encore, Encore Again." At the scheduled time, when millions of viewers were settling down in front of their television sets, a toothy presenter appeared on the screen instead of the well-known movie and made a short speech. From which it emerged that RTV had received a host of telephone calls protesting the showing of the movie. The next day some newspapers revealed the secret identity of the anonymous defenders of public morality and Soviet officers' dignity who had telephoned RTV. They were the defense minister and the chairman of the War Veterans' Committee. I vividly remembered a similar thing happening three years ago involving former [Defense] Minister D. Yazov. When he was told that producer Peter Stein intended to stage the "Oresteia" by the ancient Greek dramatist Aeschylus in the Soviet Army Theater, he said that he would not allow a German to stage a Greek there. This rapidly flew around the capital's intelligentsia and the marshal lost all their respect even before the August putsch. However, there was at least some logic to that decision: The Army Theater is subsidized by the Defense Ministry. But what about in this case? The government allocates money for television, only half of what is required, moreover. So there was no reason but overbearing arrogance for the telephone calls to the television station. And the leaders of RTV who postponed the movie until another day demonstrated the basic principle of playing it safe. The events of the last week on television enable us to view the problem of television's destatization from a new angle. A few days ago there were rumors going round yet again that an edict on the flotation of "Ostankino" is supposedly on the president's desk awaiting signature. During the "Without Touching Up" program on Monday during which journalists met with V. Shumeyko, he was asked -- as recent minister of the press and someone who advocated the flotation of television before other leaders -- to speak about this. His answer was extremely indicative. The speaker of the upper chamber of parliament thinks that one of the two main television channels must remain a state channel. But the other must be proclaimed a national channel and a prominent industrial and financial association like AvtoVAZ or LogoVaz must be allowed to take part in its flotation. I noted that he named these firms with their close links with the government. The man behind the plan indirectly acknowledged this saying that "you have to go to the limit in this, you have to be able to walk a knife edge." And although that idea was not developed, I saw it as a desire on the part of the authorities to keep control over the two major television channels. In order to ensure that on Chemical Worker's Day or Teacher's Day the relevant minister can call the head of the television channel on the "hot line" and demand that a program he finds unsuitable be taken off. And the latter will take it off, he will have no other option, my dear....
