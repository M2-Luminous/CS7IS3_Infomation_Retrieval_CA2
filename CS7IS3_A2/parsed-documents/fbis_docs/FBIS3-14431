Vivekanand] [Text] Amman--For the first time since the imposition of international sanctions against Iraq, a cargo ship carrying freight for Jordan coming through the Red Sea will be inspected on shore instead of high seas in what could turn out to be a precedent- setting event, informed sources said Saturday. The sources said the Skyman, a 13,000-tonne German vessel carrying 3,000 tonnes of general cargo for Jordan, was expected to dock at al-'Aqabah on Monday and a "civilian officer" from the diplomatic mission of one of the members of the anti-Iraq coalition would inspect the cargo at the port. The Skyman was prevented from proceeding towards al-'Aqabah on March 18 by the U.S.-led enforcers of the international sanctions against Iraq. After four inspections, the inspectors ruled on Wednesday that the ship could not be allowed to proceed to al-'Aqabah since they did not have "accessibility" to inspect some of the cargo. The vessel proceeded to a Gulf port to unload cargo destined there before returning to the Red Sea for a new inspection with better cargo accessibility, the sources said. "It was half way to a Gulf port from the Red Sea when an agreement was reached after Jordanian Government intervention that the vessel could be inspected at al-'Aqabah port rather than the Tiran Straits," where the inspections usually take place, said one source. "Subsequently, it was recalled to al-'Aqabah. The vessel is expected at al-'Aqabah on Monday." The Skyman is carrying general cargo, including steel rods and animal feed, for the Jordanian market, according to the ship's agents. The inspection of the Skyman will be the first on-land inspection of cargo coming through al-'Aqabah after the imposition of the sanctions against Iraq in August 1990. It was not immediately clear whether the agreement for land-based inspection of the Skyman was a one-time procedure or the forerunner of a mechansim proposed by Jordan. Jordan, whose maritime operations are severely hampered as a result of what many officials here describe as over-zealous enforcement of the sanctions, proposed early this year that the inspections be carried out at al-'Aqabah port by an international agency. The proposal was viewed positively by American administration officials, according to sources. However, follow-up action on the proposal was at snail's pace, and Jordan was enraged by what appeared to be an escalation of the inspections and tightened guidelines imposed by the American-led warships patrolling the Red Sea. At least seven al-'Aqabah-bound vessels, including the Skyman, were denied permission to enter the Gulf of Aqaba by the enforcers of the sanctions since January this year compared to 20 during the whole 1993. The Jordanian Government repeatedly protested to the U.S. as well as the U.N. sanctions Committee against the "siege of Aqaba." (see separate story) The Lower House of Parliament urged the government last week to refuse to return to the U.S.-sponsored peace talks with Israel before the blockade of Aqaba is lifted and the lifting is formally announced at the U.N. Security Council. Diplomatic sources said the inspection of the Skyman could be a "dress rehearsal" for setting up a firm mechanism for land-based inspection at al-'Aqabah as proposed by Jordan. Lloyds Register of London, an independent international agency which has extensive experience in cargo inspections all over the world, is tipped to be the body which would take over the inspection at al-'Aqabah as and when the mechanism is in place. Lloyds officials have visited al-'Aqabah several times in the past three months to evaluate the facilities available for inspections and for talks with Jordanian shipping officials.
