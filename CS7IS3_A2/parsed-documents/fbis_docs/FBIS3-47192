While there has been some progress on the issue of improving the transparency of the bidding procedures, Japan rejected the U.S. proposal to include Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) in the agreement on government procurement, and the two sides have not been able to close the gap on the issue of objective criteria. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa will be meeting President Bill Clinton for the third time at the summit talks on 11 February. The Clinton administration seems to have refrained from making tough demands on Japan so far "for fear of hurting the Hosokawa administration." However, the present government has been in existence for six months, and the prime minister's close aides believe that "this time, they will be asking for results." The government is, thus, hoping that some progress can be made in the framework talks, which is the focal issue at present. According to one government source, however, "the point of compromise remains unclear," and more rough sailing is expected in the talks. As far as Hosokawa is concerned, he has no choice but to push for "political reform first," even though he also faces the need to adopt pump-priming measures and pass the budget, not to mention his visit to the U.S. In contrast to Clinton, who will be well- prepared, Hosokawa cannot claim to have fully prepared a well-thought-out strategy for the U.S. summit meeting. At the framework talks, government procurement, insurance, and automobiles and auto parts have been named as priority areas, and both sides expect to reach agreement before the summit meeting in February. After the negotiations on telecommunications, the working group on government procurement of medical equipment is holding meetings on 6 and 7 January, the working group on insurance on 10 and 11 January, and deputy ministerial level discussions on automobiles and auto parts are due to start on 11 January, leading up to the critical negotiating phase in February. According to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, objective criteria still represent a controversial issue because "they might lead to managed trade." The United States would like to introduce such things as future sales volume as numerical targets, while Japan is strongly opposed to the idea. Recently, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the United States has taken the more flexible position of "not seeking the setting of numerical targets." Japan, however, remains unconvinced. It believes "the United States is still asking for an increase in our purchase of U.S.-made automobiles and auto parts; this will still lead to numerical targets." Furthermore, in government procurement and insurance, the United States is seeking to measure the degree of openness of the Japanese market by comparing the share of foreign products and companies on it to those in the other G-7 nations. According to the Foreign Ministry, Japan maintains it will "not agree to any targets," on this issue either. However, since Japan has been unable to come up with any effective measures to reduce its current accounts surplus, some government officials believe "Japan will have to make some sort of concession." In the end, Hosokawa may have to make a political decision overriding the wishes of the bureaucrats.
