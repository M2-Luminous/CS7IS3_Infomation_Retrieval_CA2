In the opinion of the Chinese side, cooperation must be based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit and should be practiced in accordance with economic laws. Partners must heed each other's needs, abide by the principle of equivalent exchanges, maintain a balance of trade and regulate it, if necessary. The creation of joint ventures must be in the interests of the participants and aim to develop the economies of the participating countries. Second, the forms of cooperation must be diversified. At present, the exchange of goods forms the greater part of all economic exchanges. In Beijing's view, proper trade must be the main tendency in this sphere. To this end, it is necessary to improve the conditions for the performance of banking operations. The Chinese Government fully shares the Central Asian states' desire to develop relations with various areas in the PRC, supplementing their links with the neighboring Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. Third, economic cooperation must originate from the specific conditions and muster all the local resources. Full account must be taken of the market development prospects from the outset of the creation of joint ventures, which must provide a good economic return and produce competitive output. Fourth, as a new "Silk Road" is built, transport and communications must inevitably be improved. The prime minister of the PRC State Council pointed out, in this connection, the importance of the agreement concluded in this field during the current visit. In Li Peng's view, China and Kazakhstan must make every effort to ensure the vigorous functioning of this transport "bridge" between Europe and Asia. Fifth, the small amount of economic aid that we have been able to give the states of Central Asia, the premier stressed, is only a symbol for the PRC people's friendly feelings toward their neighbors. China is itself a developing country at the moment and is trying to improve its economy. Sixth, China intends to promote multilateral cooperation so that everyone may develop. The PRC is conducting an "open door" policy toward the developing, as well as the developed, countries, and particularly toward neighboring countries, Li Peng observed. As it develops its links with the states of Central Asia, China would like to see a growth in their trade, the strengthening of economic ties and friendly contacts with other countries. We are ready for honest and equal competition, the Chinese leader said. As he concluded his speech, Li Peng emphasized that China did not see Central Asia as a target for the expansion of its sphere of political and economic influence.
