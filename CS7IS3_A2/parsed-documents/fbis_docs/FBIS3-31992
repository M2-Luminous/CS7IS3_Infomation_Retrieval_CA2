Lopez is charged with murdering Salvadoran citizen Jose Crecencion Diaz Alvarado. The incident took place on 20 January when Diaz Alvarado's body was found inside a Jeep Cherokee with diplomatic license plate No. 753. Diaz Alvarado was one of Lopez' bodyguards. Prosecutor General Romeo Melara Granillo considers the attitude of the Americans contradictory: [Begin Melara recording] This is a total violation of our laws. What is also worrying is that the United States demands that we correctly apply justice while they violate our laws and make a mockery of them. They demand that we uphold the law but they violate them in cases such as this. This is what is worrying. Regardless of whether or not this person has diplomatic immunity he should have been processed through the Salvadoran legal system and it should not have been handled the way it was. [end recording] The legal investigations are being conducted by the Soyopango 2d Criminal Judge, who received a note from the U.S. Embassy saying that the criminal had departed the country bound for Panama. Nevertheless, immigration does not have his departure on record, PNC [National Civilian Police] Director Jose Maria Monterrey said. [Begin recording] [Monterrey] We are exerting pressure. That is our job and this is why we are here with the prosecutor. We are outraged over this incident. You must realize that every person who leaves through the airport must go through immigration. Even in the case of the president, he sends his passport and he enters and leaves and gets his passport stamped as well as all members of his entourage. This applies to everyone. [Cordoba] Have you been able to establish who is to blame at the airport? [Monterrey] We do not know yet whether he left through the airport or if he was taken out of the country some other way or whether he left using a passport under another name. The fact remains that several hours after the murder this major was already in Panama. You, as a member of the media, should recall the case of the Mexican who was involved in the cocaine robbery. Onusal [UN Observers for El Salvador] immediately ordered that he be placed in the hands of the justice system despite his diplomatic immunity. He has been under arrest for eight or nine months and is under the orders of a judge. [end recording] This case will show whether the U.S. Embassy in El Salvador practices what it preaches to the Salvadoran Government and not allow another murder case to go unpunished.
