FR940826-1-00035 FR940826-1-00006 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [TX&hyph;19&hyph;1&hyph;5736b; FRL&hyph;5029&hyph;5] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plan: Texas Emission Statement AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This action approves a revision to the Texas State Implementation Plan (SIP) to include revisions to the Texas Air Control Board, Part III, Chapter 101, General Rules , section 101.10, Emission Inventory Requirements . These revisions are for the purpose of implementing an emission statement program for stationary sources within the ozone nonattainment areas. The implementation plan was submitted by the State to satisfy the Federal requirements for an emission statement program as part of the SIP for Texas. In the final rules section of this Federal Register , the EPA is approving the State's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to this proposed rule, no further activity is contemplated in relation to this rule. If the EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn, and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. DATES: Comments on this proposed rule must be received in writing by September 26, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments on this action should be addressed to Mr. Thomas H. Diggs, Chief, Planning Section, at the EPA Regional Office listed below.
