At the outset there were several drafts. Over a period of three years a 30-volume work submitted by the Committee for Special Underwater Projects of the Government of Russia was selected on a competitive basis. More than 40 organizations took part in developing it. Specialists rejected the proposed scenarios for raising the Komsomolets. The reactor of the nuclear vessel is shut down and does not pose any danger. In addition, the gas which ensures a certain pressure level inside the reactor is subject to considerable outside pressure at a depth of 1,700 meters. If the Komsomolets is raised, the existing equilibrium will be disturbed. The danger is real that gas will force out a kind of "radioactive broth" which will cause pollution of the sea. This was not the least important reason why the project to seal two torpedoes with warheads which pose the greatest danger was preferred. A special compound made of crab shells will be pumped into the unsealed torpedo tubes. Tengiz Borisov, one of the authors of the draft and the chairman of the Committee for Underwater Projects, is convinced that the use of such unique technology will guarantee the preservation of the submarine for 30 to 50 years. The interdepartmental commission which is a part of the Security Council of Russia has confirmed the proposed draft. Underwater sealing work will begin in the summer of next year. Otherwise, the specialists expect leaching of the products of plutonium corrosion, a massive discharge of radioactive elements, and pollution of the natural environment for 600-700 years by the end of 1994. Only domestic organizations are to be used for work. The St. Petersburg TsKB [Central Design Bureau] Rubin, the St. Petersburg Technology Institute, and a number of defense enterprises act as leading developers. In the words of Tengiz Borisov, the main task of the committee is to conduct continuous ecological monitoring of Russian coastal waters. In the summer, the area of Novaya Zemlya where nuclear waste was actively dumped in the 1960's and 1970's was surveyed for the first time. The committee is also working vigorously on the use of the preservation technology to neutralize a tremendous amount of chemical ordnance in the Baltic Sea which was dumped by allied troops after World War II. As the chairman says, the Committee for Underwater Projects which was created a year ago is called upon to play the role of a "groundskeeper" of the depths of the sea. Some 17,500 containers with radioactive waste were dumped in the northern seas of Russia, 6,000 containers in the Far East. Eight nuclear reactors and two nuclear submarines rest in the Gulf of Biscay and near Cuban shores. The committee has offered a unique, just developed technology for the purification of liquid nuclear waste for joint use with the Japanese and South Koreans. If this technology is implemented, it will be possible to ultimately abandon the dumping of poisonous waste into the water as early as the coming year.
