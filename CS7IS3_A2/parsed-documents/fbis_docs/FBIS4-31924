Representatives of 42 organizations that are members of the confederation of Polish Employers [KPP] and representatives of five organizations that are not members of the KPP told Prime Minister Pawlak yesterday that the "Strategy for Poland" is a document for which they have been waiting for a long time, that, in their view, the goals outlined in the program are correct, and that they themselves are interested in their implementation. On Equal Footing During a discussion on the main items of the "Strategy," the employers had particularly high praise for the government's readiness to form partnershiplike labor relations and negotiation-based mechanisms for salary regulation. The employers want the state to play the role of an umpire and mediator in conflicts between employers and employees. As KPP Chairman Andrzej Wilk stated, the implementation of the task would make for a rapprochement among those who are most interested in seeing conflicts resolved--that is to say, trade unions on the one hand and employers on the other. According to Ryszard Bielawski of the Gdansk Employer Association, only an economy "based on consultations" can assure social peace. Employers will gladly participate in negotiations, provided the government approaches them on a partnership basis. The prime minister said that employer participation in the Trilateral Commission is very significant for putting employer-employee relations in order and that the government will be "seriously taking employers' views into account." Let Us Commercialize Many of the employers present stressed the importance of commercialization of state-owned enterprises. "It is a good thing," they said, "that the issue was mentioned as a `strategic problem' in Deputy Prime Minister Kolodko's program." Without its successful implementation, it will not be possible to carry out the "Strategy." Commercialization implies making the enterprises oriented toward market criteria, and "only then will employers be stimulated in an appropriate manner." State-owned enterprises currently produce almost half of the GNP, while 95 percent of all conflicts occur in them. According to Andrzej Tyszkiewicz, manager of the Zeran automobile plant and chief of the Federation of Employers of Domestic Automobile Producers, employers representing the current and former state ownership are more sensitive to social policies than private employers. In Tyszkiewicz's view, employers of the enterprise to be commercialized will be the leading executors of the appropriate labor relations in Poland (meaning relations modeled after EU [European Union] countries). Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak responded by saying that he can see no obstacles against a speedy commercialization of enterprises, even if their current managements were to be retained. "They will simply start thinking along different lines once they find themselves under market conditions, while you are not going to have good cadres emerge from lame structures," the prime minister said. He is waiting for a unanimous position on this issue by the managing cadres.
