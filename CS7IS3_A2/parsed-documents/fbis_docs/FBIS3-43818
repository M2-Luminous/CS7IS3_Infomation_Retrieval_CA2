[Begin recording] [De Klerk] The government has a specific role to play with regard to law and order and the prevention of violence. We've discussed our plans in that regard with Mr. Mandela. We will be discussing those plans also with the Transitional Executive Council. I will also be discussing them with Chief Minister Buthelezi because of the importance of the Inkatha Freedom Party in the conflict situation. We will be discussing it with the peace structures.
