FR940526-2-00055 FR940526-2-00035 C. Depository At the present time, as a program control element, Ginnie Mae has designated that REMIC securities be registered at the same depository as is currently the depository for Ginnie Mae MBS, Participants Trust Company (``PTC''). D. Ginnie Mae Guaranty Fees The Ginnie Mae guaranty fee is initially set at 20 basis points. This fee may be adjusted upward or downward at such times and in such manner as Ginnie Mae determines appropriate. E. Payment Date REMIC securities holders will be paid on the 16th day of each month, or if the 16th is not a business day, on the first business day following the 16th. F. Other Program Fees During the initial stage, Ginnie Mae will have no liability for payment of any fees or expenses (other than those of Ginnie Mae's Legal Advisor; see below) in connection with Ginnie Mae REMIC transactions, such as those of trustees, trust counsel and accounting firms, including payment of Ginnie Mae's Financial Advisor. These fees and costs will be paid out of the sales proceeds, and closing will be contingent upon their payment, except for payments to the trustees, which will be paid by the trust from the trust cash flow. III. Authority Ginnie Mae's authority to guarantee REMIC instruments is contained in section section 306(g)(1) of the National Housing Act (``NHA'') (12 U.S.C. 1721(g)(1)), which authorizes Ginnie Mae to guarantee ``securities *␣*␣* based on or backed by a trust or pool composed of mortgages *␣*␣* .'' The REMIC securities will be based on or backed by mortgages since Ginnie Mae MBS will serve as the collateral. The Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac REMIC programs are authorized by substantially similar statutory provisions. Further, Ginnie Mae's authority to operate a REMIC program has recently been confirmed in section 3004 of the OBRA which amended section 306(g)(3) of the NHA (12 U.S.C. 1721(g)(3)) to provide Ginnie Mae with greater flexibility for the REMIC program regarding fee structure, contracting, industry consultation and program implementation. The General Counsel for the Department of Housing and Urban Development will issue a legal opinion that, pursuant to section 306(g) of the National Housing Act, Ginnie Mae has the statutory authority to guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest on the REMIC securities in accordance with the terms and conditions of the trust agreement, and that this guaranty is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. In appropriations legislation, Congress annually sets Ginnie Mae's commitment authority to guarantee MBS. The amount of MBS commitment authority authorized by Congress is set forth in section 306(g)(2) of the NHA (12 U.S.C. 1721(g)(2)). Since the REMIC securities will be backed by Ginnie Mae MBS, Ginnie Mae has already guaranteed the collateral for the REMIC. Accordingly, it has been determined that the section 306(g)(2) limitations are not affected by, and do not limit the issuance of, Ginnie Mae's guarantees of REMIC securities. This determination was supported by the House of Representatives Committee on Appropriations. (See H.R. Rep. No. 103&hyph;150, 103D Cong., 1st Sess. at 34.) IV. Initial Stage Ginnie Mae is beginning its REMIC program with an ``initial stage,'' which is expected to have a duration of several months, until standard policies, procedures and documents are developed and the full participation stage can be commenced. During the initial stage, Ginnie Mae will guarantee REMICs that are issued by a small number of participants, consisting of sponsors, co-sponsors, trustees, trust counsel and accounting firms, selected by Ginnie Mae through the use of Competitive Application Proposals (``CAPs''). In addition, Ginnie Mae has obtained the services of a Legal Advisor and a Financial Advisor through competitive proposals to provide Ginnie Mae with assistance in implementing the REMIC program. In the initial stage, Ginnie Mae will develop documents that will serve as the basis for all subsequent REMICs, as well as guidelines and procedures. During the initial stage, Ginnie Mae will establish an order of rotation for each of the five participant functions. Teams, consisting of a sponsor, co-sponsor, trustee, trust counsel and accounting firm, will be created based on the rotation. Ginnie Mae anticipates that several team rotations will be required before the full participation stage can commence. V. Full Participation Stage Notice Following the initial stage, the Ginnie Mae guaranteed REMIC program will be opened to all approved sponsors. Ginnie Mae will issue a REMIC Guide, which will contain Ginnie Mae's requirements for participation in the Ginnie Mae REMIC program as well as Ginnie Mae's standard documents. Ginnie Mae will publish another notice, which will contain specific procedures for initiating Ginnie Mae guaranteed REMIC transactions in the full participation stage. VI. Terms and Conditions for Participants As a condition of participation in the program, each participant must agree to the conditions set out below.
