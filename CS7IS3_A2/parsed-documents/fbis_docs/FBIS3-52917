In a statement released today, it emphasized the necessity to solve all internal conflicts in Afghanistan according to the principles of Islamic law, so that everyone will then be devoted to the construction of the country that was destroyed by war, and in order that the Afghan Muslim people would reap the fruits of jihad for God's cause and would set [the Afghan people] an example for others in sacrifice, selflessness, and the rise above personal disputes. The statement saw that what was happening between the brothers in Afghanistan will leave the door wide open for the colonialist powers and the remnants of infidelity who are lying in wait for this Muslim country. The statement recalled the expression of concern of the Constituent Council of the League, at its recently held session, over the continued armed conflicts in Afghanistan and its appeal to the warring parties to abide by the principles of Islam, to cast away personal disputes, to rise above private interest, to work toward ensuring the security, stability, and safety of the Muslim people of Afghanistan, and to seek the arbitration of neutral Muslim ulema to solve the conflict and remove its causes.
