This battery is said to generate electromotive force twice as strong as that generated by existing temperature-difference batteries. The generation of greater electromotive force is attributed to the greater difference in the electrolytic reactions that is produced by using a vitreous carbon material that can convert temperature-difference energy into electric energy, instead of platinum for the battery electrodes. This new battery is expected to draw the attention of environmental fields, because it can generate electric energy from warm industrial-waste water. The temperature-difference battery generates electricity by taking advantage of the difference in the degrees of ionization of an electrolyte at two temperatures. Previous temperature-difference batteries used platinum electrodes that had a low capacity for converting the temperature difference into electric energy. Also, some batteries used vitreous carbon made from either a phenolic resin or cellulose for the electrodes, which needed extra thickness to compensate for the lack of strength. With thicker electrodes, the battery's internal resistance increased to consume a part of the electromotive force. For the electrodes, Assistant Professor Hashimoto's group used the vitreous carbon material it developed in-house. The material is approximately 1.5 times stronger than the vitreous carbon material made from cellulose. Moreover, the group added boron onto the surface of the new vitreous carbon to obtain higher voltage. Actually, the new, 50-micron-thick, vitreous carbon film was produced by adding boron to an organic compound called polycarboxy-diimide and shaping the mixture into film form before baking at 600�C. The electrode is prepared by vapor-depositing copper on one side of this film. The new battery generated electromotive force of approximately 3 millivolts per use, which was twice that of the battery with platinum electrodes. The current from this battery was 25 mA/m[.sup]2[/] at a temperature difference of 20�C. In experiments, the group used an electrolyte that was comparatively poor in electric conductivity in order to confirm the performance of the electrode. However, the group believes that industrial applications of this battery are feasible if larger electrodes and a more conductive electrolyte are used.
