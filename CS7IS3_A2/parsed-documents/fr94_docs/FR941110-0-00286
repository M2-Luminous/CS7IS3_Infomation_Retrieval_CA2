FR941110-0-00286 FR941110-0-00018 In 1838, Asa Gray described Hibiscus brackenridgei (ma`o hau hele) from a specimen collected on West Maui (Roe 1961). Then, in 1930, Edward Leonard Caum published two varieties, molokaiana and kauaiana, based upon type specimens from the islands of Molokai and Kauai (Caum 1930). An additional variety, var. mokuleiana, was named by Sister Margaret James Roe in 1961. In 1990, David Bates recognized two subspecific taxa: ssp. mokuleianus and ssp. brackenridgei (including var. molokaiana ). He placed Hibiscus brackenridgei var. kauaiana in synonymy with a non-Hawaiian species of Hibiscus, H. calyphyllus. Hibiscus brackenridgei, a member of the mallow family (Malvaceae), is a sprawling to erect shrub or small tree up to 5 m (16 ft) tall. Most plant parts (young branches, leaves, and some flower parts) vary in the degree of hairiness. The leaves, about 5 to 15 cm (2 to 6 in) long and equally wide, have three to seven lobes but are generally heart-shaped in outline. Beneath each leaf stalk is a pair of very thin stipules (leaf-like appendages), 5 to 15 mm (0.2 to 0.6 in) long, that fall off early in development, leaving an elliptic scar. Flowers are borne singly or in small clusters. The petals, between 3.5 and 8 cm (1.4 and 3.1 in) long, are yellow, usually with a maroon spot in the center of the flower. Each triangular calyx lobe is reddish to yellow, and usually has a raised, elongated gland on the midrib. Seven to 10 bracts are attached below the calyx. The staminal column, which has anthers attached to the upper three-fourths or nearly to the base, extends beyond the petals. The fruits are somewhat round or oval capsules 1.1 to 2 cm (0.4 to 0.8 in) long that have a beak-like appendage at one end. This species differs from other members of the genus in having the following combination of characteristics: yellow petals, a calyx comprised of triangular lobes with raised veins and a single midrib often bearing a prominent elongated gland, 7 to 10 bracts attached below the calyx, and thin stipules 5 to 15 mm (0.2 to 0.6 in) long that fall off, leaving an elliptic scar (Bates 1990). Hibiscus brackenridgei is currently known from Oahu, Lanai, Maui, and Hawaii; it may possibly occur on Kauai. Twelve populations are known to exist, containing approximately 60 individuals. The two recognized subspecies are discussed separately below. Hibiscus brackenridgei ssp. brackenridgei was known historically from Laau Point on Molokai (HHP 1992e7), from scattered locations on Lanai, and from Pohakea Gulch south to near McGregor Point on West Maui (HHP 1992e4, 1992e5, 1992e10 to 1992e13, 1992e15). Hibiscus brackenridgei was also collected from an unspecified site on Kahoolawe (HHP 1992e17). However, the specimen is unavailable, and the subspecies was not determined (Bates 1990). Currently, Hibiscus brackenridgei ssp. brackenridgei consists of about 7 populations containing probably fewer than 60 individuals on State and private land on the islands of Lanai, Maui, and Hawaii (HHP 1992e1 to 1992e3, 1992e6, 1992e9, 1992e14, 1992e16; HPCC 1990c, 1991e; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). On Lanai, only five or six plants remain near Keomuku Road at 275 m (900 ft) elevation on privately owned land (HHP 1992e14, HPCC 1991e). On West Maui, Hibiscus brackenridgei ssp. brackenridgei is known from two populations occurring at Kaunohua Gulch and the West Maui NAR (HHP 1992e2, 1992e3; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). The Kaunohua Gulch population, numbering approximately eight individuals, is found within a fenced area of 5 to 10 sq m (55 to 110 sq ft) on privately owned land (HHP 1992e3). The West Maui NAR population, consisting of 14 individuals, is located in the Lihau section at about 400 m (1,300 ft) elevation in lowland dry forest on State-owned land (HHP 1992e2; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). On East Maui, the known populations, which extend over a 6.25 sq km (2.4 sq mi) area, number no more than 20 individuals (HHP 1992e1, 1992e8; HPCC 1990c). These populations are near Puu o Kali between 249 and 440 m (800 and 1,450 ft) in elevation on State-owned land (HHP 1992e1, 1992e8). On the island of Hawaii, Hibiscus brackenridgei ssp. brackenridgei is known from two populations on State and private land: at Puu Anahulu Homesteads and Puu Huluhulu, approximately 3.5 km (2 mi) apart. These two populations contain no more than five individuals (HHP 1992e6, 1992e16; P. Q. Tomich, in litt., 1991; K. Wallis, in litt., 1993).
