"But I must say that some of Benda's statements disquiet me," Pilip said, adding that these statements had harmed the KDS. "I agree that the person of General Pinochet is far more complicated than is pictured in some critical media reports protesting against his visit to the Czech Republic," Pilip said. He added, however, that presently it was necessary to "direct attention towards important questions connected with the transformation of the economy, health care and the educational system and not to provoke speculation as to whether it is appropriate to use military methods for solving the situation in the country or not." Information that Benda might be removed from his post at a KDS Executive Committee meeting on Saturday [11 June] was published today by the left-leaning daily RUDE PRAVO. On June 5 Benda told NOVA Television that if he were in the same situation as General Augusto Pinochet he would probably act in the same way. He added he did not consider Pinochet a criminal but a brave man who, through tough means but acting against an enemy just as tough, saved his country at the last moment from the horrors of communism or a long-lasting civil war.
