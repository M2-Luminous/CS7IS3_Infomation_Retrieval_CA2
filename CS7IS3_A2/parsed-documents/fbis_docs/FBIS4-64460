At the first German-Netherlands ambassadors' conference in Mannheim on Tuesday [3 May], the two officials came out in favor of conducting a frank and critical dialogue with the Islamic states and promoting mutual understanding by getting to know one another better. The German and Netherlands ambassadors to Algeria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Turkey participated in the conference. The exchange of opinions focused on questions of stability in the southern Mediterranean region and in the Middle East. Kooijmans said that Islam was in many cases equated with extremism and fundamentalism. While extremism was dangerous, it was not immediately connected with Islam. There were fanatics in other religions too, Kooijmans stated, adding that the Europeans should not be guided by fear of the Islamic world.
