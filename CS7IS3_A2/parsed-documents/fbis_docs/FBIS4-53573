"Japan's economic growth appears to have stopped weakening," the BOJ said in its monthly economic review, using almost the same words as a month ago. "However, there are no clear indications of imminent recovery." Personal consumption, a main engine of growth, "is picking up gradually," while housing and public-sector investment are strong, but corporate capital spending is still falling, the report says. Job growth remains slow, the central bank said, but it noted a halt to the falling ratio of job offers to seekers. Money supply growth remains low due to weak lending by banks, the report asserts, saying rises in March and April to the top of the BOJ's forecast range resulted from "portfolio shifts between money and other financial assets" not counted in the money supply. On inflation, it says domestic wholesale prices are falling on weak demand and cheaper imports, service prices are stable and consumer price increases remain low. Industrial production "has virtually stopped decreasing," the central bank said, although it noted that the trade ministry expects declines in April and May in the wake of stepped-up spending before the end of the fiscal year. Capital spending continues to fall among manufacturers -- except for such bright spots as semiconductors, liquid crystal displays and cellular telephones -- and is stagnant among nonmanufacturers, the report says. It notes recent rises in Japan's trade surplus but says the current-account surplus "has peaked" due to "larger deficits in invisible and transfer accounts."
