Specialists confirmed that, indeed, the spaceship with Vasiliy Tsibliev and Aleksandr Serebrov aboard touched the Mir station. However, it is too early to speak about causes and consequences of the incident. Some experts believe that the programme of the 15th main expedition (Viktor Afanasyev, Yuriy Usachev and Valeriy Polyakov) which relieved Tsibliev and Serebrov at the Mir station, will be somewhat changed. Their plan of work did not provide for space walks. However, it will be necessary to do them now. Nevertheless, according to the cosmonauts who ended their mission on Friday, the Mir station is in good condition. Although the station launched in 1986 was to end its service life five years later, it will function normally till 1997 according to experts' estimates. Tsibliev stressed that for this purpose it is necessary to take permanently preventive measures. The cosmonauts safely returned to the earth and, judging by their statements, feel well. Some inconvenience is only caused by muscles which did not function under zero-gravity conditions, and which are forced "to work" now. Tsibliev and Serebrov are satisfied with the fully completed programme of the expedition. As for explorations and experiments conducted on a commercial basis, they, according to Serebrov, "are evidently profitable". True, cosmonauts do not participate in signing such contracts, he admitted.
