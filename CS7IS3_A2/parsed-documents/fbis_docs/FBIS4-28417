FBIS4-28417 "dreas112_c_94015" FBIS-EAS-94-112 Daily Report 10 Jun 1994 North Korea Japan's `Schemes' To Become Nuclear Power Noted Japan's `Schemes' To Become Nuclear Power Noted SK1006050394 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0455 GMT 10 Jun 94 SK1006050394 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Undisguised Nuclear Ambition" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, June 10 (KCNA) -- The Japanese Government recently decided to submit to the International Court of Justice a statement saying that "the use of nuclear weapons is not necessarily a violation of international law", according to a report from Tokyo. This decision of the Japanese Government is a crude breach of the international law that prohibits the use of nuclear weapons. It is the biggest challenge to world peace and security and an unpardonable archcriminal act of bringing a nuclear holocaust to the globe. This is an open manifestation of the Japanese reactionaries' criminal schemes to turn Japan into a nuclear power and thereby establish domination over Asia. Now, the plausible mask of "three non-nuclear principles" much advertised by Japan hitherto has been thrown off, and it has become clear that its clamor about the DPRK's "suspected nuclear arms development" was to find an excuse for justifying its moves to become a nuclear power. From the open talk of the Japanese Government that "the use of nuclear weapons is not necessarily a violation of international law", one can see clearly once again that the recently disclosed Japan's large plutonium concealment case was by no means accidental. It is only too natural that the unbiased public opinion is now lifting up voices opposing and denouncing Japan's moves to become a nuclear power. Japan must look squarely at the trend of the times and promptly give up the design for its conversion into a nuclear power, a move that would spell catastrophic consequences upon it.
