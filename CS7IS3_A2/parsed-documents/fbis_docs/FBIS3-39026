Matter Closed in the Republican Party"] [Text] The Republican Party [PR], which held a National Council meeting at the Mutualite yesterday, demanded the formation of a single majority list for the coming European elections. A list headed by Jean-Francois Deniau. This is the story of a National Council meeting which came too late. Or too soon. Too late, because the PR leaders -- Gerard Longuet and Philippe Vasseur -- had set this cumbersome mechanism in motion to prevent the formation of an autonomous UDF [Union for French Democracy] list headed by Giscard d'Estaing at the UDF National Council meeting scheduled for 19 February. However, since then, the former president of the republic has given up this idea and his remaining supporters in the UDF seem to accept the principle of a single majority list in the forthcoming European elections. But this PR National Council meeting also came too soon: The party cadres meeting in Paris were thinking more of the cantonal elections next March; Giscard and Chirac will not meet until tomorrow; and it is not yet known whether Edouard Balladur will still be strong enough in two months' time to impose a single list on the RPR [Rally for the Republic]; and if either will still want it. This inopportune timetable produced a National Council meeting without an issue, without a debate, and without interest. For instance, the PR had launched a wide-ranging consultation of its members on the European program which was intended to be "exemplary," but which, despite thousands of amendments sent in for weeks, ended in a unanimous show of hands. Similarly, the deliberately "blue, white, and red" final text tries to answer the opposing objectives of "the new frontier" to the East, so dear to Philippe Seguin, and that of the single currency shared by four or five countries proposed by Maastricht's supporters, and urges a stronger Community protection but at the same time a move to put the Brussels Commission in its place. Finally, the question of the single list raised virtually no problem. Of course, Charles Million once again -- without saying it explicitly -- argued enthusiastically for the formation of two RPR and UDF lists: "The European debate concerns us, because it cannot be stifled by tactics or by resignation or reduced to mutual concessions on a minimum program.... Europe is worth a debate. Let us not lock ourselves into a petty political game." Tactical Choices But the debate on the debate did not take place. Giscard's supporters know that the fate of the two lists is in the hands of the RPR alone and its tactical choices in its struggle against Balladur. In these conditions, the ministers had no difficulty in imposing a single list, with the simplistic tone so dear to the advertisements advocating the privatization of Elf: "Who can doubt that we would defend our interests better if we are separated, when we have a single government, and a single majority?" Francois Leotard seems to be asking. "France's voice must be heard strongly in the Strasbourg Assembly," Gerard Longuet said without even a hint of doubt. "The French public and especially the European public must be presented with a union list expressing the solidarity and strength of our majority." Opinion Poll Wars The matter was therefore settled. In advance. The party cadres, who will need the RPR's votes in next March's canton elections, had to heed this message of unity. Having triumphed without fighting on the essential issue, the PR leadership could make some concessions to the Giscard clan. First, the pledge by all members on the list to take their seats in Strasbourg. That rules out [Foreign Minister] Alain Juppe as head of the list. And at the same time it settles the quarrels on precedence within the RPR with Philippe Seguin. Furthermore, the assurance that all the future French elected representatives will join the same group -- the PPE [European People's Party] -- to help form the "liberal Europe" so dear to Alain Madelin. That only left the question of who would head the list. It is know that the PR is pushing Jean-Francois Deniau, and the CDS [Social Democratic Center] Dominique Baudis. For several days, the opinion poll war has been raging, each having its own, naturally favorable to its candidate. But the PR, which proudly proclaims that it is the "second party in France," after the RPR, has an undoubted numerical superiority, in members and deputies, over the centrist party. And it intends to use it. That is why the PR made do yesterday, through Gerard Longuet, with referring the choice of candidate to the "confederation's competent bodies." Gerard Longuet does not want to violate the UDF, he simply wants to dominate it, for instance to be president of it in 1995 when Giscard no longer is. Meanwhile, he is showing his strength. He is asking the UDF to choose Deniau at a political office meeting or at its next National Council meeting on 19 February. Or later. It does not really matter when, the important thing is to be as strong as possible with a view to the big bargaining session which will preceed or follow the 1995 presidential election.
