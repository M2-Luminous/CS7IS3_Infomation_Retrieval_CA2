Venizelos said that from an initial evaluation of the report, one can conclude that it is an objective document. The spokesman stressed that the blame is clearly put on the Denktas pseudostate and Ankara. In a diplomatic way, Venizelos said, we should admit that the Turkish Cypriot and Turkish sides are blamed for a lack of political will. The Greek Government, Venizelos concluded, cooperates with the Cypriot leadership and will carefully examine the alternative approaches to the problem that UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali has proposed.
