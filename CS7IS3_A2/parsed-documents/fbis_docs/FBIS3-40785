In its Volume I report tabled in Parliament today, the committee said if RBI had not turned "a blind eye to the massive irregularities in the banking transactions between the period of July 1991 to April 1992, when thousands of crores of bank funds were diverted to the stock market, it would not have been possible for some brokers to play havoc with the system." It said Mr S. Venkitaramanan as the governor of RBI during this crucial period must be held no less responsible. Referring to the finance ministry's role in the scam, the committee said it failed to anticipate the problem, respond to it purposefully when it first surfaced, manage adequately thereafter the consequences of it, apply the needed correctives with promptness and punish the guilty in time and resolutely. On the role of top RBI officials in the scam, the committee said the suggestion to treat the foreign banks differently, the delay in the issue of the circular of July, 1991, failure to incorporate all the deficiencies in this circular and the absence of any follow-up action subsequently, the delay in the issue of the bill discounting circular for 22 months, recommendation to appoint people in top positions which proved to be a liability and display of unusual interest in the account of Harshad Mehta were all acts of "omission and commission" on the part of the former governor of RBI, Mr S. Venkitaramanan, which could not be "overlooked in any of their ramifications." Similarly, the large number of SGL (security general ledger) bouncings, the deficiencies in the functioning of the public debt office (PDO) and the goings-on in both State Bank of India [SBI] and the National Housing Bank [NHB] of which Mr R. Janakiraman was a director, clearly indicates "there was dereliction in performing his duties" as deputy governor, the report observed. The committee noted that Mr Amitava Ghosh, who was the deputy governor in charge of department of banking operations and development [DBOD] for ten years, must be held primarily responsible for the continuing irregularities in the banking sector, ignoring the various inspection reports prepared by the terms of RBI inspectors over the years like the Augustine Kurias report, the Ranganathan report and for being `casual' in his approach to his duties. Mr N.D. Parameshwaran, the chief officer of DBOD should also be held responsible for the lapses of the department. The JPC said, he need not have played any role concerning the account of Harshad Mehta. It also urged review of the penal clauses in the BR (bankers' receipt) Act and other relevant Acts to enable RBI to impose graded penalties and other types of punishments commensurate with the seriousness of the abuse. Referring to the functioning of public sector banks and appointments of top posts in these banks, the committee asked the finance ministry to set up a board on the lines of the public enterprises selection board for appointment of chief executives and executive directors of nationalised banks. The committee noted as many as ten top former executives of the 20 nationalised banks had, during the past few years, been found involved in serious irregularities. This was "a telling commentary on the process of selection and appointments by the government," it said. Irregularities committed by top management not only adversely hit the functioning of their respective banks but also led to the malaise spreading over the entire banking system, JPC said. It said this hoax of flotation of funds by PSUs [public sector undertakings] was perpetrated and the funds so released became a principal source of finance for all varieties of speculative and illegal transactions in the securities market, as well as the stock market. The placement of PSU funds became the single great contributor to the scam, it said. "What the committee finds as condemnable is that all this was public money and all who were playing with it were public servants," it observed caustically. The committee favoured replacing the government nominee directors from the boards of public sector banks, who are at present from the civil services. It strongly felt, in view of their conduct and activities in the scam, the working of foreign banks had to be strictly supervised as in a way, they were the initiators of the scam as well as the major players. In the light of these mistakes, the committee felt, the responsibility and accountability of the finance minister to Parliament could not be `denied'. Though the finance minister tried to disown direct responsibility for administrative failures or management deficiencies in the case of individual banks and other financial bodies, the committee said such a distinction could not be sustained by the constitutional jurisprudence under which the parliamentary system worked. In the light of developments that had supervened, the committee said the relevance of continuing in its present form the banking division and the stock division by the finance ministry needed to be examined. The committee came down heavily on what it termed the "culture of non-accountability in all sections of government and the banks." Describing this culture as "the most unfortunate aspect" of the scam, the report said. "The scam was a result of failure to check irregularities in the banking system and also liberalisation without adequate safeguards." "While the mood of the government is upbeat on liberalisation, their orientation towards strict enforcement has yet to manifest itself. Deorientation without effective checks and balances would in the view of the committee be an unmitigated disaster," it said.
