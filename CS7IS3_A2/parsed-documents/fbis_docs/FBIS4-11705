['Awn] I have not said that I am against the visit. I just expressed some political reservations about the visit because I consider Lebanon to be an occupied territory. Therefore, the sight of the pope shaking hands with the current regime's officials would greatly shock the Lebanese at the national level. [passage omitted] [Nasrallah] What is your political peace plan for Lebanon? ['Awn] My plan is well known. There should first be a dialogue between me and those who are against me. I was the one who started the march. I refuse to have my country marginalized in the peace negotiations. Lebanon should be present as a major party at the negotiating table. There should be tripartite negotiations attended by Syria, Lebanon, and Israel. I am willing to sign an agreement with any Lebanese Muslim to work together for the freedom and salvation of Lebanon. I am confident that I can bring the Christians to the dialogue table, and also the Muslims. I believe that I truly represent the Muslims just as I truly and freely represent the Christians. That is my offer. I hope that nobody would claim to represent the Christians and Muslims more than I do. I have not rejected anyone. All I call for is equal rights for all the Lebanese in a dear, free, and independent Lebanon. [Nasrallah] Tell us about the agreement reached between you and the government under which you signed a document indicating that you would not indulge in political acitivity in France. ['Awn] Let whoever holds such a document produce it. [Nasrallah] The government says that it has something to that effect. ['Awn] I have nothing at all to do with the Lebanese Government. I neither negotiated with the Lebanese Government nor promised it anything directly, indirectly, or through mediators. I rejected that government and still do. So how could I negotiate with a government I do not recognize? I had been kidnapped. I was a hostage inside the French Embassy. Even if their claim that I did sign something were true, it would be invalid under the law because I was not completely free to accept or sign anything. The situation is now as follows: I do nothing that contravenes French law, because I am a guest in France. I will do anything permissible under French law, regardless of whether or not I signed anything to the contrary. [Nasrallah] I have heard you talk about funds seized by the Lebanese Government. What are these funds? ['Awn] There are funds in my name that did not come from the government or from donations. These were funds in the bank under my name and the names of my wife and daughters. The government froze these funds unfairly. Furthermore, I was an army commander. I served Lebanon for 35 years. The government has ignored my material rights arbitrarily through a law that violated all laws. Also, do not forget that I was prime minister and I have material rights and am entitled to compensation as army commander, and am also entitled to aides and a monthly salary and compensations. The government has rejected all that. [passage omitted] [Nasrallah] Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri says that nobody has claimed Gen. 'Awn's rights from him and that if that happened he would look into it. ['Awn] At any rate, my problem is not with them. I have not recognized them and I still do not recognize them. Even if they put me in the dock on any particular charge, I would not defend myself before them. [passage omitted] [Nasrallah] Permit me to go to the heart of the matter. You tend to accuse Syria of everything. Is that right? ['Awn] Let me be frank. Am I an enemy of the Syrian regime? Have I betrayed it to Israel? Have I plotted against it? Have I taken political regional or international stands against its position or in a way detrimental to it? I only defended Lebanon. I never opposed special relations between Syria and Lebanon. I have said and I continue to say that I extend my hand to the sincere hands in Syria so that we can be two fraternal countries in the full sense of the word, with each one free, independent, and its own master.
