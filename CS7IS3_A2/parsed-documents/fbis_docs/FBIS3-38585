He was confronted by angry people, who have either suffered themselves or their families have suffered at the hands of the IRA. [passage omitted] At the news conference, the Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, praised the U.S. President Bill Clinton for allowing him a visa to attend a conference on the north. But first he was asked for his reaction to the news that Sir Patrick Mayhew has a new plan for a devolved government. [Begin recording] [Adams] I have to get more information, but we all know that that doesn't provide a solution; in fact, as part of one of the main elements in the talks I had with Mr. Hume, we agreed that an internal settlement was not a solution. [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Adams, may I ask you, you went to America looking, seeking help and support from the Americans, from President Clinton. It really hasn't worked. He actually did say, you know, you should go back and support the Downing Street declaration. He's also knocked completely on the head the idea of a peace envoy. What is your view of that? [Adams] Well, first of all, Charlie, I went to the United States because I was invited to attend a conference, which would give me and others the opportunity to put across our views. It was a rather unique opportunity. I think it worked very well. It's a pity that the British Government wasn't there to put its views. It's a pity that the two main Unionist parties didn't put their views also. So I think all of that worked very well. I didn't expect as the result of a 48-hour visit to New York that the Clinton administration would change policy absolutely. I think they did a very useful and positive thing when they [words indistinct] and I have commended President Clinton for that. [Reporter] Mr. Adams, you said you'd give your response soon to the Downing Street declaration. How soon are we talking about, can you give any sort of outline time [word indistinct] for that response? [Adams] Well, I have never set deadlines on this peace process. And I think if you, if you watch what has been happening for these last few months, you'll see the wisdom in not setting a deadline. We're trying to unravel decades of conflict, in fact centuries of conflict. We're dealing with some very crucial issues. The core issues are being addressed, but we need to move it all forward, and I think we have to be patient, in the way that (?we're doing it). [Reporter] Yesterday the Taioseach Albert Reynolds said the time was coming for you to give the clarification, that he had given an abundance of clarification. [Adams] Well, I mean, a letter arrived in my absence, which I will have the opportunity to consider within the next few days. Well, I mean, I don't want to respond. I haven't been au fait with the Irish and British press comment of anyone. I do think that Mr. Reynolds has been taking a very common sense attitude to most (?of these). I only wish the British would follow his example. [Reporter] But Mr. Adams, if he's been taking a common sense approach to the issue, why don't you reciprocate, and at least try and (?help him) to say yes, we will reach a conclusion by some time? (?Is it) not unreasonable, unfair to ask you to put some time limit or some time in the future when you hope you can deliver an answer? [Adams] The reality of the situation is that each party has been given clarification by the British Government on issues which they sought clarification on. The party which I represent, which represents a quite significant section of people in the north, has not been given that clarification. Now, until we get that, we cannot give a definitive response. [Reporter] (?Is) the peace process, in your view, advanced at all by this visit or are things still the same, you're coming back to the same position? [Adams] Well, I don't know what the situation is here since I left, but certainly I think that the climate has been improved, that here we have a focus, as I said earlier, on the issues, on the core issues. A framework has obviously been identified of the two governments in consultation with everyone else. There's a lot of jockeying going on, a lot of people, maybe quite legitimately, trying to sort out their own positions, so I think that the last 48 hours have been helpful and (?all of it) certainly, certainly no harm has been done. But I also think there are some parts of the British, you know, establishment think that they still rule the world. They're not content with interfering in Irish affairs, but they want to interfere in North American affairs also. But more importantly, they create the situation. Had I not been denied a visa because of British pressure, who would have paid any attention? Who would have noticed (?a) Gerry Adams going there, had we been handled in a sensible way? So I went to the conference, it was a good conference, despite the absence of some of the key players. And people who didn't know the Republican view now have at least had the opportunity, and an uncensored media, to examine the Republican view. [Reporter] So, how do you assess the chances of peace and maybe an eventual yes to the Downing Street declaration from the IRA? [Adams] Well, I do, I do, and I've said this repeatedly, I do have a very firm conviction that we are going to have peace. The opportunity for peace was never more realizable. I think that we're into a final phase of this conflict, but how long it takes is something else again entirely, but we have moved, I mean we're talking about peace, we're not talking about war. (?It wasn't a) conference, I wasn't in the States talking about bringing weapons to Ireland, talking about any of those war activities, no one (?dealt) with that. We all talked about how we end war. So I think it's all moving forward. [end recording]
