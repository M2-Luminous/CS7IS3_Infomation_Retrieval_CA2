The report also pointed to joint responsibility for Kuwait's foreign investment scandals and emphasized that, those calamities notwithstanding, certain principals are still occupying leadership positions in the management of foreign investments. The report underscored the "lack of government awareness of the magnitude of the general fiscal crisis" and noted that some 90 percent of oil revenues anticipated in the new budget will be expended on salaries whereas about 59 percent is earmarked for military outlays, foretelling of substantial future deficits. Following is the text of the report: Underperforming Debt A majority of deputies does not wish to amend Law 41/93, which governs underperforming debts, according to the secretary of the Public Funds Guardian Committee. We also believe this to be the assembly's sentiment. Several ministers have expressed the government's desire to amend the underperforming debt law but have not made it clear whether the desired amendments would cover fiscal matters or procedural aspects. We believe that the government would face a serious conflict with the assembly should it propose to postpone the instantaneous settlement deadline, extend the rescheduling period from 12 to 20 years, or even merely indicate that it would consider payment in kind. The governor of the Central Bank of Kuwait was quoted as saying that 3,174 clients, or 33 percent of the original 9,523 or so, have already secured their settlements. We assume that some 2,783 others have settled instantaneously in response to the law and there was no reason to secure their settlements. This means that some 5,957 clients, or about 63 percent of total debtors, have responded to the law. They accounted for about KD5.375 billion in accumulated debt, or 96 percent of the KD5.591 billion in combined original debt. Those figures generally agree with a previous finance minister's statement that about 6,000 clients have responded to the law. The finance minister added, however, that those who did not respond have combined balances of some KD900 million, leaving a difference of about KD216 million in the balances of those who responded to the law and whose who did not. This difference is explained by the fact that the acquired debt balance is higher than the balance of debt instruments because of bank discounting and the possible inclusion of other types of debt. It would have been incumbent upon the Central Bank of Kuwait and the Ministry of Finance to divulge the balance of acquired debt and to reveal its components. Oil Investments Reports by the Audit Bureau, a public oversight agency, on correcting the investments of the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation are being published in a local newspaper. Those reports have been overdue for 10 years during which the public treasury incurred huge losses. Nevertheless, they are a healthy outcome of the separation of the branches of governance and indicate the restoration of a degree of respect for the law and for oversight agencies. The oil investments case is almost an exact duplicate of Kuwait's foreign direct investments case, both of which are currently under investigation by the general prosecutor's office as well as by the British and Spanish court systems. They are also quite similar to the oil tanker case, which is also before the courts in Kuwait. A single team seems to be fully or partially responsible for all cases from the Santa Fe case to the Spanish incident to the British Petroleum deal to the remittances made during the occupation period and its aftermath. The Audit Bureau's reports underscore the pattern of misconduct itself--i.e., purchases made without the benefit of serious prior studies; purchases at above going prices; direct funding support of projects in which they got themselves entangled; disregard for the constitution and other laws when providing guarantees and loans, the creation of phantom companies and tampering with financial books, and the founding of certain firms at the expense of others. The same team remains in positions of management in spite of poor financial performance and the lack of periodic due diligence by the parent organization, which failed to take meaningful corrective steps either because of hurried meetings of because of buck passing. Those policies and decisions went unchallenged by the Supreme Petroleum Council and the cabinet either because they were not deemed important or because of over-confidence and of allowing personal considerations to outweigh the fundamentals of public administration. The Audit Bureau's reports are not all out yet but they indicate losses in the billions of dollars on top of foreign investment losses. This is something that should be given attention and adequate consideration, as a profound lesson if nothing else. Those reports, which are no doubt being scrutinized by government, should be studied by relevant National Assembly committees as well. Politics aside, it must be emphasized once again that all of us without exception have been victimized by such misconduct. The General Budget We reported two weeks ago that new 1994/95 budget figures released by the government show expenditures of KD4.390 billion against revenues of KD2.537 billion, of which oil revenues account for KD2.235 billion or 88 percent. The new budget figures therefore indicate a budget deficit of KD1.853 billion, compared with a deficit of KD1.223 billion estimated for the current 1993/94 fiscal year. The deficits for the current and upcoming years are comparable when the impact of added defense expenditures is excluded. We also previously noted that the proposed budget was no accomplishment and that it is antithetical to last January's recommendations by the Ministry of Finance. We further noted that the budget did not reflect a true picture of the country's fiscal position next year because it was not comprehensive and its forecast of the country's fiscal position did not go beyond one fiscal year. Preliminary figures indicate that new budget allocations for wages and salaries may be as high as KD2.011 billion, as opposed to published estimates of KD1.144 billion, after adding salary allocations for subsidiaries (KD211 million), autonomous agencies (about KD338 million) and salaries for the military (KD318 million). The figure accounts for about 90 percent of estimated oil revenues and for about 79 percent of total anticipated revenues. The government employs about 97 percent of the Kuwaiti labor force outside the military sector. Defense outlays are estimated at about KD980 million or approximately 44 percent of total oil revenues forecast. Allotments for the Interior Ministry and the National Guard would raise anticipated defense outlays to about KD1.325 billion, or 59 percent of total estimated oil revenues. It is to be noted, however, that military salaries are included in the general allocations for both defense and wages and salaries and the duplication should be corrected. There is little chance of directly containing wages and salaries expenditures in the short-term but this is not the case with defense outlays if alternatives were considered without sensitivities or pressure. The new budget allows only KD220 million to cover interest due on Treasury notes and bonds with no provision for interest due on underperforming loans or on foreign debt. The Kuwaiti prime minister is said to have requested expeditious ratification of outlays for state acquisition of private real estate. If true, this would be another indication of the lack of government recognition of the magnitude of the general fiscal crisis. As to revenues, the government adjusted its oil revenue forecasts in the new budget downward from $15 to $12 per barrel. It had proposed a downward adjustment last January to $10.5 per barrel but no change was made in the dollar exchange rate, which remained at 299 Kuwaiti fils. Expected oil revenues consequently declined by some $185 million, about 7.6 percent, even though production was estimated to expand by about 11 percent or 200,000 barrels per day.
