FBIS4-6736 "dreas078_d_94008" FBIS-EAS-94-078 Daily Report 22 Apr 1994 South Korea Government Sends Message to DPRK Red Cross Government Sends Message to DPRK Red Cross SK2204032694 Seoul KBS-1 Radio Network in Korean 0202 GMT 22 Apr 94 SK2204032694 Seoul KBS-1 Radio Network Korean BFN [Text] The government sent a telephone message to North Korea this morning, objecting to North Korea's call for the repatriation of long-term prisoners who refused converting from communism. It has, however, urged North Korea to repatriate figures who were kidnapped to North Korea and to resume talks between the North and South Red Cross societies. This morning, the government sent the telephone message to Yi Song-ho, acting chairman of the North Korean Red Cross Society Central Committee, in the name of Kang Yong-hun, president of the Korea National Red Cross, and stressed: Because Mr. Kim In-so--whom North Korea asked on 19 April to be repatriated to the North as a long-term prisoner because he refused to convert from communism-- acquired the ROK nationality on his free will, is no longer a prisoner of war. If North Korea is interested in the humanitarian issue, it should take practical steps to resolve the separated family matter. In today's message, the government said that the reason no progress had been made in the settlement of the separated family issue is because of the North side's failure to implement an agreement reached between the North and South and demanded that, based on the spirit of the Red Cross Society, the North side repatriate approximately 440 persons -- who were kidnaped to the North -- including Tongjin Ho sailors, as soon as possible, and that it immediately resume the suspended Red Cross talks.
