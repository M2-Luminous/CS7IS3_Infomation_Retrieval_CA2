Robaina also spoke of the bustling international activity in Cuba and asked for solidarity against the economic blockade imposed by the United States over three decades ago. In that regard, Robaina asked for international solidarity in light of this pressure tactic, which it considers unjust. Robaina reiterated Havana's willingness to discuss any topic with the United States so long as no strings are attached. Following a meeting with Guido Di Tella, his Argentine counterpart, Robaina said that he had informed Di Tella of the economic measures Havana has implemented as well as the steps it is taking toward integration with Latin America and the Caribbean. Robaina also spoke to Di Tella about Cuba's criteria for the democratization process of the United Nations; the preparations for the upcoming Ibero-American summit in Cartagena, Colombia; and a presidential summit called by Washington at the end of 1994. Robaina, who is here on an official visit on 13 and 14 April, made a stop in Buenos Aires as part of a tour that began in Uruguay and will continue with Peru and Paraguay. Robaina gave a news conference following his one-hour meeting with Di Tella and said that Cuba and Argentina are living in a "new phase with a smoother communication." Commenting that Cuban-Argentine relations "have overcome difficulties," he pointed out that "the things both nations have in common are stronger." Cuba is currently opening to the investment of foreign capital. That, he emphasized, is of great interest to Argentina and its businessmen. Regarding Cuba's debt with Argentina, estimated at some $1 billion, Robaina reiterated Havana's intention to "unfreeze" the topic and have experts from both countries begin talks in that regard. Argentine Foreign Minister Di Tella called his meeting with Robaina positive, fruitful, and sincere, and added that topics of mutual interest were discussed in a respectful manner. Robaina gave numerous interviews to major local and foreign media throughout the day.
