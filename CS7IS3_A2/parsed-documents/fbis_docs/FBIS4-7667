Gronkiewicz-Waltz pointed out that the approval of the budget would open up an opportunity to negotiate another agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). She said that the implementation of the previous agreement brought about the cancellation of 8 billion dollars owed to the Paris Club and contributed to a preliminary agreement on cancelling part of Poland's debt to the London Club. She stressed that the signing of the agreement increased Poland's credibility in the international arena, reduced the level of Polish risk, created chances for the greater inflow of investment funds to Poland and made it possible to get another loan from the European Union (EU). The president voiced its concern over lack of implementation of promises made during the election campaign by the present political alignment. Walesa said this was the problem making the president to be very cautious when making difficult decision concerning the budget.
