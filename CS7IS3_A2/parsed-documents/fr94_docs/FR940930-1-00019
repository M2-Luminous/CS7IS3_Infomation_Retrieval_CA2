FR940930-1-00019 FR940930-1-00008 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE Patent and Trademark Office 37 CFR Part 1 [Docket No. 940965&hyph;4265] RIN: 0651&hyph;AA67 Revision of Affidavits Under 37 CFR 1.131 AGENCY: Patent and Trademark Office, Commerce. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Patent and Trademark Office (Office) proposes to amend the rules of practice relating to submission of affidavits or declarations under 37 CFR 1.131(a) to implement the relevant provisions of Public Law No. 103&hyph;182 and the GATT (General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs), and to provide relief in certain circumstances where a common assignee holds both an application and a patent claiming patentably indistinct, but not identical, inventions. DATES: Written comments must be submitted on or before December 1, 1994. No oral hearing will be held. ADDRESSES: Address written comments to the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, Washington, D.C. 20231, Attention: Charles E. Van Horn, Deputy Assistant Commissioner for Patent Policy and Projects, or by fax to (703) 305&hyph;8825. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Charles E. Van Horn by telephone at (703) 305&hyph;9054 or Hiram Bernstein by telephone at (703) 305&hyph;9282 or by mail marked to the attention of Charles E. Van Horn, Deputy Assistant Commissioner for Patent Policy and Projects, and addressed as above. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Public Law No. 103&hyph;182 (November 4, 1993) implementing the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), amended 35 U.S.C. 104 to provide that for the purpose of obtaining a patent, an applicant can show a date of invention in the United States, or in a NAFTA country which occurred after the date of implementation (i.e., December 8, 1993). Although GATT enabling legislation has not been passed, these proposed rule changes assume that it will be passed, and therefore changes to 37 CFR 1.131(a) similar to NAFTA would be required. See Article 27, paragraph 1, of the Agreement on Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, Including Trade in Counterfeit Goods, of the GATT. In the event that the GATT enabling legislation is not enacted when the final rules are published, the proposed rule changes relative to the GATT will be withdrawn. The Office proposes to amend 37 CFR 1.131(a), which is currently limited to facts showing a completion of the invention in the United States, to allow for a submission of facts in an affidavit or declaration that show completion of the invention in a NAFTA or a World Trade Organization (WTO) Member country. The WTO is established under the GATT agreement to resolve disputes between signatories to the agreement. The facts presented must demonstrate completion of the invention prior to the effective date of a reference thought to bar the grant of a patent or the patentability of a claim in a patent under reexamination. Additionally, the Office recognizes that there is a potential conflict between existing 37 CFR 1.131(a) and 37 CFR 1.602(a). Section 1.131(a) prohibits affidavits or declarations thereunder when the same patentable invention as defined in 37 CFR 1.601(n) (i.e., patentably indistinct inventions) is claimed. An interference under 35 U.S.C. 135, rather than antedating under §1.131(a), is generally the available remedy. However, 37 CFR 1.602(a) provides that when the applications or the application and patent are owned by a single party, interferences are not declared or continued unless good cause is shown. This can result in a hardship where there is an issued patent that can no longer be amended as by filing a continuation-in-part application. Where there are two or more pending applications, the conflict can be avoided by filing a continuation-in-part application incorporating the conflicting inventions in a single application. The Office proposes to amend 37 CFR 1.131 to broaden its application to a single party where inventions of a pending application and a patent held by the party are patentably indistinct but not identical. Under the proposed additions to §1.131, an affidavit or declaration could be filed by a party to avoid a 35 U.S.C. 103 rejection based on a 35 U.S.C. 102(a) or (e) patent owned by that party, where the patent claimed an invention that was patentably indistinct, but not identical to an invention claimed in an application or patent undergoing reexamination. The proposed addition to §1.131 would not affect the use of the issued patent in a rejection based on double patenting. However, where patentably indistinct but not identical inventions are claimed, a double patenting rejection can be avoided by filing an appropriate terminal disclaimer. In addition, petitions under §1.183 will be entertained for waiver of §1.131 requirements in appropriate instances where two pending applications claiming patentably indistinct but not identical inventions are held by a single party. Discussion of Specific Rules Section 1.131(a), if amended to (a)(1) as proposed, would allow a §1.131 affiant or declarant to rely upon facts occurring in a NAFTA or a WTO Member country to show completion of the invention. The term ``domestic'' would be changed to ``U.S.'' The section is proposed to be amended from a single sentence to three sentences. Section 1.131(a)(2), if added as proposed, would limit the availability of acts showing completion of the invention in a NAFTA or WTO Member country to those acts occurring subsequent to the effective date of the agreements.
