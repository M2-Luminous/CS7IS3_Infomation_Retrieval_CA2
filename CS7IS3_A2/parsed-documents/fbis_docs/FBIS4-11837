He said in a press conference held in the foreign correspondents association in Cairo yesterday that his country's agreement to hold talks on the Hala'ib triangle represents a kind of concession. He said: "I pledged to safeguard Sudan's sovereignty over its territory." He added: "Hala'ib is Sudanese." He said that Egypt's decision to establish a new electoral constituency there is tantamount to an Egyptian confirmation that it has never belonged to Egypt before. He described his country's decision to appoint a governor for Hala'ib as an internal matter within the framework of its sovereignty over its territory. He said: "The governor will go there to assume the duties of his post at whatever time he wants." He expressed Sudan's willingness to accept mediation or arbitration with regard to the triangle. Abu-Salih urged Egyptian officials to "stop pursuing the fait accompli policy and to consider the triangle a disputed territory." He held Egypt responsible for "the delay in convening the ministerial meeting in Khartoum." On Egypt's criticisms of Sudan for sheltering extremists, Abu-Salih renewed his invitation for an Egyptian security delegation to visit Sudan to ascertain there are no terrorist camps in Sudan. He said that "Sudan's security is linked to Egypt's security, and Sudan would not allow Egypt's security to be threatened from its territory." He denied that Sudan has received any Egyptian lists demanding the extradition of a group of extremists who are wanted to appear before the Egyptian judiciary. He stressed that "Sudan has not received any lists." He expressed "Sudan's willingness to bolster security cooperation between the two countries." With regard to Sudan's relationship with Iran, he described this relationship as "less than normal." He pointed out that "Sudan is Sunni...and Iran is Shiite, and there is a difference between the two sects." He added: "Sudan is entitled to establish relations with any state without interference from anyone." He said that "any talk about this relationship is interference in Sudanese internal affairs -- which we reject." He strongly denied the presence in Sudan of any forces from the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. He said: "Anyone who has such evidence should submit it." Regarding the presence of [Saudi businessman] Usamah Bin-Ladin [in Sudan] and his support for fundamentalist extremists, he said: "Usamah Bin-Ladin lives in Sudan normally and is engaged in construction work on the most vital road in Sudan, that is the Khartoum-'Atbarah road. About 170 km of this road have been completed. He has no activities other than his trade businesses." Abu-Salih said: "Madeleine Albright, U.S. permanent representative to the United Nations, will visit Sudan the day after tomorrow, Thursday, in the framework of the Sudanese-U.S. talks. We are waiting for the message which she will carry from U.S. President Bill Clinton to Sudanese President 'Umar Hasan al-Bashir." He expects the message to deal with the Sudanese peace talks held in Nairobi recently. He added that Sudan has indictment evidence against states he did not name and Israel, "supported with documents showing the types of weapons seized from southerners during the fighting, but we prefer not to reveal this evidence at present."
