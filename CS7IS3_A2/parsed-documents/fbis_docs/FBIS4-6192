But if Pyongyang changes its mind and embraces inter-Korean dialogue during its talks with Washington, Seoul will come to the bargaining table with Pyongyang on condition that the meeting should first discuss North Korea's nuclear program. A government official said over the weekend that because the South announced it would no longer seek to exchange special presidential envoys with the North, Seoul would not be the first to offer to resume the suspended dialogue with Pyongyang unless the latter showed a change in attitude. If there is firm evidence of a change in the North's inter-Korean dialogue policy, the government will seek to resume the talks on the principle of keeping open the dialogue channel at all times, he added. If the dialogue resumes, the agenda will focus on mutual nuclear inspections between South and North Korea under the declaration of denuclearization of the peninsula, with the government seeking high-level talks or a joint nuclear control commission meeting, he said.
