The Canadian has not been identified, but a Canadian diplomat in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, said it appears the hostages are being well treated and that the Government of Yemen is negotiating their release. The eight men work for an American oil company. There have been dozens of kidnappings of foreigners by tribesmen, who routinely want favors from authorities in exchange for their release.
