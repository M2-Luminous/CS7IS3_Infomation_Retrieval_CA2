"This is a justifiable claim giving expression to the aspirations of his people," said Conservative Party leader Ferdi Hartzenberg. Signing himself as transitional Volksraad [National Assembly] president, Dr Hartzenberg said in a statement on Tuesday the interim constitution did not accommodate such expression and therefore offered no lasting political solutions for South Africa. "The Afrikaner nation's demand for freedom and self-determination in its own republic with its own constitution is also a justifiable claim which needs to be addressed," Dr Hartzenberg said. These demands would have to be accommodated in a future constitutional dispensation for peace and prosperity.
