Giving the keynote speech at the beginning of a two-day seminar on "Technology transfer and other joint venture opportunities in the new India" here, Mr Chandra noted the hurdles created in many sensitive areas while concluding agreements on transfer of technology between the two countries. "Strong opinions have been expressed from both sides and the provisions in the GATT agreement pertaining to the patent system have caused acrimonious debate," conceded Mr Chandra at the meeting which was organised by Business Development Associates. However, consequent to the agreement signed on December 15 last year in Marrakech, "India will be introducing necessary amendments to the Indian Patent Act of 1970," Mr Chandra said, echoing the Prime Minister's assurances to US Commerce Secretary Ron Brown and US Trade Representative (USTR) Mickey Kantor. A little over a month ago, India, along with China and Argentina, got a reprieve of 60 days from the USTR to improve its patent and copyright laws. Otherwise, it was in danger of being listed as a Special 301 country, one that was not meeting the conditions of trade laid down in the US Trade Act. The Patent Act amendment, Mr Chandra said, would increase the period of protection from seven years to 14 years in the case of pharmaceuticals and processed foods and 20 years in other cases. He stressed that New Delhi had traditionally been cognisant of the need to protect IPR, a view strongly disputed by Washington's senior officials. The Copyright Act was also being amended for the protection of performers, sound recorders and broadcasting organisations. Furthermore, trade marks, trade secrets and industrial designs were protected under laws conforming to international standards, Mr Chandra insisted. "Apprehensions with regard to protection of IPR and infringements of patents and copyright have been exaggerated in the past," he said. N Vittal, Secretary, Telecommunications, was also invited to the meetings, but was unable to attend because of preoccupations.
