A special prosecutor demands money from the potential targets of his investigation, and others do not attend court proceedings and later allow court orders to be falsified. Investigations and arrests are overturned because of inconsistencies, as in Adelina Mesa's case, who was accused of a terrorist attack in Bogota, and prosecutors are blamed for inconsistencies in a number of cases. All these episodes seem to have finally exhausted the patience of Attorney General Carlos Gustavo Arrieta. His staff is now handling 1,200 investigations of prosecutors. In a letter to Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff, he revealed the system's Achilles heel: arbitrary actions and negligence on the part of a number of prosecutors. Arrieta issued a forceful criticism: some prosecutors initiate legal action hastily and without solid evidence, thereby violating the principle of [presumed] innocence and due process. In his letter, the attorney general announced the immediate start of new investigations because these abuses still persist, even though in May 1993 he had issued warnings concerning these abuses, also in a letter to the prosecutor general. De Greiff agrees that there are serious irregularities in the work of some of his subordinates, but says they do not reach the extreme cited by the Attorney General's Office. "We," De Greiff told EL TIEMPO, "do not conceal anything from a sense of esprit de corps; we do not protect people because they are in the Prosecutor General's Office. We are not saints, but we try to be." During his 18 months at the Prosecutor General's Office, De Greiff has investigated 656 prosecutors in internal procedures. To date 238 investigations have been concluded; 418 are still under way. Director of Prosecution Offices The National Director of Prosecution Offices, Ana Montes, who coordinates prosecutors all over the country and whose office maintains statistics on decisions issued by prosecutors acting as trial judges, has her own view of the matter. Montes agrees that "it is time to look at what is going on," but she explains that many of the complaints are filed when the party affected by a decision calls for a disciplinary or penal investigation against the prosecutor. Still, the Attorney General's Office believes that the problem goes far beyond that. As an example, they say that prosecutors have been initiating legal proceedings against municipal officials who in the end prove their innocence. "On many occasions ignorance of administrative contracting provisions and regulations or of budget systems has caused legal action to be initiated and municipal officials to be suspended who later (...) must be returned to office." "All this," explains the attorney general, "could be avoided if prosecutors studied the situation thoroughly before initiating legal proceedings." However, De Greiff and Arrieta both seem to agree that the time has come to apply a firm hand.
