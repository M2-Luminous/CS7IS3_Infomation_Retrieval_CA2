This is a significant meeting of the largest scale and highest quality in the regional propaganda and ideological front since Tibet's peaceful liberation. The spirit of the conference will certainly have a far-reaching influence on propaganda and ideological work in Tibet, and will contribute positively to its reform, development, stability, and all-round social progress. Party and government organizations at all levels as well as the propaganda and ideological front must earnestly implement the spirit of the conference by obtaining a clearer understanding of the situation, further emancipating minds, achieving greater unity in understanding, and heightening spirits so as to effectively strengthen and improve propaganda and ideological work throughout the region. Propaganda and ideological work has always been an important component of the party's work. In the past four decades since Tibet's peaceful liberation, the propaganda and ideological front has done a tremendous job and achieved remarkable achievements in earnestly implementing the party's basic theories and lines in various historical stages to bring about momentous changes in Tibetan society and to accomplish the party's various tasks. Especially since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the propaganda and ideological front has greatly inspired cadres and people throughout Tibet to emancipate their minds and change their mindsets; it has harnessed the initiative, enthusiasm, and creativity of the masses in dedicating themselves to reform and the establishment of a socialist market economy. It has also effectively promoted the anti-splittist struggle and stability; has enriched the people's spiritual and cultural life; has publicized the outstanding Tibetan cultural traditions; has safeguarded the motherland's unification and unity of nationalities; and has facilitated the smooth progress of reform, opening up, and modernization construction in Tibet. The facts have proved that Tibet's propaganda and ideological workers are a contingent of people loyal to the cause of the party and the people; who possess special strengths and fighting capacity to endure hardships and sacrifice; who are full of vigor and vitality; and who can be trusted by the party and the people. Under the party's correct leadership, people of all nationalities in Tibet are implementing the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and the Fifth Plenary Enlarged Session of the Fourth Regional Party Committee; they are striving to build a new socialist market economic system. A new situation of reform and opening up has emerged in Tibet. In the process of this historic change, the propaganda and ideological front is confronted with two fundamental tasks: to study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and conscientiously adhere to the party's basic line to facilitate Tibet's socialist modernization and safeguard the motherland's unification, and to enhance the unity of nationalities and oppose splittist forces in order to ensure Tibet's social stability. In the final analysis, these two fundamental tasks are issues concerning reform, development, and stability; they are the main issues of Tibetan social life at present and for some time to come in the future. All propaganda and ideological departments in Tibet should firmly grasp these issues. They should follow Comrade Jiang Zemin's instruction that we should arm our people with scientific theories, guide them with correct public opinion, inculcate them with noble ideals, and encourage them with fine works of literature and art. They should persist in the orientation of serving the people and socialism, and should adhere to the principle of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend. They should bring into play their specialties and advantages in publicizing the spirits of our times, promoting a flourishing socialist literature and art, and creating more and better quality intellectual products to the delight of the masses. They should continuously satisfy the masses' growing demands in spiritual and cultural life, raise the level of propaganda and ideological work, enhance propaganda effects, and work hard for Tibet's social stability and economic growth. The propaganda and ideological front is facing a glorious yet arduous task. Presently propaganda and ideological departments in Tibet are facing difficulties and still cannot cope up with the demands in building the two civilizations and in stabilizing the situation. However, we are convinced that so long as propaganda and ideological departments take the just concluded regional propaganda and ideological work conference as a new starting point and work hard to forge ahead and fulfill various tasks, they will certainly be able to raise the level of propaganda and ideological work in Tibet and accomplish the historical mission entrusted by our times upon propaganda and ideological work.
