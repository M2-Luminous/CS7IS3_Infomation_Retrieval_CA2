While the income tax cut is included, in all other aspects, there is no clear manifestation of the Hosokawa administration's policy direction. As always, the draft budget is a duplicate of last year's. The present budget should have been a crucial one both from the short-term and the mid- and long-term point of view. It should have been designed to achieve: first, a breakaway from the three-year-old recession, the most serious in the postwar period, led by domestic demand; second, a transition from the consistently producer-oriented economy since the end of World War II to a consumer-oriented one; and third, laying the groundwork for dealing with the aging society. These are policy goals the Hosokawa administration has been upholding. Yet, how come there is no trace of them in the government's draft budget? Aside from the income tax cut, a major increase in public investment is important to boost the economy. While appropriations for public works projects are indeed being increased by 4 percent compared to the original allocation in fiscal 1993, compared to the actual amount expended at the end of fiscal 1993, this, in fact, represents a considerable decrease. For sure, finances will be in bad shape in the short-term because of the issuance of special government bonds for the first time in five years. However, we have pointed out time and again that an early economic recovery will be indispensable for resolving mid- and long-term issues. From the lack of enthusiastic reactions from the economic circles to the long-awaited income tax cut and the comprehensive economic package, and the present appreciation of the yen, another supplementary budget may become necessary fairly soon. Moreover, since a provisional budget for more than one month is now believed to be inevitable, it is more than clear that the budget should have been formulated more meticulously from the very beginning. In addition, there is the need to deal with the ongoing rapid appreciation of the yen. Even from the point of view of a consumer-oriented economy, and preparing for the aging society, the draft budget is a failure. The pattern of allocation of funds for public works, contrary to the prime minister's campaign promises, has remained totally unchanged. The budget is simply a result of all-out efforts by Diet members from both the ruling coalition parties and the opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] to grab appropriations in the time-honored "zoku-giin" [Diet members having special interests in certain policy areas] style, and desperate efforts on the part of all ministries and agencies to maintain their previous appropriation level. We cannot help wondering what happened to the "end of the 1955 System [the LDP regime]"? In short, the Hosokawa administration's policy ideals are not reflected in the budget at all. To say the least, this budget has nothing to do with the future of the Japanese economy as envisioned by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. Has the prime minister exercised his leadership at all in the process of drawing up the budget? The only bright spot is that the income tax cut somehow was included. Yet, even this becomes almost meaningless if not followed by a radical reform of the taxation system. These issues should be discussed thoroughly in the Diet. At the same time, the government should start taking concrete steps now to effect a radical reform in the budget formulation process for fiscal 1995 and beyond. It is impossible to grow out of old habits in a short time.
