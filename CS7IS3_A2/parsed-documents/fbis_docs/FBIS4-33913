FBIS4-33913 "drlat114_a_94025" FBIS-LAT-94-114 Daily Report 14 Jun 1994 CARIBBEAN Cuba `Straight Talk' on Deregulating Cigarette Sales `Straight Talk' on Deregulating Cigarette Sales FL1106011894 FL1106011894 BFN [Editorial Report] Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish at 1600 GMT on 10 June carries a 15-minute edition of its regularly scheduled "Straight Talk" program, with Eloy Concepcion, from TRABAJADORES newspaper, and host Osvaldo Rodriguez, from BOHEMIA magazine. Rodriguez opens the debate by stating that measures increasing prices and deregulating sales of cigarettes and rum have significantly influenced the market and buyers. Concepcion states that consumers and speculators have not hoarded these products since they went on deregulated sale. He adds that many people feared the cigarettes were stale but this is not the case. The warehouses had stockpiled cigarettes to ensure that supply would meet demand. Concepcion adds that speculators are holding back, given that the media has reported the factories have the conditions to continue producing 50 million cigarettes a day. Rodriguez states the fight has been won as long as the cigarette industry is able to maintain the flow of production. Concepcion states that he believes that after years of gratuities, the first big lesson the people have learned is to be aware of home and personal finances. He adds that the basic quota of four boxes has gone from costing 20 cents each to costing 2 pesos each, and the two additional boxes were 1.6 pesos each and now cost six pesos each. Concepcion adds that rum has gone from 7.2 pesos to 13.75 pesos, and that next September the cost of electricity will increase and transportation and water services have already been increased in order to mend the national finances. He adds: "We have to say it clearly. This affects the people's pocket. The Cuban people will learn to live on a budget, which is something we never thought about because the state took care of us." Concepcion goes on to say that the current tobacco harvest has been outstanding, adding: "This year's tobacco crop is a slap in the face to those who think that socialism is incapable of organizing efficient agriculture." Rodriguez states that the measures have benefited smokers because the black market can no longer charge 30 pesos for a box because consumers can now buy three boxes for 30 pesos. He adds that undoubtedly the people will have to learn to live on a budget and that near the cigarette factory in Ranchuelo, people are illegally selling cigarettes stolen from that factory in the streets and that the factory's workers, management, party cell, and union representatives have to solve that problem. Rodriguez closes by stating that stealing from the cigarette factories is widespread, adding: "As long as this lack of control prevails, we will not be able to sustain a stable production."
