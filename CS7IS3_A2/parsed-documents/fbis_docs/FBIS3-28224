Kanzaki and Kantor expressed basic stances mainly on two areas -- whether to include Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) in the scope of government procurement and ways to increase foreign access to Japan's mobile phone market -- the official told a press conference. But he declined to give further details, saying both sides agreed to make no comment. After the press conference, the official told KYODO news service that the discussion basically "went in parallel" during the 60-minute meeting. Neither side yielded on key points in the two areas, though Kanzaki and Kantor agreed to continue talks, he said. Subcabinet-level talks are to resume on Monday in Washington. Kantor, apparently skeptical about Japanese bureaucrats' ability to settle issues, is visiting Japan in a search of a breakthrough in the stalled framework talks through direct meetings with cabinet ministers. He has already met with the foreign minister, the trade minister and the finance minister. But these meetings appeared to have no tangible results, casting doubt over the settlement of framework issues before the February 11 meeting between Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton. The U.S. trade negotiator is to hold a press conference at 2 P.M. [0500 GMT], wrapping up his trip to Tokyo.
