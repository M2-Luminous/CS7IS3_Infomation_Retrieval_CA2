The DPA correspondent had reported that he had learned this in the Slovak capital of Bratislava, where Defense Minister Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union) is currently visiting the Slovak Army. Through lack of money the Bundeswehr can reportedly by no means be kept at the level of 370,000 men; it must be reduced to about 200,000 army soldiers, about 80,000 air force soldiers, and 20,000 navy members. Since at the security conference in Munich on the weekend Ruehe had also announced a reduction of the Bundeswehr and cutbacks in Bundeswehr planning, in terms of both structure and bases, this DPA report was received with considerable attention by government circles. Reportedly, the future of the Bundeswehr will soon be the topic of a talk between the chancellor and his defense minister. In Munich Kohl had stated that the size of the Bundeswehr will be somewhere close to 370,000 men.
