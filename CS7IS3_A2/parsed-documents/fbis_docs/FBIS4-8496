Protection Force (UNPROFOR) chief for the former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi said on Wednesday that he had agreed with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic that "the current crisis in Gorazde should be used as a chance to secure a lasting peace and ceasefire in the entire territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina." Asked about his current contacts with the Bosnian Serb leadership, who suspended all links with UNPROFOR after the NATO air attacks on Serb positions near Gorazde (Moslem enclave in southeast Bosnia), Akashi said he had received assurances from Milosevic that he can continue the talks with the Bosnian Serb leaders. "I intend to fly to Sarajevo to resume the talks regarding the ceasefire and peace, not only in connection to Gorazde but also linked to all other situations and I am very satisfied by such prospects," Akashi said. He described the hour-and-a-half meeting with the Serbian president, held on Wednesday morning, as "very useful and productive." "I appreciate his understanding of the complexity and urgency of these issues," Akashi said. Commenting on the possibility of additional air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs, Akashi underscored his hope that the situation would not deteriorate to such an extent to force UNPROFOR to defend itself and the staff of humanitarian organizations with the minimum of weapons. U.S. NATO jets on April 10-11 bombed Bosnian Serb positions near Gorazde, a U.N.-designated safe area which should have been demilitarized. It served as the starting point for a 10,000-strong Moslem offensive in late March on Serb territories. After a strong Serb counter attack, which threatened to defeat the Moslems, the United Nations called for NATO air strikes on Serb positions allegedly to protect U.N. observers in Gorazde. At last Saturday's negotiations with the Moslems, the Bosnian Serbs proposed a ceasefire in the entire Bosnian territory, but the Moslems rejected this suggesting a partial ceasefire and focusing only on the issue of Gorazde.
