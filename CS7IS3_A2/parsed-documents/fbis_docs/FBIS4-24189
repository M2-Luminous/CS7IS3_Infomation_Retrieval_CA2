It follows the arrest of self-declared president, Chief Moshood Abiola, yesterday. Chief Abiola is widely believed to have won last June's annulled presidential election. [passage omitted] Now the protests are beginning, as Sola Odunfa reports from Lagos. [Begin Odunfa recording] Leading the protests is the National Democratic Coalition, Nadeco, which has appealed to the international community to show and intensify its support for the restoration of democracy in Nigeria under a government headed by Chief Abiola. [passage omitted] However, the government is not without support. The most prominent of its supporters so far is former military head of state, Gen. Yakubu Gowon, who was toppled in 1976. He defended Chief Abiola's arrest on the grounds that the government had a duty to maintain law and order. He appealed to Nigerians to support the national constitutional conference opening in Abuja on Monday [27 June] as the only way to terminate military rule permanently. Meanwhile, the Federal High Court sitting in Lagos has ordered that all six former senators charged with treason be remanded in police custody. The court revoked the bail it granted earlier to three of them, including former Senate President Ameh Ebute. Their trial has been adjourned to 6 July. The three others, a former civilian state governor, Segun Osoba, and two retired air force officers, charged with forming an illegal political association were released on bail. Their own trial will begin on 12 July. [end recording]
