[Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] The OAS ordinary session will be held in Brazil this month. The foreign minister has stated that, as usual, Bolivia will uphold a firm stance regarding its landlocked situation, a more than century-old problem with Chile, which that country has systematically refused to discuss within the OAS framework. [Aranibar] The current government, in practice and in theory, is tackling the maritime issue from the viewpoint disclosed both by the president of the Republic and myself, and which has to do with Bolivian willingness to strengthen relations with Chile as long as there is a desire to discuss all the existing problems, even the maritime problem. We are going to act at a bilateral, trilateral, and multilateral level with that objective in mind. This is one of the purposes of our presence at the upcoming OAS assembly in Belem, Para State. Changing the subject, I would like to tell you that yesterday, together with the vice president of the Republic, I had the pleasure of closing the preliminary meeting of Latin American and Caribbean people, or better said their governments, to discuss the UN's decade for indigenous communities. This was a very important and far-reaching meeting, and it approved a package of recommendations resulting from the consensus between the governments represented on the occasion and the indigenous people and communities that participated.
