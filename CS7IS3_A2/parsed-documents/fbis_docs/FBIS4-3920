Shaanxi, Shanxi and Henan, three neighboring provinces along the middle reaches of the Yellow River, are now expanding their cooperation in all aspects of economy, especially in transport, energy and chemical industries, as well as agriculture. The provinces share a triangle plain area, where the Yellow River flows south and then turns east. Covering a total of 40,000 square kilometers, the triangle area has 30 countries and cities with a population totalling 11 million. Although they have been neighbors along the Yellow River, the provinces had never had any cooperation with one another, because they had been under independent regional administrations in China. Provinces and autonomous regions in different administrational regions hardly cooperated in economy or culture in the past. It was not until 1986 that some departments of the State Council initiated a plan for the three provinces to start economic cooperation in the triangle area. With further reforms and opening up, China has encouraged regional cooperation across the country. So far dozens of provinces and cities have expanded cooperation with their neighbors. The on-going cooperation involving the south-western provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan and Guizhou has promoted the local economies. The same is true for the cooperation schemes embracing provinces and cities on the middle and lower reaches of the Chang Jiang River and around Bohai Bay. They are now playing a crucial role in the economy of the whole of China. Given best opportunities for regional cooperation at the time, the three neighbors along the Yellow River have worked out a scheme together to promote their local economy, especially in the triangle area. Costing more than 100 million yuan, the Sanmenxia Bridge across the Yellow River started to be used at the end of last year. It now contributes much to the coal transport from Shanxi, a province abundant in coal, to Henan where power energy is in short supply. In the past, coal was carried across the Yellow River by ferry. An annual amount of only 600,000 tons of coal was ferried. Passengers would wait two or three hours to queue up for the ferry. The 1,300-meter bridge has not only put an end to the ferry between the two provinces across the Yellow River, but also links up with a national highway leading from Hohhot City in northern China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to Beihai City in south-west China's Guangxi Autonomous Region. Another big bridge now being built across the Yellow River in the triangle area is expected to improve the traffic conditions in the area after it is put into use this October. The three provinces have technological cooperation as well to promote their major industries. A total of one billion yuan has been invested in their industrial and agricultural projects. Three thermal power plants with a total annual generating capacity of six million kw have been set up in the provinces. Large plants for aluminium, synthetic ammonia, phosphate fertilizers and urea have been built as well. The provinces have also upgraded their low-yield land and land bordering the Yellow River. Over the past decade, the trade between the cities and counties in the triangle area has amounted to more than 300 million yuan. The gross product of the region now is twice the 1985 figure, and its general industry and agriculture product is 3.4 times the figure of 1985.
