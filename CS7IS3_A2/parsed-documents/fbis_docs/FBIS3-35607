Kazan Agrees To Nominate Its Candidates for Parliamentary Election"] [Text] Tatarstan leaders are ready to join in the election campaign to elect the Federal Assembly. KOMMERSANT-DAILY has learned that the collection of signatures to register President Mintimer Shaymiyev and Supreme Soviet Chairman Farid Mukhametshin as candidates in the elections for the Federation Council was launched yesterday in the republic. If this is so, the republic is in for a fierce struggle for seats at the Russian parliament between the bureaucrats and the democrats. Russian State Duma Deputy Ivan Grachev is intent on seizing one more chance by running for the Federation Council. This information has not been officially confirmed. According to local observers, the silence is attributable to the fact that the negotiating process between Kazan and Moscow, which was resumed in January, has not yet reached the stage of signing an interstate treaty and intergovernmental agreements. According to Tatarstan Prime Minister Mukhammat Sabirov, however, the republic's leaders expect the documents to be signed before 13 February -- the deadline for completing the registration of candidates. Once treaty protocols are approved in Moscow, the Tatarstan president and parliamentary speaker will definitely make an official announcement about their joining the election campaign for seats in the Federal Assembly's upper chamber. Then, observers note, one will be able to state with certainty that the federal elections will take place in the republic on 13 March and that State Duma seats in all five one- mandate districts will be fiercely contested by representatives of the local administration. Shaymiyev and Mukhametshin will apparently be elected to the Federation Council. The bureaucrats' main rivals in the struggle for deputy seats will be representatives of the "Equality and Rule-of-Law" electoral bloc, an association of Tatarstan's democratic forces. Yesterday's meeting of its leadership approved nine candidates whose election campaigns the bloc will support. Six of them already contested the 12 December elections and won more votes in their districts than any other candidates. Apparently, this gives "Equality and Rule-of-Law" a chance to compete with the republic's leaders for Russian parliamentary seats. Ivan Grachev, for the time being the only State Duma deputy from Tatarstan, elected on the "Yavlinskiy- Boldyrev-Lukin" ticket and the bloc's chairman, will run for the upper chamber. "We may lose to the nomenklatura, if more than 50 percent of the voters turn out in electoral wards. But this would not suit the republic's leadership, who keep saying that by ignoring Russian elections the people prove the correctness of a course chosen by Tatarstan," Grachev told KOMMERSANT-DAILY. Local politicians, however, note that the bloc's chances are diminishing because the democrats cannot put up a joint front in the elections. Despite a decision by the bloc's leaders, members of the Democratic Party of Russia's local branch and representatives of other democratic movements are going to join in the fray.
