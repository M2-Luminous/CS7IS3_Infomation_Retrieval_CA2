This they do after paying bribes to Togolese soldiers and other border officials. According to the reports, the men among the traders are arrested by the Togolese soldiers after they have entered Togo. A statement by the ministry said efforts by the Ghana Embassy in Togo to secure their release are being jeopardized by a steady stream of arrests. The ministry therefore advises all Ghanaians, particularly traders, not to put themselves at such unnecessary risks at this time when the Togolese side of the common border is closed.
