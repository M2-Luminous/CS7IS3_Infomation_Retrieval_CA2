FBIS4-27366 "dreas105_d_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-105 Daily Report 31 May 1994 South Korea IAEA on `Decisive Opportunity' To Take Samples IAEA on `Decisive Opportunity' To Take Samples SK3105120094 Seoul KBS-1 Radio Network in Korean 1000 GMT 31 May 94 SK3105120094 Seoul KBS-1 Radio Network Korean BFN [Text] If North Korea does not stop the work of replacing the fuel rods within two to three days, the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] made a final conclusion that the transparency of North Korea's nuclear issue cannot be verified. The IAEA plans to make an additional report on this to the UN Security Council [UNSC] sometime this weekend. Following is a report by Cha Man-sun from Vienna. [Begin Cha Man-sun recording] The IAEA believes that the statement on North Korea, which was urgently adopted at the UNSC today, will stimulate the resolution of the fuel rods issue, and anticipates a positive response from North Korea. However, if North Korea does not show a positive response in two to three days by immediately suspending the work to replace the fuel rods, a decisive opportunity to take samples will be lost. Currently, the work to replace the fuel rods is being carried out at a very quick pace with the presence of two inspectors, and it seems that over 4,000 of the 8,000 fuel rods will be replaced in two to three days. Therefore, if North Korea does not immediately implement the UNSC's demand, the IAEA will make a final decision saying that it has reached a stage in which it cannot verify the transparency of North Korea's nuclear issue, and then report this to the UNSC sometime this weekend to urge that additional measures on North Korea be taken. The two inspectors who are in Yongbyon reported that the work to replace the fuel rods has reached a limit in which it is difficult to take samples, and that if the work to replace the fuel rods was stopped, there would be no safety problem at all at the atomic reactor.
