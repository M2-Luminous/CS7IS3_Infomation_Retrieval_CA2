We will now talk to diplomat Omar Morales, member of the Cuban delegation, to learn details of this meeting. What are the meeting's objectives? What countries are participating? What topics have been discussed up to now? [Morales] The ACS's basic objectives are to further economic integration and operational cooperation. Those were the initial objectives but they have since been expanded because we have also talked about establishing commissions for foreign economic relations, trade, investments in the Caribbean region, and transportation. In our search for new cooperation mechanisms, the association's initial objectives expanded and now include the ones I mentioned initially, as well as the coordination of all the economic issues to which I have referred. The current meeting is being attended by the all the independent Caribbean countries [words indistinct] the 25 independent Caribbean countries and several dependent territories with the manifest absence of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. They are the only ones not attending the conference. Up to now, we have only discussed the organization's charter. We have discussed the text of the document or agreement that will legalize the ACS. On this issue, one of the topics that has prompted more attention is the participation of the dependent territories because there are big differences between all the dependent territories. Saint Martin and Montserrat are not the same, for example, as French Overseas Departments such as [word indistinct] and Guadeloupe. Each of them has very special characteristics, and we will have to reach specific participation formulas for each of them. Of course, their participation in the organization will be different from that of the independent countries. Today, we continue and expect to really get into the issue of the text of the charter. Yesterday's meeting ended with the presentation of the Caricom [Caribbean Common Market] program, and today we will start to debate the text itself. This is what we have done up to now. [Govin] In the past days, news agencies have reported that the topic of NAFTA, which, as we all know, was signed by the United States, Mexico, and Canada, is going to be debated in the Jamaica meeting. What can you tell us about this, taking into account that Mexico is a signatory of that pact and will also be a member of the future ACS? [Morales] No, this issue has not been mentioned up to now, and I don't think it will be included because the ACS is not being established to deal with the NAFTA issue. Furthermore, one of the principles included in the discussions on the association's constitution, is that the association has to work to further the integration of our countries. Once we have, for example, an integration organization for Latin American, Caribbean, [word indistinct], or however you want to call it, we will be in a more advantageous position and could then talk to other blocs or associations. The fact that Mexico, which has maintained a very constructive attitude at the meeting and is one of the countries that has enthusiastically furthered the establishment of the association, is in the [words indistinct] has no importance. There are many countries, such as Colombia, Venezuela, the Central Americans, Caricom itself, that are in the association and also participate in other integration mechanisms. The countries that already participate in integration mechanisms are not limited in any way because they will now participate in the ACS. [Govin] The official constitution of the ACS is scheduled to be held in Barbados next July. Could you briefly give us the organization's characteristics and its main objectives. [Morales] As I said before, the association's main objective is to further Latin American and Caribbean integration and an operative cooperation among our countries. Those are its main goals, and several commissions will also be created. We all want, despite the fact that it means a lot of hard work, to finish our job and officially establish the association in July. This obviously will require a very strong effort by all the member countries as July is only three and one-half months away and we are just starting to debate the charter. We, thus, have to hurry and work hard to be able to constitute the ACS in Barbados. It is anticipated that all the Caribbean heads of state will attend this event.
