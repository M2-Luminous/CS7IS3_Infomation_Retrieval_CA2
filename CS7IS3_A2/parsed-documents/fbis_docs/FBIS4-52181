In reply to a question from World Bank President Louis T. Preston in a meeting at the BAPPENAS office yesterday, Ginandjar said that privatization efforts in Indonesia need to be expanded in various sectors. The objective is not only greater efficiency but also to overcome the government's ever worsening shortages of development funds. According to Ginandjar, privatization has started in the electricity sector. In the future, privatization will be expanded to a number of other sectors including the communications (toll roads, railroads, and ports) and infrastructure sectors (telecommunications and drinking water). Ginandjar acknowledged that development funds will be more limited in the future. The private sector's role in infrastructural projects, therefore, will be expanded, particularly in East Indonesia. A matter more important than privatization is efficiency issue, Ginandjar continued. Efficiency can be achieved by promoting competition among private sector managers and companies as well as among state-owned enterprises. Ministers In his meeting with the World Bank president and his deputy, Gautam S. Kaji, BAPPENAS Chairman Ginandjar Kartasasmita was accompanied by ministers who handle development of infrastructure and human resources, namely Minister of Education and Culture Wardiman Djojonegoro; Minister of Tourism, Post, and Telecommunications Joop Ave; Minister of Communications Haryanto Dhanutirto; Minister of Public Works Radinal Moochtar; and Minister of Health Sujudi. Ginandjar told reporters that the meeting was absolutely not for discussion of the size of the loan to be given by the World Bank in the next fiscal year but was merely for a dialogue on the expansion of Indonesian development. According to Ginandjar, loan assistance from the World Bank for fiscal 1994-95 in the framework of the CGI will not be discussed until after the Indonesian Government has finished drafting its funding priorities for development projects for that fiscal year. Ginandjar said the Indonesian Government will continue to take advantage of opportunities for loan assistance from Bank Indonesia [as published] as well as from other international financial institutions. He denied that such loan assistance will reduce government efforts to achieve national self-sufficiency. "Self-sufficiency absolutely does not mean that we will then not want to accept loan assistance. If low-interest loan assistance is available, why should we not take advantage of it?" Ginandjar said to reporters. The World Bank provided loan assistance totaling $1.6 billion in the CGI framework in 1993-94.
