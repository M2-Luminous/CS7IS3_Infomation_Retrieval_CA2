We remind you that Mr. Hogg is visiting Kosova as part of his tour to several areas of former Yugoslavia. We go over to Skender Durmishi's report from Prishtina: [Durmishi] The start of a dialogue on Kosova is necessary and the first step to precede all measures and other actions toward solving the Kosova question, as one of the most important points of the crisis in the former Yugoslav area. We should keep looking for concrete forms and solutions -- this was the main message with which British Secretary of State Douglas Hogg arrived in Prishtina today. At today's talks, Hogg put forward this message to both sides. During the meeting with Kosova's president Rugova, the high-ranking British guest considered the visit as a gesture of good will and expressed his views on possible solutions to the Kosova problem. On this occasion, Rugova pointed out that the commitment of Kosova Albanians to a peaceful solution is a clear testimony of our readiness for dialogue through the mediation of a third party. Mr. Rugova said that on the basis of referendum results, we have our option for an independent and neutral Kosova, with which we can enter the process of dialogue with no prejudice. Considering today's meeting to be very important and after briefing the high-ranking guest about the grave situation in Kosova, president Rugova demanded more active commitment from the international community to a fair solution of Kosova's problems. In this respect, we hope that Great Britain, as an expert on the problems of Kosova and Albanians, will grant fresh assistance, Mr. Rugova said. As part of his visit to Kosova, Foreign Office Minister Douglas Hogg met today with representatives of the Serbian side, a meeting that was held behind closed doors. In two brief news conferences held after these meetings, recalling that he has not brought along any definitive project but is expressing his own opinions on possible solutions, Mr. Hogg told reporters that the Kosovar problem should be solved within the framework of Yugoslavia, because there can be no changes to borders. The fact that 90 percent of the Kosovar population are Albanians cannot be ignored and this requires that economic, political, and the maximal cultural autonomy be granted to the Albanians of Kosova. Conditions should be created for the Albanians to exert full control over topics of interest, such as the economy, education, communications, and their security, as well as having complete political and social freedoms. Mr. Hogg also pointed out the high level of disagreements and options between the Albanian and Serbian sides, which, he said, with the mediation of the international community, could be brought closer by means of an equal dialogue, because if both sides are not equal, this cannot be called a dialogue. Hogg stressed that the pressure on Serbia for the immediate return of the CSCE monitors to Kosova is another step for the international community, and should follow immediately. In the evening, Hogg held talks with several leaders of political parties and intellectuals in Kosova.
