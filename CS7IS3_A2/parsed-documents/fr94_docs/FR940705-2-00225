FR940705-2-00225 FR940705-2-00091 Appendix M&hyph;V&hyph;F. The RAC Chair will provide a report on all human gene transfer protocols that have been approved by NIH/ORDA at the next regularly scheduled RAC meeting. Appendix M&hyph;V&hyph;F&hyph;1. In accordance with Reporting Requirements (See Appendix M&hyph; IV), any adverse effects of the treatment should be reported immediately to the local Institutional Review Board, the NIH Office for Protection from Research Risks, and NIH/ORDA followed by the submission of a written report filed with each group. Reports submitted to NIH/ORDA shall be sent to the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National Institutes of Health, Building 31, Room 4B11, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 496&hyph;9838. Appendix M&hyph;V&hyph;F&hyph;2. In accordance with Reporting Requirements (see Appendix M&hyph; IV), reports regarding the general progress of patients should be filed with both the local Institutional Review Board and NIH/ORDA within six months of the commencement of the experiment and at six-month intervals thereafter. In the event of a patient's death, a summary of the special post-mortem studies and statement of the cause of death should be submitted to the Institutional Review Board and NIH/ORDA, if available. Appendix M&hyph;VI. Procedures to be Followed for Expedited Review of Single Patient Human Gene Transfer Experiments by NIH Director Under Section III&hyph;A&hyph;2 Requests for Expedited Review should be submitted to the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National Insitutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 496&hyph;9838. Appendix M&hyph;VI&hyph;A. A Principal Investigator submitting a request to the NIH/ORDA for Expedited Review of a single patient gene transfer protocol shall provide detailed information regarding the necessity of Expedited Review. Appendix M&hyph;VI&hyph;B. No protocol shall be considered without relevant Institutional Biosafety Committee and Institutional Review Board approvals. Appendix M&hyph;VI&hyph;C. At this time, all gene transfer protocols are considered experimental. Appendix M&hyph;VI&hyph;D. Regardless of the method of review, the Points to Consider is the standard of review for all gene transfer protocols. Appendix M&hyph;VI&hyph;E. Review of such protocols may include intramural NIH experts but must include extramural experts. Appendix M&hyph;VI&hyph;F. The reviewers shall consider similarity of the new protocol to previously approved protocols. Appendix M&hyph;VI&hyph;G. The NIH/ORDA shall report to the RAC following Expedited Review and include all of the materials on which the decision was based. The RAC shall formally review the protocol at its next scheduled meeting. Patient privacy shall be maintained. Appendix M&hyph;VI&hyph;H. Protocols that are deferred or not approved by the RAC in its normal review process are not eligible for Expedited Review. No protocol shall have more than one patient approved under Expedited Review. Appendix M&hyph;VI&hyph;I. As requested in the context of non-expedited review, none of the costs of the experimental protocol shall be borne by the patient or the patient's family. Appendix M&hyph;VI&hyph;J. Data on all patients undergoing gene transfer shall be provided to the RAC within six months of the procedure. Appendix M&hyph;VII. Footnotes of Appendix M Appendix M&hyph;VII&hyph;A. The Food and Drug Administration has jurisdiction over products intended for use in human gene transfer clinical trials. For general information on the Food and Drug Administration's policies and regulatory requirements, see the Federal Register , Volume 51, pages 23309&hyph;23313, 1986.
