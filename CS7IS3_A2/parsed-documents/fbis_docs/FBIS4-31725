Yesterday afternoon [Bosnian Serb leader Radovan] Karadzic's chetniks from their stronghold in Veliki Radic fired several howitzer shells at a funeral in Jezersko, and then continued shelling the other free parts of the Bosanska Krupa municipality. They have been shelling Buzim from the territory of the so-called Serbian autonomous region of Krajina, and all night and this morning they have been shelling the outskirts of Cazin, Krivaja, (Pljanici), [words indistinct], (Spahici), (Gornje Srbljane), and [word indistinct]. This is obvious proof of their collaboration with Abdic's traitorous phalanx, and yet another open aggression on Bosnia-Herzegovina, as they skillfully use Abdic as a smokescreen for their attacks. The Kladusa rebels and mercenaries have also continued with their bestial attacks along the entire front line. Their artillery and infantry attacks never ceased throughout the night, and have even intensified this morning. Another appeal has been sent to the international organizations to try and save the families that are being prosecuted in Velika Kladusa.
