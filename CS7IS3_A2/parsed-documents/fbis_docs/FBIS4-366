The meeting was to brief council members on the tragedy in which the president of the Republic of Burundi died. [passage omitted] The meeting participants studied steps to be taken immediately to maintain calm and peace in our country. The Council of Ministers first of all observed one minute's silence in memory of the distinguished man and his aides who died. Analyzing the facts, the Council of Ministers noted that the tragic event leading to the deaths of the Burundian head of state and some of his close aides was caused by an accident that occurred when the Rwandan presidential aircraft aboard which they were traveling exploded. That is why the members of the government once again urge the Burundian people to remain calm and ignore any rumor intended to divide them for purely political reasons. Similarly, the Council of Ministers urges all political and administrative officials to stand aside from party positions and motivated reporting in the face of the present sad event. This call is also addressed to the state and private media. As everyone knows, this tragedy has occurred unfortunately just when our country was beginning to emerge from its last crisis, which was brought about by the death of Melchior Ndadaye during the night of 20-21 October 1993. The work ethic was beginning to reassert itself and industry was reviving. In the light of this new tragedy and the resumption of a socioeconomic situation which has already been noted, the Council of Ministers deems it relevant to take the following steps: First: A period of national morning is declared from today, 7 April 1994, until the day of the funeral. Work will be suspended for three days; that is, Thursday, Friday and Saturday of the current week. Second: Flags will be flown at half-mast throughout the national territory and at our diplomatic missions abroad. Third: Suitable music and biographies of the distinguished people who died will be broadcast on Bujumbura Radio-Television Nationale du Burundi Radio. Fourth: Books of condolences will be opened. Fifth: Missions composed of the people's representatives and security force officials will proceed on working tours of the provinces to support local governments during these difficult times. Finally: The members of the government take this occasion to send sincere condolences to the wives of the distinguished figures who died and to the Rwandan Government and people. [Dated] 7 April 1994, Bujumbura.
