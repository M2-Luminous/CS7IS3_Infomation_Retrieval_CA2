FR941117-0-00144 FR941117-0-00011 Commercial Aviation Air-Ground Systems ยง22.857 Channel plan for commercial aviation air-ground systems. The 849&hyph;851 and 894&hyph;896 MHz frequency ranges are allocated for block assignment to nationwide air-ground systems providing radiotelephone service to passengers aboard commercial aircraft. These frequency ranges may also be used to provide service to persons in general aviation or other aircraft. Ground stations transmit on channels in the 849&hyph;851 MHz range. Airborne mobile stations transmit on channels in the 894&hyph;896 MHz range. Systems using these channels must conform to the channel plan described in this section. (a) Channel blocks. The spectrum allocated for commercial aviation air-ground systems is divided into ten channel blocks, numbered 1 through 10. All ground stations in each geographical area must use the same channel block for communication with airborne mobile stations in flight, in accordance with ยง22.859. (1) Each channel block is subdivided into 6 control channels labeled P&hyph;1 through P&hyph;6, and 29 communications channels labeled C&hyph;1 through C&hyph;29. (2) The authorized channel bandwidths are as follows: (i) Each control channel has a bandwidth of 3.2 kHz. (ii) Each communications channel has a bandwidth of 6 kHz. (b) The center frequencies (in MegaHertz) of the communications and control channels are listed in Tables G&hyph;1 and G&hyph;2 of this section.
