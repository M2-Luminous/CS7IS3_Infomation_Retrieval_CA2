At the invitation of the Georgian Health Ministry, they are to take part in a forensic examination of Zviad Gamsakhurdia's body. According to messages published in the press, members of the ex-president's family categorically rule out the possibility of carrying out a forensic examination, and set other categorical conditions. A SAKINFORM correspondent asked Head of State Eduard Shevardnadze to assess the current situation. He said: The will of God is involved in the birth of every person. Therefore, anybody's departure from this world is a regrettable event. This also applies to ex-Georgian president Gamsakhurdia. One should not talk now about who is to blame for the disasters that have befallen the country. As for the decision on the place of burial, this is an exclusive privilege of the family. The burial can take place in Groznyy, as demanded by the family. The Georgian authorities regard the request to carry out an international forensic examination as completely lawful, despite the fact that the ex-president's family opposes this. Of course, this can only happen after the place where the deceased was buried is revealed. I think that any sensible person would agree, Eduard Shevardnadze pointed out, if I say that the cause of Zviad Gamsakhurdia's death should not be wrapped in mystery and people should know the truth. This is why it is necessary to carry out an examination. A group is working at the Georgian Cabinet of Ministers which is entrusted with reaching agreement on these issues with Zviad Gamsakhurdia's wife.
