Twelve thousand people have fled from villages in Sirnak and Hakkari in the past two months, causing the Iraqis to take tight security measures at the border with Turkey. The refugees, who first started to move into Iraq in February, claim that their villages were burned down by Government security forces and that they had been put under intense pressure to leave. Observers from various organizations formed a delegation, under the auspices of the privately run Turkish Human rights Association, to visit and talk with the refugees who are in seven different camps, 15 kilometers inside the Iraqi border. The observer's report will be sent to the United Nations Commission of Human Rights, the Red Cross and other international groups. After examining the camps, delegation chairman Akin Birdal said "the picture I saw hurt my conscience" and added that six more villages had been evacuated and burned by Government security forces. He also told reporters that the villagers who wanted to leave the Turkish side were hindered by the security forces. Chairman Birdal called for help with the refugee problem which he also discussed with the UN Zakho representative Ayman Garibeh and the governor of Dahuk, 'Abd-al-Aziz al-Tayyib. "The condition of the refugees is not very good, our medical teams visit the camps twice a week and we give them food provided by the World Food Fund. We have solved the refugees' water and sanitation problems. During our health inspections we found 20 cases of malaria and treated them," declared UN Zakho representative Ayman Garibeh in a statement. Ayman answered a question regarding the granting of political status to the refugees and said. "We are only concerned with providing humanitarian aid, our centers in Ankara and Geneva are currently busy with this issue and they will decide on this but anyone who crosses the border is considered a refugee and they are not forced to return," and added that the UN is trying to solve this problem. The governor of Dahuk said that the refugees fleeing from the Turkish side are causing them problems since the United Nations had demanded that the camps should be established on government land and that refugees should be provided with pasture areas for their animals. He continued, ``the refugees have put us in a difficult situation. The migration started one year ago with a trickle of people and it was very easy for us to find them a place to settle but lately the numbers have increased dramatically and with our limited resources we are not able provide adequate help. ``Housing in the cities is a big problem since four thousand villages were destroyed in the Gulf war and we settled them into cities.'' He also said that they were sharing the food aid they received with the refugees. The Human Rights delegation reported that 12 thousand refugees lived in Hizava, Tilkabar, Dorka, Foraq, Zakho, Buhery and Sharanish camps. [place names as published] According to the report living conditions in the camps are not good. After the three day visit to the camps, Akin Birdal gave a statement to the Human Rights Association in Diyarbakir and said "The aid given to the refugees is not adequate and every one of us is responsible. We call on everyone to help. These people cannot survive the winter and most of them want to return to their home country but democratic regulations are necessary."
