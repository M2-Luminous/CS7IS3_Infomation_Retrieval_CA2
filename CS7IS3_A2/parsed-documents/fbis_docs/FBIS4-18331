This lecture should be followed in the coming weeks by a series of private lessons destined to examine with a fine-tooth comb each program included in the military programming law for 1995-2000. There were a dozen people around the table, representing the major contractors and the professional unions: Louis Gallois (Aerospatiale), Serge Dassault (Dassault Aviation and GIFAS [Associaton of French Aerospace Manufacturers]; Alain Gomez (Thomson-CSF), Noel Forgeard (Matra Defense), Jean-Francois Bigay (Eurocopter), Emile Blanc (SNPE [National Powders and Explosives Company] and GIAT [Industrial Group for Ground Weapons] Industrie; Jean Climaud (SPER [Professional Association of Electronic and Radioelectric Industries]); Jean-Claude Albrecht (Giat Industries), Herve Cheneau (Directorate of Naval Constructions), and Herve Ardity (of the Richelieu Committee of small- and mid-sized companies). [passage omitted] The industrial representatives yesterday were all given the opportunity to air their views on the subject and to explain their working methods. They agreed that a decree should be passed obliging them to work together to a greater extent , to avoid overlap, and therefore that they should work more closely with the military chiefs of staff. Most of them reiterated the need for orders covering several years at a time. For his part, the general arms delegate asked the primary contractors to avoid taking responsibility away from their subcontractors or imposing cost cutting on them, in order to preserve the fabric of small- and medium-sized companies. The discussion, started yesterday by the Defense Ministry, will continue at a swift pace and should result in the unveiling of a number of measures by the summer. In the meantime, unless there is a last-minute change of plan, the military programming law should be submitted to the president of the Republic at next week's Defense Council meeting, before being put before the cabinet on 20 April and presented for parliamentary debate at the end of May.
