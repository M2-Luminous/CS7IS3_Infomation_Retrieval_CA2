Foreign Affairs Minister Pik Botha appealed to moderates within the Bophuthatswana cabinet to reconsider a decision not to participate in the election. He expressed concern that the continuing strikes in the territory could spill over into South Africa and said the government would insist on free political activity in Bophuthatswana. Mr. Popo Molefe of the ANC [African National Congress] said his party would insist that budget allocations to Bophuthatswana be halted. He said the ANC would also support the intensification of mass action in support of free political activity. Meanwhile, reacting to the furor caused by his cabinet's decision, President Mangope has said that he is prepared to die for the independence of Bophuthatswana if necessary. He said neither the Transitional Electoral Council [as heard] nor the Independent Electoral Commission would be allowed to operate in Bophuthatswana unless the government decided to register for the election. However, President Mangope expressed optimism that mediation could lead to agreement to parties before the election. [sentence as heard] He said it was now up to the Bophuthatswana parliament to decide whether the state would participate in the election.
