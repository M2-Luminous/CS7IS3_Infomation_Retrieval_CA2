ACTION: Notice; extension of comment period. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is extending to September 6, 1994, the comment period for a notice that announced the availability of the document entitled ``Preamendments Class III Devices; Strategy Document; Availability'' that appeared in the Federal Register of May 6, 1994. The document sets forth the agency's strategy for implementing the provisions of the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 (the SMDA) which require FDA to review the classification of certain class III (premarket approval) devices, and either reclassify the devices into class I (general controls) or class II (special controls) or retain them in class III. The statute also requires FDA to establish a schedule for requiring the submission of premarket approval applications (PMA's) for those devices retained in class III. DATES: Written comments by September 6, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit written comments to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Joseph M. Sheehan, Center for Devices and Radiological Health (HFZ&hyph;84), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, 301&hyph;594&hyph;4765, ext 157. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of May 6, 1994 (59 FR 23731), FDA announced the availability of a document that sets forth the agency's strategy for implementing the provisions of the SMDA which require FDA to review the classification of certain class III (premarket approval) devices, and either reclassify the devices into class I (general controls) or class II (special controls) or retain them in class III. The statute also requires FDA to establish a schedule for requiring the submission of PMA's for those devices retained in class III. Interested persons were invited to comment by August 4, 1994. FDA received one request for an extension of the comment period for 30 days. The request stated that extension was necessary to provide interested persons sufficient time to review all of the devices listed in the document. FDA finds under section 520(d) (21 U.S.C. 360j(d)) that there is good cause for granting a 30-day extension to provide sufficient time for review and comments. Accordingly, the comment period is extended to September 6, 1994. Interested persons may, on or before September 6, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above), written comments regarding this notice. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Dated: July 25, 1994. Michael R. Taylor, Deputy Commissioner for Policy.
