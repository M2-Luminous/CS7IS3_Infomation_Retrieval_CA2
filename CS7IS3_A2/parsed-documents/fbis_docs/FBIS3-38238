The Munich-based Eurofighter consortium said no date had been fixed for the flight, which was postponed last autumn because of difficulties with the jet's computerised flight-control system. But the aircraft was in its "last test phase." The first prototype of the twin-engine Eurofighter 2000 being developed jointly by Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain, is due for trials at Manching in Germany in the next few weeks. An initial private flight is expected at Manching in March or April before it appears in public. Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence procurement minister, has told the Commons that the fighter might be on display at September's Farnborough air show. Although the industry consortium has played down the importance of the first flight in the overall development programme, senior managers are extremely anxious to avoid further delay, fearing it could undermine political support for the Eurofighter and jeopardise production prospects. British Aerospace, the principal UK partner, has meanwhile agreed to take joint responsibility for the flight-control system with Deutsche Aerospace, which has headed this part of the project. The new arrangement is designed to make the two directly answerable to the partner governments and put pressure on them and their sub-contractors -- notably GEC-Marconi which is supplying the crucial software -- to meet their contract dates. The partners decided to hold further tests on the system after crashes of both the Swedish Gripen and the U.S. F-22, which also depend on sophisticated flight-control technology. The consortium is still in talks with government representatives over a new contract price for the roughly 10 billion pound development programme. This follows changes to the programme agreed in late 1992 which were designed to reduce the eventual production cost. The companies are seeking price increases to reflect the longer development period now planned. On the other hand the governments hold the consortium responsible for delays caused by technical hitches. The Ministry of Defence would have to seek Treasury approval for any increase in Britain's share of the cost.
