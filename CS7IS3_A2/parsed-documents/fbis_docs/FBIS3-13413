In lay terms, this decree "puts them outside the law;" in legal terms, it means the government has made membership in any of these organizations a criminal act; from the public and political point of view, it puts them on a par with Palestinian terrorist organizations. No democratic state hastens to outlaw a collective entity. Each and every article of the penal code treats people as individuals and not as members of an organized body; liberals have qualms about acting as oppressors. Kahanists may now argue that the Israeli Government has betrayed its own principles. After all, existing legislation does not prevent bringing members of these outlawed organizations to trial and their being treated with utmost severity if the prosecution can prove that they broke the law. The penal code does not punish views, but there are situations in which even a democratic state must outlaw organizations. In 1948, the Provisional Council of State [PCS] issued the Antiterror Act in response to the assassination of UN mediator Folke Bernadotte. Based on the Law and Administrative Ordinance, laws enacted by the PCS were called "acts" to highlight the fact that the legislative body was a provisional entity created in the aftermath of a revolutionary feat (the declaration of the state upon the conclusion of the British mandate). The PCS decided to create the legal tools with which it hoped to get rid of the Stern Gang, from whose ranks the assassin came, because it was feared that the group would generate more assassins whose crimes might have seriously harmed the state. The government's actions yesterday followed the line of the 1948 events. Barukh Goldstein was a Kahanist. So, who is to tell that other assassins will not emerge from the same environment? Hence, qualms notwithstanding, preventing any type of organized activities by people who might infer practical conclusions from their political views (similar to the conclusion reached by the assassin at the Cave of the Patriarchs) is right. One of these people, Barukh Marzel, has already announced that he and his friends will go underground and continue doing as they please. There is no certainty that the security forces will succeed in preventing other manifestations of anti-Arab violence, which could be perpetrated by people who have never been members of any Kahanist organization. Even if the effectiveness of outlawing Kakh and Kahana Hay is doubtful, one cannot dismiss the value of the warning issued by the government yesterday. In his address to the Knesset, Yitzhaq Rabin drew a distinction between Barukh Goldstein and his supporters and the Jewish public at large. The outlawing of these organizations is meant to warn people against joining or supporting them, as the government trusts the psychological impact of its decision. Nevertheless, it would be wrong for Rabin and other cabinet ministers to think that they completed their job with this anti-Kahanist move. In addition, they must remove the Jews from Hebron, and they cannot make do with relocating them to Qiryat Arba'. The massacre in the Cave of the Patriarchs also tainted Gush Emunim and the entire settler community. Ostracizing Kakh and Kahana Hay and getting rid of the Jewish presence in Hebron are not enough to restart the peace process.
