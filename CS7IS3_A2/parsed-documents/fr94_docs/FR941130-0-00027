FR941130-0-00027 FR941130-0-00003 The terms ``materially deficient'' and ``consistently undervalued'' as used in the regulation are heavily dependent upon the facts and circumstances of each transaction or group of transactions. Because there is no ``bright-line'' test that can be applied to these terms, the OTS does not believe that it would be useful to further define these terms. With respect to the comment that the converting association should not be penalized for a materially deficient or substantially incomplete appraisal and the comment that the converting association should be given the opportunity to correct the faulty appraisal, the OTS does not believe that any change to the interim final rule is warranted. While management of a converting association may properly rely on the opinion of an independent appraiser in valuing conversion stock, it is ultimately the fiduciary responsibility of management to ensure that the converting association is properly priced for sale. The converting association also is ultimately responsible for the quality of the work of all of its agents, including its attorneys, accountants and selling agent, as well as its appraiser, and thus, should exercise due care in the hiring of such parties to ensure that qualified advisors and experts have been retained on behalf of the association. In any instance where a materially deficient conversion application is submitted, whether as a result of significant legal, accounting, appraisal or other deficiencies, the OTS retains the right to deem the application materially deficient and reject it. As to the issue of permitting ``corrections'' to inadequate appraisals submitted to the OTS, the purpose of rejecting conversion applications containing faulty appraisals is to encourage applicants to file applications that are substantially complete and that comply with regulatory requirements. If there are no consequences of filing an application that is substantially incomplete, there is less incentive to submit an adequate appraisal. In addition, given limited OTS staff resources, it is unfair to delay review of complete conversion applications with adequate appraisals by devoting inordinate amounts of OTS staff time to multiple reviews of applications with inadequate appraisals. The OTS believes that there is an appropriate role for officers of a converting association in the preparation of an appraisal. The OTS expects that the appraiser will consult with officers of the association in preparing the appraisal because the officers will often be the sole source of information about certain aspects of the current and future business operations of the association. It is not appropriate, however, for the officers to attempt to influence or to interfere with the independence of the appraiser. Similarly, appraisers seeking engagement with a converting institution should not in any manner suggest that they can provide a ``lower'' valuation than other appraisers. The board of directors has a primary responsibility to hire the appraiser and to review the appraisal report. The board of directors is entitled to rely on the appraiser's expertise. As with officers, it would be inappropriate for the board of directors to influence or interfere with the independence of the appraiser. The board of directors also retains the authority to reject an appraisal or to dismiss an appraiser. In such a case, the OTS would conduct the same type of review that it does when a savings association dismisses its accounting firm or rejects an accounting firm's opinion. 7 7 17 CFR 229.304 (March 8, 1989). The interim final rule requested comment on whether appraisers or their affiliates should be prohibited from also serving as underwriters or selling agents in a conversion. A majority, albeit a narrow one, of those who commented on this aspect of the interim final rule were in favor of a prohibition on firms serving in both roles. Upon review of the comments, the OTS has determined that, as discussed in the interim final rule, the appraisal process and the independence of the appraiser should not be tainted by even the appearance of a conflict of interest. Although the same firm infrequently performs both these services and the OTS is not aware of any serious problems when it has, the final rule generally prohibits a firm from this dual service, except where procedures are followed and representations made to ensure that an appraiser is separate from the underwriter or selling agent affiliate and the underwriter or selling agent affiliate does not make recommendations or in any way impact the appraisal. Additionally, the final rule prohibits the appraiser from receiving any fees other than the fees for services rendered in connection with the appraisal.
