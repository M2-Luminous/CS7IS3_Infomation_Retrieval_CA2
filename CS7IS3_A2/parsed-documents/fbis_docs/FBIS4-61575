Yeltsin's visit, is causing increasing tension due to a planned send-off scenario, which is supposedly humiliating to veterans and to all Russians, is seen differently in official circles. We learned from the Russian Foreign Ministry that while this scenario was being formulated, there were no differences in the sides' approaches. An understanding was reached between B. Yeltsin and H. Kohl that the send-off for the Russian troops would be organized no less ceremonially than the send-off for the three Western countries' troops. The president repeatedly drew to the chancellor's attention the extent to which this episode impinges on the feelings of Russians, especially veterans. Calls to demand from the German side a joint withdrawal of the former allied troops are unfounded. Under the four-power agreement, our troops are supposed to be withdrawn by 31 August, and the three Western countries' troops by a later date. For this reason, it is neither legally nor ethically valid to insist on a change in this scenario, the Foreign Ministry believes. As for B. Yeltsin's upcoming talks with H. Kohl, certain details of the send-off will be clarified there. The culmination of the ceremonies will be in the presence of the German and Russian leaders in Weimar and Berlin. Nobody disputes these proposals.
