This final rule does not make changes to the interim rule that are significant in this context. Accordingly, the initial finding of no significant impact remains applicable, and is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the office of the Rules Docket Clerk at the above address. Executive Order 12866 This rule was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review.

Executive Order 12616, Federalism The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12616, Federalism, has determined that the policies contained in this regulation do not have significant federalism implications and, thus, are not subject to review under the Order. Issuance of the regulation does not change existing Federal, State or local governmental relationships, except that, under the statute, compliance with the disclosure provisions of this rule will preempt State law requirements dealing with identical subject matter. Given the lack of discretion pertaining to the preemption issue by the statute, further analysis of the federalism implications of the rule would serve no purpose.
