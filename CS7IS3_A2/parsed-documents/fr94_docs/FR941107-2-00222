FR941107-2-00222 FR941107-2-00112 Handwashing and Gloving Handwashing is frequently called the single most important measure for preventing spread of infection. The scientific rationale, indications, methods, and products for handwashing have been delineated in other publications. 64-71 Washing hands as promptly and thoroughly as possible between patient contacts and after contact with blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions, and equipment or articles contaminated by them is an important component of infection control and isolation precautions. In addition to handwashing, gloves play an important role in the prevention of the spread of infection. Gloves are worn for three important reasons in hospitals. First, gloves are worn to provide a protective barrier and prevent gross contamination of the hands when touching blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions, mucous membranes, and nonintact skin; 27-29 the wearing of gloves in specified circumstances to reduce the risk of exposures to bloodborne pathogens is mandated by the OSHA bloodborne pathogens final rule. 51 Second, gloves are worn to reduce the likelihood that microorganisms present on the hands of personnel will be transmitted to patients during invasive or other patient-care procedures that involve touching a patient's mucous membranes and nonintact skin. Third, gloves are worn to reduce the likelihood that hands of personnel contaminated with microorganisms from a patient or a fomite can transmit these microorganisms to another patient; in this situation, gloves must be changed between patient contacts and hands washed after gloves are removed. Wearing gloves does not replace the need for handwashing because (1) gloves may have small inapparent defects or be torn during use, and (2) hands can become contaminated during removal of gloves. 14-15,39,72-75 Failure to change gloves between patient contacts is an infection control hazard. 32 Patient Placement Appropriate patient placement is an important component of isolation precautions. When possible, patients with highly transmissible or epidemiologically important microorganisms are placed in a private room with handwashing and toilet facilities to reduce opportunities for transmission of microorganisms. A private room is also important to prevent direct- or indirect-contact transmission when the source patient has poor hygienic habits, contaminates the environment, or cannot be expected to assist in maintaining infection control precautions to limit transmission of microorganisms (i.e., infants, children, and patients with altered mental status). When a private room is not available, infected patients are placed with appropriate roommates. Patients infected by the same microorganism can usually share a room provided (1) they are not infected with other potentially transmissible microorganisms, and (2) the likelihood of reinfection with the same organism is minimal. Such sharing of rooms, also referred to as cohorting patients, is especially useful during outbreaks or when there is a shortage of private rooms. When a private room is not available and cohorting is not achievable or recommended, 23 it is very important to consider the epidemiology and mode of transmission of the infecting pathogen and the patient population being served in determining patient placement. Under these circumstances, consultation with infection control professionals is advised before patient placement. Moreover, when an infected patient shares a room with a noninfected patient, it is also important that patients, personnel, and visitors take precautions to prevent the spread of infection and that roommates are carefully selected. Guidelines for construction, equipment, air handling, and ventilation for isolation rooms have been delineated in other publications. 76-78 A private room with appropriate air handling and ventilation is particularly important for reducing the risk of transmission of microorganisms from a source patient to susceptible patients and other persons in hospitals when the microorganism is spread by airborne transmission. Some hospitals use an isolation room with an anteroom as an extra measure of precaution to prevent airborne transmission. Adequate data regarding the need for anterooms, however, is not available. Ventilation recommendations for isolation rooms housing patients with pulmonary tuberculosis have been delineated in other CDC guidelines. 23 Transport of Infected Patients
