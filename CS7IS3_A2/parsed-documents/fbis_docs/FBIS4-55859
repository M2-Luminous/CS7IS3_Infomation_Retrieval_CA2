President Tudjman spoke about the work of Don Mihovil Pavlinovic and the current situation in Croatia. [Begin Tudjman recording] [passage omitted on details of Pavlinovic's life] If it were not for the greatness -- both intellectual and political -- of men such as Mihovil Pavlinovic we would not have Croatia as it is today. His ideas, similar to those of Ante Starcevic [19th century Croatian intellectual], were the foundation for the thoughts of later cultural and political players in Croatia, and we have used his ideas today as the basis for the movement for the creation of the independent and sovereign Croatian state. They have enabled us to conduct Croatian state policy, as we have done, on all issues, including the Serb problem in Croatia, the general south Slav problem, and especially policy toward Bosnia-Herzegovina. [end recording] [announcer's remarks indistinct] [Begin Tudjman recording] We have proved to the world that we are in favor of a peaceful solution. The world has seen that Croatia is a peace-loving country, but also a resolute country. Consequently, if we have to, if our efforts to normalize relations by peaceful means and gradually to introduce the constitutional and legal system into the occupied territories fail, the world will have to understand that Croatia has used up all possibilities and that it can no longer support a situation in which more than 250,000 Croatian people, refugees live outside their homes, even if those homes are destroyed and ruined. We will build new ones, we will build everything all the way to Vukovar and Baranja [words indistinct] [applause] [end recording] [Announcer] Croats from Australia, Canada, America, and Europe are coming back home. The unity and reconciliation of all Croats here and in the diaspora have been achieved. Despite the war we have managed to conduct a stable economic policy, and it is thanks to this that we will manage to introduce our money, the Kuna, on Statehood Day. The president said that economic experts have recognized our achievements: [Begin Tudjman recording] You have achieved this despite the consequences of the war and without a single dollar or mark in foreign loans. You have achieved this because you knew what you wanted both in the political and economic spheres. Croatia had a leadership that knew what it wanted, that led its people, and gained the people's trust. [passage indistinct] Let us be worthy of Mihovil Pavlinovic and other great men of Croatia, and of all Croatian victims who have laid their lives on the altar of the homeland. Let us be worthy of everything we have achieved in the past four years, worthy of the achievements the world has recognized and admires. The world is ready to lend assistance to our stable Croatia. As a democratic and stable country, we needed allies in the world, but, I assure you, the world also needs this stable Croatia as a factor of peace and democracy, as one of the important players in the creation of the new international order in this part of southeastern Europe. Dear brothers and sisters, men and women of Croatia [words indistinct] Croatian navy, and the Croatian armed forces. I am convinced that the Croatian people will know how to complete their historic task, that they will strengthen their sovereignty and know how to build the Croatian homeland into a country of well-being and progress for all people of Croatia, a homeland which Croats in the diaspora, throughout the world, will come back to, because today they can be proud of being the sons of the Croatian people and of a democratic Croatia. Long live Croatia! [end recording] [passage omitted]
