They make particularly frequent references to ``Russian experts,'' officials of the Russian Ministry of Defense, and some Russian politicians. Ukraine's minister of defense made a tour of units and facilities of strategic rocket troops deployed on the territory of Ukraine and visited temporary storage facilities for nuclear warheads detached from those missiles that have been taken off combat duty for an objective evaluation of their condition. During the trip, Ukraine's Army General Vitaliy Radetskyy and officials in charge of the condition of nuclear weapons made statements for the press. Lieutenant General Volodymyr Mykhtyuk, commander of the 43d Rocket Army of Strategic Rocket Troops: ``Problems involving maintenance do exist. This is perfectly understandable. However, there is no need to lay it on thick. The situation at nuclear facilities is fully under control. We have all the necessary means for this. Any attempts at drawing parallels with Chernobyl or something similar are absolutely groundless.'' Lieutenant General Valeriy Vasylyev, commander of the Ukrainian Air Force: ``The strategic aviation within the Ukrainian Air Force is equipped with nuclear munitions. They are presently reliably stored. Even though our aviators also have numerous problems, there cannot even be talk about a critical situation. Such assertions do not correspond to reality.'' Army General Vitaliy Radetskyy, Ukraine's minister of defense: ``On the instructions of the president and in accordance with a special program, we, together with military specialists and scientists, visited all the facilities where nuclear weapons are stored. Our main task was to obtain objective information on the operational status of nuclear warheads and assess the quality of their maintenance and storage. We particularly wanted to find out what additional measures need to be taken locally with regard to such important issues as the security and defense of the facilities and protection from fire and detonation.'' ``Of course, we have enough problems. Particularly so on the eve of negotiations on these issues with the Russian side. In the very near future, we plan a meeting with the Russian Federation's defense minister [Pavel Grachev]. A whole package of documents have been elaborated and will be discussed. It is important that both we and Russia show a willingness to constructively resolve all problems that are emerging.'' ``Therefore, one should not overdramatize the situation, as some journalists and politicians have done. The situation at the missile facilities is satisfactory. We are taking additional measures to reinforce security, maintain normal conditions for storing nuclear warheads, and provide units and subunits of strategic troops with everything necessary.''
