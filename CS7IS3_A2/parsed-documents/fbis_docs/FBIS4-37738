The financiers say that the PLO has failed to establish the institutions required for administering the funds. Palestinians, on the other hand, maintain that the funds are being used to put pressure on them. What is the truth? ['Abbas] The Palestinian authorities have to return as quickly as possible. That will be the touchstone for the financiers. Once we are in the Gaza Strip and in Jericho, we will be able to say: Here are our institutions, now, please give us the money you promised. We will not give them any pretext for blocking the money. [Abied] The experiences of the past few months have not been very encouraging. The talks between the Israelis and the Palestinians were delayed. ['Abbas] Both sides have wasted a lot of time. Now the Palestinian authorities must quickly assume their tasks and tackle the enormous economic and social problems. And we should not forget that there are further negotiations to be held with Israel on the handing over of authorities and the return of refugees. [Abied] Why do you not want to take part in the autonomy administration? Are you annoyed? ['Abbas] The fact that I was successful in the Oslo talks does not mean that I have to assume part of the power in the autonomous regions. The construction of the Palestinian regions needs young, qualified people. I do not think that I am suitable for a ministerial office. [Abied] Does this mean that the existing `revolutionary' institutions of the PLO and the 'revolutionaries' they contain are not in a position to cope with the future stages? ['Abbas] I doubt whether they are up to the complicated challenges. For establishing a school, constructing roads, or working out a development plan we need experts that have a different mentality. It is not shameful for a revolutionary to admit that he cannot build a state. [Abied] Do the other Palestinian leaders share this view? ['Abbas] Many of my comrades-in-arms have refused to participate in the new Palestinian authorities because they hold similar views. And several of the new "ministers" have been quite reluctant to accept their nomination. [Abied] You said that there will be a Palestinian state within two years. What makes you so optimistic? ['Abbas] Until the secret talks were held in Oslo it was taboo for the Israelis to negotiate with the PLO. For them we were terrorists. Today there are lively contacts between the two sides, and there is increasing support in the Israeli society for the idea of a Palestinian state. For the Israelis, the most important thing is their security. That is why much will depend on the capability of the Palestinian authorities to safeguard this. If the Israelis get the feeling that a Palestinian state does not threaten them, they will accept it. [Abied] Is this not prevented by the Palestinian opposition, especially the Islamic Hamas? ['Abbas] There are two oppositions. The Syria-based `Alliance of the Ten Organizations' and the opposition in the occupied territories. The first makes a lot of noise, but it does not have any influence. The latter is pragmatic. We have told them: Why should we destroy the possibility of self-rule with our own hands? In a few months' time there will be elections in the autonomous regions. If the majority of Palestinians speak out against the forces of peace and in favor of those who want to continue the struggle, then we will respect this decision.
