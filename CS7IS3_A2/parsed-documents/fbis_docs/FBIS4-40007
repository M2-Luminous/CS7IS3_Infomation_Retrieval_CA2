Six leaders of the Lvov branch, including SPU Oblast Committee Chairman Ivan Lutsuk, SPU City Committee Chairman Yevhen Talipov, and Oleksandr Pokrovskyy, member of the SPU Political Council, were present. These names are not well-known to the general public, however, to a great extent, their viewpoints reflect the position of the party. It is natural that the interview began with a question as to how the SPU views the current political situation in our state. [Talipov] The fact that Chairman of the Political Council O. Moroz became Supreme Council chairman is positive. He is not a political novice. I do not think that Ukraine will lose while he is in office. He has profound experience and a desire to work. I believe that he will become a consolidating factor and will not be affected by political affinities. [Statsyshyn] Do you believe that Moroz will manage to unite the leftist and right forces? [Talipov] If he is unable to do this, we were wrong and should not have placed our stakes on him. He has every opportunity and all the strength to unite the legislature. The key issue is the independence of Ukraine, the welfare of the population, and adhering to promises which we gave to our people. [Statsyshyn] Some SPU deputies see their primary mission as "restoring what has been ruined by the democratic administration." What do you mean by this? [Talipov] Our position is clear and evident. Each Supreme Council deputy -- before he was elected a deputy -- provided a program which promised welfare and more active battles for the independence of Ukraine, democracy, and social progress. The previous legislature did not fulfill any of their promises -- virtually nothing was implemented, only streets were renamed, symbols changed, "wild" capitalism was imposed on us and, in addition, they resigned early. Therefore, people said "no" to them. Currently, new people -- able to rebuild Ukraine -- will come to power. However, reconstruction does not mean the destruction of everything which existed before. The previous legislature adopted some 300 legislative acts. Should we repeal them? The key task is to continue reviving Ukraine. [Statsyshyn] What priorities were discusses at the SPU plenum? [Pokrovskyy] I participated in the work of the plenum. The democratic administration ruined some things and we should restore them. They completely ruined the economy over the past four years. Dozens of enterprises do not work, employment and prices have grown considerably. Therefore, I believe, that the key task is to restore the economy. The principle aim is to stabilize prices, restore a stable national currency, liquidate profiteering, and restore the volume of production. We discussed this at the plenum. The point is that it is necessary to stabilize the political system in Ukraine, to unite the efforts of all political parties, trade union movements, and working collectives to resolve economic issues. To consolidate society, the Political Council adopted a decision to suspend the activities of O. Moroz as chairman of the SPU. His obligations were transferred to People's Deputy Serhiy Kyyashka. [Statsyshyn] Are the fears of Ukraine losing its independence under socialist rule founded? [Talipov] The one who says these words has not read any of the SPU documents. You will not find anything you are speaking about in our program. The West does not welcome us, we wish to restore the relations which have been ruined. Those people -- the ones who did this -- are now wealthy. However, working collectives and working people suffer. Therefore, we will never tell people such nonsense. Why was Oleksandr Oleksandrovych supported in the legislature? Because he did everything to revive Ukraine. In the true sense of the word. [Statsyshyn] You said that Moroz's task was to unite all of the political forces. How will you explain that neither Kostenka nor Durdynets -- who were proposed by other legislative factions -- were elected deputy chairmen? How will Moroz find common language with, let us say, Chornovol or Khmara? Do you think that they want to unite with you? [Lutsuk] What is the basis for consolidating political forces? The concept of independence. This is one of the postulates of the SPU program. Do Chornovol or Khmara oppose independence? Ukraine has huge economic potential. Therefore, we support a wealthy Ukraine. Do Chornovol or Khmara oppose this? Therefore, I believe that we will be able to find common language with both Chornovol and Khmara. [Talipov] By the way, according to Ivan Makar, O. Moroz is the smartest Supreme Council deputy. The Supreme Council chairman is a person around whom all parties and movements should unite. He should not adopt someone's platform, such as our esteemed President Kravchuk did. Either he consolidates with Rukh or he goes to the people, or he goes somewhere else; in a word, he has no established position. The Ukraine of today is neither communist, nor socialist, nor belonging to Rukh, nor to anyone else. We have a multiparty system and the people will decide for themselves who they will follow. The fact that the bloc of leftist forces won in the election demonstrates that the people's eyes have been opened and esteemed deputies should respect their opinion. There are still such people who believe that the "Rukh is our navigator."
