It has emerged that some Russian parliamentarians link the normalization of Georgian-Russian interstate relations to the settlement of the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict. Owing to this, they, together with Abkhaz separatists, went as far as demanding that President Boris Yeltsin's offical visit to Tbilisi should have been canceled. The historic visit did go ahead and a package of interstate agreements was signed, which answers the (?vital strategic) interests of our peoples. As if to avenge the frustration of their plans, Abkhaz separatists, actively supported by North Caucasian militants and other mercenaries from the Russian Federation, launched a new punitive action against the Georgian population still remaining in Gali rayon, in effect, completing the ethnic cleansing and genocide of the Georgians in Abkhazia. All this is happening at a time when, according to the Geneva accords, a stage-by-stage return of the refugees and displaced persons to Abkhazia was due to start on 10 February, while on 8 February, a Georgian delegation, as part of a joint group of experts, began talks in Moscow on Abkhazia's future status. We call on you, says the appeal, to go deep in understanding the essence of the tragedy unfolding in Georgia, to assess in time the threat posed by aggressive separatism not only to our country but also to all multi-ethnic states, to take necessary measures, so that the Russian Federation can perform the function of guarantor and mediator in the peaceful settlement of the conflict, to ensure the inviolability of the state border between Russia and Georgia and prevent armed formations from crossing it from Russian territory into Georgia. We also call on you to start an interparliamentary dialogue, since our supreme legislative bodies have the responsibility for choosing the right political course aimed at saving our peoples from the horrors of fratricidal war, destruction and chaos.
