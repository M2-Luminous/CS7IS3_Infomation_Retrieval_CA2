FR940719-0-00066 FR940719-0-00022 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 675 [Docket No. 931100&hyph;4043; I.D. 051694B] Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Closure. SUMMARY: NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for Pacific cod by vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI). This action is necessary to prevent exceeding the second seasonal apportionment of the Pacific cod total allowable catch (TAC) allocated to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear in the BSAI. EFFECTIVE DATE: 12 noon, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), May 16, 1994, until 12 noon, A.l.t., September 1, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Andrew N. Smoker, Senior Inseason Manager, Fisheries Management Division, NMFS, (907) 586&hyph;7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675. In accordance with §675.20(a)(7)(ii), the Pacific cod TAC for the BSAI was established by the final 1994 initial specifications of groundfish (59 FR 7656, February 16, 1994) and increased by an apportionment from the reserve (59 FR 21673, April 26, 1994) to 191,000 metric tons (mt). The second seasonal apportionment of the amount of the 1994 Pacific cod TAC allocated to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear is 8,404 mt pursuant to §675.20(a)(3)(iv) and §675.20(a)(2)(v). This action is consistent with amendment 24, which apportions Pacific cod TAC among gear types and seasons (59 FR 4009, January 28, 1994). The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director), has determined, in accordance with §675.20(a)(8), that the second seasonal apportionment of the Pacific cod TAC allocated to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear in the BSAI soon will be reached. Therefore, the Regional Director has established a directed fishing allowance of 8,000 mt, with consideration that 404 mt will be taken as incidental catch in directed fishing for other species in the BSAI. The Regional Director has determined that the directed fishing allowance has been reached. Consequently, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for Pacific cod by vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear in the BSAI, effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., May 16, 1994, until 12 noon, A.l.t., September 1, 1994. Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be found in the regulations at §675.20(h). Classification This action is taken under §675.20 and is exempt from OMB review under E.O. 12866. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. Dated: May 16, 1994. David S. Crestin, Acting Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service.
