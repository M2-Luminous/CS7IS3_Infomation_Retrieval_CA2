This is because the conflict that took place in Cambodia following the visit by the late Tunku Abdul Rahman, Malaysia's first prime minister, made it impossible for other Malaysian leaders to visit Phnom Penh. Here is Shah Bahrom Datuk Shah Ya, a RTM [Radio Television Malaysia] correspondent reporting from Vientiane. [as heard] [Begin Shah Bahrom recording] Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir said the above when addressing the state banquet hosted in his honor by the co-prime ministers of Cambodia, Prince Ranariddh and Hun Sen, at the Government House tonight. He said that even though visits to Phnom Penh were impossible then, the leaders and the people of Malaysia continued to pay attention to Cambodia. Malaysia sympathized with the situation in Cambodia when it was bogged down by civil war. Now Malaysia is happy to see the country being restored to an everlasting peace with the help of friendly countries. Malaysia is also happy to be involved in the peace process in Cambodia, including participation in UNTAC [United National Transitional Authority in Cambodia]. As for Malaysia, it is important that peace is restored to Cambodia because this is also important for the stability and prosperity in the Southeast Asia region. Malaysia's involvement in Cambodia's peace process is mainly due to the fact that Malaysia is a neighboring country and a close friend of Cambodia. It has become ASEAN's new practice to open up opportunities and boost cooperation among its member countries as well as with peaceful countries in Southeast Asia. This includes a peaceful Cambodia. Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir reiterated that when there is unity in Southeast Asia, the countries in the region will definitely be much stronger to face future challenges. Malaysia hopes that finally all 10 countries in Southeast Asia will become members of ASEAN. Laos and Vietnam have taken various steps and make preparations to join ASEAN.
