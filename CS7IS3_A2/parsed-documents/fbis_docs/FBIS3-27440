According to a report on the economic development in 1993 and the outlook for 1994 issued by the Economic Ministry and the State Statistical Committee to the State Duma members, the country's gross national product (GNP) in 1993 dropped by 12 percent from 1992, while the industrial production decreased by 16 percent. The country's industrial production has gone down sharply since the beginning of 1994, with a 23.1-percent drop in January over the same period of 1992, the report said. Unemployment was increasing rapidly and had reached 7.7 million by the end of last year, the report added. The country's inflation also remained high last year. All prices for consumer goods were soaring by 8.4 times while those for manufactured goods went up by nine times. Russia also faces a grim situation in regard to its foreign economic relations and foreign exchange which the country badly needs for investment in some projects and for support for ongoing economic reform. Meanwhile, the funds allocated by the government in the budget to the country's science and technology also decreased in 1993.
