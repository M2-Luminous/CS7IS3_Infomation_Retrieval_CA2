FBIS4-36321 "drnes110_m_94003" FBIS-NES-94-110 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 JORDAN Notes Israeli Overuse of River Water Notes Israeli Overuse of River Water JN0706200594 Amman Jordan Television Network in English 1900 GMT 7 Jun 94 JN0706200594 Amman Jordan Television Network English BFN [From the "News at Ten" program] [Text] Jordan said current talks in Washington would place adequate emphasis on regaining its rightful share of water and securing recognized borders with Israel. Minister of State for Cabinet Affairs and Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani said Jordan's water rights were embedded in international and regional agreements, and that it insisted on enforcing such agreements. He also blamed Israel for excessive water siphoning from the River Jordan and its tributaries. Speaking to "News at Ten" reporter Maha al-Sha'ir, Dr. al-'Anani said it was important to settle the issue of how to divide water among the region's riparian states. The minister also stressed the need for reaching agreement on recognized and secure borders, and that technical problems should not stand in the way of the demarcation process. He said the current cease-fire line with Israel is not a good recipe for peace. [Begin recording] [Al-'Anani] What is more important is that each country should live within recognized and secure boundaries. The current cease-fire lines do not constitute a recipe for permanent peace. Therefore, our insistence on demarcation boundaries is because we want to create also the atmosphere which would be conducive for permanent peace in the area. [Al-Sha'ir] You referred to reports from Israelis that it is very difficult to put lines or border demarcations for that area of the Dead Sea for instance. [Al-'Anani] Well, I think the foreign minister of Israel was specifically referring to the technical problems which might be encountered in trying to delineate boundaries in the Dead Sea itself. He might be referring, either to certain geological factors in that area or he was specifically referring to the fact that the surface of the Dead Sea was continuously shifting and moving because of over water siphoning that is taking place in the area, and we think that Israel is very much to blame for overdrawing from the River Jordan and its tributaries, which eventually thrown to the Dead Sea. And, therefore, while we acknowledge that there might be difficulty, but this does not construe any clear reason for not engaging in the demarcation process itself. [end recording]
