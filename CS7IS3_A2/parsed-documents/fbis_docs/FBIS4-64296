Addressing a visiting delegation from the Turkish Cypriot Fighters Association, Denktas said that the failure to reach an agreement on the confidence-building measures [CBM's] shows that as long as it is recognized as the legitimate government of Cyprus, the Greek Cypriot Administration will not sign an agreement with the Turkish Cypriots. Denktas said that it was wrong for UN special envoy Clark to have declared the collapse of the talks on the CBM's while in the Turkish Cypriot sector. Denktas recalled that the Turkish Cypriots conveyed their proposals on four main issues to the Greek Cypriots, but the latter rejected them. Denktas said: The announcement about the collapse of the talks should have been made in the Greek Cypriot sector.
