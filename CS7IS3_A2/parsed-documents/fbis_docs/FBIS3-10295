[Reporter Cecilia Pachano] During the almost five hour cabinet meeting, the ministers discussed at length the package of fiscal laws known as the Sosa Plan, although the topic was not exhausted. They believe the package will be finally approved this weekend during an extraordinary Council of Ministers meeting. To make this possible, the economic cabinet declared this an emergency and will continue to refine the laws so they can be ready before 8 March, the date on which the executive insists it will formally submit them to Congress. Progress was made on other matters, however. The ministers approved a decree that cuts spending to a level close to the 10-percent goal the government set. Most affected by the reduction are the Transportation and Communications Ministry, with a cut of 30 billion bolivares, the Interior Ministry, with 12 billion bolivares, the Agriculture and Livestock Ministry, with 10 billion bolivares, and the Defense Ministry with 6 billion. Another result of the cabinet meeting was approval of the decree creating the National Tax Management and Control Service [Servicio Nacional de Administracion and Control Tributario], a self-financing body without the legal authority [personalidad juridica] to replace the General Income Directorate, which is to be known by the name of Fiscal Police [Policia Fiscal]. [Begin Guillermo Alvarez, Central Information Office minister, recording] It will direct and administer tax activities, participate in the drafting of tax policies and issue guidelines to implement them, participate in studying and drafting bills, act as the authority that establishes tax policies and explains and enforces fiscal legislation, have the authority to collect taxes, and ensure sufficient taxes are collected. There is no budget allocation for this body; it will be self-supporting through the product of its own operations, and that is why it is called an autonomous service. [end recording] Also approved during the Council of Ministers meeting was a decree maintaining a freeze on medicine prices, and the ministers ordered a revamping of the Energy and Mines Ministry. [Begin Energy and Mines Minister Erwin Jose Arrieta recording] The purpose of this revamping is to adapt and modernize this ministry in line with the country's current mining and energy situation, so we can have a policy on mining and oil, as well as a large-scale mining activity. For that purpose, the ministry's structure will be appropriate for that challenge. [end recording] [Pachano] The Council of Ministers also approved a decree reactivating the National Border Council, which will be installed formally on 8 March.
