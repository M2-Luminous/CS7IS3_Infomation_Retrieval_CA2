Government spokesman Dieter Vogel said in Bonn today that military and economic measures against the continued aggression by Serb combat troops are among "the allies' options to make the Serb leadership see reason." Vogel added that close political cooperation is needed between the European Union and NATO as well as the United Nations, the United States, and Russia to achieve this. This would allow "maximum pressure" to be exerted on the Serb leadership. The German Government therefore welcomes Clinton's expressed intention to work in close coordination particularly with Russia to prepare the ground for further measures.
