FBIS4-59974 "drnes097_f_94001" FBIS-NES-94-097 Daily Report 18 May 1994 Morocco King Hassan Urges Return of Rights to Jerusalem King Hassan Urges Return of Rights to Jerusalem LD1805170794 Rabat Moroccan Kingdom Radio Network in Arabic 1300 GMT 18 May 94 LD1805170794 Rabat Moroccan Kingdom Radio Network Arabic BFN [Text] Today the Islamic nation is celebrating Jerusalem Day according the Jerusalem Committee's resolution, issued at its meeting in Fez on 19-20 April 1984 under the chairmanship of His Majesty King Hassan II, God make him victorious, the chairman of the Committee. Today is an occasion for more than 1 billion Muslims throughout the world to renew their insistence on the Arabic character of this holy city, despite the Zionist practices to obliterate its Arab and Islamic features. King Hassan II, the chairman of Jerusalem Committee, had emphasized during one the Committee's sessions that we should use all our human and material strength and potential to up hold the word of right and to persuade those who know and those who do not or who are pretending not to know that our rights should be returned as soon as possible. This gracious royal invitation to return the right to its legitimate owners reflects the effort made and being made to support the issues of Islam and the Muslims. While commemoration of Jerusalem Day is coinciding this year with the peace process in the Middle East, and especially in the land of Palestine where the Palestinian authority has assumed its duties in the self-rule areas, what has been achieved represents only one step of many that are required to be made on the path of achieving a just and comprehensive peace. No doubt Jerusalem will remain the core issue in any settlement in the area, and the question of recovering it will remain a joint nationalist and Islamic preoccupation. It will remain the objective toward which the Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim generations will aspire.
