Namely, concerning Russia's present impaired international position. The large-scale dismantling of the Russian Federation's international positions is connected primarily with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Even as the continuer-state, which has preserved three-fourths of the territory of the former USSR, but which has lost 40 percent of its economic potential and half its population, Russia is not now in a position to lay claim to this role. In addition, it has found itself without allies and with a mass of problems on borders dotted like shagreen leather. The realities are harsh: As a century ago, Russia has been pushed northeastward and pressed back to the Polar Circle. The question of the ways of ensuring the country's security under such unfamiliar conditions simply could not have failed to have come front stage in domestic policy. But it has been lent particular seriousness by a number of far from obligatory derivatives of the process of the "'shrinkage' of Russia's influence." Thus, it was difficult from the very outset to explain the absence of attempts to preserve the tried-and-tested relations with the former Union republics. It was disheartening that countries designated new allies permitted themselves to treat us as the poor relation. They insistently put out flags indicating the limit of Russia's influence. The absence of its real defense of the rights of 25 million brothers who speak the same language and who have come, through no fault of their own, to be outside its boundaries was disturbing also. The spontaneous explosion of civil feeling, which had been hurt to the quick, was a natural human reaction to the infringement of national dignity. It may be called patriotism, as do some, or nationalism, as do others, but the main thing here was the idea of the preservation and affirmation of Russia as an independent factor in the world system of states--shaped over centuries, distinctive, and with its own rights and interests. It is time for everyone, evidently, the radical democrats included, to recognize the ponderability of these, it may now confidently be said, national aspirations. Healthy patriotism is a natural feeling of any normal citizen who does not have an urge to unfailingly remake Russia as something else or chop off its historical roots. A most important constituent of the international climate with reference to the Russian Federation on the threshold of the 21st century are primarily its close surroundings. These are now the countries of the CIS and also traditional neighbors, primarily in East Europe. Another such most important reality of the external situation is the circle of industrially developed countries of the West, primarily the Seven. Its geographical remoteness does not diminish its influence, particularly when it acts jointly. All the other force vectors of international life are for Russia ultimately merely of a secondary, background nature. For this reason, the country's cardinal task for the years ahead should be the encouragement of the lapping and mating of two most important factors--the close surroundings and the West. In other words, assurance that they operate in a mode of general stabilization and consolidation, not follow different courses. Were Russia to be confronted with an "either-or" choice, and were it to agree to this, such a development would be for it tantamount to a major strategic loss. Russia, if it wishes to remain itself, cannot renounce its geopolitical and civilizational essence as a power pulling together the two most populous continents. This uniquely propitious Eurasian format, which was its cradle and which gave birth to its greatness, is critically important for it in the future also, as the link with mother earth for Antaeus. On the other hand, the end to the confrontation with the West, which has for the first time in many decades freed up colossal development potential and which presupposes broad mutually advantageous cooperation, could be promising as another, new constant of Russian policy. Unfortunately, the possibility of firmly establishing such a stable movement in the future with a foothold in both factors is not for the Russian Federation today easy. Through, most likely, no fault of its own. Does the West need a united and strong Russia? Eschewing a starry-eyed "yes," there is as yet no simple answer to this question. There is a dual attitude toward it, regardless of any ideology which it has, what is more. This was best expressed by Henry Kissinger. "On the one hand," he wrote in the INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE after the disintegration of the USSR, "the tsarist and Soviet empires grew into a constant threat to the balance of forces along their entire vast perimeter in Europe, the Far East, and Asia. On the other, these empires twice saved the independence of the European countries, inasmuch as without their contribution Napoleon and Hitler would have gained the upper hand." Thanks for the kind words, as they say, but why, then, the other theme--"constant threat." Is this not double-dealing? Why should Russia alone be approached with such prejudiced yardsticks? The British Empire, which was earlier called such officially, has now been transformed into a commonwealth headed by Britain, which is endeavoring to maintain special relations among its members. But no one is rushing to take a stab at the imperial ambitions of the British. France similarly grouped its former colonies in a community of Francophone countries, and no one reproaches it for this. Finally, the United States, which back in 1823 declared the Western Hemisphere to be the sphere of its special interests (the Monroe Doctrine), adheres today to the same policy, although, let us be plain, far from everyone agrees with this. Yet in all three cases it is a question of great powers considering it useful to unite around them countries located here thousands and even tens of thousands of kilometers away, as a rule. It would seem that people would like to deny Russia, on the other hand, the right to have immediate surroundings that are favorable to it--a viable Commonwealth of Independent States. But this is a double standard. Whoever wishes to be our dependable partner must recognize that the Russian Federation seeks not exceptional but equal and commensurate conditions of development. Russians would not understand anything else. In order to avoid unacceptable discrimination, it is essential that Russia cleave properly but firmly to a course whose essence is that it is not an inferior object, but a ponderable subject of international policy. This means that it also may--by political methods and a basis that is voluntary for the other participants--form external surroundings, close surroundings even more, which are friendly toward it and which are developing constructively. As, for example, is being done by the United States, which has formed together with Mexico and Canada the common North American free trade zone. Of course, Russia's actions in this plane must be comprehensible to its partners near and far and instill trust in them. But Russia also is entitled to expect the understanding and trust of others. It is in the achievement of such a two-in-one goal that the art of the foreign policy and diplomacy of a truly great power lies. Here also lies the difference between patriotism and imperial ambitions.
