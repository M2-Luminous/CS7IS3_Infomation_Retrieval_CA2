Hata said he is concerned about statements by a North Korean defector that the pro-Pyongyang General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryun) has systematically shipped high-technology products to North Korea. Lim Song son, a first lieutenant in the North Korean People's Army, defected to South Korea in August. He told a Japanese think tank in November that Chongryun has circumvented Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Control (COCOM) regulations by clandestinely shipping military-related communications equipment, computer microchips and other high-tech products to Pyongyang. Hata said he has been informed by government officials that the cabinet information research office estimated the annual outflow of money from Japan to North Korea at 200 billion yen. The estimate apparently includes Chongryun's banking remittances to the North Korean Government, cash gifts from Korean residents in Japan to their relatives in North Korea and the value of various manufacturing plant-related investment, according to Katsumi Sato, director of the Modern Korean Institute. Hata said, however, that the government faces difficulties in obtaining accurate data about the remittances and in confirming the alleged COCOM violations by Chongryun. He ruled out applying an immediate economic sanctions to halt the alleged shipments. Japan will not take the initiative of imposing economic sanctions on North Korea before the UN Security Council adopts a resolution calling for sanctions, he said. North Korea could ``erupt violently'' if Japan put pressure on Pyongyang, he said. Hata stressed that Japan and Asian countries need the presence of U.S. troops on Japanese soil as there are still ``some countries armed with nuclear weapons'' in this area of the world. ``We would face trouble if a vacuum was created in Asia following the withdrawal of U.S. Troops,'' he said. ``My ideas are not very different from those of Liberal Democratic Party President Yohei Kono,'' who recently voiced concern about a possible negative security impact following the withdrawal of U.S. Forces from the Philippines.
