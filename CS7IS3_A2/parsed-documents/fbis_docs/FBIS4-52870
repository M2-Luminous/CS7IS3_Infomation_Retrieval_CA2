FBIS4-52870 "dreas094_c_94008" FBIS-EAS-94-094 Daily Report 14 May 1994 North Korea Daily Says Peace Agreement Will Settle Nuclear Issue Daily Says Peace Agreement Will Settle Nuclear Issue SK1405101494 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1006 GMT 14 May 94 SK1405101494 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Just Overture for Durable Peace on Korean Peninsula" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, May 14 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today describes the DPRK's proposal for replacing the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement and establishing a new peace arrangement as a timely and realistic measure to settle the nuclear and other acute issues on the Korean peninsula and open a new phase in the improvement of DPRK-USA relations and inter-Korean relations. The paper says in a by-lined article: To remove military confrontation and the danger of war and preserve peace on the Korean peninsula is a vital question related to the peaceful reunification of Korea and the future destiny of the Korean people and a main key to the preservation of peace and security in Asia and the rest of the world. Due to the reckless illegalities of the United States, a signatory to the Armistice Agreement, military confrontation remains and the danger of a new war is increasing on the Korean peninsula. The United States is trying its hardest to stifle the DPRK with strength over its "nuclear issue" while wantonly violating the Armistice Agreement. The DPRK and the United States are signatories to the Armistice Agreement. Therefore, hostile relations between them cannot be removed nor can rapprochement be achieved without replacing the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement and establishing a new peace arrangement. A glance at the existing truce arrangement justifies an early realization of the DPRK's peace overture. The present truce arrangement is a legal and institutional mechanism to check arms buildup and military confrontation, stabilise the situation and preserve peace on the Korean peninsula. But it fails to play its role as such today. After the collapse of the East-West cold war structure and the equilibrium of strength, the United States, acting the "only superpower," is shipping large quantities of military equipment to South Korea in broad daylight and becoming more undisguised in its military threat to the DPRK, a signatory to the Armistice Agreement, in an effort to stifle it. This means that the United States has unilaterally and totally abrogated the Korean Armistice Agreement it signed in the name of the United Nations, and nullified the provisions of the agreement. The United States must discard the anachronistic confrontation concept and war psychology and accede to the DPRK-proposed negotiations for peace.
