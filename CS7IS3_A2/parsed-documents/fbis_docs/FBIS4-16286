FBIS4-16286 "drsov073_t_94004" FBIS-SOV-94-073 Daily Report 14 Apr 1994 BALTIC STATES Estonia Paldiski Reactors' Nuclear Rods Withdrawal Postponed Paldiski Reactors' Nuclear Rods Withdrawal Postponed WS1404180494 Tallinn BNS in English 1300 GMT 14 Apr 94 WS1404180494 Tallinn BNS English BFN [Text] Tallinn, Apr 14, BNS -- Russia will not start pulling out nuclear rods from its reactors at the naval base of Paldiski in the second decade of March, as was established earlier, said Juri Tikk, the Estonian Government's special representative in Paldiski. The date for starting the work will be most likely set on Apr. 22 or 23, when the Russian group to carry out the dismantling is scheduled to arrive at the facility, located some 35 kilometers to the west of Tallinn. But Tikk expressed hope that the work will still start this month. The two countries have already agreed upon the technical issues pertaining to the dismantling of the reactors in the Russian submarine crew training center. Ago Tiiman, secretary of the Estonian delegation for talks with Russia and head of the group for military issues of the delegation, said Estonia had proposed what he called a totally new plan for the dismantling. "This idea is different from the earlier ones. Our position is that the rods must be out from Estonia by June 30, 1994. But the rest of the work -- dismantling of the reactor corpus and taking out the solid and liquid nuclear waste -- must take place as quickly as possible," Tiiman said in a press conference of the Estonian delegation. He said the idea reminded of an earlier suggestion, according to which the reactors would be mounted on special trailers and taken away by ship or train. He refused to specify. Tiiman characterized his country's new proposal as optimal. He said work according to this scheme would cost Estonia less than 10 million U.S. dollars. The Estonian Cabinet at its meeting on Apr. 12 ruled to introduce emergency regulations on the Pakri peninsula, where Paldiski is situated, during the period of work on the reactors. The regulations, to become effective after a decree by the minister of the interior, will make the region again off-limits area for outsiders. Estonian officials say that if Russia agrees to the scheme proposed by the country, the whole process of dismantling the reactors will take about three years.
