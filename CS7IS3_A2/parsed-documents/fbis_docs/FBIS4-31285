This was stated by Gyula Horn at a press briefing after the talks. Ivan Peto also said that what was achieved is very promising. The two sides agreed on most issues. Kata Peli Nagy reports on today's coalition negotiations. [Begin Peto recording] What is behind us suggests a very promising and effective negotiation process over the coming days. We thought virtually identically about the majority of issues. [end recording] [Nagy] This is how Ivan Peto, chairman of the Alliance of Free Demicrats [SZDSZ], and Gyula Horn, his Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] counterpart, assessed briefly the first round of government coalition negotiations this morning. [passage omitted] [Begin Horn recording] I must say that a fully constructive approach and complete openness toward each other has characterized the talks this morning, and we were able to come to an agreement very quickly. Naturally, tough and long debates can be expected on questions of content, but we agree -- and we agreed on this too -- that the date for convening the National Assembly is a firm framework for us, to which we would like to adhere under all circumstances. [end recording] [Nagy] This means that work in the expert committees must be completed by 20 June. The two sides would like to conclude the coalition agreement before 24 June. In this way there is a chance for the new government to be formed at the end of the month.
