FR941230-1-00052 FR941230-1-00004 (e) Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of this section. Example 1. Joint ownership. Z, a privately owned electric utility, and City H agree to construct an electric generating facility of a size sufficient to take advantage of the economies of scale. H will issue $50 million of its 25-year bonds and Z will use $100 million of its funds for construction of a facility they will jointly own as tenants in common. Each of the participants will share in the ownership, output, and operating expenses of the facility in proportion to its contribution to the cost of the facility, that is, one-third by H and two-thirds by Z. H's bonds will be secured by H's ownership in the facility and by revenues to be derived from its share of the annual output of the facility. Because H will need only 50 percent of its share of the annual output of the facility during the first 20 years of operations, it agrees to sell Z 10 percent of its share of that annual output for a period of 20 years pursuant to a contract under which Z agrees to take that power if available. The facility will begin operation and Z will begin to receive power 4 years after the H bonds are issued and, therefore, the contract term of the issue will be 21 years. H also agrees to sell the remaining excess portion of its share of the annual output (40 percent) to numerous other private utilities under a prevailing rate schedule, including demand charges. No contracts will be executed obligating any person other than Z to purchase any specified amount of the power for any specified period of time and no person (other than Z) will pay a demand charge or other minimum payment under conditions which, under paragraph (a) of this section, result in a transfer of substantial benefits of ownership and substantial burdens of paying the debt service on bonds used directly or indirectly to provide those facilities. The bonds are not private activity bonds because H's one-third interest in the facility (financed with proceeds) is treated as a discrete portion of a mixed use facility and, although 10 percent of H's interest in the annual output of the facility will be used, directly or indirectly, in the trade or business of Z, a non-governmental person, under the rule in paragraph (a) of this section, that portion constitutes not more than 10 percent of the available output of the facility. If more than 10 percent of the available output of the facility were to be sold to Z pursuant to a take or pay contract and more than 10 percent of the debt service on the bonds were to be paid or secured by Z, the bonds would be private activity bonds under paragraph (a) of this section. Example 2. Power Authority K, a political subdivision created by the legislature in State X to own and operate certain power generating facilities, sells all of the power from its existing facilities to four private utility systems under contracts executed in 1990, under which the four systems are required to take or pay for specified portions of the total power output until the year 2020. Currently, existing facilities supply all of the present needs of the four utility systems but their future power requirements are expected to increase substantially. K issues 20-year bonds to construct a large generating facility. A fifth private utility system contracts with K to take or pay for 15 percent of the available output of the new facility. The balance of the output of the new facility will be available for sale as required, but initially it is not anticipated there will be any need for that power. The revenues from the contract with the fifth private utility system will be sufficient to pay less than 10 percent of the debt service on the bonds (determined on a percent value basis). The balance, which will exceed 10 percent of the debt service on the bonds, will be paid from revenues from the contracts with the four systems from sale of power produced by the old facilities. The bonds meet the private business use test because more than 10 percent of the proceeds will be used in the trade or business of a nongovernmental person. In addition, the bonds meet the private payment or security test because payment of more than 10 percent of the debt service, pursuant to an underlying arrangement, will be derived from payments in respect of property used for a private business use. Therefore, the bonds are private activity bonds. Example 3. Municipal utility U, a political subdivision, purchases all of the electricity required to meet the needs of its customers (1,000 Mw) from B, an investor-owned utility that operates its own electric generating facilities, under a 50-year take or pay contract. Although U does not anticipate that it will require additional electric resources and any new resources would produce electricity at a higher cost to U than its cost under its contract with B, B encourages U to construct new resources sufficient to meet the requirements of U's customers. U issues obligations to construct facilities that will produce 1,000 Mw of electricity. B, U, and I, another investor-owned utility, enter into an agreement under which U assigns to I its rights under U's take or pay contract with B. Under this arrangement, I will make payments to U and U will continue to make payments to B for the 1,000 Mw it is entitled to under the original take or pay contract. The payments made by I to U will be equal to or greater than the amounts required to pay the debt service on U's bonds. Under paragraph (d) of this section, U's obligations are financing a facility in a manner that is inconsistent with the purposes of section 141 and, therefore, the take or pay contract under which I purchases electricity is allocable to U's new facilities. Because I is a nongovernmental person, U's bonds are private activity bonds. Example 4. Transmission network. In response to an order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ( FERC ), municipal utility V and investor-owned utility W enter into an agreement for the shared use of W's transmission facilities and transmission facilities that V is to construct (collectively, the network ). Both V and W require shared use of the entire network, rather than point-to-point service. Pursuant to the agreement, V issues its bonds to construct new transmission facilities. The FERC order provides for sharing of costs of the network using relative load share ratios. Under this methodology, V will be responsible for 40 percent of the load share of the network. Under all the facts and circumstances, relative load share ratios is a reasonable method of measuring the capacity and use of the network. V and W reasonably expect that, on an annual basis, more than 90 percent of the amounts owed to V for use of its facilities will be paid for in kind (that is, through the provision of transmission services on W's facilities). The agreement provides that V and W will be entitled to transmission services that are comparable to the owner's own use. V reasonably expects that, due to the isolated location of the network, no other parties will seek to use V's transmission facilities. Under these circumstances, W will use more than 10 percent of the available output of the facilities financed with V's bonds and more than 10 percent of the debt service on V's bonds will be paid by W. Under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, however, W's use of the financed facilities will not be treated as private business use if those facilities are financed based on V's reasonable expectations regarding the amount of wheeling anticipated and the requirements of paragraph (b)(4)(i) and (iii) are satisfied. Although W's use of the financed facilities involves more than 20 percent of the property financed with the proceeds of the issue, because substantially all of the consideration for this use is the provision of other transmission services, the limitation in paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section does not apply. Assuming that the financed facilities are not necessitated by the need to provide transmission to W and that the other conditions of paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section are satisfied, W's use of the financed facilities will not cause V's bonds to be private activity bonds.
