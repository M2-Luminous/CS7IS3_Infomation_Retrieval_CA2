Mr. Li made these remarks at a team discussion for Guangdong deputies to the National People's Congress (NPC) during the NPC session in response to concern over the problem of social order which is an important issue arousing great concern from the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, both of which are currently being held here. Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Guangdong People's Congress, Mr. Fang Bao, who was formerly in charge of the province's law-enforcement work, said he was mainly worried about the question of social order because it had become more critical in the province than in other cities in recent years. Guangzhou, a gateway to the province, first recived an impact from worsening social order with some 50,000 criminal cases registered in the municiality alone last year. Mr. Fang said that the social order problem had been quite serious in recent years even though much work had been done in this sector. It was up to the public security police to deal with public order, he said, while security teams comprised of local residents had been set up as an auxiliary force to the police. Some entities and government departments, however, had not done their part in the maintenance of public order. Mr. Li put the proper dealing with social order as the main task in Guangzhou for the coming years. An injection of RMB 600 million will be used to improve salaries and police quality in a bid to arouse the enthusiasm and morale of the police force. The spending will also be used to improve police equipment and facilities, creating better conditions for the police force.
