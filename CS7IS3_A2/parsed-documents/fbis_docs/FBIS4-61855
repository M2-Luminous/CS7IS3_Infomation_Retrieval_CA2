However, according to data released by the foregoing service, a pre-strike situation is still in force at separate enterprises of the petroleum refining and defence industries, in the agroindustrial complex, and in the mining and metallurgical industries. According to Petrov, the miners of Perm region, for instance, have still not received the 1.5 billion roubles owed to them by the state for unpaid wages. The agro-industrial complex of Orenburg region has not received wages, amounting to 29 billion roubles, by the beginning of April 1994. Workers of the Dukat beneficiation [as received] combine, Magadan region, have not been paid wages for three months running. As noted by the head of the labour disputes service, the question of financing defence enterprises is particularly acute today. According to the Russian State Defence Industry Committee, the workers of this sector of the economy had received wages only once in four months, and the state still owes some such enterprises the wages they should have received in 1993. Along with demands to pay the owed wages and to increase their overall earnings, the work collectives of this sector of the national economy call for the solution of problems linked with the size of the defence order, with the sale of military hardware abroad, with the easy crediting of defence enterprises and their switch-over to the production of civilian goods.
