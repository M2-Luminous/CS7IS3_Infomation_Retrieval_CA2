The ruling is aimed at following the recent practice when the national police chief simultaneously was the head of the volunteer law enforcement force. But Justice Minister Kaido Kama also told reporters today the Cabinet had ordered the Interior Ministry to draw up within one month's time a draft of new Home Guard Statutes or submit to the government a scheme of changes in the Home Guard organization. It cannot be considered normal that the head of such kind of a volunteer-based organization is appointed by the government Kama said. The parliament last month adopted a law on noncommissioned police force. Home Guard leaders claim the legislation has placed their organization outside the legal framework. The currently effective statutes of the Estonian Home Guard were established under a April 28, 1992 ruling of the government. The head of the parliamentary legal affairs commission, Juri Adams, has admitted that the ruling from two years ago fails to effectively correspond to present-day needs. Adams has suggested the Home Guard could continue existing as a non-profit organization or a public service entity.
