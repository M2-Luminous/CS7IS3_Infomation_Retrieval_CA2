"The very fact of reaching an agreement is in itself positive," he told AFP. "That shows that we got what we wanted." The Ma'ariv newspaper headlined: "Security top brass happy, 'All our main demands have been accepted'." The daily quoted triumphant security officials congratulating themselves on the pact signed by PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres on Wednesday [9 February] night. Israel keeps control of the border and crossing points, Jewish settlements and roads leading to them for the five-year interim period of autonomy. Ben Ami said Israeli and Palestinian delegations would next week resume talks on the military, civilian and economic aspects of autonomy, in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba and in Paris, in a bid to seal an overall agreement to launch self-rule. "We are now going to try to put into practice the principles expressed and signed in Cairo. A lot of questions remain to be answered," Ben Ami said.
