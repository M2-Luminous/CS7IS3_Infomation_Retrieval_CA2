It is likely, therefore, that the German cabinet meeting today will work out appropriate measures against the threat of such mass lethal weapons imposed recently by North Korea. Correspondent Yi Myong-ku reports from Berlin: [Begin Yi recording] The German newspaper, DIE WELT, quoting an intelligence source in the West, reported that North Korea is selling nuclear-delivery rockets to radical states in the Middle East and handing over technology on biological weapons and chemical weapons to them. This paper wrote that the nations to which North Korea is selling weapons are capable of paying North Korea in foreign currency at once, and Iran, Syria, Iraq, and Libya are included in these nations. A German intelligence source pointed out that the arming of these countries with mass lethal weapons poses a direct threat to European countries. The source expressed worries about the possibility of Europe being taken hostage by these countries even from next year. This source also revealed that some business firms in Europe, including Germany, are involved in the Middle East nations' manufacturing of weapons based on North Korean technology. Another intelligence source pointed out, however, that Germany effectively blocked the weapons produced in Germany from being handed over to the Middle East nations, and transaction of such mass lethal weapons is being carried out in a more skillful and secret manner with each passing day. Therefore, tenacious efforts are necessary to prevent Arab states from arming themselves with such weapons. Meanwhile, the German cabinet meeting to be held today will discuss measures to cope with the issue of uranium produced in the Former Soviet Union being brought into Germany and with the issue of the armament of Arab states with nuclear-delivery rockets and biochemical weapons. It was learned that a secret report on the proliferation of such lethal weapons will be submitted to today's cabinet meeting. In addition, the cabinet meeting will also work out effective countermeasures for the threat imposed by North Korea. [end recording]
