While in the republic, he met with Vaclav Klaus, the Czech Republic's prime minister, Ivan Kocarnik, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister and Radomir Sabela, Deputy Minister of Industrial and Trade Ministry. All parties agreed to a co-operative economic expansion in trade, investment and banking. Thailand expressed desire to export rice, coffee, and tapioca to the Czech Republic. Direct buying and selling transactions are planned to be conducted through Thailand's Ex-Im Bank instead of sales through the third country. The two parties agreed to operate the free trade area of CEFTA [Central European Free Trade Association] and AFTA [Atlantic Free Trade Area] by concentrating on Indochina's and Eastern Europe's trade gates to help decrease export taxes on products bound for the Czech Republic. The private sectors of both countries will also map out additional co-operative efforts, he said. In the investment sector, Thailand persuaded the republic to pursue their crystal and machinery industry in Thailand. Expertise and production technology from Czech Republic are needed in Thailand, said Suphachai.
