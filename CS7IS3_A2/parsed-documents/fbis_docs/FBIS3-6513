The Thai side proposed that Thailand and Vietnam take the lead to organize a meeting of six countries situated in the Mekong River basin in order to develop together the Mekong River basin. About 26 projects have been proposed by the Asian Development Bank for the development of the Mekong River basin. Deputy Finance Minister Trairong Suwannakhiri granted an interview to reporters in Hue, Vietnam, yesterday afternoon. [Begin recording] [Trairong] Among these six countries, Thailand and Vietnam are the strongest countries since China will involve only one province. Thailand and Vietnam are stronger than the others. The six countries are China's Yunnan Province, Burma, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Thailand. Therefore, what is agreed by Thailand and Vietnam, I think it would be concurred by the other countries. [Unidentified reporter] Regarding the project to take water from the Mekong River for use in our country, will there be any objection from other countries? [Trairong] This matter has already been discussed by the Thai prime minister. Therefore, there is no need for me to talk about it. The project to divert water from the Mekhong River for consumption is a high-level issue. Thai and Vietnamese prime ministers have discussed this issue. I, therefore, do not have to talk about it. We only discussed 26 projects including issues of the Mekong River, electricity, roads, railways, airports, tourism, environment, assistance in the field of education, and so on. [end recording]
