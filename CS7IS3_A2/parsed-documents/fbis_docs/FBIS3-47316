Both sides will hold full-fledged discussions beginning 12 January, and the meeting on automobiles and auto parts is set to be held again in Washington on 20 January. The two countries are to reach a final agreement in a plenary session of the meeting slated for late February. Priority has been given to the automobiles and auto parts sector, government procurement sector, and insurance sector, and the two countries are to draw a conclusion on all sectors by 11 February when the Japan-U.S. summit talks are to be held. With wide differences still remaining between the two countries over objective criteria to gauge the degree of market access for foreign goods and Japan's plans for the purchase of American-made auto parts, however, the two countries are expected to have a heated exchange at the vice ministerial meeting.
