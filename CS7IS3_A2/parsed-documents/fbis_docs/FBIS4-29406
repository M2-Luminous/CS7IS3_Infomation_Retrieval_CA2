This morning, the government held a Unification-National Security Coordination Council meeting during which it fine-tuned its position not to oppose the third round of talks between the United States and the North if North Korea's new conciliatory gesture, including its policy of allowing inspectors to remain in the DPRK--revealed by former U.S. President Carter now on a visit to the North--turns out to be true. However, if the U.S. Clinton administration focuses on having North Korea freeze its nuclear development plan, it will be difficult to guarantee the transparency of its past nuclear suspicion. On the basis of this judgment, the government decided to convey to the U.S. side its firm position on this point. The government also decided to fine-tune its final position after President Kim Yong-sam is briefed on the result of former President Carter's visit to the North, who will return to Seoul through Panmunjom tomorrow.
