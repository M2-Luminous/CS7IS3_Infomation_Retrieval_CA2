He held talks with Iranian Foreign Ministry officials and other government representatives on that crisis. The Caucasus has been the site of political and military clashes for more than five years. Regardless of the mediation efforts of several countries, the clashes and tension in that region have not subsided. On the contrary, they have increased. Reports have said that a large percentage of Azerbaijan's territory has been occupied by the Armenians. More than 40,000 innocent people in Azerbaijan have either been killed or wounded and more than 1,000,000 others have been evicted from their places of residence to become refugees. In addition, the national monuments and establishments of the two sides have been destroyed as a result of the war, in which neither side stands to gain anything. Obviously, the prolongation of the present state of affairs will lead to destruction and weaken the two countries. Considering the need for the establishment of security and peace and the removal of the crisis in the region, several countries, including the Islamic Republic of Iran, have made an effort to hold talks with the warring sides to end the fighting. In fact, several international organizations have urged them to hold bilateral talks to find a political way to end the clashes. In view of that, the objective behind Kazimirov's visit to Tehran was aimed at establishing an identity of views with the Islamic Republic of Iran's officials on the situation in the Caucasus and finding a way to end the clashes in Nagorno-Karabakh. It will be recalled that the Islamic Republic of Iran's officials have tried political initiatives to persuade Azerbaijan and Armenia to resolve their problems right from the very beginning of the clashes. In fact, they have taken positive steps in that direction. The alteration of recognized borders through the use of military pressure is unacceptable in the world. The maintenance of territorial integrity is regarded as a most important principle for peace and security. In view of that, the Islamic Republic of Iran has urged all the countries to resolve their problems through talks and reconciliation. The political experts are convinced that the coordination that may be established between the Islamic Republic of Iran and regional organizations and foreign countries, Russia in particular, will be an effective step to end the war in Nagorno-Karabakh.
