Kebich said after the meeting, held behind closed doors, that he had asked Chernomyrdin to speed up the provision of a loan Russia had promised to Belarus. "The prime minister of the Russian Federation promised assistance in this matter," Kebich said. Sources in the Belarusian delegation told Interfax that Kebich, in explaining his request for an earlier arrival of the 200-billion-ruble loan, said that lack of cash forces many of Belarus's enterprises to delay the payment of wages to their workers. At the same time, the Belarusian delegation said it realized that Russia was unable to give Belarus or any other member of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) any loans without approval by parliament. The Belarusians also mentioned that a Russian 1994 national budget the draft of which the legislature has passed at the first reading would limit Russia's total loans to other CIS countries to 185 billion rubles. The above-mentioned sources in the Belarusian delegation said the Russian government had assured Belarus that it would do its best to provide the loan earlier but had given no specific dates. Kebich said that "today it is extremely important not only to carry through the unification of the monetary systems of Belarus and Russia but also to find ways of forming a political and economic union of the Slav states." Talking to reporters, he said that such a union might subsequently be joined by Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and other CIS countries. In his view, the union member states need not have a single currency, namely the Russian ruble."Setting up an interstate bank would be enough to solve (their) economic problems," he said. Kebich said disagreements between Belarus and Russia over the status of the National Bank of Belarus (NBB) remain an obstacle to the materialization of the two countries' monetary union. The Russian Finance Ministry wants the NBB to be a branch of the Central Bank of Russia, which, Kebich said, Belarus cannot accept. He also believes the exchange of Belarusian rubles for Russian ones by bank transfer could be done at a rate of four or five Belarussian rubles to one Russian ruble. He said the rate was based on the cost of consumer goods in the two countries, he said. In the meantime, NBB chief Stanislav Bogdankevich called the conditions made by Russia at the second round of monetary union talks unacceptable. He told a news conference in Minsk that he was against Belarus and Russia having a single budget. As for Russia's offer to provide credits to close Belarus's budget deficits, he described that as "totally unacceptable." Apart from that, Bogdankevich still considers Article 5 of the monetary union treaty unconstitutional. "I did not initial that fundamental article, which provides for what is effective abolition of the National Bank of Belarus," he said. "Therefore the document is no more than a letter of intent." "The treaty cannot be signed on those terms. Negotiations are needed to take us back to our mutually advantageous positions," he said. Kebich's spokesman Vladimir Zametalin said the prime minister considered it his moral duty to carry through the work he had begun two years ago despite any pressure or resistance to Belarus's union with Russia. "What is today needed for real unification are not declarations or promises but persistent practical measures," Zametalin quoted Kebich as saying.
