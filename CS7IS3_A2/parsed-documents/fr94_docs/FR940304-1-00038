FR940304-1-00038 FR940304-1-00008 Accordingly, the refiner chooses to attribute up to 5,000 pounds of the domestic status class III crude as the source of the 10,000 pounds of aviation gasoline removed from the subzone refinery for the commuter airline. Since no other aviation gasoline could have been produced from the crude oils that entered production on Day 1, the refiner must attribute the remainder to the crude oils that entered production on Day 21. Again, using the production standards from T.D. 66&hyph;16, the class I crude could produce aviation gasoline in an amount up to 10,000 pounds (50,000 × .20). Likewise, the class IV crude oil could 31 produce aviation gasoline in an amount up to 8,500 pounds (50,000 × .17). The refiner selects use of the class I crude as the source of the aviation gasoline. The refiner could attribute up to 27,300 pounds (35,000_5,000 × .91) of the domestic class III crude oil as the source of the motor gasoline. This would leave 2,700 pounds of domestic class III crude available for further production for other than aviation gasoline or motor gasoline. The remaining motor gasoline removed (also 2,700 pounds) must be attributed to a privileged foreign crude oil. The refiner selects the privileged foreign class II crude oil that entered production on Day 1 as the source for the remaining 2,700 pounds of motor gasoline. This would leave 32,300 pounds of privileged foreign class II crude oil available for further production, of which no more than 27,400 pounds could be designated as the source of motor gasoline. The refiner attributes the jet fuel that is removed from the refinery subzone for the US Air Force for use in military aircraft to the privileged foreign class II crude oil. The refiner could attribute up to 20,995 pounds of jet fuel from that class II crude oil (32,300 × .65). Designating that class II crude oil as the source of the 10,000 pounds of jet fuel leaves 22,300 pounds of privileged foreign class II crude oil available for further production, of which up to 10,995 pounds could be attributed as the source of the jet fuel. Because the motor gasoline and the jet fuel, under the foregoing attribution, would be considered to have been separated from the privileged foreign class II crude oil, a relative value calculation would be required. The jet fuel is eligible for removal from the subzone free of duty by virtue of 19 U.S.C. 1309(a)(1)(A). The refiner could attribute the privileged foreign class II crude oil as being the source of 9,812 pounds of jet fuel (22,300 × .44). The refiner chooses to attribute the privileged foreign class III crude oil as the source of the jet fuel. The refiner could attribute to that class III crude oil up to 15,000 pounds of kerosene (30,000 × .50). II. Attribution on a FIFO Basis Day 1&hyph;5 Transfer, within the Refinery Subzone, from one or more storage tanks into process 150 barrels of Privileged Foreign (PF) Class II crude oil, equivalent to 50,000 pounds. Day 6 Removal from the refinery subzone 119 barrels of residual oils to customs territory, equivalent to 40,000 pounds. Since the operator uses the FIFO method of attribution, as the product is removed from the subzone, or consumed or lost within the subzone, attribution must be to the oldest feedstock available for attribution. Accordingly, the 40,000 pounds (119 barrels) of residual oils will be attributed to 40,000 pounds of the PF Class II crude oil from Day 1&hyph;5. Day 10 Transfer, within the refinery subzone, from one or more storage tanks 4 barrels of domestic motor gasoline blend stock, equivalent to 1,000 pounds to motor gasoline blending tank. Day 6&hyph;15 Transfer, within the refinery subzone, from one or more storage tanks into process 320 barrels of Domestic Class III crude oil, equivalent to 100,000 pounds.
