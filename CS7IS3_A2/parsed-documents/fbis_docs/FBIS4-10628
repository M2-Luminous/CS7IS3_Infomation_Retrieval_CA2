Nothing at all was being planned. We were simple viewers analyzing the various reactions as reflected by the television interviews. [Jimenez] Did the members of the Cabinet Council know of the content of the document that was going to be presented? [Alarcon] No Cabinet Council member knew about this document. This was a decision made solely by the president, and if you listen to the documentary introduction the president himself assumes the responsibility of the content of the document. [Jimenez] Politically speaking, who gains from this? [Alarcon] The people are the ones who benefit. The people are the ones who did not know the inside details of how the military government operated.
