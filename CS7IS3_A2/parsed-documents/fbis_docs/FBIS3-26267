The 141-km highway took about ten years and ten million yuan (1.15 U.S. dollars) [figure as received] to build because of the difficult terrain and conditions. It starts from Zhamu and ends at Medog. A spokesman for the provincial communications department said that frequent collapses of snow and mountains as well as landslides caused the road-builders "unimaginable difficulties and sacrifices."
