The spokesman, however, declined to disclose whether the North side's letter hinting of the resumption of inspections implies additional overall inspections [chuga chonmyon sachal] of the radiochemical laboratory or the replacement of the surveillance equipment -- as has been insisted by North Korea. The IAEA is closely examining to what level North Korea would accept inspections and the real intention behind its hint of resumption of inspections. The IAEA, while delivering the resolution adopted at the special Governors meeting held last March, had strongly called on the North side to accept additional inspections of the radiochemical laboratory and stressed the necessity of replacing the surveillance equipment, including the reloading of film in surveillance cameras.
