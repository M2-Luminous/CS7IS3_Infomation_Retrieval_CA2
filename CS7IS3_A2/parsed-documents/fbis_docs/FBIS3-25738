A source at the talks said that the meeting is being held as a response to a request by the observers who hope that one week-old differences will be overcome and hope that the two sides will approve specific principles for national reconciliation tomorrow. One of the points of disagreement that is being discussed at the meeting relates to UNITA's radio station the Voice of the Resistance of the Black Cockerel, also known as VORGAN. According to Angolan legislation, political parties can own publications but cannot own radio stations. Meanwhile, UNITA considers VORGAN an exception because it already existed before the legislation was approved. Another point of disagreement relates to the country's administrative decentralization, which the government says is already being implemented. Meanwhile, UNITA wants provincial government to have its own power, at several levels, as well as its own budgetary capacities. Moreover, UNITA wants the principle relating to holding provincial and locals elections to be defined in Lusaka, following a transitional period.
