FR941219-2-00041 FR941219-2-00030 Along with the tentative determination, EPA announced the availability of the application for public comment. EPA received two comments supporting the determination, but no requests for a public meeting. B. Decision In the tentative determination, EPA proposed to fully approve Arizona's MSWLF program. Arizona's application for adequacy determination meets all of the statutory and regulatory requirements established by RCRA. The State of Arizona has the authority to enforce the requirements of its MSWLF program at all MSWLFs in the State, with the exception of those located on Tribal Lands. Accordingly, Arizona is granted a determination of adequacy for all portions of its MSWLF program. In addition to enforcement by the States, Section 4005(a) of RCRA provides that citizens may use the citizen suit provisions of Section 7002 of RCRA to enforce the Federal MSWLF Criteria at 40 CFR part 258 independent of any state enforcement program. As EPA explained in the preamble to the final MSWLF criteria, EPA expects that any owner or operator complying with provisions in a state program approved by EPA should be considered to be in compliance with the federal criteria. See 56 FR 50978, 50995 (October 9, 1991). Today's action takes effect on the date of publication. EPA believes it has good cause under section 553(d) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C 553(d), to put this action into effect less than 30 days after publication in the Federal Register . All of the requirements and obligations in the State's MSWLF program are already in effect as a matter of state law. EPA's action today does not impose any new requirements on the regulated community, nor do these requirements become enforceable by EPA as federal law. Consequently, EPA finds that it does not need to give notice prior to making its approval effective. Compliance With Executive Order 12291 The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of Section 6 of Executive Order 12866. Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this approval will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis. Authority: This notice is issued under the authority of Sections 2002, 4005 and 4007 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6912, 6945, 6947. Dated: December 6, 1994.
