Sources from the office for construction of the Jing-Jiu railway said that by the end of last month, the project, which was started in 1992, has applied a total investment of 10.696 billion yuan, with 626 km of tracks laid. Statistics show that 76 percent of the total designed amount of earth and stone for the whole line's railbed has been put into place, while 62 percent of the bridges and 33 percent of the tunnels have been finished. The 2,370 km-long Jing-Jiu line goes through nine provinces and municipalities from north to south. Originally, it was scheduled for completion in 1997. However, to help ease the present "jammed" conditions of the country's rail transport, the government decided early last year to shorten the construction term and finish the project by the end of 1995. This year the Chinese Ministry of Railways plans to sink 11.3 billion yuan into the Jing-Jiu line, and 80-90 percent of the project will have been finished by the end of the year. An official from the ministry said that if the present construction speed is maintained, the whole Jing-Jiu line will be able to start operation by the end of 1995.
