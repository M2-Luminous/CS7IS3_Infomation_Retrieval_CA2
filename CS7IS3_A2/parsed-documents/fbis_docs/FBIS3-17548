"The West needs Russia as a partner capable of action in political, economic, and strategic terms," Ruehe stressed in St. Petersburg at the weekend. A stable Russia is in the interest of both Germany and Europe as a whole. The West will therefore continue to support the "political, economic, social, and military rebuilding process" in the country. However, Russia must create the conditions for the success of the reforms itself. German-Russian relations have always been particularly important, Ruehe underscored. The friendship between the two countries is an important pillar of present stability and the future security order in Europe. The further deepening of relations, also in the military sphere, is a contribution to "transparency and predictability" on the continent. Ruehe is attending a meeting of the "Bergedorfer discussion round" in St. Petersburg. The association was set up around 30 years ago in Bergedorf near Hamburg. Politicians, military representatives, scientists, and representatives from organizations from Europe and American are taking part.
