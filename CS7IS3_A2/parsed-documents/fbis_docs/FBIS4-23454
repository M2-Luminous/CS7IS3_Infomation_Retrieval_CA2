The contents of the message was not revealed. The governments which make up this "troika" are from three countries that are said to be close to Zairian affairs. The political situation is still confused in Zaire while people are awaiting the appointment of the new prime minister who will be in charge of managing the transition period to the Third Republic. A special commission, set up by the High Council of the Republic- Transition Parliament [HCR-PT] to examine the various candidates submitted, was to submit its report today to the HCR-PT bureau. The Zairian opposition, assembled within the Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition [USOR], is divided on this procedure and the conditions set up to designate the future prime minister. USOR radicals believe that only Mr. Tshisekedi should be appointed prime minister because he was elected by the National Sovereign Conference in August 1992 and then dismissed by Marshal Mobutu. An important USOR faction, led by the Union for the Republic and Democracy, said on its part that the post of prime minister has become "vacant" and presented three candidates for the post.
