Zhang Daxing, the principal criminal, was sentenced to life imprisonment and stripped of his political rights for life, while his accomplice Chen Jiangfu was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment and stripped of his political rights for one year. In December 1993, Zhang Daxing, a self-employed industrial and commercial businessman from Jiangsu's Taicang county who was doing business in Shanghai, asked Chen Jiangfu, a farmer from Jiangsu's Wujin county who wanted to start his own household tailoring business in Shanghai Municipality's Baoshan County, to go out with him under the pretext of doing business. On 28 January 1994, after purchasing air tickets for the Shanghai-Hangzhou flight for the following day, Zhang Daxing told Chen Jiangfu about his plot to hijack the aircraft to Taiwan and showed him a blackmail letter he had written earlier. On 29 January 1994, Zhang Daxing and Chen Jiangfu boarded China Eastern Airlines flight 5513 for Hangzhou. Shortly after the plane took off, Zhang Daxing got up and forced the flight crew to change the plane's course to Taiwan using the blackmail letter and threats to blow up the plane. Meanwhile, Chen Jiangfu followed Zhang Daxing's orders and kept an eye on the people on board. In the course of dealings between the flight crew and the two criminals, the plane landed at Hangzhou's Jianqiao Airport and the two criminals were arrested on the spot. In trying the case, the Hangzhou City Intermediate People's Court uncovered the facts and decided that Zhang Daxing and Chen Jiangfu used threats to hijack the aircraft, disregarding state law. There was sufficient clear evidence to prove that they had hijacked the aircraft. To safeguard normal aviation order and protect the safety of passengers and property, it is necessary to strictly punish criminals who hijack aircraft. In accordance with the relevant stipulations of the "Decision of the National People's Congress Standing Committee on Strictly Punishing Criminal Elements Who Hijack Aircraft" and the "Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China," the Hangzhou City Intermediate People's Court passed initial judgment on principal criminal Zhang Daxing and his accomplice Chen Jiangfu. Zhang Daxing and Chen Jiangfu pleaded guilty and accepted the verdict. As they did not file an appeal within the legally prescribed period, the initial judgment of Hangzhou City Intermediate People's Court became legally binding. A spokesman for the Supreme People's Court said: Hijacking civil airplanes is a grave crime as it seriously endangers the safety of passengers and their property. The crime must be severely punished in accordance with the law. He said: The judicial organs will definitely continue to severely punish without leniency plane hijackers who defy the law and take such risks.
