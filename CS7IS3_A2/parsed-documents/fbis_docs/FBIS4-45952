At present its range is limited to 1,500 km. Agni's shape may also be changed. Dr. A.N. Agarwal, director of the Agni program, gave this information while addressing a function organized by the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. He revealed that there will be no change in the warhead which at present is capable of carrying one tonne of explosives. However, efforts are being made to increase the payload capacity during the third stage of the missile development, but it has no connection with the warhead load. Dr. Agarwal said that the first successful flight of the missile proved that India has been able to acquire the technology of the 10-tonne G [as published] missile type. The later flights proved that the reentry payload can hit the smallest of targets. What after Agni? Replying to the question, Dr. Agarwal said that we are further refining the latest system of flight data analyses. Dr. Agarwal said that the Indian missile program has emerged from many pressures. This has given recognition to India in this field. He said that most of the modern missile techniques are controlled by very few countries. India has developed the technique from indigenous technology and available limited facilities at its own institutes and with the help of its own scientists. He said that the country's young scientists have taken up the new challenges. Equipment banned under the Missile Technology Control regime are being developed. He assured that the country will make rapid progress in this field in future. On the subject of missile technology development, Dr. Agarwal said this was a small program due to which the country can now sit and talk with the superpowers on an equal basis. He said the developed nations are stubborn in this connection and they do not even want to give an ordinary database technique to developing nations. About research work being done in different fields, he said India will become strong technologically and economically in next 20 to 25 years.
