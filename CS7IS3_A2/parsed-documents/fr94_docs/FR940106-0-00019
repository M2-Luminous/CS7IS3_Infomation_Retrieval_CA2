FR940106-0-00019 FR940106-0-00007 Section 295.8 (b) and (c)␣Copyright and Publication_(24 Comments) A number of universities have expressed fear that the new ATP rules will prevent universities or their employees from copyrighting their works. The fear is also raised that the ATP rule will require universities to get the permission of their for-profit collaborators before publishing their research findings. In response, NIST notes that the parts of the ATP rule dealing with the questions raised by these comments on copyright and publication were not proposed to be substantively changed in the Federal Register notice of August 2, 1993. In the old rule, the provision on copyright was found in §295.5(b), and the treatment of publication of research results was found at §295.8(d). In the new rule, the provision on copyright is found in §295.8(b), and the treatment of publication of research results is at §295.8(c). Except for renumbering, the only change that NIST proposed for the old §295.5(b) concerned the governmental use license that each ATP funding recipient is required to provide to NIST for any copyrighted data first produced in the performance of the ATP award. The scope of the governmental use license has been truncated by deleting the authority of the government to distribute computer programs first produced in the performance of the ATP award to users in the United States. The ability of funding recipients to copyright the works of their employees remains unchanged. Both the old and new versions of the ATP regulation state that ``funding recipients'' can copyright works made under ATP. Universities that receive funds under ATP are ``funding recipients''. They are funding recipients if they are members of joint ventures. They are funding recipients if they are subcontractors. Universities get copyright. Accordingly, no change is made to §295.8(c) of the regulation based upon the comments described above. Except for renumbering, the only change that NIST proposed for the old §295.5(d) was to delete the first part of the first sentence. That sentence originally read: ``Although the program will encourage the timely publication of research results by funding recipients, the decision on whether to publish or not will be made by the funding recipient(s).'' In the proposed revision, the sentence was revised to read simply ``The decision on whether to publish or not will be made by the funding recipient(s).'' NIST believes that the regulation is very clear that the decision to publish shall be made by negotiated agreement of the funding recipients and that the for-profit members of a joint venture will not be able to dictate to universities on this matter. This provision has been part of every ATP award made since 1990, and no difficulties have arisen under it. Accordingly, no change is made to section 295.8(c) of the proposed regulation based upon the comments described above. Section 295.14␣Special Financial Reporting_(5 Comments) Two universities and three other not-for-profit organizations commented on proposed section 295.14, which would increase the flexibility of financial reporting requirements and encourage award recipients to retain independent CPA firms to perform audit services, while reserving the right of the Department of Commerce's Office of the Inspector General to determine the timing and nature of these services, and to conduct its own audit. The comments suggested a need for greater specificity as to the applicable OMB regulations which might apply and the conditions under which the Departmental Inspector General would exercise his authority in setting the time frame and scope of audit services. In response, the regulations have been amended to state that the audit principles to be applied to ATP awards are the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) according to the General Accounting Office's ``Government Auditing Standards'' subtitled ``Standards for Auditing Government Organization, Program, Activities and Functions''. Clarifying changes have also been made to the definitions of ``direct costs'' found at §295.2(c) and ``indirect costs'' found at §295.2(h). Section 295.31␣Qualification of Applicants_(1 Comment)
