Eftov: "Inflation Based on False Computations"] [Text] According to the government, last year's inflation reached 240 percent, although the statisticians assess it at about 350 percent. What causes the disparity? Could an erroneous computation by the Republic Statistical Institute make the projections agreed upon with the International Monetary Fund questionable? Why is it that the increased cost of petroleum has not been included in the December inflation? As a result of this "gaffe," wage increases will be lower than they should have actually been. We have learned that the government intends to demand officially that the Republic Statistical Institute correct its data on last year's price and inflation dynamics. On the eve of the new year's meeting with journalists, Institute Director Svetlana Antonovska, the Republic's leading statistician, made the data public. Therefore, Crvenkovski's Cabinet was among those dissatisfied with the work of the statisticians. Naturally, it separated the government's dissatisfaction from the excessively gloomy statistical depiction of the situation and the dissatisfaction of the trade unions and the opposition, for instance, and the excessive embellishment of our reality as depicted in official statistical data. Questionable Timing Essentially, what is the nature of the argument between the government and the statisticians? At the news conference we mentioned, director Antonovska said that last year retail prices (therefore, inflation) rose 349.8 percent. Unlike the statisticians, the calculations of the Ministry of Development indicate that the annual inflation was somewhere in the vicinity of 229.6 percent (the latest increase in petroleum products was not included, the reasons for which will be explained later). The gap between the inflation as computed by the ministry and the assessments made at the beginning of 1993 (an inflation of 233 percent was anticipated) was minimal--1.2 percent. The misunderstanding (let us avoid all sorts of stories and speak of the real differences in the interpretation of the facts, if possible!) lies in the timing in computing the dynamics of retail prices. Namely, the statisticians computed the dynamics of retail prices for the January-December 1993 period in terms of January-December 1992. It is thus that they arrived at the figure of 349.8 percent increase. However, this is only an average annual increase in retail prices (throughout the world this is known as a deflator, which is subsequently applied in determining the level of the public product, in preparing the budget, and in computing the other macroeconomic figures) which includes the inflation carried over from 1992. Therefore, there can be no question whatsoever of an annual inflation, for in this specific case the computations should have covered the period through December 1993 in terms of December 1992, which would amount to 229.6 percent (which was the computation of the Ministry of Development). Wages Affected However, this does not conclude the misunderstandings between the government and the Republic Statistical Institute. In computing retail prices for December, the statisticians did not take into consideration the latest increase in the price of petroleum products. This is quite strange, for the increase took place on the 13th of last month, while the inflation was computed for the period between 21 November and 20 December. Therefore, this did not include the direct impact of the price increases of gasoline (let us not mention the indirect impact, which will be included in computing the January and even the February inflation, which would be normal); the statisticians computed the December retail price increase at being 13.5 percent. Unlike them, in its computations, which include the petroleum price increase, the Ministry of Development estimated that December prices rose by some 18.7 percent. Therefore, the computation of the pace of the annual inflation should be amended. The annual inflation, according to the computations of the Ministry of Development, should amount to about 244.7 percent. The noncomputation of the increase in the prices of petroleum products in the December computation of the increase in retail prices is of purely practical significance as well. On the one hand, instead of raising the December wages, in terms of wages in November, by about 20-21 percent (the actual increase in the cost of living), according to the data of the Republic Statistical Institute, wage increases should not exceed 15.7 percent. It is true that the December lag will be somewhat compensated in determining the cost of living for January. However, it must be borne in mind that the January wages are subject to a different computation method compared to December. To be more specific: wages will be increased at a lesser percentage rate than actually required. Naturally, the fact that increases in the price of petroleum products were not included in the computations to determine the December inflation will also question the government's projection concerning the dynamics of inflation in 1994. At the very beginning, one could project an increase in the planned inflation from 70 to approximately 80 percent. This will annul the heavy insistence of the government on ending the computation of prices by 20 December so that as the start of the new year no more drastic price increases will be expected. This will lower the growth of inflation (a scenario used by all governments who pledge to stabilize prices or launch an anti-inflation program). In the final account, the question arises of observing the limits agreed upon with the International Monetary Fund relative to inflation dynamics. All in all, this entire matter can be characterized as an additional worsening of relations between the government and the Republic Statistical Institute, relations which, in the past as well, could not be considered satisfactory.
