FBIS4-63980 "drsov103cc_94006" FBIS-SOV-94-103 Daily Report 27 May 1994 INTERREGIONAL AFFAIRS ITAR-TASS Carries Press Review for 27 May ITAR-TASS Carries Press Review for 27 May LD2705072994 Moscow ITAR-TASS in English 0635 GMT 27 May LD2705072994 Moscow ITAR-TASS English BFN ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] [Text] Moscow May 27 TASS -- Russian newspapers on Friday run reports by their own correspondents and news agencies about the seizure of a bus near Mineralnye Vody by terrorists, the situation concerning the Crimea, the forthcoming arrival of world-famed writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn in Vladivostok, and the Russian president's meeting with the leaders of the Federal Counter-Intelligence Service (FCS). NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries excerpts from the president's report at the all-Russia meeting of the FCS. "The country acutely needs reliable, intensively working special- purpose agencies. It is essential to remove the burden of totalitarian legacy and at the same time counter disruptive sentiments that hindered the work of fcs personnel," the newspaper quotes the president as saying. NOVAYA YEZHIDNEVNAYA GAZETA (NEW DAILY NEWSPAPER) on the all- Russia FCS meeting: "A wave of resignations and transformations in 1991-1994 has demoralised the FCS which lost both skilled personnel and monopoly on investigation operations". ROSSIISKIYE VESTI interviewed Sergey Filatov, chief of the presidential staff. "The circulation of rumours about personnel changes in the top echelon of powers turns nearly into a system. I would even say that leaks of information have become an instrument of political struggle". Asked what renders state personnel unstable, Filatov said: "The frequency of personnel changes is influenced by the socio-economic condition of society and by the outcome of struggle between political forces". Filatov views this as a transient phenomenon in present-day conditions, "because sometimes compromises are achieved through personnel reshuffles. A compromise in politics makes it possible to ease tension in society and stabilise the situation". KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA continues to publish a series of interviews with Aleksandr Rutskoy. In this instalment, the former vice- president describes the "Lefortovo period". "I pondered a good deal, assessing in-depth the entire spectrum of causes and circumstances that put Russia in the hardest crisis situation. Simultaneously I was writing two books The Collapse of a Power and The Finding of Faith. The former analyses all events that took place in the Soviet Union and Russia from 1990 to the October tragedy of 1993. "After The President's Journal was published, I had to supplement my book with yet another chapter, taking a look at the October events from the position of the democratic press and the `Journal'. Mass media hyped stories about Supreme Soviet snipers but none of them turned up either in Lefortovo, Butyrki or Matrosskaya Tishina prisons. Hence the question -- which side the hired killers-snipers were from?". KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) on the Crimean issue and Ukrainian- Russian talks: "Despite the optimism with which some participants in the Moscow meeting spoke about the positions of the sides drawing closer together, the talks ended in failure, since from the very outset the Ukrainian side manifested a desire to resolve domestic problems at the expense of neighbours, as was the case during the talks on the nuclear disarmament of Ukraine". PRAVDA on the same subject: "One still feels that it is beneficial for certain forces in Ukraine to maintain a heightened interest in the Crimea". The newspaper quotes the Ukrainian publication NEZAVISIMOST, which shares the Rukh movement sentiments, as writing as follows: `The outcome of presidential elections, just as the future of Ukraine and the Crimea, is at stake. Leonid Kravchuk would either be out of reach for competitors, or he would lose the elections completely long before June 26'. ROSSIISKAYA GAZETA analyses the recently issued six presidential decrees: "Unfortunately we must note that upon the cancellation of quotas and licences which are taken stock of by means of computers, we shall have to rely fully on the strict observance of rules by customs personnel and on their integrity. Will that work?"
