The sources said Kohl had proposed a new summit on July 15. Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Martino said nomination of the sole remaining candidate in the race, Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, had been blocked by Britain. He was speaking on the second day of a two-day EU summit which was dominated by a quarrel over a replacement for Commission President Jacques Delors, who retires on January 5 as the EU's top civil servant. Earlier Saturday, the two other official candidates, Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers and the EU's British trade commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan, withdrew their names from the race. Martino told journalists that Major was blocking Dehaene's nomination on the grounds that it had not been properly handled. Expressing support for the British position, he said: "Someone should remind us of important principles." All 12 EU leaders must be in agreement for a candidacy to go forward to the European Parliament for its approval.
