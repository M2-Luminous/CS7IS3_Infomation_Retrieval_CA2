However, the bombing and strafing hit the wives and children of the Para soldiers [former non-communist resistance forces], killing or wounding a number of them, instead of the Democratic Kampuchean forces. The Para soldiers were very angry and condemned Khan Savoeun, Prince Ranariddh, and other FUNCINPEC ringleaders, and fired heavily at the aircraft.
