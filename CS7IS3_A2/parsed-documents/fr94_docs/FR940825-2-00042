Box 1478, Houston, Texas 77251&hyph;1478, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;718&hyph;000 a request pursuant to Sections 157.205 and 157.211 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act for authorization to install a two-inch tap and meter station in Warren County, Mississippi, under its blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;430&hyph;000, all as more fully set forth in the request which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Koch states that the proposed delivery tap will serve the City of Vicksburg, Mississippi (Vicksburg). Koch estimates the cost of installing the proposed facilities to be $6,278, and indicates that it will be reimbursed by Vicksburg for the actual cost of the construction. Koch further states that the volumes proposed to be delivered to Vicksburg will be within Vicksburg's currently effective entitlements, and that the proposed activities will not affect Koch's ability to serve its other existing customers. Comment date: October 3, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice. 4. Shell Offshore, Inc. [Docket No. CP94&hyph;722&hyph;000] Take notice that on August 17, 1994, Shell Offshore, Inc. (SOI), One Shell Square, New Orleans, Louisiana 70139, filed a petition for declaratory order in Docket No. CP94&hyph;722&hyph;000, requesting that the Commission declare that facilities to be constructed on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) would have the primary function of gathering natural gas and would thereby be exempt from the Commission's jurisdiction pursuant to Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the petition which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. SOI states that it proposes to construct a seven-mile, 12-inch pipeline extending from the production platform in Mississippi Canyon Block 194 (MC&hyph;194), offshore Louisiana to a sub-sea interconnect with the 20-inch jurisdictional transmission line jointly owned by Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company and Columbia Gulf Transmission Company in Mississippi Canyon Block 148. SOI further states that the line would be owned by the working interest owners in MC&hyph;194 and would be used to gather their production. SOI indicates that the line would be operated at a pressure of 1250 psig and that compression, dehydration and separation facilities are located on the production platform in MC&hyph;194, but that any processing for the extraction and removal of liquids and liquefiable hydrocarbons would occur at onshore processing plants. SOI seeks a declaratory order holding that the proposed facilities would have the primary function of gathering natural gas and would thereby be exempt from the Commission's jurisdiction pursuant to Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act. In support of its claim that the primary function of the proposed facility is gathering, SOI points out the following: (1) the length (seven miles) and diameter (12 inches) are comparable to other OCS facilities previously determined to be gathering, (2) the geographic configuration of the facility (a small diameter gathering line feeding production into a larger diameter interstate pipeline) is consistent with other OCS gathering facilities, (3) the facility will be located entirely behind onshore processing plants, and (4) the facility will be owned by the working owners in MC&hyph;194 to gather their production to a point where it can be received for transportation onshore. SOI indicates that 20,000 Mcf per day of production from MC&hyph;194 is currently curtailed due to inadequate pipeline capacity, and SOI requests that an expedited decision be issued permitting the facilities to be placed into service during the 1994 offshore Louisiana window. Comment date: September 2, 1994, in accordance with first paragraph of Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.
