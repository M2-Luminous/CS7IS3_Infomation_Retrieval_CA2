FR940527-1-00036 FR940527-1-00014 •MDC 1 (Diseases and Disorders of the Nervous System) We have observed that surgical pacemaker procedures are being performed with increasing frequency for anatomical nerve problems associated with heart block. These diagnoses, diagnosis codes 337.0 (Idiopathic peripheral autonomic neuropathy), 742.8 (Other specified anomalies of nervous system), and 742.9 (Unspecified anomaly of brain, spinal cord, and nervous system), are assigned to MDC 1, but the surgical pacemaker procedures are not. Consequently, when a pacemaker procedure is performed on a patient with one of these diagnoses, the case is assigned to DRG 468. Therefore, we propose to add the following procedure codes to DRGs 7 and 8 (Peripheral and Cranial Nerve and Other Nervous System Procedures): 37.74_Insertion or replacement of epicardial lead (electrode) into epicardium 37.75_Revision of lead (electrode) 37.76_Replacement of transvenous atrial and/or ventricular lead(s) (electrode) 37.77_Removal of lead(s) (electrode) without replacement 37.79_Revision or relocation of pacemaker pocket 37.80_Insertion of permanent pacemaker, initial or replacement, type of device not specified 37.85_Replacement of any type pacemaker device with single-chamber device, not specified as rate responsive 37.86_Replacement of any type pacemaker device with single-chamber device, rate responsive 37.87_Replacement of any type pacemaker device with dual-chamber device 37.89_Revision or removal of pacemaker device In addition, during our review of DRG 468 cases, we found that there are several hundred cases of lower limb amputation procedures with a principal diagnosis from MDC 1. Patients with diabetes often develop complications that require the performance of a lower limb amputation. Although the majority of the diagnosis codes for diabetes are assigned to MDC 10 (Endocrine, Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases and Disorders), cases with a principal diagnosis of diabetes with neurological manifestations (diagnosis codes 250.60, 250.61, 250.62 and 250.63) are assigned to MDC 1. Therefore, we are proposing to move the following procedures to DRGs 7 and 8: 84.11_Amputation of toe 84.12_Amputation through foot 84.13_Disarticulation of ankle 84.14_Amputation of ankle through malleoli of tibia and fibula 84.15_Other amputation below knee 84.16_Disarticulation of knee 84.17_Amputation above knee •MDC 5 (Diseases and Disorders of the Circulatory System) Closed endoscopic biopsy of lung (procedure code 33.27) and open biopsy of lung (procedure code 33.28), diagnostic tools for vascular tumors, are often performed on patients with a principal diagnosis of 228.00 (Hemangioma of unspecified site) or 228.09 (Hemangioma of other sites). Although these principal diagnoses are assigned to MDC 5, the diagnostic procedures are not. Thus, if they are included together on the same claim, the case will be assigned to DRG 468. Therefore, we are proposing to assign procedure codes 33.27 and 33.28 to DRG 120 (Other Circulatory System OR Procedures) in MDC 5. In addition, we identified the following nonextensive OR procedures (that is, procedures assigned to DRG 477) as appropriate to move to MDC 5: 40.11_Biopsy of lymph structure 40.19_Other diagnostic procedures on lymphatic structures 40.21_Excision of deep cervical lymph node 40.23_Excision of axillary lymph node 40.24_Excision of inguinal lymph node 40.29_Simple excision of other lymphatic structure 40.3_Regional lymph node excision
