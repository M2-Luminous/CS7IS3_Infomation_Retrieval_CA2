Under the amendments, compensation claims will be filed at the Finance Ministry within five years from the coming into force of the act (instead of three years, as established previously). The amendment was prompted by the fact that many people failed to submit their claims within the set period because of organizational difficulties, i.e. inability to gather the required documents in time. The parliamentary Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) that has been boycotting parliament's work for a month now, took part in the debate and the vote. The MP's continued to debate at second reading parts of the Commercial Code, regulating the state of insolvency (known also as the bankruptcy act). At a meeting behind closed doors the Parliamentary Foreign Policy Committee adopted a stand on the memorandum of CE [Council of Europe] Parliamentary Assembly rapporteurs Domenique Coloumberg and Friedrich Koening on Bulgaria's adherence to the commitments made upon its admission to this organization. The two rapporteurs visited Bulgaria this April. All parliamentary forces supported the stand, except for those from the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) who walked out. Mr. Ivan Genov, MP of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), told BTA's reporter that "the memorandum is excessively one- sided and represents only the attitude of the SDS, ignoring all other political forces." In his opinion, the committee's stand is intended to prevent the Council of Europe from interfering in internal political struggles. "Bulgaria strictly observes its commitments as member of the Council of Europe. There is political pluralism in this country, a freely elected parliament and a free press. The human rights are guaranteed. The committee understands that the transition naturally poses serious problems, but they do not call Bulgaria's commitments to the CE in question," runs the stand. The SDS representatives opposed it. "This is the first time someone dares accuse CE rapporteurs in partiality and prejudice," said MP Asparukh Panov. Later today the MP's of the SDS declared that the memorandum was objective and benevolent towards Bulgaria and to the difficulties it is facing in the period of transition to market economy. At its meeting today, attended by representatives of the Defence Ministry, the Foreign Ministry and the Presidency, the Parliamentary National Security Committee approved a draft resolution on the participation of Bulgarian battleships in Turkish military exercises. The committee insists that the draft resolution be debated at a plenary sitting as soon as possible, as the two exercises begin July 4. The motion was made by the Council of Ministers. The committee heard experts' reports on different aspects of the document for Bulgaria's participation in the Partnership for Peace initiative. The document was approved by the Council of Ministers as a basis for negotiations with NATO.
