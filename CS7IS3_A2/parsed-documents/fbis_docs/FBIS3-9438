Talks reopened Thursday and were continuing Friday between the rump state of Yugoslavia, made up of Serbia and Montenegro, and the other former Yugoslav republics of Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], Geneva peace conference spokesman John Mills said. But non-Serb sources said the talks were as unproductive as earlier sessions because the Serbian authorities refused to provide documents needed for a realistic evaluation of the former state's assets. Mills said talks by the working group, headed by Danish ambassador to Berne Els Johansson, would be "a drawn-out process." Another ex-Yugoslav working group, on humanitarian issues, was due to meet Friday afternoon in Geneva headed by Sadako Ogata of the UN High Commission for Refugees who returned recently from a visit to Bosnia-Herzegovina.
