We are new independent states and therefore we have mutual interests in many spheres. We would primarily wish to develop political cooperation, but also economic cooperation, as we have good conditions for this, Ukrainian Minister Anatoliy Zlenko stated following the signing of the documents. We had talks on the political situation in the region, the situation in Croatia and Ukraine, the promotion of economic relations which lag behind the political will, and on political relations, because there are no open questions between Ukraine and Croatia, Mate Granic stated. He announced that treaties on friendship and cooperation between the two states, treaties on economic, cultural, medical, and transport cooperation, and several other important documents are being prepared. The Croatian minister informed journalists that his talks with the Ukrainian minister also referred to all important issues in Croatian and Ukrainian foreign policy. Minister Granic also informed the Ukrainian minister about the Geneva negotiations, his visit to Italy in February, and Croatia's desire to be admitted to the Council of Europe and to join the Partnership for Peace program.
