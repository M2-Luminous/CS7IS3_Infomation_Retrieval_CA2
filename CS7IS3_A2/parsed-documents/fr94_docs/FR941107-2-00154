FR941107-2-00154 FR941107-2-00088 IV. Commission's Findings and Order Granting Temporary Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change The Commission finds that the NYSE's proposal to extend the pilot for auxiliary closing procedures on expiration days through October 1995, is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange. Specifically, the Commission finds that an extension of the pilot for auxiliary closing procedures on expiration days is consistent with section 6(b)(5) of the Act. 6 Section 6(b)(5) requires, among the other things, that the rules of a national securities exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to perfect the mechanism of a free and open market, and to protect investors and the public interest. For the reasons set forth below, the Commission believes that the NYSE proposal furthers the objectives of section 6(b)(5) of the Act. 6 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5) (1988). The NYSE's auxiliary closing procedures were initially adopted in September 1986 to apply to triple expirations. 7 The Commission has extended these procedures to all monthly expiration Fridays on a yearly pilot basis since 1988. 8 These procedures resulted from efforts by the Commission and the self-regulatory organizations to address stock market volatility associated with the expiration of index derivative products traded in conjunction with the underlying component stocks as part of index derivative related trading strategies. 7 See supra note 3. 8 See supra notes 3&hyph;4. In our 1993 Approval Order, the Commission extended the NYSE's MOC pilot program procedures through October 31, 1994, and requested that the NYSE provide the Commission with specific data by July 31, 1994, detailing the NYSE's experience with the pilot program and containing an analysis of the effectiveness of the expiration Friday procedures in reducing volatility. Specifically, the Commission requested data covering expiration Fridays from October 1993 through June 1994. The Commission requested that the report include: (1) The names of the pilot stocks and the imbalance (if any) at 3:40 and at the close for those stocks that had an imbalance of MOC orders of 50,000 shares or more at 3:40; (2) for those stocks with an imbalance of 50,000 shares or more at 3:40, the names of the stocks where the imbalance changed from one side of the market (sell or buy) to the other side (buy or sell) due to cancellations of MOC orders; (3) for all pilot stocks, all MOC order imbalances (of any size) as of 4:00 p.m.; (4) the change in price of the closing transactions from the previous trade for all pilot stocks; (5) the change in price of the closing transactions from the price of transactions at 4:00 p.m. (if there were no transactions precisely at 4:00 p.m., the NYSE was to use the price from the transaction effected closet in time to 4:00 p.m.) for all pilot stocks; and (6) for each pilot stock, the number of shares in MOC orders submitted by 3:40 p.m. that were canceled for any reason prior to the close. The Commission also stated that the report should include: (1) The change in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (``DJIA'') at the close on each expiration Friday; (2) opening prices and daily trading ranges of the pilot stocks on expiration Fridays, as well as the following Mondays; and (3) price volatility as measured by the change in price from the last regular way trade to the closing price, including historical data analyzing price volatility at the close prior to the implementation of the prohibition on canceling MOC orders after 3:45 p.m. and the other MOC procedures. Finally, in our approval order regarding QIX auxiliary closing procedures, the Commission requested that the Exchange also include in its report all of the above requested data for QIX expiration days which expire at the en of the calendar quarter. The Commission requested that the NYSE provide the Commission with a report by July 31, 1994 covering expirations through June 1994. The NYSE submitted a report to the Commission on July 26, 1994. The report covers expiration Fridays for the period November 1993 through June 1994 and the December 31, 1993 and March 31, 1994 quarterly expirations. For that period, the NYSE reports that there were 117 (out of 413 total) stocks with buy imbalances greater than 50,000 shares at 3:40 p.m. Of these, 84 still had MOC buy imbalances greater than 50,000 at the close and three had reversed to sell imbalances under 50,000. In contrast, there were only 10 stocks with sell imbalances over 50,000 at 3:40 p.m., of which five still had sell balances over 50,000 shares at the close. In general, both the number of stocks with imbalances over 50,000 shares and the average number of shares in the imbalance declined between 3:40 p.m. and the close. The report also discusses MOC prices and price changes at 4:00 p.m. and at the close. The data show very little volatility at the close. Over half the stocks had no change at the close, 89.3% changed one-eighth point or less, and j96.1% changed one-quarter point or less. The stocks with large imbalances also did not exhibit much volatility at the close. The stocks with buy imbalances over 50,000 shares at the close averaged an increase of slightly more than one-eighth; the stocks with sell imbalances over 50,000 shares at the close averaged less than one-eighth point decline. With respect to QIX expiration procedures, the Exchange states that there were only 4 stocks with buy imbalances greater than 50,000 shares at 3:40 p.m., only one of which still had an MOC buy imbalance greater than 50,000 shares at the close. In contrast, there were 26 stocks with sell imbalances over 50,000 at 3:40 p.m., 17 of which still had sell balances over 50,000 shares at the close.
