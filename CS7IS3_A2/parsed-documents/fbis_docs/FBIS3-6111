This proposal was made in a letter sent today to the Alliance of the Anti-Nuke Peace Movement, the Alliance of the Environmental Movement and the Civic Federation for Economic Justice of South Korea. Noting that the South Korean authorities had dumped 11,000 trillion becquerels of nuclear waste into the sea in the 1986-92 period, the letter goes on: "Such nuclear waste dumping by the South Korean authorities is a crude breach of the international conventions on protection and conservation of the sea environment and an anti-national, anti-human crime inflicting immeasurable disasters on our nation and mankind. "The random dumping of nuclear waste by South Korea vividly shows how far the South Korean authorities have gone in developing nuclear arms while crying over `suspected nuclear programme of the North.' "It is entirely natural that in South Korea environmental organisations, people and broad public circles took issue with the authorities' criminal dumping of nuclear waste and have risen in a struggle against it. "We hope your organisations will turn out more courageously in the just struggle in the future to check the South Korean authorities' criminal nuclear waste dumping and nuclear arms development."
