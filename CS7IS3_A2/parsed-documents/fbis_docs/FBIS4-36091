In a resolution passed today, the conference stresses its complete solidarity with the Lebanese Government and people, and support for Lebanon in defending its sovereignty by all available means. The conference calls on the UN Security Council and the cosponsors of the peace conference in the Middle East, "the United States and Russia" to move immediately to put an end to Israeli aggression, which is against the UN Charter and is designed to torpedo the peace process. The resolution calls for saving the peace process from collapse. The resolution expresses the nonaligned conference's concern over the Israeli acts of aggression against Lebanese towns and villages. It said that the new massacre committed by Israel and previous kidnappings and acts of terror are no doubt intended to torpedo the peace process. Hisham Dimashqiyah, Lebanese ambassador in Cairo and head of the Lebanese delegation to the nonaligned conference, delivered a speech at the conference. He said that by its repeated acts of aggression against south Lebanon Israel is violating Lebanon's sovereignty and defying the peace process. He called on the conference to pass a resolution strongly condemning Israeli aggression and stressing solidarity with the Lebanese people in defending their sovereignty by all available means. The foreign ministers and heads of delegations of Syria, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Palestine, Morocco, and Yemen delivered speeches in which they expressed support for Lebanon and called on the conference to pass an unequivocal resolution condemning Israeli aggression against south Lebanon. They also stressed that they support the Lebanese authorities efforts to extend their control throughout Lebanon. Dimashqiyah told MENA that the Israeli aggression against Lebanon will impact negatively on the peace process in the Middle East, particularly the Lebanese track. Responding to a question on Lebanon's intention to freeze the peace talks' Lebanese-Israeli track, Dimashqiyah said that freezing the negotiations may happen afer consultations among the higher Lebanese authorities, the Government, and the Chamber of Deputies. He said that the current Israeli air raids on Lebanon are part of a series of recurring acts of aggression, along with kidnappings of citizens and other air raids that kill and wound dozens of Lebanese. He said that the Lebanese Army is in a state of alert to repulse any aggression in cooperation with the Syrian forces operating in Lebanon. He noted that Israel uses any provocations or clashes on the border as a pretext to launch acts of aggression deep inside Lebanese territory, not just provocations in areas at the borders.
