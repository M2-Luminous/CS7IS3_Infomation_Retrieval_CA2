C. Tsai] [Text] Taipei, May 20 (CNA) -- The prosecutor's Office of the Taipei District Court's Shihlin Branch on Friday [20 May] indicted two arms dealers on bribery charges in a major arms procurement scandal involving much of the navy's top brass. Prosecutor Chen Jui-jen said that Cheng Cheng-kuang and Liu Shu of the Hsih Kuang Co., the Taiwan agency of an Italian arms supplier, were charged with violating the Corruption Punishment Act. The two arms dealers were accused of offering and paying bribes to two navy commanders who eventually helped the Hsih Kuang Co. win a bid to sell a reconnaissance ship to the navy, Chen noted. If convicted, Cheng and Liu will face up to seven years in prison. In addition, Liu, Hsih Kuang's president, was indicted for embezzling NT [New Taiwan] $2.5 million in company funds -- money which Cheng wanted to use to bribe a navy officer. He would face an additional five years in prison if convicted of the charge. This is the first time indictments have been brought against civilians involved in the arms buying scandal, which came to light last December after the body of navy Captain Yin Ching-feng was found floating in the sea off Taiwan's northeastern coast. He was murdered before he could disclose corruption surrounding the award of lucrative military contracts. In mid-April, military prosecutors indicted captain Kuo Li-heng, a navy weapons procurement officer who has been in custody since late last year, for corruption and leaking military secrets. Kuo will be tried by a military court and will face either the death penalty or life in prison if convicted. He was charged with taking bribes totaling NT$12 million (US$446,096) offered by civilian arms dealers in exchange for military secrets. Adm. Ku Chung-lien replaced Adm. Chuang Ming-yao as navy commander-in-chief a month ago after Chuang stepped down as a show of responsibility for the affair.
