What are your views on nuclear arms, and how do you explain the continued nuclear activities of Pakistan against loud criticism and accusations that it is weapon- oriented at a time when the world trend is towards disarmament in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union? A: Pakistan does not oppose the NPT. We have never refused to endorse the NPT. However, as a matter of principle we cannot accept discriminatory treatment vis-a-vis our neighbour India. In fact, as early as 1979, Pakistan had proposed simultaneous adherence by India and Pakistan to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. In that year we had also proposed that the two countries should simultaneously accept the IAEA safeguards. We have also called for the establishment of a nuclear weapons free zone in South Asia and a bilateral/regional nuclear test ban. Regrettably India has taken a negative stance on all these fair and constructive proposals which are aimed at preventing nuclear proliferation in our region. When the NPT was adopted in the U.N. General Assembly in 1968; Pakistan voted for it. We clarified then that Pakistan would sign the NPT if our neighbour India did so also. Pakistan has always been concerned about India's desire to develop nuclear weapons. These fears were realised when India exploded a nuclear device in 1974. Pakistan continues to maintain a principled position that it will accept any non-proliferation measure that is equitable and non- discriminatory between Pakistan and India. Therefore, if India signs the NPT, Pakistan will do so simultaneously. On nuclear arms, let me state it categorically that Pakistan fully shares the view that nuclear proliferation would be destablishing and would threaten international peace and security. This is more true after the end of the cold war and the landmark agreements between the U.S. and Russia to reduce their nuclear arsenals. Pakistan has resolutely supported international efforts aimed at achieving complete nuclear disarmament as well as nonproliferation, particularly through the establishment of equitable and non-discriminatory regional non-proliferation regimes. Our position regarding the U.S. nuclear policy in South Asia is that the Pressler Amendment which has created difficulties in the Pak-U.S. relationship, is a discriminatory law as it applies only to Pakistan and not to India or other countries which are known to be seeking a nuclear non-proliferation as India feels no compulsion to respond to the many constructive measures we have proposed for keeping South Asia free of nuclear weapons. The criticism against Pakistan over the nuclear issue is unjustified. We remain committed to using our nuclear programme for peaceful purposes only. While, in the development of this peaceful nuclear programme, we have acquired a certain technical capability, Pakistan has taken a firm political decision not to use this capability to produce nuclear weapons. Statements made by us reflectng this position are meant as reaffirmation of the peaceful nature of Pakistan's nuclear programme to preclude any misunderstanding.
