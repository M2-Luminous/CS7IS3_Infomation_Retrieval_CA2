Tsekov felt there were a sufficient number of sober-minded individuals among the Ukrainian lawmakers and they were knowledgeable about the Crimean problems. If, however, the Ukrainian parliament moved to kill Crimean autonomy, Tsekov said, the peninsula would break off all relations with Kiev. And moves to sever relations were not likely to be peaceful, he said. According to Tsekov, Leonid Kravchuk could play up the Crimean problem to win support in Ukraine's western provinces. First of all, Tsekov said, the Crimean parliament must concentrate efforts on independent statehood, and then -- on the restoration of unity with Russia. That was what the lawmakers called for before they were elected, Tsekov said, and they had to meet their electoral pledges. In Tsekov's view, the first thing the parliament must do, was to restore the Constitution of May 6, 1992 which said Crimea's relations with Ukraine were limited to the treaty on bilateral relations. Next, Tsekov said, the peninsula's executive and legislative branches would have to send a joint mission to Kiev. The mission would try to convince the Ukrainian leaders of the need to address the Crimean problem. According to Tsekov, the Constitution of May 6, 1992 could be restored in a matter of two weeks, after a discussion by parliament. Tsekov said Crimea would first sign a treaty of economic union with Moscow, and treaties on a political and military union would soon follow one after the other. A treaty on a military and political union could, however, be signed between Russia, on the one hand, and Crimea and Ukraine, on the other. In Tsekov's view, Kiev would sooner or later come to realize the necessity of building a union, if not a confederation or federation, with Russia. The territorial integrity of the Republic of Crimea must be insured in the context of the Commonwealth's Collective Security Treaty but, Tsekov said, Crimea must have its own Guards.
