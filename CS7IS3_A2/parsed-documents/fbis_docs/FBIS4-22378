As a result, the enemy is defeated, the amazed public applauds, and as for the truth -- well, nobody will think to rifle through boring papers, checking what is written in them against the arguments being propagated in the popular press. It is an old trick, but a good one, and it is used very frequently. A recent example is the comparative table printed in the weekly ARGUMENTY I FAKTY (No. 11, March 1994) entitled "The Path of Russia's Economic Development -- How V. Chernomyrdin Sees It. And How Ye. Gaydar Sees It," which was then commented on by experts A. Illarionov and A. Shapovalyanets [See FBIS Report: Central Eurasia -- FBIS-USR-94-029, 24 March 1994, pp 20-21]. Without undertaking to evaluate the authenticity of the viewpoint expounded by the "Russia's Choice" leader on Russia's paths of economic development, let us try to analyze how far the ARGUMENTY I FAKTY version accords with the position of the current government chairman, particularly as in recent months Viktor Chernomyrdin has made repeated public statements about it and the government's actions are not only in sight of, but under close scrutiny from the public and the press. So, what aims, according to the version printed in the weekly publication, is Viktor Chernomyrdin pursuing? Number one on the list is "halting the slump in production" in combination with "the reform of the state-controlled sector of the economy." Immediately the interpretation is that, in the authors' view, this must mean preferential credit for industry and the agricultural sector; large-scale investment by means of emissions; concessions to specific enterprises, sectors, and regions; state control over economic activity; the expansion of licensing, the regulation and level of prices, and so on. In other words, an entire complement of nightmares, accompanying the advent of "Red directors" and, accordingly, the collapse of reform. Clearly, this fossilized stance is in stark contrast to curtailing inflation, cutting large-scale benefits, financing the budget via "non-inflationary sources," and other exemplary measures. But in fact, everything is precisely the other way around. Both in the government program, adopted on V. Chernomyrdin's initiative last August, and in all the premier's program speeches without exception priority was invariably accorded to the fight against inflation and the achievement of financial stability. The government chairman speaks equally firmly and consistently in favor of austere restrictions on the issue of money and concessions and of highly specific and purposeful support of efficient production units, and against dishing out credits. And the government's economic policy has nothing whatever to do with expanding the use of such outmoded instruments as licensing, or freezing profitability levels and prices. The government program also stipulates that the creation of an efficient economy is only possible on the basis of market mechanisms, and on condition that there is "a significant restriction on state intervention in the economy and a cut in the share of the state sector." Moreover, these are not just declarations. The measures set out in the government program to do away with preferential credit, abolish inefficient concessions of an individual nature offered to enterprises and regions on taxes and customs duties, and cut the range of goods subject to quota and licensing are already being implemented. The draft 1994 Federal Budget submitted to the Duma stipulates rigid requirements for targeted financing from state expenditure on developing the national economy, the size of which expenditure is restricted by the rigid frameworks of priority federal programs. At the same time, support of such sectors as the agro-industrial complex and the coal industry will be guaranteed basically via sources of finance not entailing further emissions, for which it is planned in the budget to form a special support fund. Likewise it is planned to cut drastically budget expenditure on paying out subsidies and allowances to state enterprises. Why then was it necessary to pass off the dreams of hotheads from the federation of commodity producers as the stance, indeed as the intentions of the government leader? Actually the question is purely rhetorical. It is all patently obvious. However, let us go a little further into the political labyrinth whither the authors of ARGUMENTY I FAKTY are consigning us. The Russian prime minister's hidden aim is declared to be "military and political merger with neighboring foreign states." The alternative? It goes without saying -- "integration with neighboring foreign states on an economic basis." It is true -- for some reason the premier intends to implement his "military-political" designs, according to the ARGUMENTY I FAKTY version, exclusively by means of "the accelerated creation of a ruble zone, continued financial aid to close neighbors, and the introduction of a fixed ruble rate." Where this astounding information came from remains a mystery. After all, the government's position on a whole range of tricky problems regarding Russia's relationships with neighboring foreign states has been stated publicly on many occasions. Even in the Message from the Russian Federation President, the key idea is to combine economic reintegration with a deepening of political, including military, cooperation among CIS countries. The government was never interested in dissolving the Russian economy, or in the amorphous post-Soviet economic area. The premier's statement and, in particular, the progress of the difficult talks on a whole range of problems in Russia's economic relasionships with the CIS countries indicate that the priority remains invariably the defense of Russian interests. In the draft 1994 budget the extent of financial aid to the neighboring countries is being cut significantly and its availability regulated. As for the highly complex process of unifying monetary systems, there is no mention at all of forcing this difficult matter. The government program lays down as a compulsory condition of the functioning of the ruble zone the introduction of a single currency and the implementation of money-credit and budget policy strictly coordinated with Russia. It is possible that these terms may not suit some of the partners. But Russia can do no other if it wants to avoid emergency financial donorship and as a result an inflationary slide. Finally, there is one more "political" (or more precisely, "geopolitical") contradiction. According to the version from the authors of ARGUMENTY I FAKTY, V. Chernomyrdin's aim is "to raise Russia's role as a world power" at a time when Ye. Gaydar is pushing merely for "the expansion of contacts with the West and the integration of Russia's economy into the world economy." Such a juxtaposition cannot be described as anything but imaginary. Russia's status as a world power in no way contradicts the "opening up" of its economy or consistent and equal integration into the world economy. But its relationship with the world (of course, not only with the West) is determined by our fatherland's unique Eurasian situation. So this is the "portrait" painted. Admittedly it is no more akin to the original than an image churned out by a cheap photographer, on which it is difficult to distinguish the eyes and the nose and the ears are missing altogether. But this does not matter, as the main thing is that it is possible to make profound forecasts. For instance, to frighten citizens with the prospect of 100-percent inflation a month or a currency rate of 25-30,000 rubles to the dollar. Why not 50,000 or 60,000? After all, these numbers are conjured up by expert A. Illarionov from that very same source whence the arguments about the government's position derived -- from thin air. Moreover, even our expert's opponent, A. Shapovalyanets, commenting on Ye. Gaydar's "alternative" program, also falls into the trap of nightmare prophecies. It is typical that both commentators, despite different points of departure, conclude their predictions almost identically, forecasting social explosions on the basis of hyperinflation. But then, you only have to invent nightmares to end up frightening yourself with them. It is merely a pity for the 6.5 million readers of the popular weekly that the authors did not look before leaping. The result is confusion, and nothing more.
