The document was signed at the Villa Dalmacija in Split in the presence of U.S. mediator-ambassador Jack Galvin. By signing the document, the military leaders of the Croat and Muslim sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina accepted and strongly upheld the earlier peace agreement concluded through UNPROFOR's [UN Protection Forces] mediation and accepted certain tasks concerning the organization of the federal army of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The signing of this document by the military delegations of the HVO and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army was described by U.S. mediator Jack Galvin as historic. Galvin paid tribute to both sides for their support and readiness to implement the document in its entirety. The cease-fire process, as U.S. mediator Galvin said in a statement for the public, has taken off successfully in the field and is even being implemented beyond all expectations. This initial step and today's signing of the document by the military commanders of the HVO and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army are also important because they prove to the United States that the agreement signed in Washington was something acceptable to both sides.
