A provincial official said that of the total number of the province's ethnic officials 68.5 have education up to college or special secondary school level. More than half of them hold the titles as professors or technicians. Yunnan is home to 25 ethnic minorities, which make up 34 percent of its population. Most of them used to live primitive lives before the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949. To improve life and education for these ethnic people, the province has earmarked over one million yuan (about 110,000 U.S. dollars) every year to help start special training classes for ethnic officials. Now the number of technical personnel among the ethnic population has hit a record high of 127,000. Many of them are very active in various walks of life such as agriculture, engineering, education, science and technology. Some have become acclaimed professors and research scientists. At present, ethnic-minority people hold such prominent positions in the Communist Party, government and legislature as deputy party head, provincial governor and deputy governor, head of the provincial people's congress and chairman or vice-chairman of provincial committees of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.
