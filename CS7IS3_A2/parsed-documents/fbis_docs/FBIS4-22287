At first, having encountered the natural materialization of such a distinctive (moreover, correct) mark, the Japanese tried somehow to publicly express their dissatisfaction. Having arrived in Moscow 2 years ago to participate in an international conference on a Mideast settlement, Watanabe was unspeakably disappointed by the sad circumstance that, regardless of the importance of Russo-Japanese relations, B. Yeltsin will not be able to receive him. Today, already the successor of Watanabe, Tsutomu Hata, having found out that his long-ago planned visit coincided with the improvised departure of the president of Russia for Sochi, did not begin to display rude disapproval, although the Japanese side in mild form did reserve strictly surprise about such an unfortunate coincidence. Moreover, evidently, there is no such anti-Japanese intention in the actions of our president. Now the administration is encountering much more serious problems than the fate of four points on the map--the Kurile Islands. And, therefore, the visit of a Japanese looks sooner like a tribute to general diplomatic routine: It was simply impossible for any "territorial break-throughs" to occur in the talks. The situation of the present patriotic rise is such that even to publicly hint at the return of the islands to Japan in the near historical future is dangerous. Even on Smolenskaya Ploshchad servility before the West is not in favor now. Even the transparent Japanese hints at the direct link between the territorial question and the extension of massive economic assistance to Russia do not produce the former impression on the Kremlin. But since no Japanese spy was discovered in Moscow in recent weeks, the talks proceeded calmly. Both Kozyrev and Hata gently remained in their positions, not skimping on general diplomatic assurances of the highest respect for one another. Moreover, Russia and Japan also have other points of mutual interests, in particular, the Japanese are ready to take upon themselves the burden of permanent members of the UN Security Council, and Russians would prefer to have a membership card of the club of the greatest industrial powers that is now called the "Great Seven." The Japanese have thus far not expressed special enthusiasm in regard to the transformation of the "Seven" into the "Eight." Even in the purely political sphere. But, one must suppose, bargaining is entirely appropriate here.
