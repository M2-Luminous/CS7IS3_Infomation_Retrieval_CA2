He said the Malaysian ban was not an attempt to impose its standards and values on the British. Malaysia had no choice but to impose the ban because the country was made a victim and falsely accused of wrongdoings in Anglo-Malaysian trade by the British media, he said. We suffer in every single decision that we made... Every contract awarded to the British will create problems for the government, for the leaders and the people, he told reporters at the airport here before returning to Kuala Lumpur. Anwar was asked whether Malaysia's action against British companies could be compared to the United States' policy to link trade with human rights issues such as towards China.
