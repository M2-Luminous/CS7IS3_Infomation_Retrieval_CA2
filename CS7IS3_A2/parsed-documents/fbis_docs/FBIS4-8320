Asked if during the almost five hours of discussion between the chairman of "one of the few genuinely right-wing parties in Europe and the leader of the post-communist Polish People's Party" there reigned only harmony and agreement, Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus said he would be "more careful about using these easy labels such as post-communist," because the world was always a little bit more complicated. He had talked to Pawlak about completely specific things, in the realization of which both countries were interested. "Thus I do not think there was any room, essentially, for disagreement on such matters," Klaus said. He said that Poland, at least according to Pawlak, did not have differing foreign policy ambitions. However, Klaus said it was not impossible that if he had spoken to President Lech Walesa or Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski, the difference in opinion on some things might have been greater.
