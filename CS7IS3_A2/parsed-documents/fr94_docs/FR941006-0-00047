FR941006-0-00047 FR941006-0-00012 (ii) A copy of the requested records. (iii) The OPR's and SJA's written recommendations. (iv) The exemption cited. (v) The reason for denial. (b) The OPR locates the information and recommends its release. In cases where several OPRs have functional responsibility for the information, the primary OPR is the one responsible for most of the information in the document. The OPR: (1) Works with the offices of collateral responsibility (OCR) inside and outside the Air Force, considers the opinions and information they provide, and makes the final release decision. (2) Forwards records that need coordination with other Air Force functional areas and outside agencies to the MAJCOM or FOA FOIA office, which sends them to the appropriate FOI office for review and return for final decision. (3) Answers each functional request and follows FOIA denial procedures for records withheld. ยง806.16 Referrals. A FOIA manager refers requests to another FOIA office after consulting with them when the request asks for records or information originated by someone other than the activity receiving the request or when an OPR finds records in a search that belong to another activity. (a) Refer FOIA requesters to sources that can provide unaltered publications and processed documents, such as maps, charts, regulations, and manuals to the public, with or without charge. For example, people can obtain documents published in the Federal Register without using the FOIA. The National Technical Information Service (NTIS), 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161, sells current Air Force standard numbered (departmental) publications, but does not stock superseded, obsolete, rescinded, classified, FOUO, limited (L), or ``X'' distribution Air Force publications. FOIA requests for these publications go through normal FOIA channels to the OPR for a release recommendation. (b) Usually, tell the requester about the referral, identify the record referred as security permits, and tell the requester to expect an answer from the agency or activity receiving the referral. (c) If a request would involve many referrals, tell the requester where to address the request; don't refer it yourself. (d) Before releasing records or information originated with the National Security Council (NSC) or the White House, refer them through the Office of the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense (Public Affairs) Directorate for Freedom of Information (OATSD[PA]DFOISR), Washington DC 20301. The OATSD(PA) will consult with them and reply back to you. (e) The General Accounting Office (GAO) is outside the Executive Branch and not subject to the FOIA. However, if the FOIA manager receives a FOIA request directly from the public or referred from GAO for GAO documents that contain Air Force or DoD information, process the request under FOIA. ยง806.17 Categorizing requesters. (a) Requesters' fees depend on which group they belong to: (1) Category 1: Commercial. Requesters pay all search, review, and duplication. To decide who belongs in this category find out how these requesters will use the requested documents. If you are unsure how the requester plans to use the records or the request itself does not clearly state plans, seek additional information before you categorize the request. (2) Category 2: Educational or Noncommercial Scientific Institution or News Media. Requesters get the first 100 copies free and pay for additional copies. These requesters do not pay search or review charges. Requesters who use requested records to write and spread news are not considered commercial requesters. (3) Category 3: Others. Requesters get the first 2 hours of search and the first 100 copies free. These requesters do not pay review charges. (b) Analyze each request to categorize the requester. If you think the requester's category differs from what the requester claims, ask the individual for more justification and say you cannot begin searching for records until you have agreed on the category. If the requester does not send the FOIA manager more justification in reasonable time (normally, 30 calendar days), the manager makes a final decision and notifies the requester of the decision and of the right to appeal it. (c) Tell requesters that you cannot begin to answer their requests until they state they will pay the costs set for their category.
