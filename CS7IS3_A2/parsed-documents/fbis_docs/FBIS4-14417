[passage omitted] Viktor Chernomyrdin sees no serious problem in the significant difference in value between the Russian and Hungarian deliveries. [Chernomyrdin] It has various reasons. I would not hold either side responsible for that, and I would certainly not blame either of them. The transitional, semi-market nature of the Russian economy has of course a considerable influence on this. [passage omitted] The creation of the legal basis of a market economy is now taking place in Russia. The bilateral agreements to be signed in Budapest, for instance, will partially serve this purpose. Economic processes cannot be changed all at once. However, I am certain that the imbalance in Hungarian-Russian exports and imports will gradually decrease. [Izbeki] The issue of debts inherited from the Soviet era is also a subject matter in which our countries are ahead of everyone else. The Russian Government is determined to settle this debate once and for all and as soon as possible. Viktor Chernomyrdin answered my question regarding this. He welcomes the Hungarian proposal that part of the still outstanding debt of about $800 million would be invested here in Russia. The details, of course, are yet to be discussed, but in theory, it is supported. Thus, I see no problem regarding this. The debt issue can be resolved, he added. Russia is a reliable partner in energy deliveries as well, he said. [Chernomyrdin] We undertake responsibility for what we have promised and agreed on. [passage omitted] As far as our neighbors are concerned, in my view, Ukraine has to handle this matter in a civilized manner, as it is customary in the world. The diversion or tapping of deliveries, or similar non-business methods are unacceptable. Russia and the recipient European countries expect nothing less from the transit countries than to fulfill their business obligations. [Izbeki] Viktor Chernomyrdin, who has been Russia's prime minister since December 1992, is of the view that the Russian reforms, the economy's transformation, could not have moved forward any faster, more successfully and less painfully than they did. [passage omitted] Concerning the power struggle within the Russian top leadership, Viktor Chernomyrdin denied the allegation that he was striving for greater power than what he currently has.
