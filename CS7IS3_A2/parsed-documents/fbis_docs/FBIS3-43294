This claim has been made in a telephone call to THE CITIZEN newspaper. John Matham has the details: THE CITIZEN reports that a man calling himself Karl Zimbiri phoned the paper and identified himself using a pre-arranged code word established several months ago. Zimbiri reportedly said that an elite unit called the People's Concern had carried out both the Heidelberg attack and the St James Church massacre in July. Zimbiri says the unit is still in the country ready to strike again. He says it is propaganda to suggest that the unit has fled to Transkei. Zimbiri says the People's Concern is a special unit formed 10 months ago as a sub-structure of APLA. He says the unit consists of APLA's best people who have been trained in countries around the world. The PAC does not want to comment on the alleged existence of a special unit. The Law and Order Ministry has not been available for comment.
