The session was attended by Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, Foreign Minister Irfan Ljubijankic, [names indistinct], heads of the Executive Council and Assembly of the City of Sarajevo. Those fighters of the 1st Corps who had contributed most to the repelling of the enemy offensive were presented with the appropriate decorations. Here is a report by [name indistinct] [Correspondent] At the beginning of the session, the fighters and their officers were addressed by Brigadier (Ismet Dahic), deputy commander of the 1st Corps. He stressed that the fighters had been prepared for the enemy offensive, which started on 21 December, and that despite 40,000 shells fired and the fact that Chetnik [word indistinct] units took part in these battles, the fighters of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina at the end turned the situation to their advantage. After that (Dahic) presented decorations to the members of the brigades whose fighters took part in these battles on behalf of the Corps commander. They will be handed to them subsequently. [passage omitted] We have reached the half-way stage, Foreign Minister Ljubijankic said. The other half could be even more difficult, but what we have done so far compels us to go further. Finally, the fighters were addressed by Prime Minister Silajdzic, who was greeted with a long applause. He conveyed to the fighters greetings from President Izetbegovic, who was unable to attend. Speaking about the future of the Geneva talks, Silajdzic stressed that if the aggressor continues to destroy Sarajevo and other towns and to kill civilians during the Geneva talks, the talks will not be held. There is certain fear abroad of a republic in which the Muslims would constitute a majority, Silajdzic said. That this fear is not founded is best illustrated by the conduct of the members of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina on the territories under their control. People of other nationalities are not being expelled. Places of worship are not being destroyed. Only criminals should be afraid of such an army, Silajdzic said. This was a brief summary of what was said at today's festive session organized to mark the repelling of a fierce enemy offensive.
