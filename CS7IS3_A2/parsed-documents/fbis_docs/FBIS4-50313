Prior to the opening of the exhibition, Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee and president; Qiao Shi, member of the Political Bureau Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the National People's Congress Standing Committee; Li Ruihuan, member of the Political Bureau Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, visited the exhibition, respectively. Premier Li Peng inscribed the name of the exhibition before he left to visit foreign countries. The exhibition conveys through different perspectives Anhui's economic achievements since China adopted the policy of reform and opening up, particularly the recovery and development of Anhui's economy since it was hit by a major flood in 1991. At the same time, it also shows the general condition of its economic development and its potential and bright prospects for economic development. It is the first time that Anhui has held such a large-scale exhibition in the capital since the founding of New China. Anhui has not only recovered from the 1991 flood in a short time, but has also scored great developments in economic construction and in social undertakings. Anhui's GNP grew 17 percent and its social development general index rose 30 percent in 1992. The momentum of rapid and healthy development continued and sustained in 1993. Anhui's GNP was up 22 percent in 1993 from the previous year and its development speed ranked top in the nation. In the evening of 24 April, General Secretary Jiang Zemin, accompanied by Lu Rongjing, Anhui provincial CPC committee secretary, and Governor Fu Xishou, visited the exhibition with great enthusiasm. He closely watched videos, display objects, models, and photos at different exhibition booths. He attentively listened to briefings of relevant personnel. Whenever he was told of a particular economic achievement that Anhui has achieved in recent years, he would nod to show his satisfaction. After touring the scenes of the exhibition, Jiang Zemin spoke to Anhui's leading comrades: "Please do an even better job; the future of Anhui is very promising." Chairmen Qiao Shi and Li Ruihuan visited the exhibition on the morning of 25 April and 26 April, respectively. They were both pleased with the achievements in economic construction and in social undertakings that Anhui has scored over the last two years. After viewing the exhibition, Qiao Shi said the exhibition showed great changes in Anhui and he was greatly impressed by those changes. Li Ruihuan said Anhui's fast recovery from a major disaster is really a rare feat. This fully shows the Chinese Communist Party possesses a cohesive force and the superiority of the socialist system. He added that the most important experience that one gains from the rapid and healthy development of Anhui's economy is that Anhui knows how to seize and to give play to its own characteristics and superiority. Those present at the opening ceremony of the exhibition included leading comrades Li Ruihuan, Sun Qimen, and Li Guixian; persons in charge of organs directly under the CPC Central Committee, of some departments of the party and state organs, of relevant departments of the People's Liberation Army; and people from various circles in Beijing, and foreign guests. In his opening address, Fu Xishou said Anhui's victory over the 1991 flood and in the subsequent flood-relief work was made possible by the Anhui people's hard work. He added that the victory was made all the more possible because of the superior socialist system. It was the result of the great concern and great support, both spiritually and materially, given by the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission. It was also the result of the concern and assistance rendered by the party, the government, the military, and the people in the capital; the people throughout the nation; and overseas compatriots. The purpose of holding such an exhibition in Beijing, he said, is to express the sincere gratitude of the Anhui people and to publicize Anhui, so as to accelerate the pace of economic construction and the modernization drive in Anhui. Those who attended the opening ceremony toured the scenes of the exhibition. The exhibition was divided into 16 sections showing Anhui's achievements in agriculture, village and township enterprises, metallurgy industry, petrochemical industry, machinery industry, electronic industry, science and technology, and foreign trade. State Councillor Luo Gan and other leading comrades also visited the exhibition prior to the opening ceremony. The exhibition will close on 2 May.
