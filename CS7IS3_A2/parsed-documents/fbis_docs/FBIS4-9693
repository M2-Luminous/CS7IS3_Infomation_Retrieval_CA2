Burelli Rivas explained the post has no diplomatic status. The appointment was requested by the Defense Ministry. [Begin recording] [Burelli] It is not a diplomatic post. [Unidentified reporter] Precisely, but within the Armed Forces... [Burelli, interrupting] The Defense Ministry made the decision, and the Foreign Ministry is not authorized to discuss this. [Reporter] If this is not a diplomatic post, why is he being given a diplomatic passport? [Burelli] Well, this status is provided when any function is carried out abroad on behalf of the Venezuelan state, to facilitate things and provide an advantage during a mission. The only assistance provided by the Foreign Ministry is the issuance of a special passport, or a diplomatic passport. [end recording] As expected, the foreign minister was asked how statements by [Lieutenant Colonel Hugo] Chavez, who has said he does not rule out the possibility of a military coup, would affect the country's image. The minister minimized these statements and said the fact that Chavez has joined politics strengthens Venezuela's democratic position. The Venezuelan foreign minister declined too much comment on criticisms surroundeding the recent election of the OAS secretary general. But Burelli Rivas did say he wants to address the Congress to explain what happened with regard to Venezuela's candidate.
