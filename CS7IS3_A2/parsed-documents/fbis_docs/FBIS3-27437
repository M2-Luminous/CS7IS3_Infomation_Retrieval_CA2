The statement was published in leaflets handed out by Yeltsin's Press Secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov here today, ITAR-TASS reported. Following Russia's diplomatic success in persuading Serb forces to pull back their big guns from around Sarajevo, NATO officials and some senior Western diplomats made various statements which seemed to express some "feeling of disappointment", the statement said. This sentiment reflects the position that NATO desired to "restore order" itself, and did not appreciate the role played by Russia, the statement said. Some people apparently wished to stifle Russia's bid to settle the conflict through diplomatic means, it added. As a result, some have the impression that NATO still clings to the old Cold War ideology, and that psychologically it is difficult for NATO to adapt to political realities in Russia, which have undergone drastic changes in recent years, the statement continued. Russia opposes ultimatums and prefers mediation, the statement said, adding that any attempt to restore the Cold War mentality, distrust, and spy wars run counter to the spirit of partnership for peace. The Russian president said in his statement that he believes there are more reasons for peace than for war in Europe. He again called on Western leaders to sit down at the negotiating table to work out a final settlement of the Bosnian conflict.
