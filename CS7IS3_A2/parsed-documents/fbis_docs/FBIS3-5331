Last week the United States revived its Super 301 law which allows for unilateral trade sanctions against countries found to have discriminated against US imports. The long-standing view in the Australian Government is that Australia does not take sides in the dispute but sees fault on both sides, officials said. It is understood that Evans will raise the trade dispute with Christopher in their talks which are scheduled to start Tuesday, a trade ministry official said. US President Bill Clinton signed an executive order reinstating the Super 301 provision following breakdown of the US-Japan economic-framework talks. Trade Minister Bob McMullan stressed that Australia does not support punitive trade sanctions like Super 301. "We understand why the United States, like Australia and the rest of the world, supports opening up of the Japanese market -- but we don't support anyone doing it in a unilateral or discriminatory way," he said last week. He added that he did not see reintroduction of Super 301 as "the outbreak of a trade war," but as racheting up the pressure on Japan. McMullan said the trade question would not be a "priority issue" in the Evans-Christopher talks which close Wednesday and which are to focus on defence and security concerns. "But it would be very surprising if such a senior US representative came to Australia and we did not mention some trade issues," he said. In an editorial Monday, the conservative Sydney Morning Herald labelled the invoking of Super 301 as "unnecessary and reckless" and warned that if there was a trade war "countries like Australia will be the first casualties." Urging Evans to "tell it like it is", in his meetings with Christopher, the daily said the US official should be "reminded that Australia's ability to honour its alliance (with Washington) is tied to the health of its trade-based economy.
