FR940318-1-00008 FR940318-1-00004 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 90&hyph;NM&hyph;265&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 727 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking; reopening of comment period. SUMMARY: This document revises an earlier proposed airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Boeing Model 727 series airplanes, which would have superseded an existing AD that currently requires periodic leak checks of the forward lavatory drain system and provides for the installation of a new drain valve as terminating action. The proposed action would have deleted the existing provision for terminating action, required repetitive leak checks of both the forward and aft lavatory drain systems, and added an optional procedure for complying with the rule. That proposal was prompted by reports of engine and airframe damage, engine separation, and damage to property on the ground, caused by ``blue ice'' that had formed from leaking forward lavatory drain systems and subsequently had dislodged from the airplane. This action revises the proposal by changing the optional procedure, adding a requirement for installation of a cap on the flush/fill line, and requiring periodic leak checks of the flush/fill system. DATES: Comments must be received by May 2, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 90&hyph;NM&hyph;265&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.

Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 90&hyph;NM&hyph;265&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Discussion A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to add an airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Boeing Model 727 series airplanes, was published as a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the Federal Register on March 22, 1993 (58 FR 15305). That supplemental NPRM proposed to revise a previously issued NPRM that proposed the supersedure of AD 86&hyph;05&hyph;07, Amendment 39&hyph;5250 (51 FR 7767, March 6, 1986). AD 86&hyph;05&hyph;07 currently requires periodic leak checks of the forward lavatory drain system and provides for the installation of a new drain valve as terminating action. The previously issued supplemental NPRM proposed to: 1. Delete the existing provision for terminating action; 2. Require repetitive leak checks of both the forward and the aft lavatory drain systems, and 3. Provide an optional procedure for complying with the rule, which would entail revising the FAA-approved maintenance program to incorporate a schedule and procedure to conduct leak checks of the lavatory drain systems. The proposed action was prompted by reports of engine and airframe damage, and one report of engine separation on a Boeing Model 727 series airplane that occurred subsequent to the issuance of AD 86&hyph;05&hyph;07. These incidents were caused by ``blue ice'' that had formed from leaking forward lavatory drain systems and subsequently had broken loose from the airplane and struck the fuselage or had been ingested into the engine. The proposed action also was prompted by reports of leakage from lavatory drain valves that have a configuration similar to that specified in AD 86&hyph;05&hyph;07 as terminating action. Such leakage can result in the formation of blue ice, which can dislodge from the airplane and result in engine damage or separation, airframe damage, and/or a hazard to persons or property on the ground.
