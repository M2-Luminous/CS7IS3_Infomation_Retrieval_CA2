"News services must be given absolute priority and the rest is nothing but a parasite, including publishing activities," stressed Melichercik who replaced Dusan Kleiman yesterday. But he said that not the quality of the services, but "the case of the daily REPUBLIKA" had led the government to change the agency's director. REPUBLIKA, the sole national paper supporting the current opposition led by ex-premier Vladimir Meciar, ran into a loss of 18 million crowns (about 545,454 USD) last year. The law does not allow organisations partially funded from the state budget, which is the case of TA SR, to engage in business activities ending at a loss. "It is clear that a paper of this type cannot exist on the soil of an agency which is striving for maximum objectivity and impartiality," Melichercik stressed. He added that privatisation of REPUBLIKA would solve the problem. But Melichercik said this may take a long time because the debt plus the title's value of 13.5 million crowns made up the purchasing price and no prospective buyer had appeared as yet. TA SR now has a staff of 350, including 130 journalists 30 of whom work for REPUBLIKA. 15 correspondents work in regions and eight abroad, including two in Prague and one in Brno, South Moravia. The home and the sports desks each publish about 80 news items per day, the foreign desk about 130, the economics desk 60 and the export desk 20-30. Melichercik said he wanted to increase the number of staffers in the home and foreign desks and "to part with those who have not mastered agency work." He said he regretted that cooperation with CTK had not been established yet while TA SR was cooperating with all agencies from the other neighbouring states. But Melichercik added he was pleased with today's proposal from CTK Director General Milan Stibral to meet soon.
