Shots were fired and stones thrown when Deputy Minister Chris Fismer arrived at the rally to explain President F W de Klerk's failure to arrive as scheduled. According to security officers accompanying the president, shots were fired in a crowd of opposing African National Congress [ANC] and National Party supporters. There were strong ANC and NP support groups present at the rally. Mr de Klerk was earlier advised not to attend the rally as all access roads were being blocked by ANC stonethrowers. Later, Mr Fismer, chief organiser of the presidential election tour, confirmed the shootings and stonings and said it was clear since the party put up posters for the two rallies, that firm decisions had been taken to prevent the NP from holding their meetings. It was a serious problem facing this election and the NP was going to take up the matter at every possible level. Giving his own account of events, he said he had gone to Roodepan after Mr de Klerk's meeting in the Kimberley City Hall to establish precisely what the situation was. On the way there, he had seen large numbers of black people, moving from Galeshiwe township to Roodepan, jumping on every conceivable means of transport. He said that on arrival at the grounds, everything seemed to be in order with the NP band playing and NP supporters clearly in the majority. He said, however, that police reported a large number of ANC supporters had gathered between the houses to rush the state president on his arrival. That made him decide to "test the temperature" of the meeting. A squad of ANC supporters then rushed the stage and stones started flying. Soon shots were fired. He believed the stones came from all directions and security men ushered him and other NP officials away. Later police reported that an unidentified woman had been killed and several others were injured. No further details were available. It was also confirmed in Kimberley by Mr de Klerk that he had been "struck by a projectile" at Postdene on Wednesday afternoon. Although police believe it was a crumpled paper flag, a television news cameraman said he had footage to show that Mr de Klerk had been struck on the neck by a stone.
