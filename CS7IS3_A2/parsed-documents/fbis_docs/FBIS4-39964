First, because this organization is associated with the president. Second, the congress can be seen as an attempt to create in a country with a multitude of minority parties the first real party of liberal-conservative orientation. Furthermore, the party organizers are making no secret that their main task is to ensure a second presidential term for Boris Yeltsin or a first term for Yegor Gaydar. Yegor Gaydar is creating his party not under the best possible conditions, primarily because Gaydar's new party is based on the Russia's Choice election bloc whose showing in the December elections, according to official results, proved to be far from what was desired. Naturally, one also cannot ignore the general political apathy of the population, whose majority since the CPSU days has developed a steady allergy to any parties. Furthermore, having invited Democratic Russia supporters to the new party ranks, Yegor Gaydar incurred criticism from right-wing elements for splitting the democratic movements. It is not ruled out that they will voice their complaints at the founding congress. Besides, even among those who agree to join the new organization there are differences in views on the principles of party organizational development. The former head of government is being urged to create a party not "to fit himself," also not to insist on rigid discipline, and to enshrine collective leadership. Yet chances are that there will be more Gaydar supporters at the congress -- such authoritative figures as Sergey Filatov, Andrey Kozyrev, and Anatoliy Chubays are expected to attend -- and therefore the new party will be established, and Gaydar himself will be elected its leader. Incidentally, according to information received from the Russia's Choice leadership, Yegor Gaydar has so far not been able to obtain assurances that Boris Yeltsin will be present at the founding congress. In spite of all the problems, the new organization's potential capabilities look fairly serious. Rigid discipline, Gaydar's regular meetings with Yeltsin -- giving the party some additional weight -- free access for its functionaries to the corridors of power, and considerable financial resources -- all this gives reason to suppose that Russia's Choice (unless, that is, its name is changed) will become one of the major political parties in the country. From the Russia's Choice Draft Program: --It is necessary to defeat inflation. The state budget deficit must be covered by floating state securities. --A most important task is to reduce the tax burden, stimulating business activity. --Encouragement of domestic and foreign investments should be accompanied by the provision of preferential conditions for small and medium-sized businesses. --A major prerequisite for economic growth is privatization. We are for protection of private property obtained legitimately from legal sources, and we are against private property living off state property like a parasite. --The party's agrarian policy envisions completion of reform in the countryside and formation of an effective property structure.
