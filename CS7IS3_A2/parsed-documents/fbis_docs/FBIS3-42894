These are far from unambiguous, which is quite natural since socioeconomic developments always have positives and negatives. The final balance and evaluation of the consequences of emergent tendencies are important in this matter. The process of overcoming the total statization of the economy and creating diverse forms and types of economic operation has continued and largely accelerated during the period in question. The formation of an infrastructure of a market economy and its characteristic mechanisms has begun; the mechanism of supply and demand has begun operating, albeit with disruptions; the first signs of competition have appeared. The mentality of economic cadres who are adjusting to the conditions of an emerging market economy is changing. A new generation of managers--educated, energetic, and free of the baggage of old dogmas and habits--is assuming management responsibilities at various levels of economic operations. A stratum of entrepreneurs has been gradually evolving. While evaluating favorably the movement toward a market economy which has gotten underway, we should nonetheless note the continuously growing and largely excessive "price" which our society has already paid and will be forced to pay for the selected strategy and tactics of transition to a market economy. The scale of the current crisis, which has increased as a result of "shock therapy" and its internal structure, is affecting the accomplishment of social tasks in a particularly painful manner and is fraught with the irreversible destruction of the economic and scientific-technical potential of the country. In the last two years alone the fall in production on key macroindicators came to about 30 percent, and compared to the precrisis level, approximated 40 percent. It is important to stress that, first, the drop in production is of a universal rather than structural nature and second, it has affected the most progressive and high-technology industries and types of production to the greatest degree. The ideologists of "shock treatment" view the consequences of the production slump quite flippantly; they believe it to be temporary and easy to make up. To make this more convincing, references are made to historical experience whereby the country restored its past might within relatively short periods of time following tremendous destruction and losses (as a result of the civil war and the Great Patriotic War). The following must be said in conjunction with this: First. Under current conditions, declines in the volume of production mean the loss of markets, and not only the world market (for example, in the aerospace industry, in the production of armaments, etc.) but also the domestic market. There is no such thing as a vacuum in this area. Having once yielded positions on the market, it is extremely difficult to regain that niche. In other words, the process may turn out to be irreversible. Second. Historical analogies are hardly convincing in this case. The time when it was possible to restore the economy with the help of the shovel and the hoe, drawing on mass enthusiasm or coercion of the population, is gone for good. In the modern world, this may only be accomplished by drawing on state-of-the-art equipment, technology, and organization of production. Having missed this opportunity, the country could inevitably be doomed to protracted or perhaps eternal backwardness. A slump in investment activity is the most profound and dangerous in terms of its socioeconomic consequences. In the last two years alone the volume of investment in the Russian economy fell by a factor of more than two, and now comes to about 40 percent of the precrisis level. Not only structural changes but even the elementary growth of production is impossible given this volume. However, the problem is more profound and complex. The amortization of fixed production assets has already come close to 60 percent, i.e., the threshold beyond which the physical destruction of the production potential of the country begins. Our society has become a witness to a growing danger of accidents and disasters. The mounting crisis has affected the scientific sphere (including basic and sectoral research, design and development activities, and trial and experimental production). First-rate, world-level collectives are falling apart before our eyes; leadership status on a number of avenues for scientific-technical progress is being lost; physical facilities are becoming hopelessly obsolete. The country is losing its intellectual potential, and together with it--hope for the rebirth and prosperity of Russia. Inconsistent and on occasion impulsive actions of the government and the Central Bank of Russia, the absence of a clear-cut and well-conceived financial strategy, and the selection of financial stabilization measures which were not in line with the actually emerging conditions have produced extremely unfavorable results. Disorganization of the financial system and loss of control over monetary circulation is one of the results of the policy of "shock therapy" and the methods of its implementation. In two years there has been no success in normalizing the budget system, despite attracting enormous credit from the Central Bank and artificially withdrawing monies from the Pension Fund to cover the deficit. The payments crisis which was caused by ill-conceived actions and the inability to ensure the normal intake of taxes merely undermined the revenue base of the budget and caused a chronic budget deficit. The financial system of the national economy as a whole is facing the most difficult situation (including the financial situation of enterprises and regions). Fixed assets are being systematically "eaten away." Amortization has lost the feature of being one of the most significant and most reliable sources of investment and is not in a position to ensure even the simple reproduction of fixed assets. The number of unprofitable enterprises and those with slim profit margins is growing. The payments crisis, or the breakdown of payments relations on an unprecedented scale, began against the background of a campaign to liberalize prices and tighten budgetary and credit policies. Initially it was accompanied by reductions in the volume of production; by the end of 1993 it had acquired new features and manifested itself as a mass stoppage of enterprises (including giant enterprises) which was not associated with the bankruptcy procedure. The government extensively used emission to carry out its populist statements and as a drug of sorts for "emboldening" production. During the last two years the government has been the main borrower of funds from the Central Bank. The issuance of state short-term bonds which got underway covers merely 2 percent of the deficit of the consolidated budget; the bulk of the deficit is still financed out of Central Bank credit (at the preferential rate of 10 percent). The emission of cash increased from 1.5 trillion rubles [R] in 1992 to R10.1 trillion in 1993, and its proportion in the total money supply increased from 24 to 37 percent. Virtually all cash put into circulation last year was retained by the population or services the nonbank circulation of resources. The disorganization of the financial system, the "war of the budgets" between the center and many regions, the payments crisis, and the uncontrolled emission all testify to the loss of state control over monetary circulation. The growth of inflation which was triggered by the liberalization of prices has not stopped in two years. In 1993 the average monthly rate of inflation was even higher than in the previous year (if we omit the January "surge" in 1992). The failure to combat inflation is explained by a failure to understand its nature in the economy of Russia (underestimating its highly monopolized structure, ignoring the factor of cost inflation, and so on), and correspondingly opting for inadequate, purely monetarist means to contain it by way of demand constraints. All of the above makes it possible to conclude that the hope for financial stabilization without overcoming the slump in production is turning out to be illusory and theoretically unsound. During the last two years, privatization has been the most apparent sphere of institutional changes in the Russian economy. It has been advanced the farthest in the trade sector, public catering, and the service sector. By the end of 1993, nonstate trade enterprises accounted for three-quarters of retail sales. The process of "large-scale" privatization in industry has begun. The reregistration of kolkhozes and sovkhozes has virtually ended; companies of various types have been formed; the farmer-owner sector has been emerging, albeit at a decreasing rate. The course and consequences of privatization have been far from unambiguous. Its positives include first of all the destruction of the total statization of the economy and the emergence of a growing stratum of quite energetic real owners. The value system and behavioral motivation of a significant proportion of the population have been gradually changing with the appearance of a securities market. At the same time, privatization has not brought about the inflow of investment, and has not noticeably influenced improvements in effectiveness. In a number of cases, technological connections were disrupted unnecessarily. The unfavorable consequences were largely due to the failure to think through privatization itself and haste in carrying it out. Administrative pressure and the monotony of the forms of privatization (orientation exclusively toward the creation of publicly held joint-stock companies) have remained; no reliable legal foundation has been laid. The issuance of vouchers did not ensure the popular nature of privatization, as proclaimed by its ideologists; a drop in the value of vouchers in real terms and their concentration in a small number of investment funds are fraught with not only the further stratification of society, but also the growth of social tension. Warnings and recommendations found in the previous report of the RAN [Russian Academy of Sciences] Economics Division and the Reform International Foundation have not been taken into account. The concept of the abandonment of regulation of economic and social processes by the state has led to the universal loss of manageability. World experience in state regulation, especially in countries with socially oriented market economies, has been completely ignored. The special role of the state characteristic of transitional stages of social development has not been taken into account. As a result, a vacuum of state regulation has developed, which is being filled with increasing vigor through, on one hand, the growth of narrow-group and regional-separatist interests and the plain plundering of national wealth, and on the other hand, the real and equally dangerous restoration of authoritarianism camouflaged by pseudodemocratic slogans. The breakdown of existing state government structures which has far outstripped the creation of new, modern forms of government and regulation has brought about the disruption of vertical and horizontal economic relations and technological interaction. Control has been lost over prices and incomes, and the distribution and redistribution of material and financial resources. The results of the implementation of the monetarist policy and the withdrawal of the state from regulating economic and social processes as a component of this policy have indicated the theoretical and practical unsoundness of the course chosen. The depletion of social resources for the continuation of "shock therapy" is an alarming outcome of the implementation of this policy over two years. A drop in the real income of the population by a factor of more than two accompanied by a sharply growing differentiation in incomes has aggravated the social situation in the country. At present, the incomes of 10 percent of the most affluent citizens exceed the income of the same proportion of the least affluent citizens by a factor of 10. One-third of the population have an income below the official subsistence minimum, and 10 percent of the population, or about 15 million people, are below the threshold of physical survival. This is a signal that society is entering a social conflict zone. It should be stressed that this is not just about quantitative indicators. Profound qualitative changes have occurred in the last two years; trends have emerged which indicate a looming threat to the genetic pool of Russian society. The process of depopulation of the populace has begun, with the growing death rate due to a considerable degree to alcoholism, murder, and suicide. The population has been sharply marginalized; the number of beggars, vagrants, alcoholics, and drug addicts has been growing. The quality of the "human material" is deteriorating at quite high rates (immunity against mass diseases has been declining; prostitution, venereal disease, and births of impaired children are on the rise). The moral pillars of society, social values and ideals, personal and family hopes which have always made it possible to survive what appeared to be temporary adversity, are crumbling. Crime is growing and becoming more arrogant; mafia groups proliferate. Bribery, extortion, and embezzlement have become massive and no longer cause protest or condemnation by the government. All the above makes it possible to say that the social price paid by our society for "shock therapy" has exceeded the maximum permissible limits. The scale of the economic and social calamities that have befallen Russia poses a real threat to its national security. The country has ended up at a dangerous threshold, on crossing which it may face the risk of forever losing the chance to be reborn as a superpower. Such is the outcome of the two years of the "shock therapy" policy. The most radical reformers justify in every way the destruction and sacrifices as unavoidable costs associated with fundamental changes in the existing political, social, and economic system and the "return" of Russia to the ranks of civilized countries. On the contrary, the RAN Economics Division and the Reform International Foundation are convinced that: --no objective, up to the promise of a new variant of "the bright future," can justify the social sacrifices which Russian society has made and to which it is inevitably doomed in the event that the chosen course is continued. A different approach is immoral and inhumane; --the society that is actually emerging in Russia today is far removed from the models existing in countries with highly effective and socially oriented market economies. It amounts, to a greater degree, to a society based on excessive property-related stratification, corruption, organized crime, and external dependency. From the socioeconomic standpoint, this is not taking a step forward but rather setting the country back two centuries, to the era of primitive, "barbaric" capitalism; --all programs for the renewal of Russia and its socioeconomic structure may have a chance at success only if they take into account, along with worldwide tendencies, the originality of Russia, the peculiarities of its history and culture, the spiritual stance of the population, and the requisite value system. Russia does not need to return to world civilization--it has always belonged to it, and belongs to it now as an irreproducible type of a structure of civilization. * * * An analysis of the course of the reform and the outcome of the socioeconomic development of Russia in the last two years makes it possible to draw a number of conclusions. First. A deep crisis and social calamities are not the result of unsolved problems that had piled up in the past, isolated miscalculations, or the resistance of conservative forces (although all these have also occurred), but rather an unavoidable consequence of the chosen course of the reform and the methods used to carry it out. Attempts to solve all problems with a "single leap" or a "cavalry charge" were not dictated by sober scientific calculations but rather by impatience and political ambitions. Contrary to the assertions of its initiators, this course was and is extremely idealized, and is being implemented by neo-Bolshevik methods. Second. Having experienced the failure of the chosen course of economic policy at the very first steps of its implementation, the originators of "shock therapy" did not learn a lesson but continued to stubbornly insist on staying the course. This only further exacerbated the situation and burdened the population with new hardships. To cover up their fiasco, the reformers who were in power went about systematically misinforming the public and distorting the picture of the genuine situation in the economy and the life of the people. Third. From the very beginning, an erroneous orientation toward the decisive role of foreign aid was adopted, and internal sources for stimulating business, especially investment activities, were not put to use. It became clear quite soon that this was a major miscalculation. Under no circumstances can the meager amount of this continuously promised aid seriously influence the results of transformations in Russia. However, no major adjustments in the area of economic policy were made after that, either. Fourth. A claim to infallibility, to knowing the absolute truth, has been at the root of many mistakes that have been allowed to occur and the reluctance to change the course of economic policy even after its complete unsoundness was revealed. Hence the reluctance to heed criticism and the aspiration to paint such criticism as allegedly originating from the "enemies of reform." The notion of the absence of alternatives to the strategy and tactics of reform implementation chosen by the authors of "shock therapy," rather than the reform as such, has been persistently foisted on public opinion. It appears strange, but it looks as though some political leaders both in Russia and in the West have seriously come to believe that any change in the chosen course of economic reform means a rollback, a return to the administrative-command system. The belief in one's own infallibility is a nourishing medium for deliberately refusing to seek national accord. Fifth. The unprofessionalism of the authors and champions of the "shock therapy" course has now become obvious. It is manifested in a lack of knowledge of the realities of Russia and the mentality of the nations populating it, a choice of reform methods which are not adequate for these conditions, and egregious miscalculations in projecting the economic and social consequences of the measures taken. Society has encountered a new variety of subjective and willful approaches to the development and implementation of economic policy, and in the policy itself--clearly expressed ideological attachments. During the entire period the government has evaded a discussion of the fundamental problems of socioeconomic policy with leading Russian economic scientists and representatives of progressive parties, movements, and public organizations. The "shock therapy" course has always been criticized in a sharp and well-argued manner. However, we must honestly admit that for a long time this course enjoyed quite extensive support from the population, which attached their hopes and expectations to it. However, a qualitative turnaround in public mood occurred at the end of 1993. In the December elections, people resolutely came out against experiments associated with "shock therapy." Only 8 percent of the voters came out in favor of the Russia's Choice bloc, whose leaders personify the ideologists and champions of this course. To continue this course in the future means to act against the clearly stated will of the people. What could such attempts bring about? On one hand, they could bring about the further exacerbation of the economic crisis and the worsening of social tensions in society. On the other hand, nostalgia for "the good old times" and the restorationist mood, which are quite dangerous for reforms in the Russian economy, will mount. The RAN Economics Division and the Reform International Foundation believe that, in the name of rejuvenating Russia as a superpower, it is necessary to evaluate the results of the past two years critically and honestly and to work out a new strategy for socioeconomic transformations.
