FR940810-1-00049 FR940810-1-00009 Grant Delays for GPRs that are Inconsistent with Instructions This portion of the proposed rule includes changes at §§570.304, 570.900 and 570.910. The Department considers the Grantee Performance Report (GPR) to be the foundation of HUD's ability to fulfill the statutory requirement that it review each grantee's performance at least annually. Some time ago, the Department, through its Financial Management Task Force, determined that it needed to take action against grantees that failed to submit reports in the prescribed forms in a timely manner. To accomplish this, the Task Force recommended that HUD amend the CDBG regulations to authorize HUD to hold back on making grants in cases where previous GPRs have not been submitted in a manner consistent with GPR Form Instructions. The purpose of the rule is to bring pressure to bear on grantees that are seriously delinquent in this matter. The language of the rule would only affect the most egregious cases, because a GPR is due nine months before the next grant is made. (For example, City X ends its program year 15 on June 30, 1993. HUD then makes the grant for program year 16 on July 1. The city's GPR for program year 15 will be due on September 30, 1993. If that GPR is not properly submitted by June 30, 1994, this rule would allow HUD to delay making the program year 17 CDBG grant, otherwise due on July 1, 1994, until the overdue report is properly submitted.) The rule would not permit delaying the grant simply because the GPR was submitted late, if it is submitted in proper form by the time the new grant is to be made, although persistent lateness by a grantee could be addressed through the use of the sanctions provisions at §§570.910, 570.911, and 570.913. CHAS Performance Standards for CDBG Entitlements This proposed rule describes the review standards HUD proposes to use in determining whether a CDBG entitlement recipient is following a current HUD-approved Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS), as it is required to certify under §570.303(l). These standards would replace those for the Housing Assistance Plan (HAP) that itself has been replaced by the CHAS. The proposed standards relate to the CHAS implementation process. Thus, a grantee would be held accountable for taking all planned actions to meet CHAS goals; and for pursuing all resources it indicated it would pursue. To assure that each community's non-profit and other housing developers that may apply to HUD for assistance are fairly considered for certifications of consistency with the CHAS, where such a certification is a prerequisite for application, a grantee would be expected to provide certifications of consistency in a fair and impartial manner that furthers attainment of the purposes and objectives of the grantee's housing strategy. The final specific standard is that no grantee may hinder implementation of the CHAS by action or willful inaction. Failure on the part of a grantee to meet its annual CHAS goals for persons and households to be assisted would not, in itself, constitute failure to follow the CHAS. While the Department would like to see every CHAS goal met, it is more concerned that the process of developing and implementing the CHAS be carried out in a manner that furthers achievement of the goal of the National Affordable Housing Act_that every American family be able to afford a decent home in a suitable environment. To this end, the proposed CHAS performance standards for entitlement recipients will focus on the CHAS implementation process, and, initially, if this process has been adequately followed, a lack of results would be viewed as signalling a need for further technical assistance or for modifying the CHAS. (See the recently published proposed rule for a Consolidated Plan, which would replace the CHAS.) Other Matters Environmental Impact A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations at 24 CFR part 50, which implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection during regular business hours in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Room 10276, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20410. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this proposed rule before publication and by approving it certifies that this proposed rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The proposed rule is limited to the effecting of relatively minor procedural amendments within the structure of the CDBG program regulations. Executive Order 12612, Federalism The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive order 12612, Federalism, has determined that the policies contained in this proposed rule will not have substantial direct effects on states or their political subdivisions, or the relationship between the federal government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. As a result, the proposed rule is not subject to review under the order. The proposed rule is limited to making relatively minor, procedural amendments within the structure of the CDBG program regulations. Executive Order 12606, the Family The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family , has determined that this proposed rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being, and, thus, is not subject to review under the order. No significant change in existing HUD policies or programs will result from promulgation of this proposed rule, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns. Regulatory Agenda This proposed rule was listed as item number 1633 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on April 25, 1994 (59 FR 20424, 20457) in accordance with Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
