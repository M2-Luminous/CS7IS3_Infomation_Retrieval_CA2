In the bill he submitted and in the explanation he made to the NPC Standing Committee today, Ren Jianxin, president of the Supreme People's Court, said: The purpose of enacting a law on judges is to meet the requirements for improving the socialist legal system and accelerating the building of a socialist market economic structure, to establish a socialist judicial system with Chinese characteristics, and to administer judges on a scientific and legal basis so as to ensure and upgrade the quality of judges and to guarantee that judges exercise their trial functions according to law. On the drafting of the law on judges, Ren Jianxin said: The Supreme People's Court began drafting the law in 1986, and at the end of 1988 the NPC Standing Committee listed the law in its legislative plan. In the past few years, the Supreme People's Court has conducted extensive investigations and studies, summed upexperiences in administering judges since the founding of New China, collected data on the relevant judicial systems of foreign countries and of Taiwan and the Hong Kong and Macao regions, and has sent delegations to study the judicial systems in a number of countries. In drafting the law, the Supreme People's Court took the Constitution as the foundation, carried out the guidelines of the CPC Central Committee on building a scientific administrative system that suits the characteristics of various units and an effective and encouraging mechanism, proceeded from the actual condition in China, took into account the future and the current situation, and also studied the useful experiences of other countries, in a bid to draw up a socialist law on judges with Chinese characteristics. Ren Jianxin said: In China judges are judicial personnel who specifically exercise the trial function of the state. They are state functionaries as well as professional people. However, over the past 40 years, no law has been enacted that reflects the dual characteristics of judges, and they have always been administered as administrative personnel. Therefore, it is very important to enact a law that clearly defines the qualifications, responsibilities, rights and obligations, selection and appointment, training, evaluation, and administration of judges, and rewards and punishment for judges, so as to create a system by which judges will be administered on a scientific and legal basis. Ren Jianxin also made explanations on establishing a system on qualifications of judges, a system on ranks of judges, on establishing a judges committee, and establishing a system of insurance for judges. In the bill he submitted, and in his explanations to the NPC Standing Committee regarding the draft law on prosecutors, Zhang Siqing, chief procurator of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, said: The purpose of enacting a law on prosecutors is to administer prosecutors on a scientific and legal basis, improve the quality of prosecutors, and ensure that people's procuratorates independently exercise their functions according to law. Zhang Siqing said: For a long time people's procuratorates' law-supervising function has been affected to a certain degree because of the lack of a complete law for administering prosecutors. Also, there has been a lack of necessary legal guarantees for prosecutors to exercise their powers and functions. Therefore, it is necessary to establish, through legislation, an administrative system compatible with the nature of procuratorial organs and the characteristics of their work, such as a system governing the qualifications of prosecutors, a system for evaluating prosecutors, and a system governing their ranks, wages, insurance, and benefits, so as to improve administration of prosecutors on a scientific basis. He said: Enacting a law on prosecutors is necessary for ensuring and improving the quality of prosecutors. As prosecutors are state judicial personnel exercising the function of supervising the law of the country, they must be proficient politically and professionally. Therefore, it is necessary, through legislation, to make strict stipulations governing the qualifications, selection, evaluation, and training of prosecutors, so as to facilitate the building of a contingent of prosecutors who are fair and honest, and who carry out their legal duties according to law. At the same time, the enactment of a law on prosecutors is necessary to ensure that prosecutors exercise their functions according to law; it is also needed to standardize and restrict prosecutors' act of exercising their duties. Zhang Siqing also explained the duties of prosecutors, the system on qualifications of prosecutors, and the system governing the ranks of prosecutors.
