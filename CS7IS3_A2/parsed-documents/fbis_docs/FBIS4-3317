The two sides exchanged views on furthering cultural contacts and exchanges between the two countries. During the meeting, Mahmud said China's political views and brilliant culture impressed him profoundly during his school years in Egypt. He said he highly appreciated China's stand of supporting the Palestine cause, which was made clear by late Premier Zhou Enlai, whom he first met in Cairo as a student in the audience. He expressed hope that Jordanian-Chinese cultural exchanges will continue to develop with constant mutual visits of cultural troupes and teams. Fan Zhonghui said that China and Jordan have enjoyed a fine relation in politics, economy and other fields including culture. He proposed that the two sides organize more small-scaled programs of cultural exchanges such as art galleries, exhibition of arts and handicrafts and troupe performances. China has earlier agreed to provide Jordan with about 9 million U.S. dollars to help the kingdom build a library and a children's hospital.
