At 10[.sup]14[/] - 10[.sup]16[/] atoms per cm[.sup]2[/] silver content, it becomes possible to realize selective electrochemical deposition of a metal phase onto modified portions of the film. In this case, the rate of electrochemical deposition on them is 10 or more times greater than that on film portions not containing silver. The properties of microheterogeneous systems of the oxide-metal particle type, in which the oxide acts as a carrier, largely depend on the specifics of particle-carrier interaction. An important role is also played by the oxygen adsorbed from the atmosphere on the surface of a semiconductor and on the metal particles. In the case of the system TiO[.sub]2[/]-Ag particles, the selectivity of the electrochemical deposition process, as manifested in changes in the process kinetics and a drop in overvoltage in comparison with deposition on TiO[.sub]2[/] films not containing silver, may be due to special features in the interaction between the silver particles and the TiO[.sub]2[/] film. Previous research concerned mainly the electro- and photoelectro-chemical characteristics of the system, and the status of silver on the TiO[.sub]2[/] surface remained unclear. In the present work these properties of silver particles in a Ag-TiO[.sub]2[/] system were studied employing electochemical methods, electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. At 10[.sup]14[/]-10[.sup]16[/] atoms per cm[.sup]2[/] silver concentration on the surface, the presence of 5-100 nm sized silver particles was confirmed, and a marked a marked interaction between the silver and the TiO[.sub]2[/] surface was observed.
