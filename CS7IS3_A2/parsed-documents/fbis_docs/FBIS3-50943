The total amount produced in Matanzas was 814,000 tons, which is equal to 7.15 million barrels. All these amounts are records, both for Matanzas and on a nationwide level, despite the fact that it is still not enough to meet the country's requirements. That is because approximately 90 percent of the electricity in Cuba is produced by thermoelectric generators, which have been adapted to use domestic heavy crude oil, and this represents slightly more than 30 percent of the fuel consumed. It is therefore important to understand the enormous responsibility of the Central Petroleum Extraction and Drilling Enterprise, which is in Cardenas Municipality in Matanzas Province, 150 km east of the Cuban capital. That enterprise makes the largest contribution to the country's oil production. The enterprise of the Yumuri area is made up of approximately 2,000 men, including specialists, workers, and administrative personnel, all highly qualified and experienced people. This year the development of the gas-oil program will be subject to the conditions of the current financial situation, which is why a slight increase in the extraction of the so-called black gold is foreseen. However, in light of the financial problems, the country's directorate decided to take measures to provide more facilities for the producers of Matanzas Province. This, together with the solution of the technical problems that kept the foreign associates from attaining the production goals estimated for the oil wells directly operated by them, will allow us to maintain a sustained annual increase in the extraction of hydrocarbons.
