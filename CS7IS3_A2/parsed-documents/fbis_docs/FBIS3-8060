In their opinion, the often mentioned surplus of staff does not justify the dismissal of prestigious, experienced, and well-known editors and reporters on the pretext of financial difficulties and organizational restructuring. These staff members -- who are unaffected by the dismissals and have joined the employees' protest -- emphasize that they wish to serve the radio listeners. Thus they will remain [in the institution] to carry out the work as long as possible. They think it important to let everybody know that they consider these events outrageous. They express their solidarity with those sacked and they hope that soon they will be able to work together in Hungarian Radio again.
