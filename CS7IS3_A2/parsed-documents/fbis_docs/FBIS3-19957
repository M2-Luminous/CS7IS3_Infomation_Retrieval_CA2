MEP's [members of the European Parliament] at a two-day meeting in Brussels accused Great Britain of wanting to "dilute" the Union, of "depriving the Treaty of Maastricht of its meaning," and of seeking to serve domestic political interests by refusing to adopt the decisionmaking process after the four candidates join the Union. The blocking minority within the Council of Ministers is at present 23 votes out of 76. Logically enough, this should be increased to 27 votes out of 90 following enlargement in order to keep it at 30 percent of the votes. Great Britain and Spain, for different reasons, are opposed to this purely mathematical change in the blocking minority and are asking for it to stay at 23 votes out of 90, which allows two large countries and one small one to block any decision. After having listened to European Foreign Affairs Commissioner Hans van den Broek stress the negative effects of any change to the membership timetable, the MEP's stressed that no compromise was possible on an institutional retreat. The EP considers a blocking minority of 27 votes to be absolutely essential. "Even if a compromise is reached, it will always be weak and unacceptable to the EP," stressed Raymonde Dury (Belgian, Socialist Party). Mr. van den Broek stated that the Twelve would try to break the deadlock again at their informal meeting next weekend in Ioannina, Greece. If they manage to reach an agreement on the institutional question, the EP will have little time to approve the accession agreements before the European elections in June, thus allowing Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden to join the Union on 1 January 1995 as planned.
