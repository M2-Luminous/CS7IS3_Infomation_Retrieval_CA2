Mr. Belyayev is disputing the amendments and additions made by the mayor to the Statute Governing Elections to the City Assembly. In particular, in accordance with those amendments, Federation Council members cannot be elected as deputies to the assembly, which contradicts the Russian Constitution. The court session scheduled for 15 February was rescheduled to Thursday as a result of the defendant's failure to appear in court -- Mr. Sobchak was at the opening of the Olympic Games in Lillehammer and was supposed to return to St. Petersburg last night. As a Sobchak representative stated in court, the mayor allegedly was completely uninformed about the suit that had been initiated by Belyayev on 8 February.
