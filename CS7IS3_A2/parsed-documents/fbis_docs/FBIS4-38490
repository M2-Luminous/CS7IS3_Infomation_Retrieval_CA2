As noted by Aleksandr Krivov, vice-chairman of the Russian State Building Committee, the key task, indicated in the document, is to draw up a concept and a long-term policy for settling people on Russia's vast territories and to elaborate concrete proposals for this purpose. The pivotal idea of the general scheme is to elaborate a basic settlement pattern and to site and form urban conglomerations, constituting the key form of contemporary and future distribution of the Russian population. They are to be provided with a powerful infrastructure, ensuring modern transport and communication services, information facilities, and the ecological safety of a given district. The mid-Russian, south Siberia and Pacific regions are indicated as the priority settlement areas. Leningrad, Pskov, Novgorod, Tver, Yaroslavl, Kostroma and Vologda regions, as well as the middle belt of Russia and the Urals, Siberia, and the Far East are earmarked for the settlement of refugees from the republics of the former Soviet Union, for the families of servicemen and resettlers from the north, the number of which is expected to reach 5.5-8 million people by the year 2000. A package of federal programmes is to be drawn up on the basis of this document, envisaging the development of small and medium-size towns, revival of the Russian countryside, revival and development of the mid-Russian region, and the accommodation of migrants. The expert council moved to "determine the status of the general scheme as a regularly amended prognosis-type document", to approve the draft's concept, to set up an inter-departmental commission for shape Russia's town-building policy and to draw up a draft resolution of the Russian Government "On the main directions of the state town-building and settlement policy in the Russian Federation".
