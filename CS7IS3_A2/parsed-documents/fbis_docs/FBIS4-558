In a ministerial statement regarding the situation in the area, Mr. Sunkuli further told the House that so far 28 people have been arrested in connection with fighting. [passage omitted] He gave the breakdown of those killed as 12 Kikuyus, five Kalenjins, and one person of unknown origin. Those arested include 18 Kalenjins, seven Kikuyus, and three Luhyas. Those arrested have been charged with being in possession of dangerous weapons and being in possession of firearms, Mr. Sunkuli said. Responding to the assistant minister's statement, the official leader of the opposition, Wamalwa Kijana, said the government must be firm and resolve to end the tribal clashes. Mr. Wamalwa charged that the government seemed to pay lip service to the recurrent tribal clashes and called for a permanent solution to the issue. He warned that if the clashes went unchecked there was a danger of an outbreak of civil war in the country. The leader of the opposition wondered why not a single member of the opposition had been arraigned in a court of law for being involved in the clashes, as alleged by the government. Mr. Mwai Kibaki, member for Othaya, DP [Democratic Party], who on Thursday [31 March] last week sought a ministerial statement regarding the tribal clashes in Burnt Forest, responding to the assistant minister's statement, charged that the people burning houses and committing atrocities in the area seemed properly equipped and were well organized. The member asserted that the curfew imposed in the area was bound to serve no purpose since houses had already been burnt. He wondered which houses they were supposed to go to since theirs have been burnt. Mr. Kibaki said the country had enough security personnel capable of maintaining law and order in a single division.
