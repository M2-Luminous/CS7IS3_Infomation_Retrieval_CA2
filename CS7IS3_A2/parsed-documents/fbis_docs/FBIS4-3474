In Shenzhen alone, nearly 50,000 pirated CD's were seized. Despite the operation, however, many shops are still open for business. Ng Kit-man reports from Shenzhen: [Begin recording] [Ng] Although it is illegal for people to bring pirated CD's from Shenzhen into Hong Kong, for the past six months at least, it has been possible to buy a CD for a little less than 20 yuan, only one-tenth the price of a genuine CD, and many Hong Kong residents have purchased pirated CD's here a few times. In view of the serious situation in CD piracy, Guangdong launched a large-scale crackdown yesterday in various parts of the province, including Shenzhen. Over 200 people from Shenzhen's Culture Bureau, Industry and Commerce Bureau, and Public Security Bureau raided CD shops and seized approximately 24,000 pirated CD's and nearly 30,000 laser disks, audio tapes, and video tapes. Today, we have visited a shop known to sell pirated CD's and have found that many shops are open and are still selling pirated CD's. At the Shenzhen Railway Building, where pirated CD's have always been available for purchase and which was an important target in yesterday's crackdown, many shops are still open and are stilling selling pirated CD's following the crackdown. [Ng] How much do your CD's sell for? [First unidentified shopkeeper] 15 to 20 yuan per CD. [Ng] Are they genuine or pirated? [First shopkeeper] They are homemade and genuine. [Ng] Some shops are finding it difficult to continue their business and say that they will close when they have sold all their stock. [Second unidentified shopkeeper] Many shops have closed, and nobody is placing new CD orders. This is all that I have available for sale, and I have decided to close the business when the stock is all sold. [Ng] Ng Kit-man from Shenzhen, ATV. [end recording]
