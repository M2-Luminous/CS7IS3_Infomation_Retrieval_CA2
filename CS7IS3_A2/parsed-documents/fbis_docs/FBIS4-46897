Today in Tatariya they no longer speak pretty words on this subject, but have begun to think about how to live in the future. A program is being development to bring the economy out of crisis (and this crisis is obvious, since even oil drilling is at a standstill). Most likely, major reforms await the local government. The republic authorities, whose main words during these last three years have been: "As soon as we conclude the treaty with Russia...," and which have directed all their efforts specifically toward this end, to the detriment of the economy, are now faced with the problem of realizing the treaty and implementing real reform. This was the subject of discussion between our correspondent in Kazan and one of the "fathers" of the treaty, vice-president of the RT [Republic of Tatarstan] and doctor of juricial sciences, Professor Vasiliy Likhachev. [End boxed material] [Correspondent] Vasiliy Nikolayevich, it seems to me that the period of euphoria following the signing of the treaty with Russia in February has passed. The comments by leaders of Tatariya, including yours, ever more often express the thought that it is time to start realizing this treaty. Of what should this consist, first of all? [Likhachev] Well, first of all I must say that the treaty is already in effect. This is expressed, specifically, in the fact that the government of Russia and the federal ministry have finally begun to perceive us as normal partners whose opinion must be listened to. And today the factor of our republic in the political life of Russia and the CIS is not simply the factor of a former autonomy which has travelled a certain path toward formulation of statehood. It is the image of a rather competent politician with an all-Russian, all-CIS reputation as represented by an entire republic. As for the intra-republic aspects of the treaty's realization, it will receive the support of the population only if it is oriented toward the specific individual. Specifically, immediately after we signed this treaty, people came up to me on the streets and in the stores and thanked me. They perceived this treaty as a means of solving their problems--from the national to the everyday. From this standpoint, the economic aspects of realization of the treaty with Russia are beginning to worry me more and more. Therefore, during the last meetings with the leadership of Russia, and specifically with Viktor Chernomyrdin and Oleg Soskovets, we discussed questions of economic stabilization to a greater degree. This treaty has synonymously entered political history. And no matter what anyone says today, no matter what lengthy articles are written, the event has come to pass. It is an entirely logical event which has justified the hopes of most of the republic's residents. [Correspondent] You said that the treaty must be oriented toward specific problems... [Likhachev] Of course, it is difficult to lay out all the pluses and minuses on a bookkeeper's abacus. First of all, we must mention that the treaty allows us to create a normal state. The level of responsibility of this state is increasing. The need for increasing the intellect, competency and professionalism of its public officials is increasing. Ultimately, this will be a benefit for the people. I am not even speaking of some specific projects whose realization would be impossible without mutual understanding with Russia. Moreover, the treaty also removes many questions of international relations: It places at the forefront the problems of human rights and respect for the individual regardless of nationality. The so-called common man, of course, wants things he can understand--low prices, low rent, peace on the streets and material well-being. However, we cannot expect immediate benefits from this document. Moreover, without the active inclusion of the republic's citizens in the realization of the treaty--not in perception on the level of "like-dislike," but specifically in creative and conscious work--it is unlikely that we will be able to accomplish anything. Do not think I am trying to be coy. We are speaking here of the formation of a civil society in the republic. The complexity of the signed document consists of the fact that we, making an effort to depart from the former system, have nevertheless not gone away from it, but have built a picket fence of theses from the dictionary of the market economy. Marketing, management, investments--we hear these words every day, several times a day. But ask the common man what they mean, and he will shrug his shoulders at best. Politicians, economists and the people seem to be living in different dimensions. Some complain about the lack of education of the people. Others simply do not understand anything. This is very dangerous, because the average citizen does not feel himself to be a member of society and, it seems, soon he will become totally indifferent to what is being said there, "at the top." This difficulty will, naturally, be expressed in the realization of the treaty. [Correspondent] Is the process of realization of the treaty currently being formulated in a documental manner? [Likhachev] Yes, a draft program of action by the agencies of state power of the republic on realization of the treaty with Russia has been developed within the apparatus of the president and the cabinet of ministers. There is a supplement to this program which points out the need for adopting various edicts, laws and decrees. Moreover, it contains a list of supplemental agreements and treaties with the Russian Federation. In working on this document, the experts proceeded from the fact that, first of all, the treaty directly points out the presence of specific agreements--on transport, foreign policy, higher education and so forth. And secondly, the need for adoption of such documents is dictated by life itself. I might add that the shortest time alotted for preparation of various agreements is by the end of 1995. In this connection, I would like to turn to the problem of reforming the republic's apparatus of state structures. It is in need of rejuvenation. I believe this process must begin soon... [Correspondent] Some time after the adoption of the Declaration on State Sovereignty and before the signing of the treaty with Russia, none of the leaders of Tatariya, including you, ever directly answered the question of whether the republic is within the make-up of the Russian Federation. From this angle, the problem of the existence of Tatariya as a state is not being overly reviewed even today. Yet, in my opinion, from the treaty it clearly follows that the republic is nevertheless within the make-up of Russia. Having signed this treaty, have you not closed that door which opened the way to adoption of more and more new decisions securing and strengthening the position of the republic which, ultimately, could have led to ideal results for many of the political forces of the republic? [Likhachev] From the very start of negotiations with the organs of power of Russia, and even before, we knew where we were going. Our tactical steps were not always substantiated and justified, but we always kept our strategic goal in view. Whether the treaty turns out to be specifically such depends largely on the time factor. Had we concluded it a big sooner or a big later, it would have been somewhat different, perhaps closer to the ideal. However, the limit of time and the limit of confidence of the people had already been exhausted. After all, we cannot say for almost 3 years: Wait a bit longer, we will define ourselves soon. Negotiations continued, but there were no specific results--neither agreements, nor a treaty. And, naturally, after a certain time the question of confidence in the president and the state structures of the republic would have arisen. The treaty states that, "...the Republic of Tatarstan is a state united with the Russian Federation..." My colleagues--jurists in Moscow and in Europe--evaluated this formulation as being rather flexible. Such flexibility has allowed us to adopt many elements of life of the Federation while at the same time retaining our own, legitimized, view of our existence. In this case, and I repeat this for the 101st time, we cannot approach the question with standard measures--"a little federation-confederation." This is a certain intermediate model which corresponds to the given historical period, the expression of will of the people of the republic at the referendum of 21 March 1992. And, undoubtedly, it does not close off the path to development of the Russian Federation, to modernization of its state-legal forms, as well as to the movement of Tatarstan toward strengthening and expanding its independence. It is quite another matter that it is reasonable to fear the realization of the treaty in the sense that it is not yet provided with cadres, finances, or currency... However, if it did not exist, we would simply not have paid attention to many aspects of the republic's existence, just as we do not pay attention to our own miscalculations. If it turns out well, we are good fellows. If it does not turn out--Moscow is to blame. This, after all, is the most comfortable position... In my opinion, the positive moment of signing of the treaty between Russia and Tatarstan is obvious. We were the first and, God willing, not the last in Russia to show that we can achieve what we want by political methods instead of tanks. The leadership of Russia, in turn, demonstrated that it is capable of perceiving the new and of resolving at the negotiating table any contradictions which may arise. Now we must prove to the people with specific examples that the process of reforming Russia is in progress. Not only the leadership of the republic is interested in the treaty's realization, but also the leadership of Russia. And it is still unclear to whom it will ultimately give the greatest political capital. [Correspondent] By the way, in regard to earning political capital. The fact of signing of the treaty, it seems to me, has stirred up the extreme forces in the republic, activated them. In all probability, with the signing of the treaty, the opposition, which previously was in a state of ignorance and then also a state of confusion, now has grounds and a subject for criticism of the republic's leadership... [Likhachev] That is so, but it seems to me that in many people who call themselves politicians, the sense of political feel has simply been dulled. Since the referendum, criticism of this treaty cannot speak about anything else. Opposition is necessary in any society. But our opposition is acting strangely somehow. Those who call themselves federalists want Russia to be a unitarian state. The nationalists, meanwhile, strive to get maximum independence and full state separation from Russia. In doing so, both become removed from real life in their aspirations. The credo of the republic's leadership consists of following the main postulate of physicians: Do not cause harm. [Correspondent] During the period of the treaty's preparation, the republic authorities spoke about the fact that, having delegated a large part of the powers and authorities of Tatariya, Moscow will also give it a greater portion of responsibility. And the republic authorities, in turn, would readily accept this responsibility. In other words, they have taken out a promissory note of trust from the people, and now the time has come to repay it. And, perhaps, it would be entirely logical if people blame not Yeltsin, but Sheymiyev for the high prices in the stores. And no one will listen to explanations that, supposedly, the Moscow authorities are conducting an inept financial and tax policy, that the printing press which encourages inflation works not in Kazan, but in Moscow... Are you not afraid of such responsibility? [Likhachev] Only foolish people are not afraid of anything. Our situation is rather difficult. On one hand, we have formulated our independence, and on the other--we find ourselves in a unified economic, cultural and other types of space with Russia. It will be very difficult to ensure a standard which differs for the better from the average Russian indicators. Yet we must do so, because the people need not some political and legal formulas, but specific results. This is the problem for today and tomorrow, and this is a tactical problem. Yet the strategy has been and remains as before: The republic is a state, and must realize its economic and political sovereignty. And this includes reforming the supreme organs of state power, creating a full-fledged system of organs of local self-government, training high-class administrative cadres, ensuring a normal living standard, and so forth. The tasks, as you see, are not the easiest. But there is nowhere to go. The promissory note, after all, really does have to be repaid...
