Kyriyenko, doctor of economic sciences: "The Three I's of Leonid Kravchuk: Inconsistency, Indecision, Indeterminateness"] [Text] It is no longer a secret for anyone that Ukraine is on the brink of an unprecedented economic crisis, which in terms of its consequences and losses is tantamount to a great war. The inept former parliament and a president who procrastinates for years have brought this about. Instead of creating the necessary conditions to develop production and ensure an improvement in the welfare of the population following the proclamation of independence, the president and the power structure have done everything in order to cause in the country economic chaos and an extraordinary crisis, the like of which nobody in the world has experienced. There has been a lot of twaddle under the leadership of the president; actually, everything has been done in order not to approve a new democratic Constitution, which would have set the direction for building the state and codified the supremacy of the people, rather than the bureaucratic power structure. The people remain deprived of their rights and reduced to despair and misery in an independent Ukraine under President L. Kravchuk, just as they previously were under Stalin's and Brezhnev's rule. Now that the holding of the 26 June presidential election is drawing nearer, the president and his entourage are doing everything so that the election will not be held. The president understands that a new stage of building the state is coming which calls for a new strategy and tactic and for a renewal of the confidence of the people. They are in mortal fear of the election, which will amount to the verdict of the people for the woes and misery that they have brought down on the people. The political "dodges" of the president were revealed to the fullest extent in a conversation with journalists during his visit to the editorial office of the newspaper KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI, in other presentations, and in his address to the new parliament. On 20 February of this year, Leonid Makarovych announced his decision not to take part in the next presidential election on a Radio Liberty program. The president stated: "My participation in the election is infeasible, as is the election itself." The predominant motif in all presentations of the president is: The election should be postponed until a new Constitution is adopted and until the powers of the president and the government are defined. This begs the question: Who prevented the president from recommending that the parliament develop and approve a new Constitution, using the mandate of people's confidence, which the president to my mind does not justify? Was there not enough time? There was time. In the process, the president could have displayed the kind of determination he did in order to destroy the USSR in Belovezhskaya Pushcha, referring to the people's mandate and the Independence Declaration. The president has started to worry about the constitutionality of the election. If we proceed from the need for the new parliament to restore the absolute sovereignty of the people, rather than the power structure, the election will be constitutional in nature. The election will affirm the superiority of the power of the people who have been reduced to starvation and poverty, the people whom some are already calling "brutes." Each candidate for president will present his program, which will outline the key state-creating democratic provisions that will later be contributed to the development of a democratic Constitution of the independent state. As President L.M. Kravchuk was signing the Election Law, he believed that this law was not for him: "This was unacceptable for me." "As I signed the law, I knew what I was doing, but even then I made the decision for myself: It was not for me.... It was required by strikes and political demands." [preceding statements by Kravchuk given in Russian in the original] Such is the attitude of the president toward the law. The will of the people may be frivolously toyed with. None other than the president has talked repeatedly about the creation of a rule-of-law state in which the law should be complied with by each citizen, from the president on down to the lowly clerk. The president is intimidating the parliament with the fact that the entire responsibility will devolve to it if it confirms the decision of the former Supreme Council, because that parliament does not exist anymore. It is not a secret to anyone that L.M. Kravchuk wishes to keep himself as president and his bankrupt bureaucratic-administrative system as long as possible. Leonid Makarovych maintains that a president with unknown powers may be elected, whereas differing interests of diverse regions of Ukraine exist, which may bring about a confrontation. To my mind, the people will be able to assess the programs of all candidates for president through the election--programs that could unite the fundamental interests of the people of Ukraine in the east and the west, and in the south and the north alike. The early election of the president and local councils on 26 June will allow the people of Ukraine to reveal their genuine will and give them an opportunity to elect such a president and such local organs that will be capable of making Ukraine into a civilized state.
