Haqqani has formed a 100-member reconciliation council to achieve his aim. Prominent religious leaders, intellectuals and outstanding commanders have been included in the council. Two representatives each of the three provincial governments of Laghman, Nangathar and Kunar are also included in the council. The 45-member Commanders Shura of Kabul has also nominated two of its commanders to the reconciliation body. The four major parties of the Afghan fighters are also included in the council which has already opened peace negotiations with the concerned parties. The chief of the council, Commander Haqqani, according to the source had a detailed meeting with Commander Sadiq near Kabul on Tuesday. Commander Sadiq who is representing Harakat-e Enquilab-e Eslami played a key role in the reconciliation bid by the 45-member Commanders Shura last month. The Afghan prime minister Golboddin Hekmatyar accepted the Commanders Shura call for his resignation while president Rabbani rejected it as under the formula of Commanders Shura he was also supposed to step down as president to elect an interim government. According to Haqqani sources, the Hezb-e Eslami (Hekmatyar) and Jamiat-e Eslami have asked Haqqani to take initiative for a reconciliation. Jamiat-e Eslami is willing to enter into peace talks with Hezb-e Eslami but not with its war partner Gen. Rashid Dostum. Hezb-e Eslami is not ready to hold negotiations with Jamiat unless president Rabbani resigns his office. Meanwhile, the governor of Nangathar, Commander Qadeer, has proposed a grand gathering of the commanders, ulama and the representatives of all the Afghan parties to be held at Jalalabad, as soon as possible. According to the Afghan source, Governor Qadeer made this proposal while addressing a big gathering of prominent Afghan figures including religious leaders and commanders at Jalalabad on Tuesday. Qadeer said he would support all those moves aimed at to arrange a ceasefire in Kabul and other parts of Afghanistan. He said he was in touch with the leaders of the warring parties in Afghanistan for a peaceful settlement in his country. The sources close to another prominent Afghan leader, Prof. Abdol Rab Rasool Sayyaf, said in Peashawar on Tuesday that Sayyaf had asked President Rabbani and Prime Minister Hekmatyar to remove the communist elements from their ranks. Sayyaf is helping Rabbani in the ongoing Kabul war against Hekmatyar. One of the famous commanders of Sayyaf's party, Ittehad-e Eslami, Taj Mohammad is defending presidential palace at the first defence line at Pule Mehmood Khan in Kabul with his over 1800 fighters. Meanwhile, the supply of foods and other essential goods from Peshawar to Kabul is continued. A Soviet-made transport plane landed at the Peshawar airport on Tuesday. Another transport plane carrying the relief goods from Saudi Arabia took off from Peshawar airport on Monday, the official sources said.
