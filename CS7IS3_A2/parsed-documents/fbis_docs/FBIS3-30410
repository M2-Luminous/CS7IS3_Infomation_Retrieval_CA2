Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin was also with the Turkish delegation, while his counterpart Ahmad Sardar Asif Ali was with the Pakistani delegation. The esteemed guests then held talks first with Presidency President Izetbegovic and then with Prime Minister Silajdzic. After the talks, decrees on friendship and cooperation were signed in front of a number of reporters. The decree on friendship and cooperation between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Turkey was signed by Prime Ministers Silajdzic and Ciller, and between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Pakistan by Silajdzic and Bhutto. After the signing ceremony, Presidency President Alija Izetbegovic made the following statement: [Izetbegovic] It is a great honor and pleasure for me to have had a chance to welcome to Sarajevo Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller. Our two esteemed guests come from countries friendly toward us, countries that base their relations with other countries and the world on the defense of the principles of the UN Charter, a dedication to human rights, and a respect for human dignity. I would like to stress that our esteemed guests have been elected prime ministers in their countries through democratic elections, which is a fact that supports [words indistinct]. Therefore it is no coincidence that the two prime ministers are today guests of this besieged city, which symbolizes resistance and the heroic struggle of the peoples of Bosnia-Herzegovina for sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the political independence of our country. Our tragedy provides our true friends with an opportunity to to show in deed that they are friends, but also to unmask the hypocrisy of a number of countries that defend human rights in words only. In adopting resolutions and declarations, these countries [words indistinct] but a lack of any concrete action on their implementation has contributed to the continuation of the war, and to the deterioration of the situation in our country. I would like to express my gratitude to Mrs. Bhutto and Mrs. Ciller for the unqualified support we have received from their governments and people in our struggle for a just peace. This country, which is a victim of two (fascist) [words indistinct]. The joint declaration of the two prime ministers -- with which I have had a chance to acquaint myself -- reiterates their readiness to extend, on a bilateral level, concrete material and other assistance to our struggle. Finally, I would like to congratulate these brave women on their personal courage to come to Sarajevo despite warnings not to do so. Their visit and support are an encouragement to us to persevere in the struggle for the defense of our homeland, and therefore for all those principles on which the United Nations rest. This is also a incentive to all the defenders of democratic [word indistinct] in the world to intensify their efforts in the search for a just peace [words indistinct]. [Musabasic] The Turkish and Pakistani prime ministers also prepared a declaration on their visit to Sarajevo, and they addressed a few words to the reporters. Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller said: [Ciller] We are here primarily for humanitarian purposes. We believe that the Bosnians are fighting for freedom, territorial integrity, and human rights. We have always been concerned about human rights, regardless of where [word indistinct]. The basic right is the right to life. Thus our aim can serve as an appeal for the defense of human rights. Second, we believe in territorial integrity, and we believe that territorial integrity always has to be defended. This is why we believe that the efforts by the European Commnity must be reassessed, and they must be complete. This is a humanitarian issue, and also a moral issue [word indistinct]. Civilians are being killed here. We have once again to draw the attention of the world community to the fact that this is a moral issue. We have always defended democracy and human rights, and territorial integrity. Now it is time to unite and defend the aims that we and the international community support. It is an European idea, coexistence, coexistence among various religions, ethnic groups, and cultures, and we have to defend that. (That) is our treasure. This is the reason why we should defend that idea. The territorial integrity and coexistence in Sarajevo [words indistinct] but it has to be a just peace [words indistinct]. [Musabasic] Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto told the reporters that she did not want to reiterate the Sarajevo declaration, but she stated: [Bhutto] We have signed this declaration less as prime ministers and more as mothers, daughters, and women, to express our solidarity with the suffering of the people in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but also to draw the attention of the world once again to this place where the people are suffering so. We have to do something to stop this human suffering. But it is not only a question of human suffering, it is also a question of the values on which the UN Charter is based, and upon which peace and stability in the world have been built. Territorial integrity must be respected and aggression must not be rewarded. The international community has to act fast. First to stop the killing of innocent people, women, and children, and second, to protect the values that enable the world to live in peace. Territorial integrity must be defended, and aggression must not be rewarded if the world is to continue to live in peace.
