This is a grave military threat to the DPRK and an intolerable undisguised challenge to it. The U.S. and Japanese military forces sit together to discuss an operational plan for controlling the DPRK by force of arms at the time when the situation of the Korean peninsula is rushing up to the brink of a war, which shows that the maneuvres of the U.S. imperialists to provoke a new war are entering a very grave stage. But it is a foolish daydream that the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries try to control the DPRK with their military conspiracy. They must look straight at the realities and act with discretion.
