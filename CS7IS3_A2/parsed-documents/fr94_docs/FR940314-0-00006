FR940314-0-00006 FR940314-0-00002 5 CFR Part 532 RIN 3206&hyph;AF61 Prevailing Rate Systems; Champaign, Illinois, NAF Wage Area AGENCY: Office of Personnel Management. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing a final regulation to abolish the Champaign, IL, Federal Wage System nonappropriated fund (NAF) wage area for pay-setting purposes. With the closing of Chanute Air Force Base in August 1993, the only NAF employees remaining in the Champaign wage area are those located in Vermilion County, IL. This regulation assigns Vermilion County to the Marion, IN, NAF wage area. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 1, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Paul Shields, (202) 606&hyph;2848. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On November 10, 1993, OPM published an interim rule abolishing the Champaign, IL, Federal Wage System NAF wage area and assigning Vermilion County, IL, to the Marion, IN, wage area (58 FR 59639). OPM received no comments during the 30-day comment period. However, the interim regulation gave a March 4, 1994, effective date coinciding with the anticipated effective date of the Marion wage schedule (reflecting the 90-day delay required by law since 1984). Since the publication of the interim rule, Public Law 103&hyph;123, which phases out the 90-day delay, was enacted. The new law provides that wage adjustments will be effective on the later of the normal wage adjustment date for the wage area or the first day of the first pay period beginning on or after January 1, 1994. The normal wage adjustment dates for both the Champaign and Marion wage areas were in December 1933. Hence under the new law, wage adjustments for both of these wage areas would be effective on the first day of the first pay period beginning on or after January 1, 1994. Because of the interim rule abolishing the Champaign NAF wage area, there is no new wage schedule for Champaign. In order that Vermilion County employees may receive a pay adjustment in January 1994, as required by Public Law 103&hyph;123, the effective date of the wage area redefinition must be changed from March 4, 1994, to January 1, 1994. Waiver of 30-Day Delay in Effective Date of Final Regulation Pursuant to section 553(d)(3) of title 5 of the United States Code, I find that good cause exists to make this amendment effective in less than 30 days. The regulation is being made effective retroactively to January 1, 1994, so that Vermilion County employees may receive the pay adjustment required by Public Law 103&hyph;123. Regulatory Flexibility Act I certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because they will affect only Federal agencies and employees.
