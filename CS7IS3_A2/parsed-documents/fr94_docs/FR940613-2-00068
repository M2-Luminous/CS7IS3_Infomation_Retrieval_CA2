Purpose Under section 706 of the Social Security Act (the Act), the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) appoints the Council every 4 years. The Council examines issues affecting the Social Security Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) programs, as well as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which were created under the Act. In addition, the Secretary has asked the Council specifically to address the following: •Social Security financing issues, including developing recommendations for improving the long-range financial status of the OASDI programs; •General program issues such as the relative equity and adequacy of Social Security benefits for persons at various income levels, in various family situations, and various age cohorts, taking into account such factors as the increased labor force participation of women, lower marriage rates, increased likelihood of divorce, and higher poverty rates of aged women. In addressing these topics, the Secretary suggested that the Council may wish to analyze the relative roles of the public and private sectors in providing retirement income, how policies in both sectors affect retirement decisions and the economic status of the elderly, and how the disability insurance program provisions and the availability of health insurance and health care costs affect such matters. The Council is composed of 12 members in addition to the chairman: Robert Ball, Joan Bok, Ann Combs, Edith Fierst, Gloria Johnson, Thomas Jones, George Kourpias, Sylvester Schieber, Gerald Shea, Marc Twinney, Fidel Vargas, and Carolyn Weaver. The chairman is Edward Gramlich. The Council is to report to the Secretary, and such reports shall thereupon be transmitted to the Congress and to the Board of Trustees of each of the Trust Funds. II. Agenda The Council will discuss: •Economic well-being of today's elderly and those soon to retire; •Prognoses for baby-boom cohorts and beyond; •Issues facing the Social Security program; •Issues concerning pensions and other retirement saving; and •Matters relating to technical panels of experts.
