At the High Council of the Republic-Transitional Parliament [HCR-PT], the transitional constitution commission met at last today at the People's Palace. The meeting was expected to help in adopting the group's report. It must be noted here that the points of disagreement will be submitted to the next plenary session of the transitional legislative body for debate. According to certain sources, these two agreements are linked to the prerogatives of the leaders of the transition and this stalemate at the transitional constitution commission should mean the imminent convening of the much awaited HCR-PT plenary session. Monsignor Laurent Monsengwo Passigna, however, made an important point. The chairman of the HCR-PT recalled that it is up to the opposition to name a prime minister. In an interview published by the newspaper LA REFERENCE PLUS, Monsignor Monsengwo stated, and I quote: It is not for the political forces of the conclave to exercise a kind of veto. The problem here is that people negotiate badly and change their minds later. I feel that we must follow the decision made by the troika. According to the Kisangani bishop, under this plan, it is for the opposition to name a prime minister. The others, that is to say the political forces of the conclave, grant them this right on condition that this prime minister forms his government on the basis of the principle of balance and fairness, unquote. Another important point is that the next plenary session will not directly debate the issue of prime minister, Msgr. Monsengwo also said. He urged the politicians to make haste so that a truly responsible and competent government can be set up to control the catastrophic situation in the country. Meanwhile, the scramble for the post of transitional prime minister continues. There is, however, a new situation in the prospects for the head of the future transitional government. If the high council is bent on the prime minister's election, this vote must be in the form of secret ballot in which everyone, in line with his conscience, will vote for the best interests of the nation, declared Kibassa-Maliba, who was cited by LE SOFT newspaper. The paper also quoted the Union for Democracy and Social Progress leader as saying: Tshisekedi could present himself against other candidates. Things could now move more rapidly on the Zairian political scene in order to end the crisis that has seriously affected the country for many long months.
