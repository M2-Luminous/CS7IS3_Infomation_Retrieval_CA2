The source denounced this announcement, adding that Aden Governorate's population is not beggars, and it cannot accept charity from those who aggressed on its homeland. The source said that the head of the Sanaa regime should rather stop shelling the residential quarters and civil establishments in Aden, and killing of the elderly, women, and children, in implementation of the decision by Dr. 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Daylami, who allowed the killing of women, the elderly, and children. He added that such a decision is not approved by religion, morals, or human rights. Aden is also inaccessible, and it is not in need of the charity of those who try to destroy it. He should rather lift the injustice, corruption, and hegemony from our brothers in the north, who are fighting to get rid of his regime. The source expressed regret and sadness that a people like those in the north remain under the rule of such people, who try to destroy everything in democratic Yemen, and try to prevent water from reaching Aden, and destroy the electricity station and Aden's international airport and vital establishments, and set its refinery on fire -- though 30,000 persons depend on it for their living. They also threatened to prevent navigation in the Gulf of Aden, which receives foodstuffs and medicines. Then there may be a claim that they will send medicine and food for Aden's population.
