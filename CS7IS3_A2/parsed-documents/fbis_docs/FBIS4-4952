YOMIURI SHIMBUN added that amid this kind of situation, the ship, Mangyongbong-92, which uses one of the routes used for sending money to North Korea left Niigata port, Japan for Wonsan, North Korea on 30 March. It is the third time that Mangyongbong-92 set sail from Japan this year. After loading cargo at Niigata port on 28 March, Mangyongbong-92 set sail on 30 March at around 1000. Mangyongbong-92, which set sail from Niigata port, arrived 26 hours later in Wonsan. Members of the pro-North Korean residents' league in Japan use this ship, which can carry up to 250 people. It is also being used to transport cargo. It was learned that in 1993 Mangyongbong-92 entered Niigata port on 25 occasions. It transported about 5,000 members of the pro- North Korean residents' league in Japan to North Korea and various cargo. YOMIURI SHIMBUN pointed out that if the UN Security Council decides to carry out economic sanctions against North Korea and thus prohibits Japanese trade with North Korea and pro-North Korean residents league in Japan from visiting North Korea, there is a high possibility that Mangyongbong-92 will not be able to enter Japan any longer.
