Siclari spoke at the weekend of what he said were precise signals being sent out by the Sicilian Mafia with reference to the attempts of the Mafia's boss of bosses, Salvatore "Toto" Riina, to discredit the testimony of gangsters who have turned state's witnesses. Riina was captured in Palermo in January last year after more than a decade at large, thanks largely to information gathered from a Mafia informant, and is now on trial in Palermo. The anti-Mafia chief also mentioned recent demonstrations of some 300 residents of a district of Messina, in Sicily, who opposed the arrest of Sebastiano "Iano" Ferrara, described by state's witnesses as a senior Mafia boss and by his neighbors as a solid family man capable of keeping drug dealers out of his area of the city. Now, said Siclari, law enforcement officials are attempting to understand "whether the new forces preparing to go into government," the nation's rightist alignments under businessman Silvio Berlusconi's Freedom Front banner, "have different intentions, also on the basis of the fact that during the electoral campaign the intention was shown, though it was vague, of emptying the law on state's witnesses." Any move in this direction, continued the prefect in a television interview, would apparently be linked to "what is happening in the Campania region with the proposal of some Camorristi to disassociate themselves from their organization, but not become state's witnesses." "All this is to be seen as an attempt to remove themselves from the responsibilities of the Mafia and the Camorra," the name of organized crime in and around Naples and the Campania region. The head of the Anti-Mafia Directorate declared flatly, "It is not possible to change the law on state's witnesses. This must be kept firm and I hope that what was mentioned in the electoral campaign was mentioned without any precise view of the phenomena." He also reiterated the point: "This is no time to give in. If we should give in now, we'd be set back 50 years. The Mafia and other forms of organized crime have always been based on the concept that the state is not capable of keeping pressure on them for long. And this is the first time the state has been able to maintain strong pressure on organized crime. If we again showed that we were not capable, we would really lose the battle." After sounding this warning, Siclari said it was his opinion that the present Mafia strategy would not work and his hope that the new political parties at the fore "will have the sense to understanding that it is not possible for this to happen."
