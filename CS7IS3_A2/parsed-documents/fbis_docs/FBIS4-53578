The People's Democratic Party is led by three government ministers who were expelled from the United Party last week. They are Deputy Prime Minister Sethy Regenvanu, Health Minister Edward Tabisari, and Communications Minister Cecil Sinker. The three make up the junior partner in the coalition government of the Union of Moderate Parties. They have been joined by the former agriculture minister, Oneyn Tahi, who accused the NUP of being dictatorial when he resigned from the party. Mr. Regenvanu said in launching the new party last night that the objective of the People's Democratic Party would be a fair sharing of resources to the advancement of Vanuatu and its people.
