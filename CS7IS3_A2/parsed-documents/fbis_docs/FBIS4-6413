FBIS4-6413 "dreas075_a_94010" FBIS-EAS-94-075 Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Fail To Reach Accord on Platform Fail To Reach Accord on Platform OW1904105494 Tokyo KYODO in English 1047 GMT 19 Apr 94 OW1904105494 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, April 19 KYODO -- Representatives of the ruling coalition parties failed to agree on a policy platform Tuesday [19 April] for forming a new government to replace the cabinet of outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. The representatives resumed discussions on Tuesday morning to hammer out differences on two issues of immediate concern -- Japan's stance on North Korea's suspected nuclear arms development program and tax system reform -- before nominating a candidate for the premiership, party officials said. They reached an accord on the North Korean nuclear issue but failed to narrow differences over tax reform, the officials said. It now seems that Deputy Prime Minister and concurrently Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata is a virtual certainty to be elected the next prime minister. Michio Watanabe, an influential figure in the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), formally gave up his notion Tuesday to leave the party in a bid to seek the premiership, hoping to gain the support of the coalition. Watanabe, 70, conveyed his decision in a third meeting with LDP President Yohei Kono, who has himself vowed to run in a Diet election to select a successor to Hosokawa, 56, who abruptly announced his resignation on April 8 on account of his financial improprieties. The coalition representatives will resume talks Wednesday and the selection of Hata as a prime ministerial candidate by the coalition chiefs was postponed to as early as Wednesday, they said. As a result, a Diet election to nominate Hosokawa's successor will take place as early as Thursday, parliamentary sources said. Hata said Monday cabinet changes must be minimal after the establishment of a new government. On the North Korean nuclear problem, the representatives agreed Japan should be prepared under the framework of the Constitution for an emergency situation. The agreement reached said Japan would adhere to the policies of the United Nations, and "the government should be prepared under the framework of the Constitution for an emergency situation." It also said Japan should cooperate closely with the United States and South Korea. Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], which is led by Hata, has called for a tougher stance against North Korea and urged a revision of current laws, if necessary, to implement possible economic sanctions against North Korea. The Social Democratic Party (SDP), the largest party in the seven-party coalition, has voiced its opposition to sanctions. Japan's Constitution renounces the use of force to settle international disputes. As for tax reform, Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, the chief strategist in the eight-month-old coalition, proposed a sweeping tax reform centered on an indirect tax hike. SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo rejected the proposal, party officials said. The SDP has opposed the current 3 percent consumption tax on almost all goods and services. Hosokawa was forced to withdraw his plan in early February to introduce a fresh 7 percent "national welfare tax" to replace the consumption tax after facing stiff opposition from the SDP, which threatened to withdraw from the coalition. The representatives were from the level of secretary general of the SDP, Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), Komeito, the Japan New Party (JNP), the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), the Democratic Reform Party, a small parliamentary group in the House of Councillors, and Kaikaku no Kai (Reform Society), a small parliamentary group of LDP defectors in the House of Representatives. New party Sakigake (Harbinger), a small component in the coalition, which declared Friday that it will not take a post in the new cabinet because of disappointment over the issue of picking a successor to Hosokawa, did not attend the session. Sakigake led by Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura has said it will support the candidate agreed upon by the coalition.
