Standardized futures contract trading in steel products and sugar will be halted. Exchanges already engaged in futures trading in steel products and sugar will stop issuing futures contracts after the end of October. Trading under contracts for current futures trading will be allowed to continue until the day of settlement. 2. Trading under nonstandardized, long-term contacts may be continued; however, illegal sales of contracts at a profit to increase prices indirectly will be strictly prohibited. 3. It is suggested that the Ministry of Coal Industry issue a circular urging all coal exchanges and wholesale markets to stop designing and listing standardized futures contracts for coal varieties. 4. From now on, no exchanges will be allowed to decide on their own to list new futures varieties. The listing of any new variety must be reported to the China Securities Supervision and Administration Committee for examination and approval after its justification is fully proven. 5. No banking institution may issue letters of guarantee regarding futures trading. All futures exchanges are forbidden to accept bank-issued letters of guarantee for use as cash deposits. 6. When futures prices fluctuate drastically, the China Securities Supervision and Administration Committee may ask exchanges to raise the proportion of cash deposits to those prices. Zhu Li said: The State Council's General Office urges people's governments in all localities and relevant departments to follow and implement the foregoing opinion, and to actively but steadily carry out work arising from its issuance to ensure social stability and the normal performance of various economic tasks.
