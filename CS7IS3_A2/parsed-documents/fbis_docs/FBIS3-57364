The deputies have gone their separate ways for a week to work in their electoral districts. The official mass media have made the maximum effort to portray the Duma's first days as an all-Russia slanging match and a struggle of egoistic ambitions, to discredit it in the public consciousness, and, to be frank, to prepare the ground for its speediest dissolution. The reason for such zeal is understandable. The regime, which convened the Duma as a cover designed to legalize the results of the coup d'etat, obtained as a result of the elections something qualitatively different, which does not fit in with its plans. It has no need of such a parliament, and the first act in the struggle against the Duma was a psychological war against it on the air and in the pages of the press. Everything is being done to conceal from the electorate the true meaning of the work that has been done. Therefore, it is important to understand its actual meaning. For 10 days a very hard struggle was being waged to ensure the Duma's capacity for work -- to make it as difficult as possible for particular groupings inside and outside the Duma to block and thwart its activity by means of a boycott, procedural ruses, the fueling of organizational muddle, etc. It was in order to prevent such phenomena that a low quorum needed to open the sessions was set; it was made difficult to delay matters by arranging secret votes on any pretext; an obstacle was put in the way of the fragmentation of the corps of deputies into a mass of small and very small factions; and a small Duma Council was formed, consisting of just 10 members and, consequently, arriving more quickly at agreed decisions. All this has already yielded the first fruits and made it possible quite promptly to elect the chairman and his deputies and to form the Duma committees. On the whole, it can be said that the Duma promises to be an organ that is perfectly capable of working. Thus, an important point, but still not the decisive one, has been passed in the Duma's development as an organ of real state power. It is capable of adopting principled decisions, but will the decisions of the Duma (and the Federal Assembly as a whole) have a substantial impact on the state of affairs in the country? According to the text of the Constitution, which the Central Electoral Commission hastened to proclaim adopted, the rights and powers of parliament have been curtailed to such an extent that they are, in point of fact, not even legislative but advisory. On behalf of the so-called "legislative proposals commission under the president" the Duma was presented with a 107-point plan of legislative activity whose adoption would mean parliament vegetating for many years in complete isolation from reality and from the real needs and requirements of society and the state. The fact that the Duma brushed that plan aside attests to its state responsibility. It is undoubtedly necessary to develop the legislative base. But it is perfectly clear to any unbiased observer that the country's present problems lie in a somewhat different plane. We are suffering not from a deficit of laws but from a deficit of legality, when none of the existing laws is seriously being fulfilled and, most dangerously, an example is being set here by the top executive structures headed by the president, which descended to a coup d'etat and crude armed violence against law-abiding citizens. The question now stands as follows: Either legality will be restored or the country will sink deeper and deeper into the quagmire of economic catastrophe and smouldering civil war, which threatens at any moment to escalate into a full-scale war. It was in order to try to restore legality by peaceful, nonviolent means that the opposition entered the Duma in full awareness of the fact that the entire post-October political structure was lacking a strong legal foundation. Consequently, it is a question not of a submissive existence under conditions imposed by force but of a need to radically change these conditions. This objective need can be formulated as follows: the restoration of effective parliamentary control over the executive structures -- presidential, government, and any others. At the same time it is necessary to sustain the principle that the greater the powers of the executive, the more rigid and scrupulous must be the legislature's control over them. This not only does not contradict the principle of the separation of powers but, on the contrary, stems directly from it. The legislative determination of the composition, structure, and size of funding of executive organs, the approval of candidacies for ministers and other top officials, the regular hearing of reports on the activities of ministries and departments, the holding, where necessary, of investigations -- all this is the inalienable prerogative of parliament and of its committees and commissions with a normal democratic procedure of state management and must become part of Russian political practice. This virtually means an objective need to adopt a new constitution. Is the Duma (Federal Assembly) ready to take serious steps in the said direction? Taking into account the substantial political heterogeneity of the corps of deputies, obviously a return to legality will not be a one-off act but will require persistent efforts to form a responsible state majority in the Duma and for it to win public trust and support. In our view, the platform for its consolidation must be an understanding of the disastrous nature of the present socioeconomic policy, protection for Russia's fundamental national-state interests, and the desire to establish genuine people's power in the country and the fatherland's spiritual revival. For its part the deputies' faction of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation will strive to ensure that the Duma adopts decisions on a number of fundamental questions. It is necessary to investigate and make a political assessment of the events of 21 September through 4 October last year and their consequences and to adopt legislative acts aimed at preventing anything similar ever again. The circumstances and consequences of the illegal Belovezhskaya Forest compact must similarly be analyzed. A very important task of parliament by way of restoring legality is also to examine the question of the lawfulness of the interpretation of the voting results of 12 December 1993 as the electorate's adoption of the draft constitution proposed in B. Yeltsin's name. It is our conviction that such an interpretation is unlawful. So many very gross violations of the Constitution and the Referendum Law were committed in the course of preparing and "adopting" that draft that they constitute perfectly adequate grounds for repealing the Central Electoral Commission's decision and resuming the constitutional process by means, for example, of scheduling a general election to the Constitutional Assembly. The period which the country is going through is a typical example of what is called a suspension of law, when legitimacy finds itself in question, i.e. the legal succession of all the branches of power without exception, including, of course, the Federal Assembly itself. In our view, the legality of parliament can be interpreted only from the viewpoint of the need for the country to return to the channel of rule-of-law development and the maintenance of civilian peace. Those actions -- and only those actions of it -- which are aimed at achieving the said goal can be considered lawful. This goal also determines the extent of the Duma's powers needed to realize it. The source of these powers is the direct expression of the electorate's will, certainly not Edict No. 1400, as frequent attempts are made to portray the matter. All these juridical niceties might at first sight seem to have no direct bearing on the country's real needs in its present catastrophic state. It must be understood, however, that without an increase in the rights and powers of parliament it will be unable to make a real contribution to the cause of surmounting the crisis, and any initiatives by it will remain just good intentions. This does not mean, however, that urgent socioeconomic problems have remained outside our attention. The Communists' faction has its own plan of legislative initiatives on a wide range of issues. These are, above all, draft laws aimed at replacing the policy of reforms and protecting the Russian economy: on labor collectives, taxation, price formation, the destatization of ownership (as an alternative to privatization), investment policy, and support for the agro-industrial complex. State support for science, culture, education, and health care and material and moral protection for the family, motherhood, and childhood require special attention. Extraordinary measures are needed to combat corruption and crime, particularly street crime. Any government which seriously intends to work in this area will receive our vote of confidence. But first a government program with a clear indication of the specific goals and the approximate deadlines for realizing them and with calculations of the funds necessary for this must be published, receive an expert appraisal in parliamentary committees, be discussed in detail, and, finally, be approved by the Duma. Only in this case does parliament have the right to give its consent to the appointment of the head of government and other officials, and only on this condition can it bear responsibility for the country's situation. Maybe a different way of conducting state affairs, which was practised hitherto, the method of backstage infighting and intriguing, creates an illusion of autocratic power, but in practice it has led and does lead to increased chaos and arbitrariness, when crude violence remains the only argument in a dispute, and this, as is known, is a highly unreliable and short-lived instrument for resolving complex tasks. This is not the first time Russia has experienced such a situation. Every time the executive's stubborn reluctance to cooperate with the representative power and to submit to parliamentary control has led, in the final analysis, to very grave social upheavals. The last time, this happened literally before our eyes. The collapse of the great power, bloody conflicts, economic disaster, the unprecedented degrading of national and state dignity -- do these cruel realities really not serve as an adequate argument in favor of choosing a different path of cooperation among public forces and among the branches of state power? The first days of the Duma's work have created the impression that there are forces in it which are capable of responding to reasonable arguments. Despite all their heterogeneity, they will be able to cooperate if they regard the interests of the whole state and the whole people as of paramount importance. It would be better for those who are not capable of this to leave the political stage voluntarily, without waiting for tough circumstances and the people's indignation to force them to do so.
