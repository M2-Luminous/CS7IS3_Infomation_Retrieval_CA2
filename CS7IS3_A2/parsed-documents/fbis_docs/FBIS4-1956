Cong Zhenglong, vice governor of the province, delivered a speech at the press briefing, in which he said: The large-scale increase of saving deposits made by both urban and rural residents has expanded the bank resources of funds, reinforced the capability of financial departments in releasing credits and loans, and provided the strong and effective guarantee of funds for promoting the economic development in the province. He said: 1994 is a year in which the province will make a crucial step in the reform of financial systems. Along with gradually accelerating the pace of turning the specialized bank business into commercial one, the position occupied by saving deposits in handling credits and loans by the financial institutions will become more important. Therefore, financial institutions should seize the current favorable opportunity to launch a large-scale propaganda campaign on saving deposits and to mobilize all social forces to further set off a new upsurge of grasping saving deposits.
