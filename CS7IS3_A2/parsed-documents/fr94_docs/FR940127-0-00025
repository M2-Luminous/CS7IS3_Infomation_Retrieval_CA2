In addition, as provided in those instructions, a multifamily residential property loan that is sold subject to a pro rata loss sharing arrangement is treated by the selling bank as sold (and excluded from balance sheet assets) to the extent that the sales agreement provides for the purchaser of the loan to share in any loss incurred on the loan on a pro rata basis with the selling bank. In such a transaction, from the standpoint of the selling bank, the portion of the loan that is treated as sold is not subject to the risk-based capital standards. In connection with sales of multifamily residential property loans in which the purchaser of a loan shares in any loss incurred on the loan with the selling institution on other than a pro rata basis, these other loss sharing arrangements are taken into account for purposes of determining the extent to which such loans are treated by the selling bank as sold (and excluded from balance sheet assets) under the risk-based capital framework in the same manner as prescribed for reporting purposes in the instructions for preparation of the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income. (1) The loan amount does not exceed 80 percent of the value 30 of the property securing the loan as determined by the most current appraisal or evaluation, whichever may be appropriate (75 percent if the interest rate on the loan changes over the term of the loan); 30 At the origination of a loan to purchase an existing property, the term ``value'' means the lesser of the actual acquisition cost or the estimate of value set forth in an appraisal or evaluation, whichever may be appropriate. (2) For the property's most recent fiscal year, the ratio of annual net operating income generated by the property (before payment of any debt service on the loan) to annual debt service on the loan is not less than 120 percent (115 percent if the interest rate on the loan changes over the term of the loan) or, in the case of a property owned by a cooperative housing corporation or nonprofit organization, the property generates sufficient cash flow to provide comparable protection to the bank; (3) Amortization of principal and interest on the loan occurs over a period of not more than 30 years; (4) The minimum original maturity for repayment of principal on the loan is not less than seven years; (5) All principal and interest payments have been made on a timely basis in accordance with the terms of the loan for at least one year before the loan is placed in this category; 31 31 In the case where the existing owner of a multifamily residential property refinances a loan on that property, all principal and interest payments on the loan being refinanced must have been made on a timely basis in accordance with the terms of that loan for at least the preceding year. The new loan must meet all of the other eligibility criteria in order to qualify for a 50 percent risk weight. (6) The loan is not 90 days or more past due or carried in nonaccrual status; and (7) The loan has been made in accordance with prudent underwriting standards. Also included in this category are privately-issued mortgage-backed securities provided that: (1) The structure of the security meets the criteria described above for ``Mortgage-Backed Securities;'' (2) if the security is backed by a pool of conventional mortgages on one-to-four family residential or multifamily residential properties, each underlying mortgage meets the criteria described in this section for inclusion in the 50 percent risk weight category at the time the pool is originated; (3) if the security is backed by privately-issued mortgage-backed securities, each underlying security qualifies for inclusion in the 50 percent risk category; and (4) if the security is backed by a pool of multifamily residential mortgages, principal or interest payments on the security are not 30 days or more past due. 32 32 Privately-issued mortgage-backed securities that do not meet these criteria or that do not qualify for a lower risk weight generally are assigned to the 100 percent risk weight category. * * * * * Table II._Summary of Risk Weights and Risk Categories * * * * * Category 3 *␣*␣* (2) Loans fully secured by first liens on multifamily residential properties that have been prudently underwritten and meet specified requirements with respect to loan-to-value ratio, level of annual net operating income to required debt service, maximum amortization period, minimum original maturity, and demonstrated timely repayment performance. * * * * * By order of the Board of Directors. Dated at Washington, DC, this 14th day of December, 1993. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Patti C. Fox, Acting Deputy Executive Secretary.
