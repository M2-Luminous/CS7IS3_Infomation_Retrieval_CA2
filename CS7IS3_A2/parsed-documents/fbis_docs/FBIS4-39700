An intergovernmental agreement was signed here today which introduces liberal conditions for travel under a general civil passport. This applies to all people who travel to Russia or Slovakia with an invitation for private or official business and for tourism or medical treatment for a period of up to 30 days. Visas will only be needed by those people who intend to look for work or change their permanent place of residence. "The agreement which has been signed," Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan stated in an interview with your ITAR-TASS correspondent, "will help to deepen mutual contacts and cooperation between the two countries' citizens. This is dictated by the mutual interests of Slovakia and Russia but is not evidence of a new emphasis in Slovakia's eastern policy."
