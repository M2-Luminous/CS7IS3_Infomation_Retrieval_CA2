Chinese officials complain of the West's obsession with Tiananmen and the crushing of the student democracy movement as if it had been no more than a passing hiccup. It is because it was no such thing that the anniversary must not be passed over in silence. Compared with some of China's previous political convulsions, Tiananmen may seem relatively tame. Yet for hundreds of millions of Chinese both inside and outside the country it carries greater significance. Not only was it the first upheaval to have such an immediate impact on international political awareness -- it was also the seminal political experience for a generation for whom the Cultural Revolution was just a childhood memory. Older Chinese knew to treat the apparent political relaxation of the Beijing Spring with distrust. The protesters on Tiananmen Square had to discover the leadership's ruthless cynicism for themselves. Tiananmen was also a powerful wake-up call for Hong Kong. Since 1984, the territory had accustomed itself to assuming Britain and China provided stability while Hong Kong delivered its own prosperity. The disappointment and anger which drove a million people to march through the streets reflected the realisation that Chinese rule after 1997 might not be so benign after all. In the five years since the crackdown, human rights in China have hardly improved. Dissidents are harassed and jailed. Political freedoms are nonexistent. Religious worship is interfered with arbitrarily. Journalists are jailed for spying. Sentences for economic as well as political crimes are harsh. Indispensable Partner Discontent continues to simmer close to the surface. The causes of the unrest that boiled over in 1989 -- arbitrary government, economic disruption, and rampant corruption -- appear to have worsened in the past two years. Yet while the anniversary has attracted media attention, governments have once again begun to come to terms with the fact that China is an indispensable partner politically and economically. Most European governments followed former United States President George Bush in making peace with China during the Gulf War and despite the occasional -- and costly -- flirtation with Taiwan, most have continued to court Beijing. Under President Bill Clinton, however, the United States tried and failed to use trade as a lever to force improvements in human rights. To the victims of the 1989 military crackdown, and of China's continued political repression, that policy gave a glimmer of false hope. Rekindling Hope It did not work. Its reversal was dictated by economic and geopolitical necessity. But, while Mr Clinton's decision to separate trade and human rights was the correct one for Hong Kong, he has yet to come up with an alternative policy on human rights which could rekindle real hope in China and provide some reassurance of American support for Hong Kong's continued political freedoms after 1997. Meanwhile, now that renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation trading status is no longer a domestic political issue, future anniversaries may pass unnoticed. Of more immediate concern to Hong Kong, however, is an apparent change in British policy since the governor's return from London last weekend. Although Chris Patten is standing firm over his political reform package, which China has said will be dismantled in 1997, the government opposes a human rights commission and other human rights legislation because it would not last beyond the handover. At the same time, while exiled activist Han Dongfang has been permitted to stay in Hong Kong, U.S.-based Chinese scholars Liu Binyan and Ruan Ming have been refused visas to Hong Kong, for fear they may make outspoken attacks on Beijing. These may be only the first signs of change. But how long will it be before the government begins to stifle local reminders of the June 4 massacre? The crackdown five years ago was not a mistake or an accident. It was a calculated act of repression, intended to reassert total political control after a moment of relaxation. That is why senior leaders such as President Jiang Zemin say they would do it again if necessary. For Hong Kong to allow them to escape without further criticism would be a betrayal of the millions who are still suffering from their wounds.
