The great guest and the delegation accompanying him enjoyed a popular and official welcome, which expressed the depth of the relations linking the two fraternal peoples. Very important bilateral talks took place between the brother leader of the revolution and President Idriss Deby, at which prevailed an atmosphere of friendship and common understanding and which covered a number of issues at the bilateral, African, and international levels. The brother leader of the revolution briefed his great guest on the achievements of the Great al-Fatih Revolution in the political, economic, cultural, and social fields. He informed him also of the intellectual and practical foundations of people's authority, which enabled the Libyan Arab people to practise their authority through their people's congresses and committees without having anybody to act on their behalf or represent them. President Deby informed his brother, the leader of the revolution, of the political and economic program of the Chadian Government and its efforts in the field of economic and social development in a way that consolidates stability and security for the Chadian people. In the field of bilateral relations, the two sides expressed their satisfaction with the continuous development of their strong relations and fruitful cooperation and stressed the need to adopt the necessary measures to consolidate the bilateral relations in all fields and achieve economic and social cooperation between the two countries. The two sides stressed the need to find the suitable mechanisms to guarantee the follow-up and implementation of all the agreements and minutes of meetings through the joint committee and ensure a permanent supervision by the leaderships of the two countries, within the framework of direct contacts and consultations. During the visit, a treaty of friendship and cooperation, which consolidates the relations between the two fraternal countries, was signed. The Chadian side was informed of the Lockerbie issue and the mandatory sanctions imposed on the Libyan Arab people and the negative effects on the human and economic levels that have affected the Libyan Arab people and the neighboring states, including the Republic of Chad. The Chadian side expressed its solidarity with the Libyan Arab people against these unjust measures and expressed support for Arab, African, and international efforts to find an urgent and just solution to this question, which concerns the region as a whole, through direct dialogue in a way that protects security and peace in the region. In this context, the two sides expressed their regret for the way the UN Security Council deals with this issue and expressed their anxiety about the intervention policy applied to small states. On the African level, the two sides welcome the political transformations in South Africa and its joining the OAU. They express their annoyance at the continuation of armed conflicts in various parts of the continent and the destruction they leave behind both in human and material levels. The two sides stressed the need for the OAU to find the efficient solutions to the problems of the continent and stressed the importance of Arab-African cooperation in general and the development of cooperation between the Arab Maghreb states and the states of Central and West Africa in particular. They stressed the importance of consultations between the states of the African Sahel and the GSPLAJ. They stress that the debt issue is heavy on most African states and that the exemplary solution to this question lies in the control by African states of their natural resources and wealth and the setting up of an equitable economic order that secures and helps stability and development in African states. At the end of the visit, Chadian President Idriss Deby expressed his great thanks and appreciation to the brother Colonle Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, the leader of the Great al-Fatih Revolution, and to the Libyan Arab people for the generous hospitality and warm fraternal welcome devoted to him and the delegation accompanying him. His Excellency President Idriss Deby extended an invitation to the brother Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, the leader of the Great al-Fatih Revolution, to visit the Republic of Chad, which he accepted with gratitude. Its date will be fixed later. Written in Tripoli on 4 June 1994
