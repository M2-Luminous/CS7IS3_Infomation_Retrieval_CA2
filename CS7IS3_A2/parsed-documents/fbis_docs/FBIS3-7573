According to a poll conducted by NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN from 25 to 27 March through telephone interviews of 3,000 respondents, the support rate for the Hosokawa cabinet is 47.6 percent, falling 4.9 points from the 52.5 percent recorded in the previous poll in February. On the contrary, the percentage of pollees who do not support the administration increased to 31.7 percent. The most number of pollees cited "lack of transparency in the policymaking process" as their reason for not supporting Hosokawa's government, reflecting the criticism of and dissatisfaction with the discord among the ruling coalition parties; and the abruptness of policy decisions, as evidenced by the national welfare tax plan, and the cabinet reshuffle fiasco. Regarding the issue of the prime minister's loan of 100 million yen from the Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin trucking company, which is delaying deliberations on the draft fiscal 1994 budget, as much as 49.8 percent of respondents believed: "The prime minister's explanation is not convincing," and "it is dubious." On the other hand, 80 percent of pollees expressed the opinion that the Diet should deal with the budget bill immediately. The Hosokawa cabinet marked a record 69.6 percent support rating last August, immediately after formation. Its popularity has declined consistently since then, falling to 52.5 percent in the February poll conducted after the turmoil over the national welfare tax plan. The percentage of non-supporters has also increased steadily in inverse proportion to the support rate. In the latest poll, this increased by 4.5 points to 31.7 percent. Apparently, the decrease in the percentage of supporters is directly reflected in the increase in the percentage of non-supporters. The top reasons cited by supporters of the administration (more than one answer allowed) include: "Freshness," 48.2 percent; "because it is a non-Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] coalition administration," 41.8 percent; and "the prime minister is a trustworthy person," 32.4 percent. On the other hand, only 8.6 percent said its "policies are good;" 7.8 percent appreciated its "coordination ability;" and 4.6 percent commended its "stability." "Lack of transparency in the policymaking process" (53.5 percent) topped the reasons for not supporting the Hosokawa administration, followed by "poor implementation ability," 49.3 percent; "bad policies," 44.8 percent; and "lack of coordination ability," 40.6 percent. This seems to reflect the popular criticism of the prime minister's weak leadership, as seen in the breakdown of the Japan- U.S. summit talks, and the national welfare tax commotion; and discontent with the ruling coalition parties' bureaucrat-led policymaking process. Regarding the prime minister's loan of 100 million yen from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, only 6.3 percent accepted the prime minister's explanation as "convincing," while 35.8 percent were "not really satisfied" with his explanation, although they believed "nothing can be done under the circumstances." On the other hand, 36.9 percent were of the opinion that "the prime minister's explanation is not fully convincing," and 12.9 percent even thought that "his explanation is completely dubious." This shows that while the prime minister claims he "has answered questions in the Diet in good faith," around half of the pollees doubted his explanation. However, regarding the LDP and other groups' refusal to deal with the draft 1994 budget until they are given a satisfactory explanation of the 100 million yen affair, only 4 percent thought "refusing deliberations is the normal thing to do," and 7.7 percent claimed "the refusal is inevitable." In contrast, 53.1 percent expressed the opinion that "although the refusal is understandable, they should go into deliberations," and 27.2 percent asserted "the refusal is unacceptable; they should go into deliberations immediately." This means that more than 80 percent of pollees want Diet deliberations on the budget to start. Concerning an increase in the consumption tax and other indirect taxes, 6.3 percent were "in favor," and 46.2 percent thought "this is inevitable as a revenue source to cover policies dealing with the aging society," showing a majority accepts the tax hike.
