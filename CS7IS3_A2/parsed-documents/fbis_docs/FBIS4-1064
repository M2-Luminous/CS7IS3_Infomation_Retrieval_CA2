Doonan] [Text] Ulundi April 20 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] President Mangosuthu Buthelezi said on Wednesday [20 April] he had joined South Africa's electoral process to save the country from disaster and to contribute to peace. Interviewed before he addressed more than 10,000 jubilant IFP supporters in the kwaZulu capital Ulundi, Mr Buthelezi said although he did not think the IFP's participation in national elections would lead to an immediate reduction in violence "the proportion of violence will be less". He said it would be naive to believe Inkatha's participation in elections would mean an end to violence "but it should decrease because tensions are less". "It will be difficult to imagine that all tension can vanish in a few days...we would hope tension will somehow be decreased." He said he had asked State President F W de Klerk to lift the state of emergency only to be told that his advisers had suggested he impose the emergency in other volatile parts of the country. Asked whether he expected to fare well in next week's elections he said he did not want to "prophesy...that will be tested." "Some of our offices can't cope with the number of people joining," he added. Mr Buthelezi said his late entry into the election race would hamper the IFP's performance. He said voter education had not reached all of his supporters and "this indicates it could well affect the percentage (of support)". Asked why he had entered elections at this late stage, the chief minister replied: "I did so to save the country from disaster and to contribute to peace." The IFP president was later received by cheering crowds outside the kwaZulu Legislative Assembly building.
