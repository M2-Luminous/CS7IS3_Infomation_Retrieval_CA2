FR940204-2-00137 FR940204-2-00095 11. The distributor of a Fund will adopt compliance standards as to when each class of shares may appropriately be sold to particular investors. Applicants will require all persons selling shares to agree to conform to such standards. 12. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the directors of a Fund with respect to the Plans and related agreements will be set forth in guidelines which will be furnished to the directors of the Fund. 13. Each portfolio will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, services, fees, transfer agency expenses, sales loads, deferred sales loads, conversion features, and exchange privileges applicable to each class of shares of such portfolio in every prospectus, regardless of whether all classes of shares in the portfolio are offered through the prospectus. Each portfolio will disclose the respective expenses and performance data applicable to all classes of shares in every shareholder report. The shareholder reports will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement of operations, information related to the portfolio as a whole generally and not on a per class basis. Each portfolio's per share data, however, will be prepared on a per class basis with respect to all classes of shares of such portfolio. To the extent any advertisement or sales literature describes the expenses or performance data applicable to any class of shares in a portfolio, it will also disclose the respective expenses and/or performance data applicable to all classes of shares in each portfolio. The information provided by a Fund for publication in any newspaper or similar listing of each portfolio's net asset value and public offering price will present each class of shares separately. 14. Any class of shares with a conversion feature (``Purchase Class'') will convert into another class (``Target Class'') of shares on the basis of the relative net asset values of the two classes, without the imposition of any sales load, fee, or other charge. After conversion, the converted class will be subject to an asset-based sales charge and/or service fee (as those terms are defined in Article III, Section 26 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice), if any, that in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based sales charge and service fee to which they were subject prior to the conversion. 15. If a Fund implements any amendment to its 12b-1 Plan (or, if presented to shareholders, adopts or implements any amendment of a Services Plan) that would increase materially the amount that may be borne by the Target Class shares under the plan, Purchase Class shares will stop converting into Target Class unless the holders of Purchase Class shares, voting separately as a class, approve the proposal. The directors of the Funds shall take such action as is necessary to ensure that existing Purchase Class shares are exchanged or converted into a new class of shares (``New Target Class''), identical in all material respects to Target Class shares as they existed prior to implementation of the proposal, no later than such shares previously were scheduled to convert into Target Class shares. If deemed advisable by the directors of the Funds to implement the foregoing, such action may include the exchange of all existing Purchase Class shares for a new class (``New Purchase Class''), identical to existing Purchase Class shares in all material respects except that New Purchase Class shares will convert into New Target Class shares. New Target Class shares or New Purchase Class shares may be formed without further exemptive relief. Exchanges or conversions described in this condition shall be effected in a manner that the directors of the Funds reasonably believe will not be subject to federal taxation. In accordance with Condition 4 above, any additional cost associated with the creation, exchange, or conversion of New Target Class shares or New Purchase Class shares shall be borne solely by the adviser and the distributor of the Fund. Purchase Class shares sold after the implementation of the proposal may convert into Target Class shares subject to the higher maximum payment, provided that the material features of the Target Class shares plan and the relationship of such plan to the Purchase Class shares are disclosed in an effective registration statement. 16. Applicants acknowledge that the grant of the exemptive order requested by this application will not imply SEC approval, authorization, or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that a Fund may make pursuant to a Plan in reliance on the exemptive order. 17. Applicants will comply with the provisions of proposed rule 6c-10 under the Act (Investment Company Act Release No. 16619 (Nov. 2, 1988)), as such rule is currently proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted, or amended. For the SEC, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority. Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;2494 Filed 2&hyph;3&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 8010&hyph;01&hyph;M
