This shows that the U.S. previous policy of using human rights issues to put pressure on China has failed, and that China's foreign policy toward the United States "with good reason, advantages, and restraint" has gotten the upper hand in the present Sino-American diplomatic dispute. Sino-American relations in the future might move in a new direction of seeking mutual benefit, cooperation, and common ground while reserving differences, which China has always advocated. In the past, China did not occupy a decisive position in the eyes of the United States. But now the United States has seen this Tai Shan [a symbol of great influence] with its own eyes. In his speech delivered on 27 May, Clinton admitted: "Our relationship with China is important to all Americans. We have significant interests in what happens there and what happens between us. China has an atomic arsenal and a vote and veto in the United Nations Security Council. It is a major element in Asian and global security. We share important interests, such as a nuclear-free Korean peninsula and sustaining the global environment. China is also the world's fastest-growing economy. Over $8 billion of U.S. exports to China last year supported over 150,000 American jobs..." Therefore, Clinton has decided to renew China's MFN status. Before the above-mentioned announcement was made, it was reported that, while renewing China's MFN status, Clinton would increase customs duties on products manufactured by China's state-owned enterprises and military industrial enterprises and would use this as a stepping stone for personally overruling [fou jue 0694 0414] the seven executive orders on human rights. However, in his announcement, Clinton did not mention China's state-owned enterprises and military industrial enterprises at all. He only announced a ban on importing weapons, principally guns and ammunition, from China with total value of less that $200 million. Compared with the $31 billion of China's exports to the United States, such an amount is trivial and only represents a symbolic figure. However, to placate congressmen and congresswomen who advocate human rights, Clinton also announced "extending the sanctions imposed as a result of the events in Tiananmen Square," and continued to refuse China permission to participate in the U.S. Trade and Development Aid Program, the Overseas Private Investment Companies Program, and the United States and Asian Environmental Partners Program, and denied licenses for exporting dual-use civilian products to China, among others. This shows that Clinton has not done things in a completely unrestrained manner, because he has still kept some room for maneuver. Notwithstanding, Clinton has dared to go back on [fou ding 0694 1353] his campaign promise to strengthen pressure on China as well as the executive order he issued after taking office on attaching human rights conditions to the renewal of China's MFN status. This has required great courage. In particular, while admitting that the policy of "linking" trade with human rights "no longer works," Clinton has acknowledged [ren tong 6126 0681] China's views on seeking common grounds while reserving differences, laying aside ideological differences such as human rights, and working for the goal of developing common interests. People still remember that, at the summit meeting of Asian-Pacific countries held in Seattle in November last year, President Jiang Zemin told Clinton: As the Cold War has ended, we must focus our attention on economic development. China and the United States must increase mutual trust, seek common ground while reserving differences, and develop their common interests in economic and trade cooperation, international peace, and security. Handling relations between the two sides must be considered from the angle of the global arena, the future, and the 21st century. At that time, Clinton agreed with this view. In Seattle, Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen also told U.S. Secretary of State Christopher: "Sino-American relations must always be based on common interests, but not on the same social system, way of life, ideology, and values." With regard to Sino-American differences, he maintained that specific problems should be solved in specific ways. He opposed linking specific issues such as democracy, human rights, and proliferation of weapons with trade. He said that the two countries must stop debating about ideology, democracy, and human rights issues. They must seek common grounds while reserving differences, expand areas of agreement, and work for common interests, in particular economic interests. Clinton's 27 May speech has shown that the United States is treating Sino-American relations from the high strategic plane. It has agreed to seek common ground while reserving differences and develop common interests. This is precisely what is required by the U.S. strategy of shifting its economic and diplomatic focus to Asia, because China is a major country in Asia as well as a locomotive of rapid economic development in the region. If U.S-China relations become deadlocked or are even brought to a confrontational stage, the United States' new Asian strategy can be nothing but empty talk. Therefore, Clinton's decision is being welcomed by various Asian countries.
