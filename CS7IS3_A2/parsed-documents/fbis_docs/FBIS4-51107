Another writes a letter to a newspaper criticising the Hong Kong legal system for sentencing a man to six years for a relatively minor burglary and sending another, who left his assault victim permanently disabled, to a training school. A third, who lives in a public housing estate, demonstrates outside a fancy block of flats and berates wealthy residents for living in the lap of luxury, while the working classes are forced to exist in shoe-boxes. What do these three people have in common? They could, in theory, be charged with sedition. Ridiculous, you say. In theory, yes. But the laws of Hong Kong state clearly that a seditious intention is an intention: 1) To bring into hatred or contempt or to excite disaffection against the administration of justice in Hong Kong. 2) To raise discontent or disaffection among Her Majesty's subjects or inhabitants of Hong Kong. 3) To promote feelings of ill will and enmity between different classes of the population of Hong Kong. These offences are, in theory, punishable by a long prison sentence. Of course, they are anachronisms which have been lying untouched on the statute books for years. No one in the present administration has ever given the slightest thought to using them against the Hong Kong public. But 1997 is looming and with it comes a host of uncertainties and unanswered questions. Among them is what will happen to some of these laws? It is a good question and one to which no one seems to have an answer now. Hong Kong law must be localised before 1997. It is a huge task and the Government has not consulted China on some areas of the law. Indeed, Hong Kong officials are still discussing what to do among themselves. There appear to be at least three options: rewrite the legislation; talk to China about it through the Joint Liaison Group (JLG); or do nothing and leave any changes to the Special Administrative Region (SAR) government. While the Government ponders what to do, it seems that members of the Preliminary Working Committee -- the Beijing-appointed advisers -- are taking a very keen interest in some of these laws. It does not take a great leap of imagination to believe that many of the old laws have a certain appeal to some people in Beijing. A few minor changes -- substitute Her Majesty for something to do with the central government -- and you are in business. You have some ready-made laws that are so vague, so open to interpretation, that they could be used against anyone for doing anything at any time. According to the Basic Law, the SAR government should enact laws to prohibit any act of treason, secession, sedition and subversion against the central government and theft of state secrets. Legislators in Hong Kong are concerned that Beijing will impose its own legislation if the laws are not changed by 1997. Most people in Hong Kong will agree that it will be highly inadvisable to leave many of these relics from another age on the statute books. For example, there are some clauses in the laws of Hong Kong that will send shivers down the spine of anyone who has an interest in the freedom of the press. Under the "Power to remove seditious publications" any police officer or public officer may: a) enter any premises or place; b) stop and board any vehicle, tram-car, train or vessel and remove therefrom or obliterate any seditious publication. There are other examples and, as Martin Lee has said: "In Hong Kong, we assume that the rule of law means laws that protect our rights, freedoms and way of life. But when the laws themselves are bad, our freedoms are in great danger. "Thus far, the anachronistic laws restricting press freedom have not been widely abused because of the link to the UK's parliamentary democracy ... if the Hong Kong Government were to behave irresponsibly, heads would conceivably roll in Whitehall. But even this system of accountability ... will be removed on June 30, 1997." The Hong Kong Government has acted on some laws and amended some ordinances. But it has been pointed out that Britain has left some draconian laws on the statute books in other Asian colonies, such as the Singapore Internal Security Act and a similar law in Malaysia. There is not a great deal of time left. Hong Kong should identify all the problem areas. For example, the meaning of the word subversion needs to be clearly defined, and then invite China to discuss them through the JLG. [sentence as published] If an acceptable new version of the laws can be agreed on by both sides then so much the better. It will be an encouraging sign that they can come to a sensible decision about a very important matter. If no such agreement can be reached then the Hong Kong Government must take a deep breath and come up with its own solution. It is impossible for some of these laws to remain on the books. They must be updated, improved and made relevant to modern Hong Kong society. Whatever the solution, the people charged with the responsibility had better get a move on. Time is running out.
