FR940527-1-00233 FR940527-1-00014 Executive Summary In this report, the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission (ProPAC) discusses major factors that have influenced how hospitals have evolved, looks at how hospitals have responded to changes in the health care environment, and suggests the future direction hospitals may take. The Commission also presents 23 recommendations covering a range of topics, from broad issues concerning Medicare and health care reform to updating Medicare payment rates and refining certain aspects of Medicare payments to hospitals and other facilities. The report is submitted directly to the Congress, although the Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to respond to the Commission's recommendations. ProPAC's responsibilities have expanded from its original mandate of advising the Congress and the Secretary on the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) for hospitals. These additional responsibilities include analyzing and developing prospective payment policies for all facility services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries and examining Medicaid hospital payment rates. In the past year, the Commission has submitted reports to the Congress on Medicare and the American health care system, global budgeting, and Medicaid disproportionate share payment adjustments. ProPAC, however, continues to devote substantial effort to updating and improving Medicare policies for paying hospitals. The Future of Hospitals Hospitals_the central institutions in the American health care system_have long been the sole source of technology-oriented acute health care for the most complex cases. But because technological capabilities were limited, until the last 20 years or so one hospital was much like another. Each provided its community with essentially the same range of services and was structured in a similar manner. Today, hospitals offer a rich mix of complex, intensive services to a variety of patients. Relationships among hospitals, other institutional providers, and payers have become more complex, characterized by a broad range of ownership arrangements and the sharing of financial risk. Additionally, the role physicians play in hospitals' operations has evolved markedly. Two major forces_advances in medical technology and changes in financing mechanisms_have profoundly influenced the evolution of hospitals. Technological innovations not only have expanded the services hospitals furnish, but also have resulted in greater competition from other providers. The emergence of third-party payers has created a stream of revenues that financed these innovations. As health spending has outpaced inflation, both public and private payers have sought ways to curb this growth. Medicare, for instance, has made radical changes in payment mechanisms to constrain the rise in government payments to hospitals. Private payers, too, have used various strategies to control the growth in payments, but with mixed success. For their part, hospitals have minimized cost-containment pressure by generating additional payments from private payers, a practice called ``cost shifting.'' How each hospital has evolved in response to technological advances, financing changes, and other developments has depended on its internal and external environments. The end result has been significant diversification in the hospital industry. Hospitals will continue to encounter technological and financing changes. The greatest unknown, however, is the outcome of the current health care debate and how hospitals will fare under reform. Since they account for the largest portion of total health spending, hospitals will bear much of the pressure to alter the way care is delivered and paid for in the future. Hospitals' responses to these changes will differ, depending on the source and stringency of the pressure, and the circumstances facing each facility. Summary of Recommendations In Chapter 2, ProPAC presents 23 recommendations reflecting the Commission's concerns regarding health reform and Medicare payment policies. The Commission believes these proposed changes are necessary for maintaining access to quality health care, encouraging productivity and cost effectiveness in the provision of care, and improving payment equity. The Commission developed its recommendations by setting priorities, analyzing information, and deliberating on the implications of alternative policies. ProPAC also pays close attention to the concerns of the Congress, the Administration, health care providers, third-party payers, enrollees, and the public. The Commission's recommendations are offered to comply with ProPAC's statutory mandate and to contribute to an informed, open debate about Medicare payment policies. For fiscal year 1995, the Commission's recommendations focused on three broad areas: •Medicare and health care reform, •Payment updates, and •Other payment policies. Medicare and Health Care Reform _The health care industry is facing major challenges as policy makers and legislators struggle to control health care expenditures and expand coverage to people without insurance. Several proposals have been introduced to reform the health care system. Some of these focus on incremental changes in the financing and delivery of health care; others call for fundamental restructuring of the existing system. Most include provisions that would affect the Medicare program. The Health Security Act introduced by the President would fundamentally change the financing and delivery of health care. Under this proposal, most people under 65 would obtain health insurance coverage through regional or corporate alliances that would negotiate with health plans to provide medical services. Managed competition among plans is expected to control the growth in health care expenditures. As a contingency, however, premium rate increases would be limited if expenditure growth were not contained. Medicare would be retained as a separate program, although it would be subject to a number of changes and cost-saving measures. In this report, the Commission comments on specific features of the Health Security Act and other health reform activities as they pertain to the Medicare program. This discussion is found in Recommendations 1 through 8. Payment Updates Recommendations 9 through 14 present the Commission's recommended updates to the payment amounts to various facilities. These include operating and capital payments to hospitals paid under PPS, operating payments to facilities excluded from PPS, and the composite rate for dialysis services. In examining each of these Medicare payment systems, the Commission recommends to the Congress an appropriate update amount for fiscal year 1995 payments. In addition, ProPAC considers the appropriateness of the base payment rate to which the update factor would be applied. The Commission is mandated by law to submit to the Congress each year the appropriate update to the inpatient hospital operating payment rates under PPS. ProPAC considers several factors in developing this update: the hospital market basket index, scientific and technological advances, hospital productivity, case-mix change, and the quality and long-term cost-effectiveness of health care. For fiscal year 1995, the Commission recommends an average update of 2.7 percent to the standardized payment amounts: an increase of 2.2 percent for urban hospitals and of 5.3 percent for rural hospitals. ProPAC's update recommendation for fiscal year 1995 operating payments is higher than the update already legislated by the Congress. ProPAC used its traditional approach of examining individually the factors that contribute to the update. The Commission believes this process results in an appropriate percentage to update the standardized payment amounts for fiscal year 1995. In addition, the Commission recommends an update factor for the Federal capital payment rate. ProPAC follows an update framework similar to that used for the operating payment update. For fiscal year 1995, ProPAC recommends a 3.6 percent increase to the Federal capital payment rate for both urban and rural hospitals. When the transition to fully prospective capital payments is complete, a single update factor should be used for adjusting PPS operating and capital payment rates.
