One high-level government official said on 22 May: "In connection with the selection of sites, the government has thus far conducted public relations activities for local residents with a view to pushing ahead with construction, on a priority basis, with the consent of those residents who want to have such a site built in their area. But, as seen in the large-scale demonstrations in Yangsan County, South Kyongsang Province, we have come to judge that the beginning of construction based on residents' consent is realistically impossible. In this regard, the government will make public its selection of sites during the latter half of this year before beginning construction early next year." The same official added that in order to minimize residents' backlash against the selection of sites, the government has been trying to provide support for regional development plans--including projects whose materialization the residents have long aspired for their own areas' benefit--and to legislate relevant enforcement ordinances for guaranteeing jobs for the residents' livelihood, saying that all these government efforts are now at a final stage. He made clear the policy of pushing ahead with construction by saying: "Despite some residents' opposition, we will have no choice but to carry through the construction even by exercising government power." He continued to say: "At the moment, nuclear waste coming from atomic power plants is being stored at the individual plants. But, it will reach a saturation point in 1999. It takes at least five to seven years to build a nuclear waste storage site. Therefore, it is a pressing question for us to begin construction early next year after making a final decision on construction sites within this year at the latest." It has been learned that at present the government is searching for candidate sites among six areas, such as Anmyon Island, South Chungchong Province; Uljin and Yongil, North Kyongsang Province; Changhung, South Cholla Province; Kosong, Kangwon Province; and Yangsan, South Kyongsang Province--the sites a research team of Seoul National University has proposed--and among the areas where the existing atomic power plants are located. Since the residents in the Yangsan area near the Kori Atomic Power Plant showed an interest in having such a site built in their area, the government has conducted public relations activities for them. But, in spite of the fact that more than 80 percent of the area's residents have consented to having such a site built in their area, there have been demonstrations staged by some residents and outside forces such as environmental organizations. As a result, the government officially expressed its stance of giving up the construction of a site in that area on 22 May.
