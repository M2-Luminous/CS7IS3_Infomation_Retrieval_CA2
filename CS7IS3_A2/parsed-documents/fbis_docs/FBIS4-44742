Reportedly, the technique can also be applied to other metals. Consequently, the NEW SCIENTIST reports (No. 1917, p. 18, 1994), in future a number of new liquid crystals could be created with interesting properties, as, for example, coloration. The incorporation of metals in liquid crystals can improve their properties. The crystals, reportedly, become more stable because of their greater polarizability. Polarizability is the ability to change the electronic structure into electrical fields. In addition, displays incorporating such liquid crystals are more legible because the metals also alter the optical properties. Since metals are prone toward coloration, liquid crystal displays of various colors could also be produced without the need of expensive color filters. Finally, the metals could also make the displays respond to magnetic and electrical switching, since almost all metals react to external magnetic fields. Because of the special form a molecule must have to form a liquid crystal, it has so far only been possible to incorporate a handful of metals in liquid crystals. The molecule must be long and, above all, flat. But most metals prefer tetrahedron- or octahedron-structured environments. Only a very few, as, for example, platinum, nickel, and copper, accept planar structures. Duncan Bruce and Xiao-Hua Liu of Sheffield University (Center of Molecular Materials, Department of Chemistry, Sheffield, UK S3 7HF) have succeeded in producing a molecule that contains octahedron-bound manganese. The metal atom is introduced somewhat to the side in about the middle of the long rod-like molecule so as not to disrupt the formation of a liquid crystalline phase. The molecule is a particle in which the structural elements are linked together in a chain-like manner. There are long hydrocarbon groups at the ends; in the middle there are ester bonds and a so-called imino group by means of which the manganese atom is bound. The scientists report in the journal of the Chemical Society, CHEMICAL COMMUNICATIONS (No. 6, p. 729, 1994) that the metal also has four additional carbonyl groups that hold the complex together.
