Ambassador Laney said this at a meeting with merchants and industrialists in Pusan to which the ambassador was invited. The meeting took place at the Pusan Chamber of Commerce and Industry. He also said: "The Pusan Consulate issued 12 times more visas last year than in 1989. The consulate has made it convenient for Pusan citizens to get visas and contributed to promoting friendship between the ROK and the United States. Therefore, the U.S. Embassy is making efforts to maintain the consulate by explaining to the U.S. Government how important the consulate is."
