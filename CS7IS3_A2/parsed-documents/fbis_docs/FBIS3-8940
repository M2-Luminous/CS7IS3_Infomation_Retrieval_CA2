Adrian Nastase said that the difficult economic and political problems of 1994 could be solved only by applying the arithmetic resulted from the 1992 polls. In his opinion it is not a certain composition of the executive that is essential at present, but a governing programme based on the provisions of the memorandum with the IMF, and the speeding of the reform. According to the ruling party that can be achieved, added Nastase, by the creation of a group of experts made up of representatives of all parliamentary parties, apt to attract the interest of all political parties. Referring to snap elections, Adrian Nastase said that they would be "disastrous" for the country.
