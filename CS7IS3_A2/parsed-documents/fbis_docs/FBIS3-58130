"I feel that here in Sarajevo a mandate of six or seven months is enough. I can see that everyone who leaves Sarajevo after six months is tired, and I am not ashamed to say that I am feeling a certain amount of fatigue. I am not distressed, but this weariness is undoubtedly the result of many factors. That is the only reason," he affirmed during a telephone interview given to RTBF Television from Zagreb. "The weariness is the result of these constantly repeated efforts. We constantly discuss the same problems; and we constantly run up against the same difficulties. There is no goodwill shown by the parties involved. I have always said that I was not pessimistic, but I think I can also say that I am not optimistic either," he added. When asked about the advice he would give to his successor, the Belgian officer said that he would give "the same advice that French Gen. Philippe Morillon (his predecessor -- BELGA editor's note) gave me: `Be terribly patient.'" "I would also give him another piece of advice, which would be to remind the politicians in charge of the difficulties in which they are putting us constantly, because there is no coherence in their strategy," he said. Gen. Briquemont also played down the difficulties he encountered with the United Nations. "I will tell you that the problem with the United Nations is a secondary problem. I believe that, together with Gen. Jean Cot (the commander of all UN forces in the former Yugoslavia), we expressed what we thought. When one is in such an inextricable situation and one is responsible for the lives of thousands of people, I feel that it is not just a right for the generals to say what they think but also a duty," he continued. By the end of the month Gen. Briquemont is to be replaced as the head of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia by British officer Gen. Michael Rose.
