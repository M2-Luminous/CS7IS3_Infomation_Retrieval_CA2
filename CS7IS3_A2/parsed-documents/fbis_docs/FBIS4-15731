This has been disclosed by the Russian Embassy in Zagreb, which added that the specific reasons for the postponement would be given at a news conference to be held today by representatives of Russia, the United States, and the European Union -- the mediators in the conflict. Local diplomatic circles link this postponement directly to the recent NATO air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions on the outskirts of the city of Gorazde, which has led to a serious deterioration in the situation throughout former Yugoslavia. As we know, the first round of talks between the Croats and representatives of Serb Krajina, in which Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian president's special representative, played a direct part, successfully culminated in the signing of a truce. The truce came into force on 4 April and has been strictly observed up to now. It had been expected that a number of important questions consolidating peaceful coexistence between Krajina and Croatia -- above all the restoration of trade and economic ties, which have been more or less severed -- would be discussed during the second round of talks.
