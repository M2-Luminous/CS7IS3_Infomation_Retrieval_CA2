However, both sides hinted that no major progress was achieved and the differences remained wide even though the respective positions were made clear. Pakistan and Indian diplomats remained tight-lipped about the first session of talks held on Sunday morning with Pakistan's Foreign Secretary Shaharyar Khan saying "no scores at half time" when asked for comments. His counterpart J N Dixit also parried questions telling newsmen that both the sides had presented their positions in a matter of fact style and that there were no acrimonious exchanges. More than that he would not say, he added. Nearly all the participants of the talks from both sides were present at the reception hosted by the Indian High Commissioner S K Lamba in honour of Indian Foreign Secretary J N Dixit. Pakistani diplomats stressed that discussions with the Indian side were held with utmost seriousness in which their position was made crystal clear. Foreign Secretary Shaharyar Khan, who avoided questions about the contents of the morning session, did say that the discussions were intensive and that Kashmir issue was the central point. Pakistani diplomats seemed happy that the Indians had discussed Kashmir issue thoroughly even though there were no indications that anything substantive had been achieved. Some diplomats complained that media had hyped up the talks too much. And some hints were dropped that after Monday's session, the two sides may agree to hold more such rounds of talks without announcing specific dates. However, it was clear that side issues like Siachen, Sir Creek and Wullar Barrage were sidelined during the first session of talks. The second session was held at 10 pm at the Foreign Office. Before that the Indian Foreign Secretary attended dinner hosted in his honour by Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali. The third session will be held today at 9:10 am. APP adds: Seventh round of Foreign Secretary-level talks between Pakistan and India, which began here on Sunday, focused on the Kashmir dispute with the two sides reiterating their stance on the issue. Official sources here said that the negotiations started with a "note of seriousness." Pakistan called for creating requisite conditions for a peaceful solution of the Kashmir dispute. It emphasised the urgent need to end Indian repression in Occupied Kashmir to pave way for a peaceful settlement of the issue. PPI adds: Calling upon India to create propitious conditions for finding out a peaceful Kashmir solution, Pakistan put across its known position on the issue during the first round of Foreign Secretary-level talks which began at 9:40 am and continued for 95 minutes. The talks between the two countries at Foreign Secretary-level have resumed after a break of around 17 months for which both Islamabad and New Delhi have done a great deal of homework since the announcement in this respect during last week of November. When contacted a Foreign Office spokesman told PPI that Pakistan also underlined the need for an end to repression in the Indian-held Kashmir to create propitious conditions for securing peaceful solution to the problem which is a sine qua non for the establishment of normal and cooperative relations between Pakistan and India. The 7th round of talks between the two countries at the Foreign Secretary-level is of special significance for Pakistan mainly because of the fact that India has, for the first time, agreed to discuss the Kashmir question as a separate agenda item. "The talks have so far focussed on the Kashmir issue," the spokesman said and added that during the first round, the two sides reiterated their known positions. The Indian delegation is being led by Foreign Secretary J.N. Dixit and senior officials of Indian Ministry of External Affairs, including Joint Secretary M.K. Bhdra Kumar, Director Prakash Sood, Deputy Secretary Y.K. Sinha and Under-Secretary Ms Vijay Thakur Singh. The delegation was joined during the talks by officials of the Indian High Commission in Islamabad. They include High Commissioner S.K. Lamba, Deputy High Commissioner Bal Anand, Francis Vaz and N. Parthasarthi. The Pakistan delegation was headed by Foreign Secretary Shaharyar M. Khan. Additional Secretaries Munir Akram and Khalid Saleem, Director-General India Desk Shafqat Kakakhel, Directors Akberzeb and Jalil Abbas Jillani and Pakistan's High Commissioner in New Delhi Riaz Khokhar. The spokesman said the talks started with a note of seriousness, adding that President of Pakistan and later the Foreign Secretary have both underlined Pakistan's desire for a peaceful solution of the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir on the basis of the United Nations resolutions. Amidst hopes for constructive and meaningful talks, Pakistan has repeatedly announced during recent past that this is last chance for India. The Indian Foreign Secretary, however, disagreed with the announcement during his Saturday's Press talk, saying that he does not think this is a last chance. PPI adds: The second round of Pak-India foreign secretary level talks was held here at the Foreign Office Sunday night, informed sources told PPI that during the second round which lasted half an hour, the two sides held indepth discussion focussing on all aspects of Jammu and Kashmir dispute. Asked if the talks are heading towards a meaningful progress, the sources said, it would be premature to make any assessment with finality about the talks at this stage.
