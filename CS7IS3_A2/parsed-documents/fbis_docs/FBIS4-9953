Nevertheless, a century later the Fatherland is summoning us not to our military duty to kill or be killed but rather to our civic duty to do better work so that we can preserve law and order, as well as our resistance, and development potential. If we fail to do so, if we lack the willpower and intelligence to build today, tomorrow the temptation will be great to bring Cuba to its knees by force, and we will be forced to fight on the battlefield, where courage, valor, and patriotism are gauged by what we destroy, not by what we build. Today's army must be one of creators. Just as soldiers are given the opportunity to fight because of their willingness to observe discipline, Cuban workers must be more disciplined than they currently are in order to assure victory on the economic battlefield. In this effort the chiefs play a vital role, as their own main disciplinary failing may be their inability or unwillingness to demand discipline from their subordinates. Cuban workers, most of whom are also soldiers, know that a joint action will not be successful unless someone wisely directs the efforts of all towards success. One group of workers using the same materials as another similar group, often does a disciplined, enthusiastic, and efficient job just because they have a real leader. Leadership is not a privilege; it is a demanding responsibility. We need chiefs who do not look at numbers impassively, who do not become demoralized, who can appeal to honor and ethics, who are passionate about their work and their people, and who can by their example inspire their workers to move ahead and tackle problems. One suspects that in many cases the high level of worker absenteeism is due to cowardly chiefs and union leaders who do not understand their political function and fail to demand administrative action against labor indiscipline. In their parliamentary meetings the workers are vigorously denouncing absenteeism, although they understand the current transportation difficulties and other limitations. There is strong criticism of the people who regularly fail to show up for work. In many instances this small minority is to blame for the statistics that are giving everyone a bad image. At thousands of assemblies the workers have expressed their desire to put an end to the lack of control over the issuance of medical certificates and over the protracted process of specialist reports on illnesses. In some cases these excuses are denounced as mere legal pretexts that conceal a lack of conscientiousness. In many places it is being argued that a limit must be set on the number of days a year a worker can avoid doing his duty on such grounds. All of this contrasts with the simplistic approach to the problem of absenteeism at other centers. The managers and the unions there do not seem to realize that when they admit an absenteeism rate of 9 percent, for example, they are saying that they are not working one month a year. And we are talking here about a far from exaggerated rate, in light of the actual numbers. In the wake of the work-center assemblies, where there was so much discussion about efficiency, without which the country's economic recovery is impossible, managers, unions, and workers have no choice but to devote themselves to reducing these high rates of absenteeism, because there can be no talk of efficiency in places that stop working one or two months a year. We must show an elementary sense of social responsibility towards and solidarity with the many workers who are evincing true patriotism and conscientiousness. They are the ones who get up when it is still dark and return to their homes by moonlight, who do farm and other work often with worn out soles, who work double shifts at hospitals so that patients are cared for, and who do not flag in their daily duties in order to save the Fatherland with hard work, intelligence, and honor. It is true that being on time for work is not the be-all and end-all of discipline. But if this primary obligation is not observed, if this elementary rule is not complied with, it cannot be denied that very little can be done to improve technological and economic discipline at work centers. During these early months of the year we have made great progress in grasping the problems facing us. The year 1994 must not close without clear-cut gains in reducing absenteeism. Prescriptions are not necessary. Each work center must do what each town demands. But also, in each town the problem of absenteeism must be a challenge to collective self-respect, to the expertise of chiefs, and to the prestige of the union section.
