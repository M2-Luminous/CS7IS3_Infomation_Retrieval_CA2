So far, data banks have been set up in all the 30 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities, all the cities with the status of municipalities, and all the 280 major cities and prefectures as well as 1,500 counties throughout the country. These data banks provide governments at various levels with timely, accurate and useful data for medium- and long-term economic forecasts. Last year the State Information Center submitted a report to the central government, warning that the country's total investment in fixed assets had surpassed 1,000 billion yuan, thus helping the central government to immediately strengthen macro control over investment in fixed assets. In particular, the administrative data banks have been systemized. The administrative data bank on projects to absorb foreign funds has collected over 100,000 pieces of information on 3,000 projects. The data is updated regularly. In addition, the national data bank of investment in fixed assets, the national data bank of laws and regulations and the national data bank on macro economic control have all gone into regular operation. Besides, a joint service network of data banks has been set up to cover 13 provinces and municipalities. The services will cover foreign investment guidance, tourism, international finance and enterprise laws and will charge fees.
