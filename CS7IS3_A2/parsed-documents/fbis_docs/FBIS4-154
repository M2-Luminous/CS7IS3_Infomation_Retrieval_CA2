FBIS4-154 "drafr064_c_94006" FBIS-AFR-94-064 Daily Report 4 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA IEC Memorandum Credited IEC Memorandum Credited MB0204092894 Johannesburg WEEKEND STAR in English 2-3 Apr 94 p 2 MB0204092894 Johannesburg WEEKEND STAR English BFN [By Shaun Johnson and Esther Waugh] [Text] A memorandum bluntly stating that free elections in KwaZulu/Natal were impossible without direct political intervention was the primary catalyst for the eventual declaration of this week's state of emergency there. The confidential three-page memorandum, with 15 pages of supporting documentation, was presented by Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] chairman Judge Johann Kriegler to President F W de Klerk and ANC leader Nelson Mandela in Pretoria on March 24. An edited version was released to the media the same day. The state of emergency was declared on March 31. Appended to the original document -- a copy of which has been seen by WEEKEND STAR -- was a nine-point memorandum from the IEC to Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, setting out the guarantees the IEC wanted from Ulundi regarding co-operation in allowing the election to take place in KwaZulu/Natal. It was the reaction to this memorandum by Buthelezi, King Goodwill Zwelithini, several KwaZulu Ministers and members of the KwaZulu Legislative Assembly that led the IEC to give its own ultimatum to De Klerk the following day. List of Demands In the memorandum to Buthelezi dated March 23, the IEC proposed that in order to "execute its mandate of conducting an election within the territory of KwaZulu", it requested that Buthelezi "cause instructions to be given forthwith that": - The KwaZulu Department of Education make schools available for use as polling stations. - Principals give telephone technicians access to their schools. - KwaZulu government buildings, including tribal authority and magistrates' offices, be made available for election purposes. - The KwaZulu Department of the Interior cooperate with the IEC on matters including the issuing of identity documents and seconding staff. - The KwaZulu Department of Justice make facilities available for the IEC Adjudication Secretariat. - Amakhosi [chiefs] and other KwaZulu officials and authorities assist the IEC and observer groups. - The KwaZulu departments of Health and of Pensions and Welfare co-operate with the IEC in facilitating special votes. - The KwaZulu Police provide security for IEC staff and secure the election process, as well as participate fully with other groups in security planning. `Operation Access' The IEC memorandum to Buthelezi also proposed the establishment of a working committee, and informed the KwaZulu authorities that the IEC intended to launch "Operation Access" in the region soon. The response of the KwaZulu authorities to the IEC delegation was subsequently described in the IEC's document to De Klerk and Mandela as "stage-managed to humiliate the IEC". Describing the atmosphere as "confrontational and aggressive," the IEC concluded that the requisite assurances sought from the KwaZulu authorities had not been given. In the final paragraph of the confidential memorandum presented to De Klerk and Mandela, the IEC stated: "In order for the IEC to conduct free and fair elections in KwaZulu/Natal, the requisite degree of stability and co-operation has to be established in the province as a matter of urgency. "How that is to be achieved is not for the IEC to determine. Nor will it be in a position to advise whether substantially free and fair elections can be conducted in KwaZulu/Natal unless and until such stability and co-operation have been attained."
