The Croatian opposition is still not clear about the conditions under which it was signed or what has happened to the maps -- there were 35 on the table. There have been no offical statements on this from the Croatian side. They are keeping things concealed as best they can. However the Zagreb press has published a map reprinted from the Vienna-based paper DER STANDARD and the borders on the map are shown in such a way as to give any Croat a headache. For example, the so-called republic of Serb Krajina has outlets to the sea at Biograd and Zadar, but what tops it all, the papers say, is that even Osijek is in the so-called Krajina. Is the leadership really concealing such a thing from ordinary people? President Tudjman also has different political problems every day. The replaced Josip Manolic has announced that he is off to Washington as early as today where he is to have talks with U.S. congressmen responsible for military issues. The meeting has allegedly been fixed up by Dobroslav Paraga. So Manolic is not travelling to Washington with Tudjman's blessing. Who is he representing? What is behind the visit? Those in the know say that Dr Tudjman himself would like to know the answer to this question.
