This emerges from data released by Yehuda Wilk, commander of the Israel Police Jerusalem District, summing up the 1993 work year. The severity of the attacks, however, did not change: three people were killed and 17 wounded in 1993 compared with three killed and 12 wounded in 1992. The number of car torchings dropped significantly: 267 cars were set ablaze in 1993 compared with 448 in 1992. Stone throwing also decreased sharply: 2,731 incidents in 1993 as opposed to 3,640 in 1992. The same applies to firebomb attacks: 64 in 1993 as opposed to 91 in 1992. There were 24 stabbings and attempted stabbings in 1993 compared with 27 in 1992. Three bombs were planted in 1993 compared with 14 in 1992. The number of shooting incidents remained unchanged: five instances in both 1992 and 1993. Commander Wilk attributed the drop in terrorist attacks to "aggressive intelligence methods adopted by the Jerusalem police." According to him, "terror-related problems cannot be solved by deploying huge numbers of policemen and are best handled by small intelligence teams." In 1993, the Jerusalem police arrested 350 Arabs suspected of having participated in disturbances, including stone-throwing incidents; 15 suspected of hurling firebombs; and 60 suspected of torching cars.
