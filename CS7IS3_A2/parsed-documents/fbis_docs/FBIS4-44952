The magazine's owners (a businessman and his wife) listed the times of programs that their children and those of the neighbors could see. They decided not to announce other programs that were forbidden. The magazine was intended to be an alternative solution making it finally unnecessary to ask the businessman and his wife for an opinion about the dish. The satellite dish has become a phenomenon and a power statement from its microphones--magazines are published for similar objectives. Now that its merchandize, alien to the taste and values of our community, is in demand, a period of vigorous debate has begun between two groups--one of them for the dish, the other against it. Amid these noisy discussions, Dr. Inshirah al-Shal of Cairo University's Faculty of Information, was preparing Egypt's first scientific field study of the reasons for owning a dish antenna, the effect that interest in watching its programs was having on the following of Egyptian television programs and the viewing of videotaped materials, and the 173-case sample's conviction about spreading the idea of watching programs from abroad after their having undergone this experience. In the early eighties the first bowl-shaped antenna ("dish") appeared in the Cairo skies--in Garden City, to be exact--to carry news messages at the American Embassy. Antennas began to spread afterward on the roofs of buildings. Although the dish made its first appearance in the world at the beginning of the sixties, it entered Egypt at the citizen level only nine years ago. It used to be smuggled through the airports and ports disassembled, until its importation became legal--provided that the diameter of the dish does not exceed 2.4 meters. Artists, businessmen, major personalities, and foreign communities became its most prominent customers. Despite its high price during this period (about $30,000), the large-diameter American product dominated the market. During the eighties there were only three agencies in Egypt importing the dish, including the Egypt Company for Free Markets. The number of importers had jumped to 59 by the beginning of 1992. The figure rose markedly at the beginning of 1993. Sources of the antennas became numerous, and the price fell after moderately-priced antennas affordable to the ordinary citizen were offered. The Egyptian product entered the scene through factory antennas and investment company antennas. Authority in the Home "Tell me what you watch, and I will tell you who you are." Dr. Inshirah al-Shal relied on this maxim in her study. For the study she designed a questionnaire form for viewers of overseas channels. Then she assembled the information in Cairo. Her most important finding was the high ratio of males to females in the study sample--about 5:2, or 71 percent to 29 percent. This means that authority in the Egyptian home still is in the hands of the father, husband, or son--though one should not overlook the content of some incoming programs whose audience may be limited to males, rather than females in Egyptian families. A difference in ages among members of the sample was also observed; however, the ages of the majority (60 percent of the sample) ranged between 19 and 40. This means that receiving overseas programs by satellite dish is widespread in age groups most of which qualify as youthful. Diploma Holders, Married People The study also indicated that when the data for the sample were examined for educational level, one noted that about 75 percent of the individuals had obtained a university diploma (bachelor of arts or of science). Some had obtained a master's or doctorate. Cases that were below the bachelor's level in the study sample amounted to 16 percent, and they were students. It turned out that 57 percent of the sample were married and 34 percent unmarried. One could also see that most of the individuals in the sample had excellent or good English (86 percent). Knowledge of French ran a distant second (39 percent). This means, according to Dr. Inshirah al-Shal, that the ability to follow programs from overseas and understand their content depends on the language in which these programs are created. This is true for the time being, but it will soon be possible for the audience to choose the language in which it wants to receive and view these programs. The study indicated that Muhandisin, Madinat Nasr, and Heliopolis were the areas with the most satellite dishes. Al-Muqattam, al-Manyal, and Hulwan came at the bottom of the list. The study showed that businessmen (28 percent) were most numerous among dish owners. Government employees (25 percent) were in second place. The ratio of government employees to professionals was about 2:1. This result indicates that satellite dish ownership depends on economic and educational level. The study recorded the phenomenon of several families in a building or limited area sharing one central satellite dish. Neighbors the Reason The study was not without its novel side. One group in the sample (7 percent) reported that the reason for their owning the dish had to do with the neighbors. Five percent said it was friends, while 64 percent said it was a husband or father. As for the real reasons for obtaining the dish, the survey showed that 26 percent of the individuals surveyed wanted to know what is happening abroad. This applied particularly to members of the political corps and big businessmen. About 24 percent wanted to see good programs. Some individuals from the latter group said they were tired of Egyptian television, which has become very poor and very local and does not even broadcast programs at their announced times. One individual said he wanted to know what was going on abroad and at home as soon as it happened. A group in the sample reported that they had bought the dish because it was a new entertainment device for adults and children alike. Accordingly, one can summarize the reasons for owning a satellite dish under two headings: first, because it is a piece of modern technology and (as one of the members of the sample said) one should not deprive one's family of something new. Thirty-one percent of the sample agreed. The second reason has to do with content. As a group of sampled individuals said, it was "to watch programs that the censorship will not allow in Egypt," or "to continue watching programs they became accustomed to watching while abroad," or "to know what is happening abroad," or "to improve one's knowledge of a foreign language," or "as an alternative to boring Egyptian television." Sixty-nine percent of the individuals in the sample cited such reasons. Chance for Improvement Although, as Dr. Inshirah al-Shal says, this result is clear, it gives the impression that there still is a chance for Egyptian television to assert its presence by improving the level of its programs so that the rug is not pulled out from under it irrevocably. It was therefore necessary to ask: To what extent were people satisfied with the dish after a period of contact and experience with it? The result was that 45 percent were very satisfied and would encourage its spread; 22 percent were very satisfied, but would not encourage its spread; 28 percent were somewhat satisfied; 3 percent were dissatisfied personally; about 7 percent were dissatisfied and would oppose its entry into the Egyptian home; and about 2 percent did not respond. It was also necessary to determine the relation between watching oversees programs by satellite dish and watching Egyptian television programs. The result was that 59 percent of the individuals in the study sample watch Egyptian television. Thirty-seven percent responded "sometimes." About 2 percent do not watch it, and 2 percent did not respond. As for the amount of Egyptian television viewed by satellite dish owners, the study showed that 19 percent of them watch it only rarely; 12 percent watch it less than an hour a day; 25 percent watch it from one to two hours; and 29 percent watch it from two to three hours. Superchannel--Number 1 There were several surprises in the order of overseas channels favored by Egyptian viewers who own a satellite dish. The British Superchannel occupied the top of the list. Next came CNN, but with the Superchannel leading 3 to 1. Then came Euronews, the European news channel that began broadcasting at the end of 1992 to maintain a balance after CNN began sweeping the world's television screens during the Gulf war. The French, Italian, Israeli, German, and Spanish channels came next. The Turkish channel was in sixth place, before the German channel and after the Israeli channel. The Arab channels came in eighth place. The sample members set the MBC [Middle East Broadcasting Center] channels in first place, followed by the Egyptian Space Channel, then the Tunisian, Moroccan, Emirate, Saudi, and Dubayy channels. These channels have influenced the viewing of videotapes by members of the sample. While 20 percent are keen on watching them, and 50 percent said they sometimes watched them, 20 percent of the members of the sample do not watch them at all. Their reasons can be summed up as lack of time, preference for watching television programs from other countries, or lack of interest. Most Important Points The most important point the study raised was the acknowledgment by 80 percent of the members of the sample that watching satellite dish channels indeed influences the viewing of Egyptian television. Seventeen percent denied any influence. An important question arises: Is there a negative relation between openness to the world--interest in watching others' programs--and interest in our domestic problems? Dr. Inshirah al-Shal, professor in Cairo University's Faculty of Information, a specialist in literature and the humanities, says that the question needs to be studied more deeply. Foreign television programs have created so-called "world stars" on the political and artistic level; they could also--herein lies the danger--create "the international child." This is what leads us to demand that thorough studies be made to research the effects of watching programs coming to Egyptian television screens from abroad by various means. From such programs may come a desire to emigrate, apathy, a feeling of alienation, or enlistment under the banner of groups alien to the values, customs, and traditions of the community. We too ask for interest in such a study, for more such studies, and for implementation of their recommendations before it is too late.
