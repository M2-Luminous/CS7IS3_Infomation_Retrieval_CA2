Under provisional regulations scheduled for release in the third quarter of the year, Beijing will demand that foreign-funded companies show proof that they can meet their foreign currency expenses before setting up ventures on the mainland. If they cannot do so, their applications will be turned down unless they receive approval from the State Administration of Exchange Control (SAEC) to gain access to swap centres, where foreign companies trade hard currency when it is available. SAEC approval will be given only to foreign companies engaged in sectors actively promoted by the country. At present, when a foreign investor puts in an application to the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation to set up a factory or office in China, he submits a feasibility study, which includes a report on the inflow and outflow of foreign currencies. Although the law also requires him to balance his hard currency, it is not rigorously enforced. While some foreign investors cannot balance the foreign currency demand and supply, they are still allowed to set up in China and may subsequently turn to the swap centres for hard currency to meet any shortfall. "The new regulations mean that China, as a fundamental point, does not want to keep bailing out foreign-funded enterprises. It wants them to be self-sufficient in foreign currency," said William Chan, a Price Waterhouse partner. He said China had a trade deficit and would not want foreign enterprises to further drain the country's foreign exchange reserves, estimated at about U.S.$50 billion. Last year, the trade deficit was about $12 billion. "What they are going to tell the foreign investors is this: we're going to look closely at your feasibility study to make sure you can meet your own foreign currency needs," said Mr Chan. China last year contracted investments of about $110 billion, equivalent to the amount for the past 14 years. "Given the record levels of investments in the last two years, China is more confident about the inflow and feels it can afford to be stricter," said Tsang Shu-ki, senior lecturer at Hong Kong Baptist College's department of economics. He added that China's economic supremo, Zhu Rongji, had said that the country would need to build up at least $100 billion in foreign reserves before it made the yuan fully convertible. The new regulation, by requiring foreign enterprises to meet their own demand and supply of hard currencies, will ensure that there is no drain on foreign reserves.
