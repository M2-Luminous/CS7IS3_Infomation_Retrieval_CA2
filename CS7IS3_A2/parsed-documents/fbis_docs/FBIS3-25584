Opinion polls and candidate lists suggest that Nelson Mandela will be State President and F.W. de Klerk and Cyril Ramaphosa his deputies. Finance Minister is the next most powerful position. Many in business see Derek Keys as the automatic choice, but ANC [African National Congress] indications are that this is by no means certain. ANC leaders say they would like Mr. Keys in the cabinet of a government of national unity, but as Minister of Trade and Industry, not Finance. Would Mr. Keys take the relatively junior position? Many think not. The ANC is shopping for a suitable candidate. Outgoing Nedcor [expansion unknown; a major financial institution] chief executive Chris Liebenberg is said to have been approached. But Mr. Liebenberg is believed to have declined because he does not have political ambitions. Senior ANC people fancy Thabo Mbeki for the job. But there are suggestions that Mr. Mbeki may be reluctant to occupy the hot seat at this stage of his career. What are the ANC objections to Mr. Keys? He has, after all, done a very good job under extremely difficult circumstances. There are mutterings that he is too authoritarian and not sufficiently in tune with the need for investment in human development. He is also said to be too strongly associated with the National Party for a senior job in the cabinet. Others say powerful ANC members, such as Jay Naidoo, who fancies himself as Minister of Reconstruction, do not want Mr. Keys controlling the purse strings. One cannot easily imagine Mr. Naidoo telling his voters that he would like to spend, spend, spend, but Mr. Keys won't let him. Can Mr. Keys live with the ANC's reconstruction and development programme (RDP)? He says it should be subject to discussion with interested parties in the National Economic Forum, including government departments. Opinion polls show Mr. Keys is the favourite among business people. Agenda-Sacob-Weekly Mail polled 100 businessmen and found 89 percent support for Mr. Keys as Finance Minister. ANC economics head Trevor Manuel polled a lowly 4 percent. Mr. Manuel, 20th on the ANC's election list, and Tito Mboweni (32nd) are not in the running for top jobs, although deputy ministerships are possible. A complicating factor in Mr. Keys' case is that on the latest polls the NP will get five cabinet posts, including Deputy President. With provincial leaders first in line and the NP's senior negotiators also in with a claim, there are not many cabinet posts to go around. There is unlikely to be a lot of "after you" going on in the scramble for jobs. Ultimately, the choice of Finance Minister will be made by the new President. He will undoubtedly listen closely to his party and to business. One scenario is that Mr. Mbeki will not be given a cabinet position, but will be in the President's office with overall responsibility for implementing the RDP. This would open the way for Mr. Mandela to appoint Mr. Keys Minister of Finance. He is, after all, so far ahead of the others on the election lists that this is a one-horse race.
