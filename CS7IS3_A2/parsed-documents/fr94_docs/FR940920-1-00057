FR940920-1-00057 FR940920-1-00007 At the public meeting, information should be provided that summarizes what materials are planned for separation, how they will be separated, what service areas will be included in the plan, and what level of separation is expected. The information presented at the meeting should also identify the amount of MSW that is expected to remain after the separation plan is implemented and identify alternative disposal methods available for the waste (e.g., local MWC, local landfill, long-distance transport to an MWC, or long-distance transport to a landfill). The following hypothetical plan and discussion serve as an example of the types of information that would be provided at the meeting. At the public meeting, a plan is proposed that: (1) Yard waste be collected from specific residential areas using a curbside collection program, and (2) corrugated paper be collected from commercial facilities in specific commercial area using dumpster pickup. The plan is expected to reduce the overall MSW stream by 20 percent, resulting in a residual MSW stream of approximately 400 Mg/day to be disposed of by either a local MWC or a local landfill. Although not included as a component of today's proposal, the EPA encourages the development and public presentation of a supplementary regional waste management plan. Such plans have already been developed for many areas. Presentation of a materials management plan at the initial materials separation public meeting would inform the public about current regional waste management plans if such plans existed. If a regional management plan does not exist, the meeting would provide the opportunity for local public input into the development of a regional solid waste management plan. A waste management plan would focus on the full range of options available to manage municipal solid waste, as exemplified in ISWM. Such a plan could include an analysis of the current waste generation situation and the range of strategies that are currently used to deal with municipal solid waste, including the following examples: current waste generation rates; existing waste disposal options (e.g., landfills versus MWC's); current source reduction (e.g., composting and waste disposal fees); and materials separation and recycling programs. The materials management plan could consider the adequacy of current strategies to handle projected waste generation. Finally, as in the integrated management approach called for under ISWM, the whole range of strategies available to meet projected waste disposal needs could be fully examined and considered. This could include consideration of the role of landfilling, the role of MWC application, the role of source reduction, and the role of materials separation and recycling. The materials separation management plan could outline the expected cost of these alternative strategies to the public, including the cost per Mg of municipal waste disposed (or the cost of waste disposal avoided), and their impact in terms of waste disposal capacity or waste generation avoided. As mentioned above, a materials management plan is not part of the proposed siting requirements. The proposed siting requirements include the development of only a materials separation plan. However, the materials separation plan and regional materials management plan are closely related, and public input in their development is encouraged. The MWC owner or operator would be required to prepare responses to the comments received at the public meeting. The MWC owner or operator would be required to make the document summarizing responses to the public comments available to the public in the service area where the MWC is to be located, including distribution to all public libraries in the service area. The MWC owner or operator would then be required to submit the final draft materials separation plan and the document summarizing responses to public comments to the State or the EPA, as applicable, prior to the facility's application for a construction permit under NSR (40 CFR part 51, subpart I, or part 52, as applicable). The EPA concluded that the draft materials separation plan should be submitted during the initial planning process with the application for a construction permit to be fully consistent with the EPA's ISWM approach and to ensure that the facility is designed to meet the materials separation goals of the region or community. Following application for a NSR construction permit, the public would again have the opportunity to review and comment on the final draft materials separation plan at the public meeting that would be held for public review of the siting analysis, as discussed below. The final materials separation plan would be submitted with the initial notification of construction.
