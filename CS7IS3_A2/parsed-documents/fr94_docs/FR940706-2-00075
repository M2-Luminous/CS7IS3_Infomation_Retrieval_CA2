FR940706-2-00075 FR940706-2-00042 GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION Intent to Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement U.S. Courthouse_Cleveland, OH AGENCY: U.S. General Services Administration. ACTION: Notice of Intent to Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement. SUMMARY: The General Services Administration (GSA) is issuing this notice to advise the public that an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) will be prepared and considered for the construction of a new U.S. Courthouse in Cleveland, Ohio. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Marcy Sherrill, General Services Administration, Region V, 230 S. Dearborn St, Room 3670, Chicago, IL 60604, 312&hyph;886&hyph;5574. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The General Services Administration proposes to acquire a site and develop a new U.S. Courthouse consisting of approximately 800,000 gross square feet. The new facility will consolidate the district court and court-related agencies which are currently housed in six different Government-owned and leased locations. Although the proposed building will initially accommodate the projected 10-year space requirements of the courts, the site to be acquired will be of sufficient size to allow for its expansion beyond that timeframe. The existing U.S. Courthouse in Cleveland was constructed in 1910 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It contains a gross area of approximately 250,000 square feet and currently houses the district court, the bankruptcy court and the U.S. court of appeals. Due to the significant expansion of the recent years, several court-related tenants have been relocated into approximately 127,000 square feet of leased space. The proposed new courthouse will, with the exception of two senior district judges, consolidate the entire direct court family and related agencies in one building. The existing U.S. Courthouse will be retained, and will house two senior district judges and the bankruptcy court. The EIS will evaluate alternative sites for the proposed facility, as well as the no-build alternative. The EIS will also evaluate impacts on the affected environment for resource areas including geology and soils, air and noise quality, cultural resources, land us, community services, traffic and transportation, hazardous materials, economics and aesthetics Public Scoping Meeting To ensure that the full range of issues relating to the proposed project are addressed and all potential significant issues are identified, comments and suggestions are being solicited. To facilitate the receipt of comments, a public scoping meeting will be held at 5:30 PM, Wednesday, July 13, 1994, at the A.J. Celebrezze Federal Building, 1240 E. Ninth Street, Room B&hyph;1 (basement level), Cleveland, Ohio. Both written and oral comments will be accepted at that time. Written comments may be mailed to the GSA contact person through July 29, 1994. Issued in Chicago, Illinois on June 23, 1994. William C. Burke, Regional Administrator, GSA Region V.
