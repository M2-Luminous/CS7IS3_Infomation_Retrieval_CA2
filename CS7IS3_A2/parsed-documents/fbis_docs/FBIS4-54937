Here is our recording of it. [Begin Goncz recording] [passage omitted] I am very glad that the election has taken place so smoothly, I almost dare to say, in a cheerful manner. [passage omitted] I am very glad that the voters' participation in terms of the national average has been so high. This matches the best European standards. So the anxiety that Hungary has become apathetic and that Hungary has lost interest in its own fate has proved groundless. [passage omitted] I will probably await the outcome of the next round of the elections with greater excitement. [passage omitted] If there is anything I can ask from the country and the parties, it is that after all this they should not turn sour the beauty and smoothness of this with a negative campaign or by mud-slinging or with anything else. I do not believe that the essence could be changed, it would only leave a bitter taste in our mouth, in the mouth of the Hungarian electorate -- and there is no need for that whatsoever.
