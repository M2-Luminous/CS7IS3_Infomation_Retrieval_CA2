According to a high-ranking party official, the Information Ministry granted permission last week for the television and FM radio stations to be set up and air their programs to the public. Mr. It Samheng, deputy cabinet director of the CPP, stressed: Technicians have made all the necessary arrangements to proceed with the construction as soon as possible. They are awaiting the final decision on the selection of a site. The technicians have to choose between two locations for the station. The first is the present party office compound and the second is the former party office, located behind the Botumvaddei Monastery. It is likely they will pick the current party office as the site for the television and FM radio stations. The official went on to reveal that the television and FM radio stations will not be the CPP's exclusive property. They belong to a private company operating under the name ABK, which is completely locally owned. No details have been made available, however, on the shares the CPP holds in ABK or the duration of the venture. The party official affirmed that the television and radio transmissions will not be used as a tool against television and radio stations belonging to any other party. They will contribute toward serving Royal Government policy and the king's national reconciliation policy and will propagate news of all kinds to serve socioeconomic development in the interest of the general public. Although he did not mention any economic considerations, some economists have observed that television and radio stations are prime sources of considerable income from commercial advertisements. Some circles have expressed concern that these particular television and radio stations might become rivals to Radio FM 90 megahertz and Television Cambodia, widely known to be run by the FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] party. Others have said it is merely a CPP attempt to get even with FUNCINPEC, especially in preparation for the elections in the next 4 or 5 years. It is understood that the television and radio stations of the State of Cambodia, formerly under CPP control, were returned to government hands the day the election results were announced last June. This CPP television will be called "Television Angkor, Cambodia." No one knows yet how powerful this television and FM radio station's transmitter will be. According to Mr. It Samheng, it has been projected that in the initial stage the station will have the same power as TVK, the present government's national television network. In the future, its transmitting power will be enhanced to equal that of IBC [International Broadcasting Corporation]. It should be noted that the power of the present government-run television station is about 1 kilowatt, while IBC's is about 10 kw. When the CPP's television and FM radio stations become operational, there will be four television stations and five [as published] radio stations in Cambodia: the government's television and radio, IBC television, FUNCINPEC television and FM radio, CPP television and FM radio, and Phnom Penh's radio. Not long ago, it was rumored that Kandal Province was planning to run its own radio station. This project has since been aborted.
