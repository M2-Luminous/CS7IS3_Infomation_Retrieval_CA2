FR940920-2-00007 FR940920-2-00006 [A&hyph;301&hyph;801] Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Fresh Cut Roses From Colombia AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 20, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James Maeder or James Terpstra, Office of Antidumping Investigations, Import Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;3330, or (202) 482&hyph;3965. Preliminary Determination We preliminarily determine that fresh cut roses (roses) from Colombia are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value, as provided in section 733 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (the Act), as amended. The estimated margins are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice. Case History Since the notice of initiation on March 7, 1994 (59 FR 11771, March 14, 1994), the following events have occurred. On March 31, 1994, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) issued an affirmative preliminary determination. On April 19, 1994, the Department decided to collect constructed value (CV) information from all respondents in addition to home market or, where appropriate, third country sales information ( See the April 19, 1994, memorandum from the team to Barbara R. Stafford). On May 5, 1994, the Department issued sales and cost questionnaires to the following 16 Colombian companies: Agricola Benilda; Agrorosas S.A.; Flores La Fragancia S.A.; Flores Mocari S.A.; Grupo Andes; Grupo Bojaca; Caicedo Group; Grupo Clavecol; Grupo Floramerica; Grupo Intercontinental; Grupo Papagayo; Grupo Prisma; Grupo Sabana; Grupo Sagaro; Grupo Tropicales; and Rosex LTDA. These companies accounted for approximately 40 percent of the exports of the subject merchandise during the period of investigation (POI). Although the Department ``normally will examine not less than 60 percent of the dollar value or volume of the merchandise sold'' during the POI, 19 CFR 353.42(b)(1), due to limited administrative resources the Department chose to examine less than 60 percent ( See the May 2, 1994, memorandum from the team to Barbara R. Stafford). On June 24, 1994, the Floral Trade Council, petitioner in this investigation, requested a postponement of the preliminary determination until September 12, 1994, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.15(c) (1993). As we found no compelling reason to deny the request, the Department granted this request on June 28, 1994 (59 FR 34409, July 5, 1994). On June 24, 1994, the Department relieved all respondents except Caicedo Group from the requirement of reporting sales of roses imported and/or sold as part of bouquets ( See the June 24, 1994, memorandum from the team to Barbara R. Stafford). On this same date, the Department also instructed respondents to report monthly-average price data for the U.S. market, home market, and where appropriate, third country markets ( See the June 24, 1994, memorandum from the team to Barbara R. Stafford). Also on June 24, 1994, the Department determined that eight of the respondents (Agricola Benilda; Flores La Fragancia S.A.; Grupo Bojaca; Caicedo Group; Grupo Floramerica; Grupo Intercontinental; Grupo Papagayo; and Grupo Prisma) had viable home markets and were instructed to report home market sales data as the basis for foreign market value (FMV). In addition, the Department determined that four of the respondents (Grupo Clavecol; Grupo Sabana; Grupo Sagaro and Grupo Tropicales) did not have viable home markets and instructed the respondents to report third country sales data as a potential basis for FMV ( See the June 24, 1994, memorandum from the team to Barbara R. Stafford). However, since respondents argued that third country markets were fundamentally different from the U.S. market, it was decided that the final basis for FMV for these last four respondents (either third country sales or CV) would not be determined until more information was received ( See the ``Third Country Sales Versus Constructed Value'' section of this notice for further discussion).
