The seizure of a shipment of 198 kg of cocaine in the municipality of Aparecida do Rio Doce (in southwestern Goias) early last Saturday morning provided the PF [Federal Police] with confirmation that Goias is part of the international traffic's network of routes and that it is being used to transport drugs from Bolivia on their way to destinations abroad. Although the 198 kg of cocaine in question constitute the largest drug seizure ever in that state, PF Police Chief Leone Oliveira, who was in charge of the operation, estimates that the amount in question represents less than 5 percent of the total passing through the region every month. The drug, which was found in false bottoms built into two stake trucks of the kind used to carry cattle, is now at the Federal Police Superintendency in Goiania, where it will be incinerated as soon as court authorization is received. The drivers of the two trucks, Domingos Donizeth Vilani, 37, and Moises Fernandes Maciel, 33, are now in custody.
