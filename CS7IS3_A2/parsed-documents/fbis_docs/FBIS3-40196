With the functions of government and enterprises not separated, the state-owned banks play the dual role of both policy-lending and commercial banking. They monopolize the banking business to a certain extent, creating a situation characterized by lack of competition and low efficiency. This has distorted the role of the specialized banks prevented the banks from operating in the manner of enterprises and curbed the influence of the banking industry in the realm of economy. All this does not conform with the principle of seeking maximum beneficial returns in market economy. Nor is it conducive to building the foundation for strengthening the macro-economic control. China is a developing nation which will have a shortage of funds for a long time to come. Meanwhile, the nation has a bound duty to insure that enough funds are available in promoting economic development in backward areas, in developing infrastructural facilities and major construction projects, in increasing agricultural production and in readjusting the industrial structure. Policy-oriented banking is a form of financing that the state uses in performing the aforementioned functions. Policy-oriented banking is aimed at resolving issues for better social efficiency. However, there are some economic sectors with lower social efficiency that cannot afford to make the regular interest payments for their loans. For example, one of major investments of policy-lending banks is agriculture, including funds for the storage and purchase of farm and sideline products and for agricultural development. China is a major farming country. Either right now or in the future, agriculture remains China's foundation for economic development and social stability. This situation will not change, despite the development of the market economy. Meanwhile, agriculture is also a sector that requires a large amount of investment, while its financial returns are low and its cycle of investment turnover long. Therefore the use of policy-oriented banking in support of agricultural development is a long-term task. In this sense, this form of banking is similar to the state policy, which help the state exercise its macroeconomic control. This is the basic difference between policy-lending banking and commercial banking. Policy-lending is different from other financial function. The sources of the funds are not from taxes. Nor are the funds unpaid appropriation. Policy-lending is a banking business. Policy-lending financial institutions must raise their funds in the form of debts such as issuing bonds. Therefore, the banks often use the funds to make money in the form of loans. Naturally, loans must be repaid. Policy-lending financial institutions must follow the macroeconomic policy of the state concerning the amount of loans, outlets for investments and time frame for the loans; take into consideration the peculiar characteristics of the fund-using units; and give them preferential treatments in terms of interest rate. However, loans are debts after all. It is necessary to guarantee the return of capital plus a small amount of profit. This is precisely the basic difference between policy-lending and financial appropriations. China's specialized banks are doing policy-lending businesses over a protracted period. They do policy-lending as well as commercial businesses. Therefore, there are many drawbacks such as problems in agricultural development, IOU problems in the purchase of farm products, problems in investments for major state construction projects, problems of technical transformation for large- and medium-sized enterprises, and problems of credit and loans for the import and export of large-sized production equipment. All such problems cannot be easily solved. However, some of the regular commercial businesses have been neglected due to this kind of chaotic situation in management. This has also prevented China's specialized banks from starting to reform themselves. Several years ago, some theoreticians and the central bank had the idea of reforming specialized banks by separating policy-lending banking from commercial banking in terms of accounting, but there were great deal of difficulties when such reform measure was put into practice. The "Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Some Issues Concerning Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic Structure" pointed out: "We should establish policy-lending banks, and should separate policy-lending banking from commercial banking. We should organize the National Development Bank and the Agricultural Bank of China, all of them handling strictly defined policy-related business." A department concerned reveals that in the next round of financial reform, the state will establish three policy-lending banks to specialize in handling policy-related financing. To separate policy-lending banking from commercial banking will be conducive to reforming the investment system. The new National Development Bank will be a policy-lending bank aimed at financing the major construction projects of the state. It will manage the funds it has raised in a centralized manner to ensure the completion of the major construction projects in the state plan. It will evaluate the projects and determine the lending priorities; keep spending within the limits of its own resources; and supervise and control the utilization of its funds. By doing so, it will be able to not only meet the requirements in the development of all major construction projects and make the best use of the loans for the development of capital construction projects, but also change the situation whereby sources of construction funds are unreliable; no one assumes the responsibility for investment risks; or the total amount of investments is entirely out of control. By establishing policy-lending banks, we will be able to provide financing in support and in favor of agriculture. One of the functions of the Agricultural Bank of China, which will be in charge of policy-lending business after its reform, is to issue policy-related loans for the storage of grain crops, cotton and edible oil for the state and for the purchase of farm and sideline products on a contractual basis. This means that all the policy-related businesses in support of agriculture which are now being handled by several specialized banks will be managed by a single policy-lending bank. This will be conducive to efficiently using the credit and funds for agriculture, and helping retrieve agricultural loans and implement the state policy of supporting agriculture. The major task of the new Import and Export Credit Bank is to provide credit and funds for the buyers and sellers in importing or exporting complete sets of large-sized equipment and provide credit discount and guarantee for the Bank of China in exporting complete sets of machinery and electronic products. The separation of the policy-lending business from the commercial business is conducive to turning state specialized banks into modern commercial banks. For many years, the state-owned specialized banks have been unable to act according to the business principle in tapping fund resources, in making full use of their funds, in determining interest rates and doing accounting work, since they handle both policy-lending and commercial financing businesses. They cannot operate like a modern commercial bank. Meanwhile, various banks handle different volume of policy-related business. It will be difficult to objectively evaluate each bank's performance in extending loans and create conditions for all banks to compete with one other on an equal basis. After the complete separation of policy-lending financing from commercial financing, no one is able to "eat from the same big pot" of policy-lending business. Nor can anyone use policy-lending business as an excuse to cover up poor performances in management. Naturally, policy-lending banks should assume their own risks, manage their businesses with their capital safeguarded, and refrain from competing with commercial banks. The current situation shows that the separation of policy-lending banking from commercial banking will be faced with a great deal of difficulties in forming the correct ideology, bringing about structural changes, hiring personnel, clearing up accounts, handing business accounting, and transferring financial claims and liabilities. There will be a period of transition in actual operation. However, we have to march toward this direction sooner or later. Without this separation, it will be hard to establish a new financial system. We believe that following the separation of China's policy-lending banking from commercial banking and the progress in other aspects in the financial system reform, there will a new leap forward in China's banking business.
