II. Discussion The Commission has determined to approve the NASD's proposal. The Commission believes that the rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the NASD, including the requirements of Section 15A(b)(8) of the Act. 9 Section 15A(b)(8) requires, in part, that the rules of the NASD be designed to provide a fair procedure concerning the denial of membership in the NASD and prohibiting or limiting access to services of the NASD. 9 15 U.S.C. 78 o &hyph;3(b)(8). This rule change clarifies the NASD's membership application process by eliminating the inconsistencies between the NASD's by-Laws and the Schedules to the By-Laws concerning the administration of this process. In addition, this rule change clarifies the procedures set forth in the Schedules to the By-Laws for accepting, denying or accepting with limitations an application for membership. III. Conclusion In conclusion, for the reasons stated above, the Commission finds that the rule change is designed to provide a fair procedure concerning the denial of membership in the NASD and prohibiting or limiting access to services of the NASD. The Commission therefore finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act. It is therefore ordered , pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;94&hyph;14 be, and hereby is, approved. For the Commission, by the Division of Marker Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 10 10 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
