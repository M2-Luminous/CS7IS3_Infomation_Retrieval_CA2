Confirming the outbreak of the disease yesterday, the Elgeyo Marakwet Medical Officer of Health, Dr. David Koech, said three people died in Kapkosom sub-Location, five in Molol sub-Location and three at Kocholwa. Dr. Koech said two people were admitted at Plateau Mission Hospital in Uasin Gishu District. He appealed for calm among wananchi because the disease was under control. Dr. Koech said a team of medical personnel from Iten District Hospital had been sent to immunise the people in the area and urged wananchi to go for immunisation at Kocholwa Trading Centre. The immunisation exercise will take four days. The outbreak of meningitis was last reported in Kisii in early October last year when it killed four people from one family at Riangoncho village. Several other people including school children were admitted to hospital for treatment. Earlier in September, three school children were reported to have died following an outbreak of meningitis in Soi, Elgeyo Marakwet District. Six other children were admitted to Plateau Mission Hospital for treatment. At the time, Dr. Koech said the children who died from the disease were aged between three and nine and that he had toured the area and made sure that public health officers took preventive measures. A vaccination campaign was carried out and Dr. Koech said public health experts would keep the situation under constant surveillance to curb further spread of the disease. Earlier last year, a massive yellow fever vaccination drive was conducted in the area and neighbouring Baringo where more than 500,000 people were given the jabs. [Passage omitted]
