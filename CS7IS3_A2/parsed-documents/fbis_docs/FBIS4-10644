It also agreed to hold completely new elections in the State of Amazonas on 24 April, as provided for in the Law on the Election and Removal of State Governors. The action was taken with six directors of the CSE voting in favor and five against, with two, independent directors abstaining. Isidro Morales Paul, president of the CSE, said that in the case of the State of Delta Amacuro, as well as that of the State of Lara, the new elections would take place in only a certain number of electoral districts, in accordance with the election results annulled by the Supreme Court of Justice. In the State of Amazonas the election will be completely repeated. Furthermore, it was decided that the mayoral election in the town of San Sebastian del Tachira (State of San Cristobal) will be held on 17 April, while the mayoral election in the town of Rojas, State of Barinas, was set for 15 May. Morales Paul pointed out that a special commission will be appointed, consisting of Rodolfo Zapata, director of data processing; Manuel Vasquez, director of electoral systems; and Carlos Flores Conde, (acting) legal consul. The commission will review on a case by case basis the manner in which elections are to be held to determine whether very short campaigns will be required, as well as determine the budget necessary for holding them. Morales Paul stated that the approximate cost of these three elections (in the States of Delta Amacuro, Lara, and Amazonas) would be in the order of 40 million bolivares. He said that the ordinary resources of the CSE will be used, "in order to avoid harming the interests of the voters. We will request the necessary funds through the Ministry of Internal Relations and Congress." For his part Ruben Jaen, an independent member of the CSE, stated that the repetition of the elections would cost in the order of 25 million bolivares in the State of Amazonas and 100 million bolivares in the States of Lara and Delta Amascuro. He said: "The immense expenditure which is going to be incurred, in the absence of these new elections being entirely justified, should be a matter of concern to us." Jaen said that he does not agree with the decision by the Supreme Court of Justice, although he respects it. At the same time he emphasized the fact that this decision of the Supreme Court "does not order the repetition of elections in the State of Lara but rather orders the CSE to determine the impact which such a cancellation would have on the overall result of the elections." He pointed out that these decisions--in his view not supported by arguments of sufficient weight--threaten to keep the country in a permanent state of elections. He went so far as to say that: "From now on the slogan of Venezuela will not be that it is a country to love but a country to vote, since there will be very frequent elections."
