The Islamic Economic System AL-AZHAR DEFENDED; MUFTI ON FATWAS In an approximately 400-word article on page 24, Chief Editor al-Sayyid 'Abd al-Ra'uf rebuts those who "ignorantly and maliciously" accuse al-Azhar of being a "backward and narrow-minded institution restricting the freedom of thought and creativity." He maintains that al-Azhar, with its weight, history, role, and status "will always remain too strong and mighty for the weak ones to harm." Apart from being a beacon of knowledge and learning, the writer says al-Azhar has all along been the springboard for national struggle against foreign occupation and aggression. Now, the writer argues, "the voice of intelligence and moderation against extremism and terrorism is unleashed from al-Azhar, and from there the voice of knowledge and faith is unleashed to counter the attack that is being launched against religion and its principles, values, and symbols under the pretext of freedom of thought and creativity." In a related 500-word article on page 10, columnist Majdi Salim discusses how some people, against the law, are publicly criticizing some judicial rulings in newspapers. He notes the "clamor raised by some people against the ruling of the Administrative Judiciary Court and the State Council giving al-Azhar the legal right to review artistic works, whether audio, visual, or printed, as far as religious matters are concerned." The author comments: "The clamor against al-Azhar and the law was raised in the name of freedom and liberty. Do they know law better than the men of law, or are they-- to achieve their objectives--ready to sacrifice even the laws that protect them and the homeland?" Salim concludes: "At any rate, it is not strange for this group, which is used to attacking ethics and religious values, to throw the rules of the judiciary overboard." In a 120-word report by Mahmud 'Ushb on page one, Dr. Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi, the mufti of the republic, says any capable Muslim can pass fatwas [religious rulings], but those who do not have the right answers must not try to make fatwas. The mufti is cited as saying that specialist ulema must be consulted about fatwas and religious matters in movies and television dramas. He says: "Religion is sacred and everybody must be committed to its rules and act accordingly. Passing fatwas without the required knowledge is a major sin." LAWSUIT AGAINST USE OF SATELLITE DISHES A 150-word report on page three says that a young lawyer from Aswan has filed a lawsuit demanding that "all decisions allowing citizens to possess satellite dishes be rescinded." In his petition, the lawyer says that "explicit sex movies" available on satellite television "violate Article 2 of the Constitution, which states that Islam is the religion of the state. They also violate Article 10, which stipulates that the state shall guarantee protection of motherhood and childhood, care for the young, and ensure the right conditions for the development of their talents." RELIGIOUS SEMINAR STRESSES ISLAMIC VALUES, MOSQUE'S ROLE An approximately 2,000-word report by Ibrahim Nasr and Mamduh al- 'Ashri on page four gives an account of a religious seminar arranged by the newspaper at a Cairo school. According to the reporters, the ulema addressing the audience stressed the importance of Islamic upbringing and noted the important role of the mosque "not only as a place for worship, but also as a comprehensive cultural and social establishment." The speakers noted the organic bond between religion and culture. ATTACKS SEEN AS PART OF SCHEME AGAINST ISLAM A 300-word article by Basyuni al-Hulwani on page six discusses a television serial on the era of a Muslim caliph and concludes that Muslims have historically been the target of foreign hatred and conspiracies. He says: "History proves that we have always been the target of ambitions often supported from outside. The forces of evil, which do not want Islam to be active, find local hands to implement their wishes. This is what we are currently suffering from. Will we correctly read what is happening and realize that the scheme against stability in Egypt is part of a comprehensive scheme to attack Islam throughout the world? And will we try to answer one question to realize who is the real beneficiary from attempts to attack Egypt? The question is: Who are the enemies of Islam?" RELATIONS WITH NON-MUSLIM BELIEVERS An approximately 1,300 word article by Samir al-Hudaybi on page six discusses Muslims' relations with "the people of the book"; that is, followers of the other heavenly religions. The writer begins by noting that one of the "harmful common beliefs hindering an Islamic upsurge is that paradise is exclusively for Muslims." The writer provides Koranic texts to make the point that followers of the other heavenly religions are also believers. He writes: "Belief is a human phenomenon in all heavenly religions. Here, believers' hearts are full of virtue and knowledge that there is a creator and a day of judgment. But Islam is a way of life and the best of all religions; that is, the best way of life, and Muslims are required to highlight it and its virtues to the entire world." The writer concludes: "God is the lord of all humans. All men are God's people; He is more gracious to people than their fathers; He is absolute justice, and no one will enter paradise except those who have virtuous hearts that know no hatred and love others as they love themselves." ISLAMIC CULTURAL OPTION VERSUS WESTERN CULTURE An approximately 700-word article by Islamic writer Dr. Muhammad 'Amarah on page seven discusses the Islamic cultural project, analyzing the factors that make the Islamic option "the only cultural alternative capable of competing with the Western cultural option on an international level." The writer maintains that Western culture, which rearranged its house after the fall of the Marxist model, "does not want Islam, its nation, and its culture to grow strong and independent." He explains: "The strength, upsurge, and independence of this nation mean the fall of the biggest spoils from the mouth of the `Western lion,' a real earthquake in the international balance of power, and the return of the Islamic culture's influence on the deep-seated world cultures." The writer determines that "the West, as history certifies, views the culture of Islam as the first rival, the only competitor, and the main alternative to its culture in the international cultural struggle." DIALOGUE IN ISLAM Columnist Hamid Isma'il writes on page nine the 500-word second part of an article headlined "Freedom of Thought in Islam." He says the Koran urges meaningful dialogue and opposes fanaticism. He notes how early Muslim jurisprudents discussed their differences without any fanaticism or encroachment on the rights of their opponents. They never allowed their differences to develop into conflicts or splits. Isma'il concludes that "tolerance and mutual respect characterized the general life of our early jurisprudents, who fully understood the spirit of Islam and its principles." THE ISLAMIC ECONOMIC SYSTEM Page 10 contains an approximately 800-word report by Tariq 'Abdallah on an interview with Dr. Ja'far 'Abd-al-Salam, director of al-Azhar's Islamic Economy Center. 'Abd-al-Salam stresses the importance of the Islamic economy in pushing the economic and social life toward a comprehensive development. He notes that current man-made economic systems are trying to deny the existence of an Islamic economic system because of its competitiveness, which no other economic system can match. He argues: "The current dominance of certain economic systems is only a mater of time; they will end like other ones, and nothing will remain but the economic dealings imposed by Islam." "These dealings," he adds, "are not a man-made theory, but ones imposed by the book of God [Koran] and the Sunnah [sayings and deeds] of his prophet."
