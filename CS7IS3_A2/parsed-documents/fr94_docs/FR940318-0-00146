FR940318-0-00146 FR940318-0-00023 (2) CFC&hyph;12 Centrifugal Chillers, Retrofit. (a) HFC&hyph;134a. HFC&hyph;134a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 in retrofitted centrifugal chillers. HFC&hyph;134a does not contribute to ozone depletion. HFC&hyph;134a's GWP and atmospheric lifetime are close to those of other alternatives which are acceptable in this end-use. While HFC&hyph;134a is compatible with most existing refrigeration and air conditioning equipment parts, it is not compatible with the mineral oils currently used in such systems. An ester-based lubricant should be used rather than mineral oils. (3) CFC&hyph;113 Centrifugal Chillers, Retrofit. No substitutes have been identified for CFC&hyph;113 in retrofitted centrifugal chillers. (4) CFC&hyph;114 Centrifugal Chillers, Retrofit. (a) HCFC&hyph;124. HCFC&hyph;124 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;114 in retrofitted centrifugal chillers. Because HCFC&hyph;124 contributes to ozone depletion, it is considered a transitional alternative. However, it represents a much lower ozone-depleting risk than the continued use of CFCs. In addition, HCFC&hyph;124's GWP and atmospheric lifetime are significantly lower than other alternatives. HCFC&hyph;124 is not flammable. (5) R&hyph;500 Centrifugal Chillers, Retrofit. (a) HFC&hyph;134a. HFC&hyph;134a is acceptable as a substitute for R&hyph;500 in retrofitted centrifugal chillers. See the discussion on HFC&hyph;134a under retrofitted CFC&hyph;12 centrifugal chillers. (6) CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, CFC&hyph;113, CFC&hyph;114, and R&hyph;500 Centrifugal Chillers, New. (a) HCFC&hyph;123. HCFC&hyph;123 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, CFC&hyph;113, CFC&hyph;114, and R&hyph;500 in new centrifugal chillers. See the discussion on HCFC&hyph;123 under retrofitted CFC&hyph;11 centrifugal chillers. (b) HCFC&hyph;124. HCFC&hyph;124 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;114 in new centrifugal chillers. See the discussion on HCFC&hyph;124 under retrofitted CFC&hyph;114 centrifugal chillers. (c) HCFC&hyph;22. HCFC&hyph;22 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, CFC&hyph;113, CFC&hyph;114, and R&hyph;500 in new centrifugal chillers. HCFC&hyph;22 has been used in a variety of air conditioning and refrigeration applications for many years. Like HCFC&hyph;123, HCFC&hyph;22 contributes to ozone depletion and is considered a transitional alternative. HCFC&hyph;22 exhibits a higher ODP than HCFC&hyph;123, and production of it will be phased out according to the accelerated phase out schedule. HCFC&hyph;22's GWP and atmospheric lifetime are higher than other HCFCs. HCFC&hyph;22 is not flammable and is it compatible with existing oils used in most refrigeration and air conditioning equipment. (d) HFC&hyph;134a. HFC&hyph;134a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, CFC&hyph;113, CFC&hyph;114, and R&hyph;500 in new centrifugal chillers. See the discussion on HFC&hyph;134a under retrofitted CFC&hyph;12 centrifugal chillers. (e) HFC&hyph;227ea. HFC&hyph;227ea is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, CFC&hyph;113, CFC&hyph;114, and R&hyph;500 in new centrifugal chillers. HFC&hyph;227ea is a new chemical that has not seen widespread use. It contains no chlorine, so it does not contribute to ozone depletion. HFC&hyph;227ea's GWP and atmospheric lifetime are higher than those of other alternatives which are acceptable in this end-use. HFC&hyph;227ea is also being investigated as a component of several blends. (f) Ammonia. Ammonia is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, CFC&hyph;113, CFC&hyph;114, and R&hyph;500 in new centrifugal chillers. Ammonia does not deplete the ozone or contribute to global warming. Ammonia is flammable and toxic, but it may be used safely if existing OSHA and ASHRAE standards are followed. Users should check local building codes related to the use of ammonia. (g) Evaporative cooling. Evaporative Cooling is acceptable as an alternative technology to centrifugal chillers using CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, CFC&hyph;113, CFC&hyph;114, or R&hyph;500. Evaporative cooling does not contribute to ozone depletion or global warming and has the potential to be more energy efficient than current refrigeration and air conditioning systems. Evaporative cooling uses no chemicals, but relies instead on water evaporation as a means of cooling. It is in widespread use in office buildings in the western U.S. Recent design improvements have greatly expanded its applicability to other regions. (h) Desiccant cooling. Desiccant cooling is acceptable as an alternative technology to centrifugal chillers using CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, CFC&hyph;113, CFC&hyph;114, or R&hyph;500. Desiccant cooling systems do not contribute to ozone depletion or global warming. They offer potential energy savings over the use of CFC&hyph;11. Desiccant cooling is an alternate technology to the vapor compression cycle. (i) Ammonia/water absorption. Ammonia/water absorption is acceptable as an alternative technology to centrifugal chillers using CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, CFC&hyph;113, CFC&hyph;114, or R&hyph;500. Ammonia/water absorption is an alternative technology to vapor compression cycles. Ammonia is the refrigerant, and water is the absorber. This alternative has zero ODP and GWP. For information on toxicity, see the discussion of ammonia above. Users should check local building codes related to the use of ammonia. (j) Water/lithium bromide absorption. Water/lithium bromide absorption is acceptable as an alternative technology to centrifugal chillers using CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, CFC&hyph;113, CFC&hyph;114, or R&hyph;500. Some absorption systems use water as the refrigerant and lithium bromide as the absorber. Lithium bromide has zero ODP and GWP. It is low in toxicity and is nonflammable. (k) Stirling cycle. Stirling Cycle systems are acceptable as an alternative technology to centrifugal chillers using CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, CFC&hyph;113, CFC&hyph;114, or R&hyph;500. These systems use a different thermodynamic cycle from vapor compression equipment. Helium is frequently used as the refrigerant. The Stirling cycle does not include a phase change. Heat transfer is accomplished through compression and expansion. These systems have been used for several decades, primarily in refrigerated transport and cryogenics.

See the discussion on HFC&hyph;134a under retrofitted CFC&hyph;12 centrifugal chillers. (8) CFC&hyph;12 Reciprocating Chillers, New. (a) HCFC&hyph;22. HCFC&hyph;22 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 in new reciprocating chillers. See the discussion on HCFC&hyph;22 under new CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, CFC&hyph;113, CFC&hyph;114, and R&hyph;500 centrifugal chillers. (b) HFC&hyph;134a. HFC&hyph;134a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 in new reciprocating chillers. See the discussion on HFC&hyph;134a under retrofitted CFC&hyph;12 centrifugal chillers. (c) HFC&hyph;227ea. HFC&hyph;227ea is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 in new reciprocating chillers. See the discussion on HFC&hyph;227ea under new CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, CFC&hyph;113, CFC&hyph;114, and R&hyph;500 centrifugal chillers.
