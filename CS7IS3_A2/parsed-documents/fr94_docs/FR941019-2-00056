The following summary also contains a list of submissions that were dismissed by the Office of Hearings and Appeals. Appeals Pioneer Press, 09/09/94, LFA&hyph;4066 Pioneer Press filed an Appeal from a determination issued to it on June 20, 1994, by the Chief of the FOI and Privacy Acts Branch of the Reference and Information Management Division (Chief) of the Department of Energy (DOE). In that determination, the Chief stated that the DOE did not find any documents responsive to the appellant's information request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). In considering the Appeal, the DOE confirmed that the Chief followed procedures which were reasonably calculated to uncover the requested information, and had therefore undertaken an adequate search. Accordingly, the DOE denied the Pioneer Press request.
