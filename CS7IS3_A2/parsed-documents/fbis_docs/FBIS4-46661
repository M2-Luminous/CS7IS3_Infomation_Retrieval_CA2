Small spherical objects with inert masses of m[.sub]0[/] and m are usually used to ascertain G, but they cannot be launched into open space, because too many factors produce disturbing influences. The objects, therefore, must be contained in a shell that protects them from such factors. The researchers here point to the wisdom of using so-called quasisatellite orbits for the work. The properties of those orbits are described with perturbation theory and the calculation of periodic quasisatellite orbits. In the latter case, only periodic orbits with a rather large number of intersections k possess the typical properties of quasisatellite orbits of the general type. Perturbation theory enables the determination of the approximate values of the initial parameters for orbits with specific properties, i.e., a given number of intersections k and given minimum and maximum separations of m[.sub]0[/] and m.
