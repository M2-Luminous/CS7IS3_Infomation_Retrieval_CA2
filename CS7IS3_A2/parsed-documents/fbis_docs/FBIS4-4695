We are grateful for this. Being fully aware of the motto that the emergence of the new constitution is the duty of all citizens, the extracts are of particular interest to us because the future constitution will be based on what is being discussed at the plenary session. The following is our review of the proposals and discussions at the National Convention plenary session held from 23 to 31 March. There were discussions aimed at altering, adding provisions to, and criticizing the basic principles that had been laid down. Frankly, they amounted to subtle and outright opposition to the basic principles that had already been laid down. The entire world -- not just Myanmar [Burma] -- is aware of the 104 basic principles that have been welcomed and supported by hundreds of thousands of people at mass rallies. As a member of the public, I believe that the National Convention must implement its work step by step. If retrospection, criticism, and blame for past events are accepted, then the implementation of the original objective will be marked by confusion and slowness instead of progress. It will be viewed as excessive magnanimity and concession. The very essence of democracy is to follow the wishes of the majority of organizations. If the tendency to challenge the majority is practiced -- like the maxim of one against the entire village -- it will not only amount to disrespect for democracy, but the destruction of democratic practices. In some matters, what the majority likes may be identical to what the individual likes, while in some cases what the majority likes may not be approved of by an individual or what an individual likes may not be acceptable to the majority. A genuine politician tends to concede to the wishes of the majority if his wishes clash with those of the majority. A self-centered and subjective person can end up fighting against the entire world. We heard the discussions by flexible delegates who gave priority to the national interest over the interests of their own national races and regions. We respect and admire these people who expressed in their reports a willingness to be abide by whatever decisions are made by the National Convention and declared categorically that they would not secede from the Union. At the National Convention there were those who were noble as well as those who were petty. There were expressions of belief and terms tinged with anger, pride, sarcasm, and insinuation as well as sincere and polite presentation of views. We were amazed at how those self-centered people, who are prisoners of their own subjective views, made small concessions but then sought exorbitant and greedy demands in an intimidating manner from the other side, which was barely left with anything. It is like killing an elephant for distribution to the community. They made the demands to exploit the existence of national races who are the same as them living in other regions, although the demands could mean the extinction of others living in these regions. The emergence of self-administered zones is not a matter based on one's wishes alone. Wishes can lead to anxiety, over zealousness, and one-sidedness. It is easy to remedy this matter if the basic principles are followed as they were laid down. Merely having sufficient population is not enough for the emergence of a self-administered zone. To be more specific, a national race may have a population of 1 million, with 3,125 people spread out in 320 townships. Are we to prescribe the 320 townships for that particular national race? The crucial point to consider is collective residence in congruous territory. If a national race that does not constitute a majority in a township claims a self- administered township, it will amount to a blatant act of dominance over the majority of national races residing in that particular township. The use of pressure cannot bring about a stable administration; only concrete conditions will bring about a just decision. Government organizations are fully informed of the concrete conditions regarding government work. Myanmar has its census figures with records and gazetteers in each village tract, ward, and township. Furthermore, it is not difficult for a government to carry out field work to assess the current situation. If a commission is formed and field work is carried out, it will take much time. Let there be arguments and excuses. In the final analysis, the truth -- concrete evidence, records, gazetteers, and statistics -- will be presented, and time will determine what should happen. It is important, however, not to store arrows before war. Our delegates should not be overzealous and proud. They should say what they have to say and demand only what they have to demand in the interest of the entire nation and people. We should avoid slaughtering an elephant to provide a single meal to the community.
