The first topic among many NPC deputies and CPPCC members is the overall task. They believe that it is urgent to promote -- among people across the country and cadres at all levels in particular -- the idea of caring for and having the overall interest in mind. What is this overall task? It is the prosperity of our great country and the unceasing progress of the Chinese Nation. Seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability -- this is the overall task today for the whole country and whole party. While examining and discussing the report on government work, the NPC deputies and CPPCC members commented: Memorizing these phrases does not mean one understands what the overall task is. The key is that cadres at various levels must conscientiously subordinate themselves to this overall task in thinking and in action. The measures they devise should be conducive to this overall task and the steps they take must serve this overall task. When partial interest stands in the way of the overall interest, they must voluntarily give up partial interest in favor of overall interests. NPC deputies and CPPCC members cited a wide array of irregularities in the localities that harm overall interest. For example, some localities always try to get around the strictures of the central government. When the central government was trying to consolidate order in the banking sector, the localities continued their illegal raising of investment; while the central government was calling for reducing the scale of capital construction, they continued building office buildings, auditoriums, and guesthouses; when the central government was calling for preventing the real estate sector from overheating, they claimed that there was no heating in their localities. Other manifestations include haphazard importation, duplication in construction, misguided competition in disregard of one's capabilities, rushing to launch new projects without careful study, and so forth. Some of these actions may yield short-term benefits but will, in the long run, be harmful to the state and people. The existence of these phenomena indicates that in our effort to accelerate the transition from a planned economy to a market one, lack of understanding and experience and a mistaken standpoint can often lead to misguided actions. A sense of the overall task is especially important at a time like this. A man's understanding can be improved step by step and experience can be accumulated bit by bit, but he must first have a sense of the overall interest. This year, we will be combining package reform with breakthroughs in key areas, a crucial year for all-round deepening of reform. Reform will unearth many deep-rooted contradictions. NPC deputies and CPPCC members held that the overall tasks requires us to properly handle the relations between reform, development, and stability. He Zhukang, a deputy from Jilin, said: Only by persistently implementing reform and promoting development will we be able to lay a foundation for the long-term social stability and state order. To promote reform and development, we must have a stable social environment. Reform is aimed at unleashing the motive force, development is our goal, and stability is the precondition. This year we will be placing greater efforts on carrying out reform and new contradictions and problems are bound to emerge. To ensure smooth implementation of reform, we must subordinate ourselves to overall interests and ensure that regional growth rates will be appropriate and steady. Referring to the policy of macroeconomic regulation and control adopted by the central authorities last year, Jiangsu Deputy Shen Daren said with feeling: This policy was adopted for the interest of the overall situation. It has created a favorable overall environment for regional development and helped bring along healthy development of the regional economies. It is easy to see from the comments of the NPC deputies and CPPCC members that China is indeed faced with a rare historical opportunity in terms of the conditions at home and abroad. We must, however, be aware of the fact that we are advancing economic reform when the national economy is growing rapidly; we are required to maintain a sustained, rapid, and healthy growth of the national economy while accelerating structural transformation. Under these circumstances, it is essential to stress ideals, discipline, unity, and overall interest. We must be full of confidence yet keep a clear head. Let us continue our conscientious, meticulous efforts in this regard and work in a down- to-earth manner to achieve new victories.
