The diplomat made the announcement at Government Palace after meeting with President Juan Carlos Wasmosy. At the end of the meeting, Merom said the closure of the Israeli Embassy is purely a matter of internal reorganization, adding that Israel has 17 embassies in Latin America, which is considered excessive. Merom said Israel will place more emphasis on the Muslim countries in their region, adding that his country needs increased relations and understanding with these nations in view of the requirements of the new world order. The ambassador said a commission had studied the coverage of embassies in order to relocate them. Finally, Merom said his country cannot maintain so many embassies in Latin America, adding that this is the single reason why his country decided to "close" this embassy in Paraguay.
