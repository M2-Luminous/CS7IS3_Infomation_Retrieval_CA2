They discussed the division of the Black Sea Fleet and the basing of Russian ships in Crimea. Officially, no details have been reported. INTERFAX learned from sources in the Russian delegation that the fist draft of the final document on the settlement of the Black Sea Fleet issues had not been approved by the two parties. Moscow has insisted that Sevastopol be the main base of the Russian Navy and that the Ukrainian fleet be based beyond the city limits. It can be stationed in Balaklava (Crimea) or in Odessa. Russia wanted the document to contain the following formula, "Sevastopol is the main Russian navy base in Crimea." Kiev proposed another formula, "The main Russian navy base in Crimea will be stationed in Sevastopol." A Russian delegation expert clarified that the Ukrainian formula meant that all military infrastructure in Sevastopol would belong to Ukraine. He added that the issue on leasing would be mentioned in a separate agreement. Russia wanted to avoid the term "leasing" and to mention "utilization in accordance with the intergovernmental agreement" instead. On 24 May at 2100 the talks are still continuing. The Ukrainian party put forward new proposals on the division of the Black Sea Fleet within the scope of the March agreements between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents. In accordance with these agreement Moscow would receive 699 ships and supplementary boats of the Black Sea Fleet and Kiev would receive 164 units. Kiev wanted its quota to be increased.
