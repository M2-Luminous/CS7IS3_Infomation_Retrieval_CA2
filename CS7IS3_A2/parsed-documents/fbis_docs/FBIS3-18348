That line was given its clearest airing in the speeches of Gerry Adams and Mr McGuiness, but it ran through the bulk of contributions from the floor during the debate on what Sinn Fein calls the Irish peace initiative. It is not a new line. Sinn Fein's demand for direct talks with the British in advance of a response to the Declaration has been stated almost from the beginning of this phase of the peace process. But the party used the opportunity of the hugely high profile Ardfheis to ensure that neither the Irish nor the British Government could be in any doubt about their intentions. Sinn Fein insist that any such contacts would deal with "clarification." The British, who have refused to reopen the secret channels of communication, insist in turn that what Sinn Fein want is tantamount to negotiation. The truth, as ever, is in between. Sinn Fein want the British to spell out their ultimate intentions for the North -- they want to know how far that government will go in forcing a political settlement between the Unionist community in the North and nationalist community of the whole island. They want to know, in effect, if Britain is prepared to drop the Unionist veto. The dropping of the veto would allow for the sort of national self-determination Sinn Fein wants: the island as a whole deciding a political settlement free of the "impediment" of the Unionist right to say No. To use a much over used phrase, Sinn Fein wants a level playing pitch. The flexibility and acknowledgement of the need for Unionist consent that Sinn Fein speaks of is always in the context of a post-veto Ireland. They insist that they will accept any political settlement agreed to by the people, as long as all the people of the island decide on it. But this also implies that while Sinn Fein would find Unionist consent desirable, that community's right to opt out of some future arrangement would be severely limited. How strong a voice would the Unionists have in the context of a 32-county poll? It is unlikely now that anything the Irish Government says or does to the Provisional movement is going to budge them from their current position on direct contacts with the British. Albert Reynolds cannot deliver what Sinn Fein wants even it it was his political desire to do so. It is the British who govern Northern Ireland who alone will decide its future. Sinn Fein are also confident that the contacts with the British will be reopened, though not in the short term. Indeed, the party may be looking towards a post-Major administration before the talks begin again. But they already believe there is evidence that even this administration is budging. Sir Patrick Mayhew's pleasant sounding noises in the direction of Northern nationalists last week, plus John Major's conciliatory article in the Irish News, have been interpreted by Sinn Fein as a sign that the British are softening their "no contacts" stance. Sinn Fein logic naturally suggests that if the party continue to hold out for those contacts, then the British will eventually relent. They believe, in any case, that the British are now well down the disengagement road. They even acknowledged, for the first time, that the Joint Declaration was a nationalist advance, as was, they say, the Anglo Irish Agreement -- a document they vehemently rubbished at the time. Sinn Fein naturally believe that both advances emerged directly from the Provisionals' ballot box-and-armalite tactics. And, therefore, why should they now abandon such a "successful" strategy, given their belief that the British are moving just the way they want them? The Government must now be aware that Sinn Fein have in effect rejected the Declaration. It is not enough in itself to engage them -- their old demands on the British remain. Following the Ardfheis it will now be virtually impossible for the Taoiseach [Irish prime minister] to state that Sinn Fein must be given more time. They have made their decision -- they want dialogue with the British and out of that dialogue they want commitments to a British policy change on the Unionist veto. The Government knows that is not achievable in the short to medium term. Furthermore, they have signed a binding agreement acknowledging the right of that veto to remain. What options are now open to them? A resuscitation of the talks process now seems inevitable. However, the Government is unlikely to have much appetite for that, given the failure of previous talks to deliver anything before and given the Taoiseach's belief that such a process would have its best chance of success in an atmosphere of peace.
