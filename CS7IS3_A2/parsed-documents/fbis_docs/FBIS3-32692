With the signing of Brazil, the main cocoa-producing country that had not yet signed the agreement, what is now missing is the massive participation of the consumers so that the agreement can become effective. The European union is the main cocoa consumer. Brazilian diplomats reported last week that the Europeans will sign the agreement. The new agreement is based on production and consumer committees with the objective of promoting the development and strengthening of the sector. Sergio Moreira Lima, chief of Itamaraty's Basic Products Division, told this newspaper that "there is a commitment to seek a balance between supply and demand and thus prevent the overproduction of cocoa that has been responsible for the low prices during the past five or six years." According to the diplomat, while the agreement is not in effect, there is the policy of the Alliance of Cocoa-Producing Countries, which functions independently from the international agreement and it is working to seek a balance within the market. The Alliance, which has its seat in Lagos, met some two months ago in Quito, where the producers agreed to a new production policy with the implementation of ceilings. The producing countries desire the participation of the consumers in the agreement because the success of the new policy will depend on the consumers' commitment to encourage an increase in the consumption of cocoa within their own countries. The diplomats admit that the main concern is the European union's pressure to replace cocoa butter with similar products, such as margarine, which would lead to a 200,000 ton annual reduction in the consumption of cocoa. Moreira Lima said that "the importing countries must make an effort to reduce the obstacles that block an expansion of cocoa consumption." The agreement will be implemented after it has been ratified by five exporting countries that will be responsible for 80 percent of the total world exports. The endorsement by consumer countries that must commit themselves to a minimum of 60 percent of the total imports is another condition for the agreement to go into effect.
