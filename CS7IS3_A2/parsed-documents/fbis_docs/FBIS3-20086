We declare that we are ready to cooperate with the German authorities in this matter. Allegations to the effect that those who will be extradited will be executed or tortured in Turkey consists entirely of the propaganda waged by extremist organizations. This is what we are explaining to the Germans. We are discussing these issues with various organs. Such a mechanism exists between the Foreign Ministries of both countries. We have a committee comprised of the under secretaries of the Foreign, Justice, and Interior Ministries. Moreover, we decided to set up a cooperation committee between the Turkish and German Justice Ministries. I believe that it will not be difficult to reach an agreement with Germany on these and similar issues. It is important to trust one another and I believe that this mutual trust exists.
