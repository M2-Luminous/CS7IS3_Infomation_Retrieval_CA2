This is stated in a statement that the Slovak Television Council made available to the TA SR yesterday. In the spirit of the Law on Slovak Television, the Council decided that, after every concluded meeting of the National Council of the Slovak Republic, a "parliamentary press club" will be broadcast, to be attended by representatives of all clubs of deputies. At the same time, the Council asks the STV central director to ensure in the program, as of May, 60 to 80 minutes a month for the views of representatives of those extraparliamentary political entities that achieved at least 2 percent of the electoral vote in the parliamentary elections. The Council also approved the principle that the first "Aktuality" program [main newscast broadcast at 1930 local time] will be exclusively news-oriented (without commentaries), with greater emphasis on coverage of developments across Slovakia. The Council asks that the idea be reconsidered of returning to the operation of the Television (as well as Radio) Council according to the principle of proportional representation of all decisive political entities. The statement draws attention to the fact that this would once again turn the Slovak Television Council into an object of political contest.
