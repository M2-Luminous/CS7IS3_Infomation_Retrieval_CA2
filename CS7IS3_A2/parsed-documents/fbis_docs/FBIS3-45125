He told XINHUA today that the joint communique between the governments of China and France signaled that their relationship was over the worst and ushered in a new era. In an interview with the official Chinese news agency, de Villepin said that Sino-French friendship, on the basis of the traditional principles on which the two countries established diplomatic relations, would provide for fresh advantages politically for bilateral trade and economic cooperation. Reviewing the bilateral relationship, he said that China's pursuit of the reform and opening policy constructed by senior leader Deng Xiaoping had been a major event of the past 30 years, ever since the two countries had forged diplomatic ties. From the late 1970s, China has speeded up its international cooperation in trade and economy and secured one of the fastest economic growths in the world, the chairman said. He added that increased bilateral cooperation could now be enjoyed in the future, alluding to low trade activities in the past. During the first nine months of 1993, he told XINHUA, China's trade volume with France registered only a 33 percent increase, much lower than the 90 percent with Germany, 83 percent with Italy and 154 percent with Denmark. During that period, France had lost potential trade with China worth a total of 6 billion francs (35.6 billion U.S. dollars), the France-China committee estimated. De Villepin stressed that it is now in the two peoples' interest to improve their relationship and develop economic cooperation. As permanent members of the United Nations, France and China should make efforts to help build a new world order and advance world peace and progress, de Villepin added.
