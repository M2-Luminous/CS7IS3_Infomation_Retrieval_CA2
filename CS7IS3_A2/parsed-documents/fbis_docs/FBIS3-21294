Tahraoui: "Urban Transportation; Curse the Bus"--first paragraph is LIBERTE introduction] [Text] Taking a bus in Algiers these days is no picnic. The considerable number of buses placed at the disposal of citizens has not changed one whit the time-honored struggle the unfortunate Algerian must face every day. He has no choice; his professional and family life are conditioned by this ill of modern times: transportation. Well, then, to bus or not to bus? The adventure begins in the morning, on the way to work, to end only in the evening. How many of us do not have to pay their daily tribute in time, cutting down on sleep or work in order to catch a bus? How many of us do not have to put up with, or practice the "delightful" sport, which consists in elbowing one's way through the crowd to board a bus? Very few I should say. After standing about for minutes or even hours in an agony of impatience, the fateful moment finally comes, "his majesty" the bus is among us. Clear the decks! Without any warning, the "holy war" starts. Pushing, shouting, cursing, shoving. Everything goes. Here, an old woman is trampled underfoot; there, another one is "attacked." You wouldn't believe your eyes or your ears. To force their way to the bus door, the shrewder ones take the offensive, launching successive "raids" interspersed with shoulder knocks that could send you flying across the street. The "peaceful" ones choose to look on, waiting for any "ceasefire." That's a mistake. Attacks follow in close succession, ending only when the bus is moving. Once inside, "hostilities" subside. Eventually, there is a truce. The heat inside certainly helps. The bus is crammed full. It takes luck to find a seat, or even standing room in a less crowded corner, away from nauseating odors. A deathly hush prevails, interrupted now and then by the conductor, cursing this or that. Whew! Finally, we reach the terminal and our anxiety is relieved. We fight to get out as we fought to get in...rushing to freedom. The honorable ETUSA [the urban transportation board] must be thinking of a nuisance bonus, plus a medal of valor for anyone who does not crack up in these accursed buses.
