The Social Democratic Party [SPD]-dominated laender chamber thus unanimously accepted Nehm, who had been proposed by Federal Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, of the Free Democratic Party [FDP]. The 52-year-old judge can now succeed Alexander von Stahl, who had been assigned nonactive status by the minister in the wake of the controversial antiterror operation of Bad Kleinen late last June.
