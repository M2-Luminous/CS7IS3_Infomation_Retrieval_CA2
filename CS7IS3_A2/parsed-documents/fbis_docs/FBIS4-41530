The som is to replace the som-coupon on the domestic market on 1 July. The som-coupon was introduced in November 1993. Karimov called for the priority of exports and increased production of competitive goods. He was worried about the growth of prices for many items on the domestic market and demanded tighter control of commercial stores which, he said, bought production of state-managed facilities to sell it at inadequate prices to the population. That, in Karimov's view, could lead to the devaluation of the new currency unit.
