This comes after Mr. Rabuka, after being reelected prime minister following the recent Fiji elections, said he hoped the Government of National Unity could be formed within the next five years. [sentence as heard] Opposition Leader Jai Ram Reddy says before that can happen there must be a review of Fiji's 1990 constitution, which he says discriminates against Indians and ensures they remain in a parliamentary minority. Terms of reference have been agreed for a constitutional review, which must be completed by 1997. In last month elections, Mr. Reddy's National Federation Party won 20 of the 27 seats set aside for Indians in Fiji's 70-seat parliament. Indians make up 45 percent of Fiji's population.
