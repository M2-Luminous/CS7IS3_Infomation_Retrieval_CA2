Immediately after the votes were counted, the passions in the party leadership were stirred up because Zoran Djindjic insisted, also formally, on becoming chairman of the party. We spoke with Dragoljub Micunovic, who has been the chairman of the party for four years now, about the complex relations and splits within the party and about the announcement of the Democratic Party assembly in which a new party chairman should be elected. Micunovic pointed out which decisions were taken by the Democratic Party bodies, and what the election procedure should be like according to the bylaws, concluding that the assembly scheduled for the beginning of February can only be extraordinary (its agenda has already been defined) and in no case electoral. "It is possible that one-third of the delegates fills up the agenda with the procedure by which my resignation from the position of the party chairman would be required. If this requirement is rejected, it is not possible to call for a vote of censure in the party leader until the next regular electoral assembly (in 1994)," Micunovic explained the complicated election procedure. If it happens that Micunovic, as he says himself, does not obtain the vote of confidence, his duty will be taken over by one of the Democratic Party vice chairmen, and the procedure for the election of a new chairman will start. I Shall Ask for Fair Play [Pesic] Will you run for the position of the party chairman if the delegates do not vote for confidence in you as the party chairman? [Micunovic] No, I shall not run for this position. Why should I run for the position of the party chairman? If the Main Committee in its session on 9 January 1994 opens a discussion on the confidence in the party chairman, I shall try to make the month between this session and the scheduled assembly at the beginning of February a period of democratic fair play. I shall support the principle of equal treatment and insist on the opportunity to visit our communal committees in order to present my platform there and hear critical opinions from our members at the same time. [Pesic] You deny the impression created in public that your position as party chairman has been weakened by the fact that Djindjic won the election. You stress that "the Democratic Party won the election." If you had been the bearer of the election lists, would you have achieved the same result? [Micunovic] Perhaps an even better result, but this is mere speculation. Djindjic also led the Democratic Party campaign in earlier elections. He made decisions now and then about the posters, TV spots, and so forth. I would like to point out that our party campaign was carried out in a very professional way this time and stood out because of its standard. The success of a party cannot, however, be attributed to only one man. Have you ever heard that if a party has been successful in an election, its chairman is dismissed after that? As far as Djindjic's candidacy is concerned, it is his right according to our bylaws to run for party chairman. Since the candidacy was started in the middle of an election period, it is necessary to respect the procedure defined by the bylaws. Personalized Race [Pesic] The impression was created in public that it is quite natural that Djindjic replaces you in the position of the party chairman after the success he achieved in this election. [Micunovic] This impression was created by the media because Zoran Djindjic carried out two campaigns. One for the party, in which he fought for votes, and the other for himself. The Democratic Party election campaign was personalized. TV spots, posters, badges, cigarette lighters were marked exclusively with Djindjic's name. This resulted in the impression that the Democratic Party is connected only with his name. I think highly of all of Djindjic's qualities and merits for the achieved election result, but the Democratic Party decided not to be a party characterized by its leader. I do not want to deny that splits arouse within the Democratic Party because of Djindjic's candidacy for the position of party chairman. I think that it is sensible to make changes only if a party chairman harms his party or destroys its reputation. [Pesic] How can the present splits, which harm the party, be overcome? [Micunovic] The decisions taken by the Central Committee have to be respected. One of these decisions is that all Democratic Party bodies must function according to the effective bylaws. Only in this way can we overcome the present polarization. [Pesic] There is still the impression that you are supported only by a party minority after this election. [Micunovic] This is something to be measured yet. It is certain that during the election the popularity of Mr. Djindjic rose. The final decision, however, will be taken by the assembly delegates. I have contacts with the Executive Committee chairman [Djindjic], but our relations are not as normal as they should be. The reason for it is his engagement in the election campaign that was completed only a few days ago. Compromise in the Interest of the Party [Pesic] There are people who think that you should have resigned after this election because the Democratic Party achieved poor results in their opinion. [Micunovic] This would mean that everybody who does not win an election, and no opposition party in Serbia has been successful so far, has to resign. This is a bad comparison with the English Parliament in which there are three parties. Also after this election, the Democratic Party has remained the fourth strongest party, before the Socialist Party, the Radical Party and the DEPOS, and we have no chance of endangering the Socialist Party. We obtained half a million votes this time, and in the previous election for the Federal Parliament we obtained in the coalition with the "Reformers" 460,000 votes. In the interest of the party I made a compromise and agreed with the proposal that Djindjic bore the election lists. In this way I agreed to sacrifice a part of my prestige and I do not regret my decision. I think that the party will correctly understand my readiness to serve the Democratic Party -- I do not want the party to serve me. The Democratic Party is organized according to democratic standards in order to be an alternative to the communist and socialist party. The Democratic Party has in this way become the model of the democratic political milieu in contrast to the long-lasting authoritarian way of thinking. If the Democratic Party gave up its original political intentions, it would betray most of its members and supporters who joined us because they did not way authoritarian leaders. I believe that the Democratic party will not give up its principles.
