This was stated in a conversation with a RIA correspondent by a high-ranking spokesman of the Russian foreign minister. He said that the Russian side will announce this at the consultations with NATO experts in Moscow on February 21 in discussing the procedure of Russia's joining the Partnership for Peace programme. According to the Russian diplomat, Russia's participation in this programme should include not only military components but also the issues of conversion. The Partnership for Peace programme, adopted at the January session of the heads of NATO member-states in Brussels, provides for gradual inclusion of the former Warsaw Treaty Organisation's members in NATO's political and military structures. The agreement on joining this programme has already been signed by Poland, Romania, Lithuania, Estonia, Hungary, Slovakia and Ukraine. Latvia and Bulgaria are about to do it. "Russia's participation in the Partnership for Peace programme should markedly differ from the participation of the countries which have already jointed it," said the spokesman of the Russian Foreign Ministry.
