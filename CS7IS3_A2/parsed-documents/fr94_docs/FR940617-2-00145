A determination of jeopardy to the species or a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) will not be made before 30 days from the date of the publication of this notice. This notice is provided pursuant to Section 10(c) of the Act and National Environmental Policy Act regulations (40 CFR 1506.6).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A Habitat Conservation Plan has been developed as mitigation for the incidental taking of the golden-cheeked warbler. The Applicant proposes to mitigate the incidental take via dedicating 260 acres of occupied golden-cheeked warbler habitat as a permanent preserve, providing funding for the operation and management of the preserve lands, performing golden-cheeked warbler monitoring and research studies on the preserve and project lands, and avoiding construction activities within warbler territories during the breeding season. Details of the mitigation are provided in the Environmental Assessment and Habitat Conservation Plan for the Spicewood at Bull Creek and Canyon Mesa Developments. A determination of jeopardy to the species or a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) will not be made before 30 days from the date of publication of this notice. This notice is provided pursuant to Section 10(c) of the Act and National Environmental Policy Act regulations (40 CFR 1506.6). The Applicant considered four alternatives, but rejected three of them.
