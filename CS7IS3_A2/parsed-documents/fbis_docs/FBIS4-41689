This money was minted on the islands specially for the Russian citizens working there. Norwegian sovereignty over the archipelago was established under the Svalbard Treaty (still known as the Paris treaty) of 1920, but all the countries which signed it, and they now number 40, received the right to conduct their own economic activity there. Representatives of a number of Russian organizations work on the islands, the largest of which is reckoned to be the Arktikugol Trust. Some time ago the Arktikugol Trust, whose head office is in Moscow, introduced its own coins into circulation in denominations of R10, R25, R50, and R100 at the Barentsburg and Pyramiden mines on Svalbard. But the Norwegian authorities reacted extremely negatively to this move. Since the words "Russian Federation" were stamped on the coins, Odd Blomdal, the Norwegian governor of the islands, thought that Moscow was thereby encroaching on Norwegian sovereignty over Svalbard. Representatives of the Russian embassy in Oslo were summoned to the Norwegian Foreign Ministry, where they heard an expression of dissatisfaction at the Arktikugol Trust's action. After that, as I was told at the embassy, the money was taken out of circulation at Barentsburg and Pyramiden. I phoned Barentsburg on Svalbard, where I spoke to Aleksandr Sokolov, director of the Arktikugol mine, and asked him to explain the reason for the introduction of the new coins. "Inflation, of course," he replied. "Whereas before our local internal commodity turnover amounted to R400,000 a quarter, now it is running at 20 million a month." [Zubko] What currency was in circulation at the mines before? [Sokolov] We had tokens in denominations from R1 to R25 and our own coins minted in the fifties. Incidentally, this is a real find for numismatists. [Zubko] How are you getting by now, bearing in mind that the old money supply is inadequate and you are withdrawing the new one? [Sokolov] We were in a difficult position. Commodity exchange and all workers' and employees' purchases have to be made on order forms to the official departments, which tripled the chore! But we are collecting up the coins and will send them to Moscow, where they will decide what to do with them....
