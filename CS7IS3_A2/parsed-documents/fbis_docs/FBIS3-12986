Today, the commission will interview 11 witnesses from the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]. The first witness is Major General Dani Yatom, the commander of the Central Command. The military commander of the Cave of the Patriarchs will also appear before the commission. Our legal affairs correspondent Mira Amsalem reports: The state commission of inquiry known as the Shamgar [named after Supreme Court justice heading it] commission will start its proceedings this morning by hearing the testimony of military personnel. The first witness will be Maj. Gen. Dani Yatom, the commander of the Central Command. The members of the commission -- Justice Me'ir Shamgar, the president of the Supreme Court; Justice El'iezer Goldberg, Judge 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Zu'bi, Professor Menahem Ya'ari, and former Chief of Staff Moshe Levi -- will hear the testimony of and interrogate Maj. Gen. Yatom. Afterwards, apparently today, they will also hear the testimony of Major General Sha'ul Mufaz, the commander of IDF forces in Judaea and Samaria. The commander of the Cave of the Patriarchs will also be interrogated this week. As a rule, the commission will hold its proceedings four times a week, in the morning and in the afternoon. Due to the Ramadan fast, the Arab witnesses will only testify before the commission after the fast is over, in approximately two weeks. This week, then, military, police, and Border Police personnel will give testimony. The witnesses will appear without legal counsel. If the commission decides that certain witnesses may be harmed by their testimony, they will be warned and subsequently permitted to employ legal representation. However, it may be safely assumed that some of the witnesses have already received, or will receive, private legal counselling before testifying to the commission. The commission's letter of appointment stipulates that it will investigate findings and reach conclusions as to the facts and circumstances relating to the massacre. In its search for the truth, the commission of inquiry into the Hebron massacre may reach the highest levels of the IDF, the Civil Administration, the Shin Bet, and even up to the defense minister. The commission has been given the results of the IDF's investigation into the massacre and additional material amassed by the attorneys responsible for collecting all relevant material, Miki Shaqed and Dafna Bienvoll. The military investigation has already revealed flaws in security regulations at the Cave; however, this is only one aspect of the investigation. Beyond clarifying the facts, the commission must also present its findings as to the responsibility for the massacre. The commission will try to answer these most disturbing questions in the form of recommendations for future implementation and personal conclusions with regard to actions taken by specific parties in the past. Did the Shin Bet indeed issue an early warning? What was the nature of the activities of the members of the Kakh organization and the murderer Barukh Goldstein? What were the standard security regulations at the Cave of the Patriarchs and what were the instructions and regulations governing behavior at the site? Were the authorities adequately prepared for the Ramadan fast? And finally, who bears responsibility for all this? The commission of inquiry has published notices in the newspapers calling on all witnesses to the massacre to come and testify. This is the 11th commission of inquiry established according to law. Four commissions in the past recommended the dismissal of senior officials. According to various assessments, it will take this commission at least two months to publish its recommendations.
