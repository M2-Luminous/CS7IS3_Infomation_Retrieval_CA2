Hosokawa, who escaped unhurt, was on his way home from a party at the Keio Plaza Hotel in central Tokyo marking the establishment of the Tokyo chapter of the Japan New Party which he heads. Police identified the attacker as Masakatsu Nozoe, who is 52. The shot missed the target when plain-clothes policemen slapped the gunman on the hands as he held a revolver aimed at Hosokawa, KYODO quoted witnesses as saying. But police later quoted Nozoe as saying that initially he was aiming at Hosokawa, but then decided to fire at the ceiling, the news agency said. It also said the assailant later told police that he had become upset with Hosokawa's apologies for Japan's invasion of its Asian neighbors during World War II and with his economic policies. As soon as the attack occurred police officers subdued the assailant while plain-clothes officers rushed the former premier out of the hotel and into a waiting car. A shaken Hosokawa reportedly expressed concern for his wife as he was being escorted out of the hotel, saying, "Kayoko is still there. Please..." Hosokawa, who resigned last month over his dubious financial dealings, has been threatened by rightist groups since he took office last August because of his remarks condemning Japan's wartime atrocities.
