Security at the polling stations will be looked after by a National Security Management Centre (NSMC) falling under the IEC. This will co-ordinate a network of Joint Operating Centres (JOCs), responsible for securing the stations and keeping an eye on the security situation. These in turn will be largely staffed by South African Police [SAP] and South African Defence Force [SADF] personnel, but will be chaired by civilians appointed by the IEC. The only problem with the complicated structure is that there is no plan to implement it, as details of the massive security operation have yet to be worked out. A month before the election there is still confusion over a host of technical points -- including who will carry the ballot boxes to counting points and whether security forces will be positioned within the perimeter of polling stations. The final plan is the subject of wrangling between the South African Police and the IEC. The SAP has been pushing a plan it developed for policing the election late last year, but which has come under fire from policing experts as "inadequate". The IEC is trying to work out the necessary improvements with the SAP. "The commissioners are meeting frequently with the police to ensure the safety of the elections and the monitors," said Peter Wilson, head of accreditation and logistics for the IEC's monitoring directorate. There is also a wrangle about who will command the state security forces. The IEC does not have jurisdiction over the SAP or the SADF, although they will form the backbone of security operations and will have to operate under the banner of the commission at the polling stations. The SADF dodged polling station duty rather than place its soldiers under the command of either the police or the IEC. As with all security issues, the IEC can only make recommendations to the TEC [Transitional Executive Council] which must take the final political decision on how to order the deployment of security forces. This means any plan the IEC comes up with is likely to be the subject of time-consuming political haggling in the TEC. Sources say the IEC has become the TEC's chief source of information about what is happening on the ground because the TEC cannot rely on its own intelligence sub-council -- which is supposed to be keeping the TEC informed about security problems. "The members of the subcouncil are so busy keeping information from each other, they cannot get a decent briefing together on anything. The TEC has had to rely on the IEC for objective information," said a security adviser. Without the IEC to tell it where the problems are, the TEC would not be able fulfill its main task of ensuring all parties are allowed to freely campaign throughout the country. The IEC has been able to feed the TEC with details of problems on the ground because it is flooding the country with monitors who will watch every step of the election process -- from the issue of identity documents to monitoring voting at every polling station.
