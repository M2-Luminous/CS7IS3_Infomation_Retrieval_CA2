On his arrival at the venue--CSU headquarters in Munich--Bavarian Prime Minister Edmund Stoiber criticized the CDU sister party. The CSU will ask at the meeting, which is to deal with preparations for the election campaign, "what position" CDU politicians such as Heiner Geissler, [Bundestag President] Rita Suessmuth, and Friedbert Pflueger, who will "block" decisions by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, would have, Stoiber said. He has also heard too little about how the CDU intends to integrate "the democratic right," Stoiber added. In this context, questions must be asked about the consequences of the fact that, in the meantime, more than half a million work permits have been issued to foreigners. "Unemployment is being imported," Stoiber said. Theo Waigel, CSU chairman and federal finance minister, said the SPD [Social Democratic Party] was the main opponent in the coming election debates and that the FDP [Free Democratic Party] was a "competitor." He said the CSU will tell even the CDU what it thinks when necessary. CSU General Secretary Erwin Huber said he is confident that "a closing of ranks between the CDU and CSU" will come about at the meeting.
