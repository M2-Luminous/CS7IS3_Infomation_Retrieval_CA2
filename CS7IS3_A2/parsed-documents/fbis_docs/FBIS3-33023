It was shortly before 1800. It was becoming dark in Chiapas State and in the rest of Mexico. Absalon stepped onto a rural road escorted by four or five members of the Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN]. He was received by an International Red Cross [IRC] official who then led him to Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation; and to Bishop Samuel Ruiz, the mediator in this conflict. This has been the first step that sets the basis for what could become a dialogue for reconciliation and peace in Chiapas, for a dialogue in Chiapas. Absalon Castellanos has been in contact with the media. More than 250 journalists left early from San Cristobal Las Casas to be at a point on the door step of the Lacandon jungle. This is what Castellanos said: [Begin recording] [Castellanos] The IRC has just given me a medical examination. I want to say that I wish to see Chiapas in peace and calm, with everybody working for progress. [Ruiz] Several persons were unable to see the sequence of events here. Mr. Manuel Camacho Solis came earlier and the Red Cross preceded us adequately. Both of us, Camacho Solis and myself, witnessed the thorough examination that the IRC conducted on General Castellanos, whom we have found to be in better health than ourselves. General Castellanos himself has affirmed that he was treated well and that he is in good health, and we have verified that. The Zapatist Army delivered the general to Dr. Meyer, of the IRC. Dr. Meyer then delivered the general to me, and I delivered General Castellanos to Camacho Solis who now will take the general to his family, if this is what is decided. I have proposed administering the ashes now since today is Ash Wednesday and it is also the day this event has taken place. We will do it in a symbolic fashion. [end recording] This is what happened a few minutes ago in Guadalupe Tepeyac, Chiapas State. The general has been delivered to his relatives. Some of his closest relatives were present for this undoubtedly moving ceremony. The general and his wife, Elsy Herreria, embraced each other. Their children, Absalon and Oscar, who is an Institutional Revolutionary Party delegate in Quintana Roo State, received the former state governor with tears in their eyes. Camacho Solis and Bishop Ruiz will go with Castellanos to a military post where a helicopter is waiting to take them to a hospital. [Paris AFP in Spanish at 0051 on 17 February reports that the guerrillas announced that as of Thursday they will stop collecting the war tax "in the locations where it has been implemented" in the State of Chiapas, as "an additional action to create an appropriate climate" for the dialogue.]
