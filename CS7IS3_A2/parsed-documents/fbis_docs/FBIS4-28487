FBIS4-28487 "dreas112__a94022" FBIS-EAS-94-112-A Daily Report 9 Jun 1994 ANNEX Japan Industries Dissatisfied With New FTC Guidelines Industries Dissatisfied With New FTC Guidelines OW0906112394 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 9 Jun 94 Morning Edition p 7 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0906112394 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] A draft plan for the revision of business merger guidelines compiled by the Fair Trade Commission [FTC] is advantageous to companies in that it makes it easier for them to formulate business strategies for the promotion of restructuring (business reconstruction) through a merger. The current guidelines are under criticism because "they are so abstract that it is difficult to understand in what cases firms will be allowed to enter a merger." Responding to this criticism, the FTC has decided to review the guidelines. However, because the revision is not aimed at easing standards for authorizing mergers, the industries will likely air their dissatisfaction. The draft plan has clarified that "a 25-percent market share" is a standard for classifying mergers subject to FTC examination. Although the clarification is to remove the misunderstanding that "a 25-percent market share is a criterion for approving of mergers," this will also help allay the anxiety of companies planning mergers. The draft plan has also mentioned that import volume will be taken into consideration in deciding whether or not a merger violates the Antimonopoly Law. This will enable firms to tell the FTC that "although our market shares are high at present, competition will not be restricted as a result of our merger because we plan to increase imports from now on." Meanwhile, some industries are calling for clarifying the guidelines and easing classification standards to improve circumstances for restructuring. However, the FTC is negative about complying with this call, saying: "If we relax standards, competition will be restricted in many cases as a result of mergers."
