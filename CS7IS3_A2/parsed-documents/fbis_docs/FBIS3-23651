But actually, according to a Defense Ministry estimate 6.5 trillion were transferred by the Ministry of Finance in 1993. If we consider that the minimum amount needed by the Ministry of Defense was over R10 trillion, the Defense Ministry's needs for 1993 were only 65 percent satisfied. IN 1993 THE RUSSIAN DEFENSE MINISTRY ACCOUNTS were credited with monetary resources from the sale of freed military property (besides arms and ammunition): In the domestic market--R6.5 billion; in the foreign market--$6.4 million U.S. One thousand six hundred apartments were acquired in 1993 on these proceeds. THE RF LAW "ON THE STATUS OF SERVICEMEN", which foresees a number of benefits, guarantees and advantages for servicemen and for citizens discharged from military services and for their families, was enacted as of January 1993. However, some of the benefits and advantages foreseen by the legislation have not been enacted because the mechanism of their implementation has not yet been found at the government level. They include: - supplementary transportation benefits; - payment of monetary compensation when going on leave; - property insurance for servicemen; - preferential loans for housing construction; - sale of apartments and individual dwellings to servicemen on advantageous terms; - discounts in paying for installation and use of apartment telephones, and other benefits. MONEY WAS NOT ALLOCATED PROMPTLY, or in full volume, to finance capital and housing construction. The Russian Finance Ministry's debt was carried over from one month to the next. In January 1993 it was R8.3 billion. By the end of the year the Ministry of Finance was R147 billion behind in transferring the amount foreseen in the federal budget for capital construction by the RF Ministry of Defense. And when real growth of prices of construction materials is accounted for, the figure reaches R290 billion. Of the 61,700 apartments to be placed into operation with funds from the federal budget in 1993, only 50,000 apartments, or 81 percent of the plan, were made available. Allocation of R658 billion to housing construction and to the purchase of apartments was planned in 1993 (this is not counting outlays on construction of cultural and personal service facilities). That would have been 63 percent of the total allocations for housing construction by the Ministry of Defense in 1993. The actual amount transferred was R565 billion. ACCORDING TO DEFENSE MINISTER P. GRACHEV the overall numerical strength of the RF Army as of 1 December 1993 was 2,341,000 persons. Ratio of Contracting and Conscripted Servicemen in the RF Army Number of Number of Constricted Numerical Expenditure Contracting Servicemen and Ratio Ratio Servicemen and Monthly Expenditures Monthly Expenditures 1993 120,000 R15-20 1,300,000 R8 1/10 2/1 billion billion 1994 400,000 R60-70 900,000 R6.7 1/2 10/1 billion billion 1995-1997 750,000 About 750,000 R5 1/1 20/1 R100 billion billion Note: The table gives expenditures only on position and rank pay of servicemen. Prepared by R. Bykov THE MINIMUM PAY (1994) of contracting servicemen (privates, first rate classification) is over R110,000, the lowest classification (a ship petty officer aboard a submarine receives five times more). There are also a large number of significant benefits and extra payments, such that the total expenditures for contracting servicemen will exceed the figures presented in the tables by three or four times -- several trillion per year. LAST YEAR THE PAY AND ALLOWANCES of servicemen were indexed three times -- as of January, April and September. This year they were indexed as of 1 January. Because of the complex economic situation in the country the RF Government decided on several occasions to index the pay and allowances of servicemen 1-2 months late. This brought on complaints by many servicemen to different levels of authority regarding violation of Article 12 of the RF Law "On the Status of Servicemen." Thus, the minimum wage was increased by 1.81 times as of 1 July 1993, while the pay and allowances of servicemen were not indexed until 1 September 1993 -- that is, 2 months later. The present minimum wage -- R14,620 per month as opposed to R7,740 (a 1.9-time increase) -- was established as of 1 December by a presidential edict dated 5 December 1993, while pay and allowances of servicemen were indexed only as of 1 January of this year; that is, a month later.
