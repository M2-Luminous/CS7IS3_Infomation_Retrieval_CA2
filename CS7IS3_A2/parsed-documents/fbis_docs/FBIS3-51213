One of the main questions was: What political leader do you prefer? Here were the results: Armando Calderon Sol, 40.2 percent; Ruben Zamora, 22.2 percent; and Dr. Fidel Chavez Mena, 14.1 percent. According to this poll, Dr. Chavez Mena suffered a drop. We spoke directly and exclusively with Dr. Fidel Chavez Mena, presidential candidate for the Christian Democratic Party [PDC] this morning. Chavez Mena raised doubts about the Technical University poll's credibility because the students filled out the questionnaires themselves, which, in his opinion, could cloud the poll results. Dr. Chavez Mena says PDC-sponsored polls show both he and his party in second place. He called for public opinion to not be manipulated with polls like the university's.
