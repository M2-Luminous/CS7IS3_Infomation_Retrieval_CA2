This was stated by Oleg Davydov, the Russian minister of foreign economic relations, when he spoke today in the Moroccan city of Marrakech at a plenary meeting at the level of ministers of the GATT committee on trade negotiations. He expressed the hope that the principles of free trade and fair competition, which were endorsed by the results of the Uruguay round, will produce increased mutual trade between countries and on this basis a growth of national economies and the world economy as a whole. Russia, the minister went on to say, is interested in strengthening the multilateral trade system and also assumes that it will be able in the shortest possible time to become an integral part of the system. In striving to join GATT and the World Trade Organization (WTO), whose creation will be announced in Marrakech, Russia is pursuing absolutely specific practical goals and the realistic creation of more favorable conditions for its exports. Full membership of GATT is an essential condition for Russia's integration into the world economy, which is of particular importance for the country. The Russian minister noted that this process will seriously facilitate the speeding and deepening of market reforms in Russia on the basis of the experience amassed in GATT over the decades. In this connection the speaker on behalf of the Russian Government confirmed its firm intention to complete creating a market-oriented open economy at minimum social cost. Speaking about the Russian economic situation, Oleg Davydov said that in the space of just over two years fundamental changes have taken place in Russia. The state monopoly in foreign trade, which existed for over 70 years, has been dismantled in the process of economic liberalization. Administrative barriers with respect to imports have been lifted, and restrictions on export operations have been significantly decreased. The customs tariff is now being used as a basic instrument of Russian trade policy. The price mechanism and currency regulation have been liberalized to a considerable extent, and large-scale privatization is being implemented. Russia's aim is to enter the World Trade Organization. A flexible mechanism needs to be worked out to enable the process for its accession into GATT to be transformed into entry into the WTO. Russia's entry into the World Trade Organization will be an important event for others besides Russia. On the basis of a reasonable balance of rights and obligations, the sides reaching agreement will gain in the shape of Russia a capacious market of goods, services and capital. Even now, in the conditions of economic instability caused by the transition from a strict planned system to a liberal market system, we are seeing a great interest in cooperation with Russia, the minister noted. He stressed that the obligations which Russia will assume as a member of the WTO will be an additional guarantee of the stability and predictability of the conditions for doing business with it and for the access of foreign goods to its market. We hope that the Uruguay round was the last which our country observed from the sidelines, the Russian minister of foreign economic relations said.
