This law, in his view, and also the use of a Russian military presence and economic levers could help to resolve conflicts in hot spots of former Soviet republics. Zatulin told a RIA correspondent that such a regime could be granted to Byelorussia [Belarus], Turkmenia [Turkmenistan], Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan], Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. "I would not grant it to Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, while in the case of Ukraine it is necessary to hold appropriate talks at first," noted Zatulin. He further said that the committee he heads is now working on a declaration on principles of relations with former Soviet republics. The document is planned to be completed by parliamentary hearings on problems of fellow-countrymen in the near abroad, scheduled for the end of June.
