At his party's traditional Ash Wednesday meeting in Bayerbach, Lower Bavaria, Kinkel called for a "radical change of thinking" in labor market policy. Strikes and lock-outs are "a fist in the eye of the economic development"; in view of the high number of unemployed, all politicians must work to ensure the recovery of the economy. FRG Foreign Minister Kinkel called for a zero round in the public sector and a stop to the "galloping state debts," and he rejected tax increases for higher earners. The FDP politician said that "the old-style social state" is "unsocial, cannot be financed, and is counterproductive." It must be placed on a narrower but solid basis. The social state must not become a "milking cow," Kinkel stressed.
