PAC President Clarence Makwetu said the state of emergency involved the suspension of basic human rights and would not lead to a free and fair election. He said the aim was not to solve the problem of violence but to pressurize kwaZulu into talking. [Begin Makwetu recording] The decision of the TEC [Transitional Executive Council], the ANC, and the regime, to declare a state of emergency in kwaZulu-Natal is politically wrong and tragic. This can only exacerbate a social tragedy, that is, military, security power remains with the ruling regime. [end recording] Mr. Makwetu also said that the PAC wouldn't oppose a postponement of the April elections provided it applied to the whole country. He objected to the elections being postponed only in kwaZulu-Natal.
