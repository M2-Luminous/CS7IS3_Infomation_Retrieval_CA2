Pak Yong-su, chief delegate of the North side, abruptly insisted on "issuing a joint communique expressing both sides' intent before adopting an agreement for exchanging special envoys of South and North Korea." At the same time, North Korea "virtually" withdrew its demand for four preconditions of the envoy exchange. The four preconditions, including the abrogation of President Kim Yong-sam's remarks on the North's nuclear development, were nothing but "North Korea's devices" aimed at delaying the envoy exchange. It seems that North Korea is insisting on announcing a joint communique "hinting that South-North contacts for the envoy exchange are going smoothly" after allowing itself to withdraw the delaying devices because it wants to pave the way for the third round of North Korean-U.S. high-level talks, which will be held in about a week. In other words, North Korea intends to make it difficult for the ROK and U.S. Governments to postpone the third round of talks, and it also intends to create a pretext for spurning responsibility on the other side when the talks are actually delayed. Despite this effort by North Korea, it seems almost impossible for the third round of talks that are slated to be held in Geneva on 21 March, to go on as scheduled. Robert Gallucci, assistant secretary of state for political and military affairs and head of the U.S. delegation to North Korea-U.S. talks, clearly said that "the third round of talks will not be held unless the South-North envoy exchange is realized" in a series of consultations with the ROK Government before he left the ROK on 13 March. Of course, the ROK and U.S. Government authorities have not made the delay of 21 March North Korean-U.S. talks an established fact because, from a logical point of view, it is possible that after South and North Korea dramatically reach an agreement in their next contact slated for 16 March, either side's envoy will visit the other side before the 21 March Geneva talks. However, this can hardly become reality. Accordingly, the ROK and U.S. Governments seem to be making a policy in preparation for the possible delay of the third round of North Korean-U.S. talks in consequence of failure to exchange South and North Korean envoys prior to 21 March. As has been well known, the ROK and the United States have demanded the inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and the South-North envoy exchange as preconditions of the third round of North Korean-U.S. talks. The IAEA inspection is a precondition that can immediately result in international society's intervention such as sanctions by the UN Security Council. Time has proven that IAEA inspections of North Korea are being conducted at an acceptable level. If the IAEA inspection is completed satisfactorily before the end of this week, only the issue of envoy exchange will remain unresolved. It is the ROK and U.S. Governments' position that the third round of North Korean-U.S. talks cannot be held unless the envoy exchange is realized. If North Korean-U.S. talks, slated for 21 March, are delayed, North Korea will be held responsible for that since it has delayed the envoy exchange. Accordingly, North Korea is being pressed for time while the ROK and the United States comes into a composed position. The government plans to continue to promote the envoy exchange with patience even if it is not realized before 21 March. If it becomes completely impossible for North Korea and the United States to hold high-level talks on 21 March, the United States will probably notify North Korea of the delay of the third round of talks through the New York channel around 16 March, when the next South-North contact will be held. The third round of North Korean-U.S. talks are likely to be delayed until after mid-April because the South-North envoy exchange should be realized before the talks. This can be expected, however, only when North Korea gently accedes to the envoy exchange, even if it is late, as well as agrees to the delay of the North Korean-U.S. high-level talks. If North Korea strongly opposes this, it is possible that the North Korean nuclear issue will again temporarily fall into a phase of harsh confrontation. If IAEA inspections uncover a "serious-level" of diversion of nuclear materials for other purposes, that may bring about full-pledged intervention by the international community.
