The loan will be used to "help preserve biodiversity in five key nature reserves in China and reduce soil erosion and flooding," the bank said in a statement. The project, totaling 356 million dollars, is expected to generate six billion dollars in China's domestic wood products in 33 years, the bank said. China is the world's third largest consumer of timber, using 300 million cubic meters a year. Burgeoning demand and limited supply are creating a worsening imbalance. About 500,000 hectares of forest area are lost each year in China. The loan will build 620,000 hectares of managed timber plantations, set up 280,000 hectares of multiple-use forests, strengthen biodiversity conservation, and support technology transfer, the bank said.
