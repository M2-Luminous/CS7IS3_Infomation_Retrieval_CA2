Russia is still, apparently, a superpower and has always been an important element of the Euro-Asian balance. "It is in the interest of the whole of Europe to ensure that this continues to be the case," said Baudys. Baudys made this statement at yesterday's seminar on "Security in Central Europe--The Public's Views." The three-day seminar, which is being held in Prague, is organized by the North Atlantic Assembly in cooperation with the Czech Chamber of Deputies. The defense minister also said that it is most important for European security to ensure that cooperation between the North Atlantic Alliance (NATO) and the former socialist bloc develops not only on a military basis, but, first and foremost, on an economic one. The foundation stone for peace apparently is economic prosperity. According to Baudys, the Visegrad Group should not be perceived as a political instrument for exerting pressure on NATO because Visegrad cannot be an alternative to or preparation for membership in the pact. "The issue of entry into NATO is so important that comprehensive economic, political, and social reforms within the state must be given precedence in dealing with it," said Baudys. In connection with the Partnership for Peace plan, the minister referred to the Czech presentation document, which contains offers of exercise areas, training, and so on. According to Baudys, the first step in this was the joint exercises with the Dutch marines. According to Deputy Foreign Minister Pavel Bratinka, who also took part in the conference, a Russian policy offensive is, on the other hand, now under way. "The possible renewal of Russia's influence in Europe can only be confronted by a consistent policy from NATO and the Western European Union," added Bratinka.
