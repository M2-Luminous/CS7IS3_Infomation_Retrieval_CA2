"What we have determined from this trip (to China) is that the site for the plant is known. The Chinese government has clearly made its choice known," Electricite de France (EDF) chairman Gilles Menage said in Hong Kong. "It will be situated practically in the same place -- three or four kilometers from the existing site," he said. But he added that the Chinese authorities have yet to spell out under what terms the plant would be built. EDF played a major role in building the 1,800-megawatt, twin-reactor Daya Bay complex, 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Hong Kong, and it is keen to play a role in the new venture. Publicly, China has yet to declare whether it will put the long-mooted second Guangdong nuclear plant at Lingao, five kilometers northeast of Daya Bay, or at Yangjiang, on the western side of the province. "Each site has its own advantages and disadvantages," the deputy head of public relations at Daya Bay, Chen Zhenyu, said at Sunday's formal launch of Daya Bay's first reactor, which Menage attended. The central government in Beijing is said to prefer Lingao, which independent-minded provincial leaders favor Yangjiang. EDF, a French state company that is world's biggest generator of electricity, was overall technical consultant at Daya Bay. Its staff is staying on to oversee the training of its Chinese personnel. Daya Bay's proximity to Hong Kong has aroused safety concerns in the territory, but EDF executives say that since its conception, Chinese officials have strived to match Western safety standards. Menage also said EDF was pursuing talks with Hong Kong's biggest utility, China Light and Power Co. Ltd. -- which owns 25 percent of Daya Bay -- on a possible joint venture of their own in China. "I believe that we may be able to say more in the coming weeks," he said. Hong Kong press reports last October said EDF and China Light were discussing a 2.5 billion US dollar joint venture to erect three 1,200-megawatt electric power stations in eastern Shandong province.
