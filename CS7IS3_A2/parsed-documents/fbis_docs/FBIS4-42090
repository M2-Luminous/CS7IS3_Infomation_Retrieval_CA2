Drought, last year's bad harvest, the lack of seeds, and the people's difficulties in moving about have only made matters worse for people. The threatening famine could be as devastating as that which laid Somalia to waste two years ago, according to Medecins Sans Frontieres [MSF], which has warned that humanitarian resupplying by air is becoming increasingly difficult. MSF Doctor Karim Lawabia spoke to Muriel Pomponne: [Begin recording] [Lawabia] One can say that if nothing is done by 30 May there will not be a single plane left to bring food to southern Sudan and people will be deprived of food. In reports from Juba, our colleagues at AICF [Association Internationale Contre la Faim] told us that the food situation in Juba was also tragic since the UN operation, Operation Lifeline Sudan, has almost put an end to the distribution of food on the government's side, that is, in the zones held by the Sudanese Government. Moreover, we are now expecting the rainy season, which makes air transport totally uncertain, and if nothing is done quickly, we--humanitarian organizations--may find ourselves in a position where we have to leave because we are unable to face up to the food situation. [Pomponne] You have to have agreements with the Sudanese Government in order to face up to the food situation, don't you? [Lawabia] The entire UN operation, Operation Lifeline Sudan, is taking place with the agreement of the Sudanese Government, this is obvious. As for non-governmental organizations, it is true that we do not necessarily need the agreement of the Sudanese Government, but it goes without saying that, if you want to reach the zones that need help, you have to travel for one and a half or two hours in Sudanese air space, and you need flight authorization from the Khartoum Government or one given to the UN operation. [Pomponne] Is action required very quickly? [Lawabia] Very, very quickly. [Pomponne] What is the deadline? [Lawabia] One month, even less. [end recording]
