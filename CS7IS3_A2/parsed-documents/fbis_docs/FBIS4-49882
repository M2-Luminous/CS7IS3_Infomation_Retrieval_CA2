The remark was made by Qian Qichen while addressing the opening of the symposium on the post-Cold War security situation in the Asia-Pacific region and its prospects here today. Dozens of scholars and strategic studies experts from the United States, Japan, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, Russia, India, Singapore, the Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam, and China were invited to participate in the symposium. Qian Qichen said: The overall international situation has moved toward relaxation since the Cold War, which had continued for almost half a century, came to an end. However, there are still severe turmoil and unceasing military conflicts in some regions. In contrast, the political situation in the Asia-Pacific area is rather stable, as the progress there towards multipolarity started rather early and the Cold War impact was drastically reduced. Moreover, most countries in the region have long since given priority to domestic economic development, which has helped bring about a virtuous circle of mutual promotion between political stability and economic development. Qian Qichen pointed out: The situation of relative political stability in the region is the result of the close cooperation and concerted efforts of the relevant countries, who should all treasure and continue to consolidate and develop the situation marked by peace, stability, and prosperity. He said: However, there are indeed some factors of instability in the Asia-Pacific region. Some of them are left-overs from the Cold War; others are issues that have come to the fore over the end of the Cold War; still others have been caused by failure to adapt to the changes in the post-Cold War situation in the areas of policies and ideology [zai zheng ce si xiang shang 0961 2398 4595 1835 1927 0006]. Qian Qichen pointed out: For peace, security, stability, and development in the Asia-Pacific region, it is necessary to attach importance to these issues and find a solution for them. He said: The Chinese Government holds that all countries in the region should base their relations with other countries entirely on the purposes and principles of the United Nations charter, the five principles of peaceful coexistence, and other universally recognized norms governing international relations. Mutual respect and cooperation on an equal footing between states should replace hegemonism and power politics. Peaceful negotiation, dialogue and consultation should replace the threat or use of force. Equality, mutual benefit and complementary activities should replace protectionism and economic sanctions in trade. Only in this way can the existing and potential unstable factors be brought under effective control and be removed altogether, so as to help maintain and develop the present situation of peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. Qian Qichen stressed: China is in favor of a variety of channels and levels of bilateral or multilateral dialogue on Asia-Pacific security. He said: In addressing the security issues of the region, it is necessary to proceed from the realities and particular needs of the Asia-Pacific region and its sub-regions, and to improve communications and enhance mutual confidence among various parties. Moreover, to bring about successful cooperation of the nations of the Asia-Pacific region on the issue of security, it is necessary to seek common ground while reserving differences, to seek truth from facts, and to refrain from imposing one's will on any country or on others when trying to solve an issue. During the symposium, which was organized by the China International Issues Research Center, the China Society of International Strategies, and the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, the participating scholars and experts are expected to focus on exchanging views on the security situation in the region; on the relations among China, Japan, the United States, and Russia and their security policies in the region; and on the ways and methods adopted by countries in the Asia-Pacific region to strengthen political and security cooperation among them.
