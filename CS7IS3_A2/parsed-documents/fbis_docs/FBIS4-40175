"Only this year there were five detentions of rather important recruited people, including by the British Secret Service", he told TASS on Wednesday adding that this proves that his service, which emerged after the collapse of the notorious KGB, is gradually reviving in its counterintelligence activities. As far as the fight against organised crime is concerned, Stepashin urged "extreme measures" and said that certain human rights violations are inevitable as mafia is becoming very strong. However, he stressed that "there will be no serious violations although certain mishaps are possible". He added that law enforcement agencies will work to defend the rights of the absolute majority of people and not of those "who believe that the law is not for them". Stepashin said that a real gangland war had begun in Russia. This is a war "of mafia clans, a war without rules when criminals use the latest means of human destruction". In such a situation extreme measures are necessary as "other ways of struggle do not exist". The Counter-Intelligence Service is going to sign a share-power and cooperation agreement with the Interior Ministry in the near future. Stepashin said four joint orders are being drafted which will share the powers and tasks of both agencies and promote their cooperation. The KGB and interior Ministry were always at odds in Soviet years arguing about who is the most important. Stepashin believes this should no longer happen. "It is time to end the contrapposition between the two agencies which is rooted in the past". He added that the "serious results" of the joint work of his agency, the Interior Ministry and the prosecutor's office will be known in four-six weeks.
