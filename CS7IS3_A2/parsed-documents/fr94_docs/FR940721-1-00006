FR940721-1-00006 FR940721-1-00003 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;SW&hyph;05&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives: McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Company and Hughes Helicopters, Inc. Model 369 and OH&hyph;6A Series Helicopters AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Company and Hughes Helicopters, Inc. Model 369 and OH&hyph;6A series helicopters equipped with certain main rotor (M/R) blade assemblies or certain M/R hub lead-lag assemblies, that currently requires repetitive inspections and checks for cracks. This action would require the same inspections as the superseded AD, but would eliminate pilot checks, expand the areas of inspection, and require the application of slippage marks on each M/R blade root fitting lug and related bushings to detect movement. This proposal is prompted by additional reports of cracks in the M/R blade root fittings, lugs, and adjacent blade skin, and movement of the root fitting bushings. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent failure of a M/R blade assembly or a M/R hub lead-lag link assembly, loss of a M/R blade, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. DATES: Comments must be received by September 6, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;SW&hyph;05&hyph;AD, 2601 Meacham Blvd., Room 663, Fort Worth, Texas 76137&hyph;4298. Comments may be inspected at this location between 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. The service information referenced in the proposed rule may be obtained from McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Company, Technical Publications, Bldg 530/B111, 5000 E. McDowell Road, Mesa, Arizona 85205&hyph;9797. This information may be examined at the FAA, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, 2601 Meacham Blvd., Room 663, Fort Worth, Texas. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Brent Bandley, Aerospace Engineer, Airframe Branch, ANM&hyph;123L, Northwest Mountain Region, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office, 3229 E.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Comments Invited Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of the proposed rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments, specified above, will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposals contained in this notice may be changed in light of the comments received. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the proposed rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report summarizing each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;SW&hyph;05&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;SW&hyph;05&hyph;AD, 2601 Meacham Blvd., Room 663, Fort Worth, Texas 76137&hyph;4298. Discussion On August 8, 1991, the FAA issued AD 91&hyph;17&hyph;04, Amendment 39&hyph;8003 (56 FR 42230, August 27, 1991), to require initial and repetitive inspections and checks of certain main rotor (M/R) blade assemblies and M/R hub lead-lag link assemblies for fatigue cracks and for loose bushings in the M/R blade lead-lag link lugs (lead-lag lugs). That action was prompted by two incidents involving a cracked M/R blade root fitting lug (root fitting lug). Bushing movement in the M/R blade lead-lag link lugs may have caused fatigue cracks in the lead lag link assemblies. The lead lag link assembly attaches to the M/R blade. Any cracks in the lead lag link assembly, the M/R blade, the MR blade root fitting, or any movement of the bushing, could create an unsafe condition. That condition, if not corrected, could result in failure of a M/R blade assembly or a M/R hub lead-lag link assembly, loss of a M/R blade, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. Since the issuance of that AD, additional incidents of cracks in the M/R blade root fitting (root fitting), and M/R blade skin have been reported. Additionally, the manufacturer has discovered that in some M/R blade assemblies, the M/R blade root fitting bushing (bushing) can loosen and contribute to fretting-induced fatigue cracking in the root fitting lug. The root fittings and M/R blade skins are parts of the M/R blade assembly. Therefore, McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Company issued a revised Service Information Notice No. HN&hyph;211.4, DN&hyph;51.6, EN&hyph;42.4, and FN&hyph;31.4 (SIN), dated January 27, 1993, that requested operators mark each root fitting lug and bushing with a slippage mark and thereafter inspect for slippage on each root fitting lug and bushing. The revised SIN, dated January 27, 1993, includes the M/R blade assembly and M/R hub lead-lag link assembly inspections contained in the preceding versions of the SIN, dated August 5, 1991.
