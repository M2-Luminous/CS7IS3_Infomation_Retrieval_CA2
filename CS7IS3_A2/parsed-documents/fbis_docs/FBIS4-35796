This attack, which targeted densely populated areas, showed total disregard for international conventions and charters. Israeli war planes yesterday launched air raids on several villages and towns north of Ba'labak, and these raids also caused extensive damage to property. Press reports indicate that the Israeli planes dropped large quantities of bombs and tried to land but were prevented from doing so by the Lebanese antiaircraft defense on the ground. [passage omitted] A source at the General People's Committee for Unity stated last week that the Israeli enemy is continuing its aggression against the Arab nation and is violating its sovereignty and territory with its military arsenal and weapons of destruction supplied by the West, mainly the U.S. Government, in a blatant defiance of all international resolutions. Moreover, their conspiratorial acts are stepped up whenever they want to impose further capitulation on the Arab regimes against the will of the masses, which reject defeat and surrender. The violations and the aggression taking place today against Lebanon's sovereignty and its Arab people must be an incentive for frustrating all attempts of capitulation and attempts to impose the fait accompli. It must also be an incentive for confronting this act of aggression with the responsibility required by the Arab charters, foremost the Joint Arab Defense Treaty, so that Lebanon is no longer a daily target for the aggression of the Israelis and their savage raids, whose aim is to attack civilians and break the strong spirit of resistance to the Israeli enemy and to the occupation. Proceeding from the constants of the great 1 September revolution and in accordance with the resolutions adopted by the Basic People's Congresses, which stressed the need to confront the continuous imperialist-backed Israeli aggression against the Arab nation, the General People's Committee for Unity in the Great Jamahiriyah condemns Israel's terrorism, which is manifested in its continued occupation of Arab territories, from southern Lebanon to the Golan Heights and in the Umm Rashrash [Elat] area. It also condemns its practice of aggression and its kidnapping of civilians, which nobody tries to prevent the Israeli entity from following. We also call for the implementation of the Arab charters and treaties to confront this situation.
