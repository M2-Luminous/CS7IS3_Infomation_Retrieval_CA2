FR940630-2-00142 FR940630-2-00110 [Release No. 34&hyph;34250; File No. SR&hyph;PHILADEP&hyph;93&hyph;02] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Philadelphia Depository Trust Company; Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of a Proposed Rule Change Concerning the PHILANET Terminal Communication System, the Voluntary Offer Instruction Service, and the Defender Security System June 23, 1994. Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 1 (``Act'') notice is hereby given that on August 17, 1993 the Philadelphia Depository Trust Company (``PHILADEP'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which Items have been prepared primarily by PHILADEP. The Commission is publishing this notice and order to solicit comments from interested persons and to grant accelerated approval of the proposed rule change. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The purpose of the proposed rule change is to obtain permanent approval for PHILADEP's PHILANET Terminal Communication System (``PHILANET'') and for PHILADEP's Voluntary Offer Instruction (``VOI'') service. PHILANET is an electronic communication system linking PHILADEP to its participants. The VOI service allows participants to electronically submit to PHILADEP's Reorganization Department through PHILANET instructions relating to voluntary corporate actions. PHILANET and the VOI service currently are being operated as temporarily approved pilot programs. The proposal also seeks approval of the installation of the Defender security system to PHILANET. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of and Statutory Basis for the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, PHILADEP included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. PHILADEP has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statements of the Purpose of and Statutory Basis for the Proposed Rule Change On December 30, 1983, the Commission approved File No. SR&hyph;PHILADEP&hyph;83&hyph;03 which approved PHILANET on a pilot basis. 2 The Commission has extended its approval of the pilot program several times. 3 On March 8, 1993, the VOI service was approved on a pilot basis as part of the PHILANET System. 4 2 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 20519 (December 30, 1983), 49 FR 966. (order granting temporary approval). 3 Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 27491 (November 30, 1989), 54 FR 50556, [SR&hyph;PHILADEP&hyph;89&hyph;02] (order granting temporary approval until March 31, 1990); 27863 (April 29, 1990), 55 FR 12762, [SR&hyph;PHILADEP&hyph;89&hyph;02] (order granting temporary approval until June 30, 1990); 28172 (July 3, 1990), 55 FR 28493, [SR&hyph;PHILADEP&hyph;89&hyph;02] (order granting temporary approval until July 31, 1990); 30362 (February 10, 1992), 57 FR 5921, [SR&hyph;PHILADEP&hyph;90&hyph;04] (order granting temporary approval until February 28, 1993); and 31959 (March 8, 1993), 58 FR 13658, [SR&hyph;PHILADEP&hyph;93&hyph;01] (order granting temporary approval until February 28, 1994). 4 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31959 (March 8, 1993), 58 FR 13658 [SR&hyph;PHILADEP&hyph;93&hyph;01] (order granting temporary approval until February 28, 1994). PHILADEP states it has operated PHILANET for ten years without experiencing any instances of unauthorized system access. PHILADEP continues to monitor the adequacy of current safeguards and to implement additional safeguards as necessary to minimize the risk of unauthorized access. PHILADEP has recently installed the Defender access management system, a dial-back data communications security program. Defender protects against unauthorized dial-up access to PHILANET and the VOI service by verifying that only authorized users from authorized locations have access. To access PHILANET, a participant must dial the Defender system and enter an assigned identification number. Defender then verifies the identification number and the time-of-day restrictions and dials the authorized location for that participant. Defender secures all dial-up lines (synchronous and asynchronous) of the PHILANET system. Audit records are generated for all accesses and configuration changes, and Defender incorporates the audit information into reports and graphs which assist in operating and maintaining proper security. B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition PHILADEP does not believe that PHILANET, the VOI service, or Defender will impose any inappropriate burden on competition. C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants or Others No comments on the proposal have been solicited or received. III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action Sections 17A(b)(3) (A) and (F) of the Act require that a clearing agency be organized and its rules designed to promote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions and to assure the safeguarding of securities and funds which are in the custody or control of the clearing agency or for which it is responsible. 5 The proposal enhances PHILADEP's capacity to facilitate the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions by providing participants with the ability to electronically communicate with PHILADEP. PHILANET along with the VOI service has enhanced securities processing, has reduced paper processing, and has reduced the use of tape transmissions. As a result, PHILADEP has been able to reduce the risk of data loss and delays in receiving and transmitting data. The Defender security system program should help prevent unauthorized access to PHILANET and VOI. 5 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1(b)(3) (A) and (F) (1988). PHILADEP has requested and the Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of the filing. PHILADEP has informed the Commission that PHILANET and the VOI service have been operating satisfactorily during the pilot phase. 6 The Defender system, which has been implemented and is already operating, appears to be an appropriate security measure for PHILADEP's data communication systems. In light of the above reasons for approving the proposal, the fact that PHILANET, VOI, and the Defender system have been operating satisfactorily for some time, and the fact that the Commission does not expect any adverse comments, the Commission believes it is appropriate to grant accelerated approval. 6 Supra note 4. IV. Solicitation of Comments Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of PHILADEP. All submissions should refer to File No. SR&hyph;PHILADEP&hyph;93&hyph;02 and should be submitted by July 21, 1994. V. Conclusion On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission finds that PHILADEP's proposed rule change is consistent with the Act and in particular with Section 17A of the Act. It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 7 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;PHILADEP&hyph;93&hyph;02) be, and hereby is, approved. 7 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988).
