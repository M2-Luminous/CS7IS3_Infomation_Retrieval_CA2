FBIS4-6211 "dreas075_j_94008" FBIS-EAS-94-075 Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 Indonesia Further Reports on Labor Strikes, Ethnic Unrest Further Reports on Labor Strikes, Ethnic Unrest Anti-Chinese Sentiment High BK1804130094 Hong Kong AFP in English 1012 GMT 18 Apr 94 BK1804130094 Hong Kong AFP English BFN [Text] Medan, Indonesia, April 18 (AFP) -- North Sumatra' main city of Medan was returning to normal Monday after workers' protests in which one businessman died, but anti-ethnic Chinese sentiment was still apparent. Most businesses were back in operation and traffic had returned to normal but a businessman said "there are still some worries" and said that many of his women colleagues and employees were still being brought to and from works by male relatives. The number of security officials deployed in strategic areas in the city, including shopping areas, was increased to 3,000 from 2,000 Sunday following rumours that students might join the protests, a witness said. The witness added that most workers involved in the protests had yet to return to work. Pamphlets circulated in private by an organization claiming to be "an indigenous group", called on Medan residents to rid the city of ethnic Chinese whom they said "destroy Indonesia's economy and destroy the moral of officials by among others, colluding with officials to get credits." This was a reference to the case of the state-owned Bank Pembangunan Indonesia (Bapindo), which suffered losses of up to 613 million dollars after issuing credits without proper collaterals and procedures following alleged collusions between high-ranking officials and ethnic Chinese businessman Eddy Tansil. Labour protests in North Sumatra started Thursday, involving tens of thousands of workers who, among other demands, urged the government to increase wages and recognize the right of workers to organize. At present the government only recognizes the All Indonesia Workers Union (SPSI). The protests, which continued Friday on a larger scale, degenerated into an anti-Chinese riot and an ethnic Chinese factory owner, July Kristanto, was killed as scores of shops and factories were vandalized. The Chinese, who make up about one-third of Medan's 1.5 million population, are widely resented in Indonesia because of their economic power. The REPUBLIKA daily Sunday quoted an unidentified businessman here as saying the riots had forced several ethnic Chinese businessmen to flee to Singapore and other countries. Medan District Military Commander, Lieutenant Colonel Agus Ramadan, said that four battalions totalling about 2,600 security personnel had been deployed in the area in anticipation of further "anti-ethnic Chinese demonstrations". The military said that about 120 people had been arrested for alleged involvement in murder, vandalism and arson, but that all but 20 had since been released. A Vice-Chairman of the Sejahtera (Prosperous) independent labour union (SBSI), Ghufron, said in Jakarta Monday that the union had together with eight other non-governmental organizations, organized Thursday's demonstration but denied inciting the demonstrators to violence. An SBSI official dispatched to Medan on a fact-finding mission, reported that several local thugs had admitted to being paid by "certain parties" to manipulate the strike by initiating vandalism and attacking people," another SBSI Vice-Chairman, Sunarti, said. Sunarti declined to elaborate until the fact finding mission had been completed. "The workers detained in the wake of the strike should be immediately released," Sunarti said, adding that the government should also "be capable of arresting and punishing those who have consciously manipulated the strike with violence." The union said that 78 people were still detained by police in Medan, including the union's local chapter secretary and treasurer and the wife of a union secretary. The protest which spread to two nearby provincial towns Sunday, were reported to be continuing Monday in one of them, Siantar, although on a much smaller scale, an SBSI executive said.
