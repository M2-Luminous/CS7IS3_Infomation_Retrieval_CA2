With just four days to go until the cameras beam the two leaders into the living rooms of millions, election image-makers on both sides have expressed jitters about the high-risk encounter. A bad performance by either leader could cost him thousands of vital votes from those still undecided -- perhaps even determining whether or not the ANC will get the 66 percent vote it needs to write the constitution on its own. While Mr Mandela will project the image of a stately saint, there are those in his campaign team who fear he may be too stiff and long-winded to cope with the strict time limits. ANC insiders believe Mr Mandela appears uncomfortable on television, often insisting on buttoning up his jacket in the correct old school way and failing to make eye contact with viewers by looking into the camera. And NP [National Party] election guru's are fearful that Mr Mandela will launch a strong personal attack, which could unnerve President De Klerk, who has often said he prefers playing the ball to playing the man. The ANC considers the debate to be the most crucial event between the two leaders so far -- even more important than the showdown at Codesa 1. "It epitomises the climax of this whole election campaign in which people will have to make a choice between oppression and despair and democracy and a better life," spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa said. Mr Mamoepa said the debate had the power to swing votes, but the ANC was confident Mr Mandela would come out tops. "Obviously we don't think for one split second that our president can fluff it," he said. Mr Mandela is taking seriously preparations for the debate, leaving nothing to chance. On Wednesday, he will spend an entire day with senior members of the National Executive Committee being briefed on issues, and deciding which ones to project. They will even decide on what he will wear -- dark suit and certainly no grey shoes. The preparations will not include matters of presentation, apart from the cautionary plea -- "keep it short and concise, please Madiba". Like all ANC candidates, Mr Mandela has already been through a course in television technique. He has had to undergo mock interviews in front of a television camera where a room full of people have fired questions at the candidate. They assess the performance later. NP election guru Martinus van Schalkwyk is equally upbeat about Mr De Klerk: "He's really a natural. Of course, we will prepare him, but because he's a natural, we won't over prepare him," he says. But he would give no details on the preparation. [passage omitted]
