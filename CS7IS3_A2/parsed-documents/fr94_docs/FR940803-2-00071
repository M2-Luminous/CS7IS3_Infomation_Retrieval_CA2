FR940803-2-00071 FR940803-2-00058 8. The Trust does not expect that it will recognize significant taxable gain on its contribution of cash and securities to Multimedia in exchange for shares of Multimedia. Multimedia has been advised by counsel that the distribution of shares of Multimedia to Trust shareholders likely will be a taxable event for Trust shareholders and, under certain circumstances, will be a taxable event for the Trust. However, the Transaction is not expected to increase significantly the total amount of taxable distributions received by Trust shareholders for the year in which the Transaction is consummated and is not expected to result in the recognition of significant taxable gain by the Trust. 9. The costs of organizing Multimedia and effecting the distribution of Multimedia's shares to the Trust's shareholders, including the fees and expense of counsel and accountants and printing, listing, and registration fees, are estimated to be approximately $250,000 and will be borne by Multimedia. The Trust will bear the costs of soliciting its shareholders' approval of the Transaction. The costs incurred in connection with the application for exemptive relief will be allocated between the Trust and Multimedia on the basis of their net assets, after giving effect to the Transaction. Costs incurred in connection with the organization of Multimedia will be amortized on a straight-line basis for a five-year period beginning at the commencement of operations of Multimedia. In addition, Multimedia will incur operating expenses on an ongoing basis, including legal, auditing, transfer agency, and custodian expenses that, when aggregated with the fees payable by the Trust for similar services after the distribution, will likely exceed the fees currently payable by the Trust for those services. It is not expected that the Transaction will have significant effect on the annual expenses of the Trust as a percentage of its assets. Applicants' Legal Analysis 1. The Trust may be viewed as an affiliated person of Multimedia under section 2(a)(3) of the Act since the Trust will own 100 percent of Multimedia's voting securities until the consummation of the Transaction. Multimedia may similarly be considered an affiliated person of the Trust since 100 percent of Multimedia's voting securities will be owned by the Trust. The Trust and Multimedia also may be viewed as affiliated persons of each other to the extent that they may be deemed to be under the common control of GFI. 2. Section 17(a)(1) of the Act makes it unlawful, among other things, for any affiliated person of a registered investment company to sell any securities or other property to the registered company. Section 17(a)(2) of the Act makes it unlawful, among other things, for such an affiliated person to purchase securities or other property from the registered company. 3. As a result of the affiliation between the Trust and Multimedia, section 17(a)(1) would prohibit the Trust's ``sale'' to Multimedia of a portion of the Trust's assets and Multimedia's ``sale'' to the Trust of securities issued by Multimedia, although the latter transaction arguably may be excepted by section 17(a)(1)(B). Section 17(a)(2) would prohibit Multimedia's ``purchase'' from the Trust of such portion of the Trust's assets. It is also possible that section 17(a) may apply with respect to the Trust's pro rata distribution of Multimedia securities to any Trust shareholder holding more than 5% of Trust shares. 4. Applicants request an exemption pursuant to section 17(b) of the Act from the provisions of section 17(a) of the Act in order to permit the Trust to effect the Transaction. Section 17(b) authorizes the SEC to issue such an exemptive order if certain conditions are met. 5. Applicants also seek an order under section 17(d) and rule 17d&hyph;1 thereunder. Section 17(d) and rule 17d&hyph;1 thereunder generally prohibit, among other things, transactions in which a registered investment company and any affiliated person of such a company may be deemed to be acting jointly. Applicants request an order pursuant to rule 17d&hyph;1 to the extent that the participation of the applicants in the Transaction may be deemed to constitute a prohibited joint transaction. 6. Applicants assert that the terms of the Transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are fair and reasonable and involve no element of overreaching. Applicants state that the proposed sale by the Trust of a portion of its assets to Multimedia in exchange for the securities of Multimedia will be based on the fair value of those assets as computed on the day of the proposed transfer. Applicants further state that such assets are anticipated to consist largely or exclusively of cash and short-term fixed income instruments and thus will likely pose few, if any, issued with respect to valuation. Similarly, applicants assert that Multimedia stock distributed by the Trust in the Transaction will be valued based on the value of Multimedia's assets. ``Value'' for those purposes will be determined in accordance with the provisions of section 2(a)(41) of the Act and rule 2a&hyph;4 thereunder. 7. Applicants state that the Transaction will be consistent with stated investment policies of the Trust and Multimedia as fully disclosed to shareholders. The distribution of Multimedia shares will not change the position of the Trust's shareholders with respect to the underlying investments that they then own; such investments simply will be held through two closed-end non-diversified investment companies with the same investment objectives rather than one. Thus, the effect of the Transaction is consistent with the information contained in past disclosure documents of the Trust. A proxy statement/prospectus of the Trust and Multimedia will be used, following the issuance of the exemptive relief, to solicit the approval of the Trust shareholders of the Transaction. Moreover, the Trust's shareholders will have the opportunity to vote on the Transaction after having received extensive disclosure concerning the Transaction.
