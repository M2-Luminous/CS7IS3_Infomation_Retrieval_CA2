But its sports officials changed perspective to look into the headache on Tuesday [5 April] for a cure. An Anti-Doping China'94 seminar was held to arouse the attention of all those who call the shots in sporting activities in the country's 30 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions. Also present at the seminar were the principals from all China's physical education institutions and the top officials from its ministerial sports associations. Central warning was sounded to alert freewheeling athletes. Wu Shaozu, director of the State Commission for Sports and Physical Culture, emphasized doping controls through clear stipulation, tight check and harsh penalty. "Actions must be taken," said the sports minister who took his first trip abroad to attend the Second World Anti-Doping Congress in Moscow in 1989. The number of positive cases reported on Chinese athletes in national and international events is appalling to the central control of the country's sports mechanism. From a Chinese markswoman failing her test during a World Cup meet in late 1987 up till January this year, 33 Chinese were tested positive for performance-enhancing substances, mainly anabolic steroids. These athletes were in 13 sports of shooting, speed skating, modern pentathlon, track and field, volleyball, swimming, wrestling, judo, sporting acrobatics, canoeing, weightlifting, boxing and rhythmic gymnastics. Among the caught dopers were world and Olympic champions as well as global and continental record setters. "We cannot afford to remain passive in merely detecting and penalizing them," said Yuan Weimin, vice-sports minister and director of China's anti-doping committee set up in July 1992 as a subcommittee under the National Olympic Committee. Yuan said that China first conducted doping tests nationwide in 1988 and built an IOC-approved doping control laboratory the following year. "But each year there always appear athletic drug abusers to tarnish China's sports achievement," said Yuan. After six years of trials and errors, the Chinese sports commission decided to take an active role. "We are shifting focus from detection to education and prevention," said Wu Tuesday. "It's because there are still people who slight the works of the anti-doping committee," Yuan said. He recalled that China launched its first intensive anti-doping effort prior to the Barcelona Olympics when pamphlets were published on moral and medical side-effects of drug abuse. Yuan's committee has written down a stipulation of 15 rules concerning banned substances and later added rules concerning nutrition food and beverage. "China's principle in developing sports is to better the physique of the entire population," he explained. Wu hit home the key point of the seminar when he said that a decree in his name would soon be issued to draw the line between medical treatment and performance-enhancing build-up; between individual venture and collaboration among athletes, doctors, coaches and even officials. Penalties, Wu ordered, will be from moral criticism to disciplinary and even legal actions. Yang Tianle, China's member on the IOC Medical Commission who gave an in-depth lecture on anti-doping Tuesday, added still another line between intentional activity and medical illiteracy. Now the lines have been drawn between the do's and don'ts in China's anti-doping campaign, offenders, be they individual athletes or collaborative teams, will be penalized as severely as international federations do or maybe more so to thwart the practice among the Chinese, Wu concluded.
