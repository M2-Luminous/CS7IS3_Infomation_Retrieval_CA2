The board of directors of the Pro-Venezuela Association, a Venezuelan nationalistic organization presided over by former Presidency Secretary Ramon Espinoza, expressed its solidarity during a visit to President Rafael Caldera at Miraflores Palace. In statements to reporter Vicente Briceno, Espinoza said cited the adopted measures will resolve the economic crisis. [Begin Espinoza recording] Regarding these policies, we simply suggested it was convenient to pay part of the internal debt with the private sector and certain public entities, other than the Central Bank, with funds from privatization; this would free up 40 percent of the budget appropriation destined to make interest payments on the debt. In monetary terms, this represents approximately 140 billion bolivares, which could be earmarked for social spending in 1995, and to fill the gap left over by the tax on bank debits, which will cease to exist on 30 December 1994. We are calling for the need to revise monetary and financial policy, particularly regarding interest rates. It is impossible to reactivate the production sector and bring new investments with such high interest rates. We also suggested it is convenient to redirect the problem of foreign currency to purchase capital and intermediate goods and [words indistinct] for production, so we can reactivate the production apparatus. If we are unable to reactivate the production apparatus, it would be difficult for banks in general and the financial sector to recover their capacity for intermediation and recover their condition as strong institutions to finance significant projects.
