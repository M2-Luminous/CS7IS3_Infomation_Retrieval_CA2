Dr. Budi Trisulo, Mr. Alatas' personal physician, confirmed yesterday that the 61-year old foreign minister had been hospitalized but declined to say more. ANTARA National News Agency quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Irawan Abidin as saying that doctors have ordered Mr. Alatas, a heavy smoker, to take a complete rest for at least two weeks. That would mean that Mr. Alatas, who was appointed foreign minister in 1988, would be unable to attend a meeting of the Indonesia-Malaysia joint ministerial commission in Kuala Lumpur. He had also been scheduled to fly from Malaysia to Egypt to attend a meeting of the Nonaligned Movement's foreign ministers. A key point on the Cairo agenda is the question of who succeeds Indonesia next year as chairman of the 110-strong movement.
