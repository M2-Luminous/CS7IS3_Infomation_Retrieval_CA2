During his new year inspection tour here, Kim asked Inchon officials to try to bolster the role of Inchon as the gateway to the capital area taking advantage of its location and such facilities as an international airport being built and a modern harbor. The president said that though some people demand re-discussion of the Uruguay Round agreement, it is impossible to have new Uruguay Round [UR] talks now that the talks have already been completed with 117 countries of the world. After his visit to the Inchon City Hall, President Kim dropped into the Daewoo Motor Co. in northern Inchon, where he took lunch together with 1,200 Daewoo workers at a company cafeteria. During his call at the Kyonggi Province administration in Suwon, President Kim told Governor Yun Se-tal to be especially careful about protecting the sources of the 20 million capital zone people's household water. Kim especially suggested that marking poles be placed at all waste water displacement ducts so that nearby villagers could know the state of waste water disposition by plants. From Suwon, President Kim drove to a high-tech pilot farming estate at Chongbuk-myon, Pyongtaek-kun.
