The allocation was announced by Australia development cooperation minister, Gordon Bilney, who expressed concern that new mines were being laid by both goverment forces and the Khmer Rouge. He said mines were being laid without adequate recording of their locations. Mr. Bilney said land mines threaten food production because they prevented about 30 percent of farmland from being used.
