The ministry said that the combined foreign purchase of these CBs will be set at 30 percent and individual foreigners can buy up to 5 percent of a single company CBs. Like stock investment, foreigners seeking to buy Korean bonds must open an account at foreign exchange banks and securities companies and get an investment registration card from the regulators. Even if foreigners have been issued an investment registration card from Korean regulators for their stock investment in Seoul stocks, they must separately get a card from them for bond investment, the ministry said. Foreigners can theoretically invest in both stocks and bonds simultaneously from July 1. Foreigners must trade these stocks only through the Korea Stock Exchange. But 98 percent of all Korean bonds are traded in the over-the-counter (OTC) market. They must sell their Korean bonds only to Koreans. Trading among foreigners outside the exchange is prohibited, the MOF said. CBs issued only by small-and medium-sized firms listed on the Korea Stock Exchange without payment guarantee from financial institutions will be available to foreigners. These CBs are regarded as the most risky, unattractive and illiquid of all bonds available here. Non-Koreans can also buy state and public bonds that are designated by the Securities Supervisory Board. The maturity of these bonds is more than five years. They can not buy state and public bonds unless the issuers make formal request to the regulators. All bonds foreigners buy must be kept at the Korea Securities Depositories, a semi-state agency which is in charge of safekeeping all kinds of marketable securities, until they sell them to Koreans. Foreigners can freely remit investment money and income accruing from their bond investments in Korea. But the government retains the right to restrict the cash remittance exceptionally in emergency cases, which may not take place, ministry officials said. Foreigners who buy CBs issued by small businesses will be fully guaranteed to convert them into underlying equities at the conversion date, the MOF said. But they will be told to sell part of their holdings if the aggregate foreign stock ownership exceeds 15 percent. Foreigners holding more than 3 percent of any listed company will be told immediately to sell their beyond-ceiling portion, it said. Under the limited market-opening steps, foreigners can buy 6.9 billion won worth of CBs issued by small-and medium-sized firms and they can initially buy 10 billion won worth of public bonds in September, which are issued by the Chollanam-to province to finance its container yard construction. The amount is quite a peanut of Korea's 140 billion dollar bond market, a Western broker here said. He and other foreign brokers said Korea initially put on sale "rotten vegetables" unattractive to Koreans. Fresh vegetables (guaranteed bonds with higher return) will be off-limit to foreigners for the time being. Korea opened 10 percent of the stock market and announced the initial opening of less than 0.02 percent of the bond market. The stock market (120 trillion won in market capitalization) is larger than the bond market (111 trillion won). But they added that it is meaningful that Korea finally starts to open its bond market although they do not know when additional bond- market openings will be made. The government has a justifiable reason to be cautious in the opening of the bond market because of wide differences in interest rates between home and abroad, government officials and even many foreign bankers here said. A full-scale opening will result in an influx of huge amounts of foreign capital, which will jeopardize the nation's monetary, foreign exchange and macroeconomic management, a Ministry of Finance official said. The government has not specified when and to what extent the bond market-opening will be made additionally. But many analysts here view that the bond market-opening will be made only after the domestic interest rates fall to the significant level and the nation's foreign exchange and capital flow restrictions are set free, possibly after 1997.
