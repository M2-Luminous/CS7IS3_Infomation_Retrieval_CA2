He qualified the recent Azeri radio allegations that Armenia is holding 3500 Azeri prisoners of war, as "another lie." According to Martoian, 5 Azeris were captured "when staging armed encroachment on Armenia's borders," and 11 when trying to cross Armenian territory from Azerbaijan to Nakhichevan. Moreover, the Defence Ministry spokesman denied the Azeri Foreign Ministry's assertions that there are concentration camps in Armenia. As Martoian said, last year Armenia unilaterally returned to Azerbaijan 16 prisoners of war and 60 civilians from Kelbajar District in Azerbaijan, who had taken refuge in the canyons of Vardeni District in Armenia.
