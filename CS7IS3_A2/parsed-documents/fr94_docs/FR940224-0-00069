FR940224-0-00069 FR940224-0-00013 405 KAR 12:001 KRC objects to the proposed definition of ``willfully and willful violation'' because it appears to impose a higher burden for demonstrating the willfulness of a violation than does the Federal counterpart at 30 CFR 843.5. The State's definition was previously considered and approved by OSM in a Federal Register notice dated October 1, 1992 (57 FR 45295). In that approval, the Director observed ``[T]he Federal regulations provide separate definitions for ``willfully'' at 30 CFR 846.5, and ``willful violation'' at 30 CFR 701.5 and 843.5. Unlike the Federal definition of ``willful violation'', Kentucky's proposed combined definition does not stipulate that the person who committed the act or omission must have intended the result that actually occurs. However, since Kentucky's proposed definition includes all intentional acts and omissions, it will necessarily include all acts and omissions specified in the Federal definitions. Because Kentucky's proposed combined definition will result in sanctions and penalties no less stringent than those resulting from the separate Federal definitions, the Director finds that the proposal is no less effective than the Federal regulations.'' Based upon the same reasoning as discussed above, the Director is approving the proposed addition of the definition at 405 KAR 12:001(30). 405 KAR 12:010 KRC has raised two concerns regarding the reduction in inspection frequency proposed in section 3(5). KRC feels that the proposal is ambiguous as to whether or not a finding of site stability must precede any reduction of inspection frequency. In response to this concern, the State, in its Statement of Considerations dated August 13, 1993 (Administrative Record No. KY&hyph;1333), pointed out that ``[A]fter a notice of temporary cessation is filed, the regulations require the cabinet to conduct partial inspections until the cabinet determines that the permit area is sufficiently stable with respect to mass stability, erosion, revegetation, water quality, and other reclamation requirements so that quarterly complete inspections will provide adequate inspection of the permit area.'' OSM feels that the State's explanation of its interpretation of this regulation resolves the concern raised by KRC. The second concern expressed by KRC involves the State's reference to reduction in partial inspection frequency upon completion of Phase I reclamation. The cited reference was approved by OSM on May 18, 1982 (47 FR 21404), and has not been submitted to OSM for reconsideration as part of the current amendment. However, OSM feels that the issue requires further review, in light of the counterpart Federal rule at 30 CFR 840.11(f)(2) published on August 16, 1982 (47 FR 35620). If, as a result of that review, OSM determines that revisions to Kentucky's regulations are required, action in accordance with 30 CFR Part 732 will be taken to insure that Kentucky's program is no less effective than the Federal counterpart. Agency Comments Pursuant to section 503(b) of SMCRA and the implementing regulations of 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), comments were solicited from various government agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Kentucky program. The U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Soil Conservation Service responded but did not have any substantive comments on the proposed rules. The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) raised two concerns in their response. In connection with the bond forfeiture procedures at 405 KAR 10:050 section 2(4), MSHA feels that the word ``operator'' should be deleted from this section since the agency questions how the operator could be held liable if the operator is no longer on the site and/or has no interest in the bond. However, the question of liability is one of fact to be determined in each individual case. In addition, the use of the term operator is not part of the current amendment inasmuch as the term already exists in section 2(4) and is not part of the proposed revisions. Therefore, the Director is taking no action regarding this comment.
