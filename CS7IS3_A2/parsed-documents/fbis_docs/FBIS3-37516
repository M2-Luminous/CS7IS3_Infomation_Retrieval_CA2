Last night the Tripolye station was put out of operation; a question has been raised about discontinuing the operation of the last unit at the Zaporozhye GRES [state district electric power station]; 43 tons of coal are left at the Burshtyn station, which requires 18,000 tons of coal per day. A similar situation is occuring at other stations. Oleksiy Sheberstov reported that if the stations are put out of operation completely, it would be virtually impossible to resume their work. The main reasons for the critical situation which is happening at the electric power stations is the absence of coal and fuel oil. Only 100,000 tons of coal are being supplied, but the consumption need is 160,000 tons per day. There are ample quantities of fuel oil; however, the Ministry of Power Engineering and Electrification has no money to buy it, said Sheberstov. At the same time, it was pointed out that there are customers wishing to buy electric energy for Russian rubles, however, the "Law on currency regulation" allows the sale of electric energy for Ukrainian coupons only. Dwelling on the process of setting up corporations and joint-stock companies within the industry, Sheberstov remarked that today this process is impossible to carry out without restructuring the industry, because Ukraine has a single centralized network. Therefore, the claims by Dnepropetrovsk, Lugansk, Donetsk, and Zaporozhye oblasts that the regional property, power transmission lines in particular, should be passed into their ownership are groundless. Replying to the question whether the increase in tariffs for electric energy had positive consequences, Sheberstov said that "electric energy will not be saved until it is sold to domestic customers at a price which is lower than its current prime cost."
