Hernandez Sosa, 30, turned himself in on Thursday to Honduran judicial authorities through the government's Office of the National Human Rights Ombudsman. [passage omitted] When reporters asked him about his relationship with three Nicaraguans, Hernandez Sosa said: "I have no contact with Nicaraguans or anyone else. I only have contact with God." President Reina described the alleged assassination plot as an act of "gangsterism and drug trafficking." "No one has accused me. I am not an assassin, and tomorrow I will clarify everything," Hernandez Sosa said before being admitted to the Tegucigalpa Penal Center, where he was placed in a special cell under tight security by Army personnel. [passage omitted] A presidential spokesman told ACAN-EFE, "it is absurd to think that the president could be used as a smokescreen," and he underscored that the plan "existed." The source added, "We have information that Hernandez Sosa is involved in drug trafficking, and this will allow us to clarify the situation for all of the Honduran people." Hernandez Sosa has six days, beginning on Friday, to respond in court to the charges against him in a case in which Honduran and Nicaraguan authorities are working jointly.
