FBIS4-64752 "drweu088_h_94016" FBIS-WEU-94-088 Daily Report 5 May 1994 GERMANY Bonn, Lufthansa Agree on Privatization Terms Bonn, Lufthansa Agree on Privatization Terms AU0505123094 Berlin DIE WELT in German 5 May 94 p 1 AU0505123094 Berlin DIE WELT German BFN ["Welt-Nachrichtendienst" report: "Lufthansa To Be Privatized"] [Text] Bonn -- The Federal Government and Lufthansa have agreed on how the pension claims of the employees are to be protected when the corporation is privatized. This cleared the last obstacle for a rights issue and the withdrawal of the government from the airline. The Federal Government currently holds 51.4 percent of Lufthansa. If the government does not participate in the rights issue, its holding will fall below 50 percent. As a result, the corporation falls out of the government and laender (VBL) pension plan, where Lufthansa employees currently have their pension insurance. The agreement envisages that the VBL will continue to pay the pensions of Lufthansa's current 5,500 retirees. For that purpose, the government will pay about 1 billion marks [DM] in 15 annual installments. For the active employees, currently numbering about 50,000, Lufthansa will found a company pension fund, into which the government will pay DM500 million over 10 years. The trade unions have still to agree to this settlement. Board of Governors Chairman Wolfgang Roeller announced a speedy capital increase of "more than DM1 billion."
