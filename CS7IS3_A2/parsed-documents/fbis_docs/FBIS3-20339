Indeed, aside from Jean-Pierre Thomas, deputy for les Vosges and PR treasurer, who has been at the forefront of this scandal for six months, the document handed to Rennes Public Prosecutor Jacques Brun on 24 March mentions the names of Gerard Longuet, president of the PR and industry minister; Francois Leotard, honorary president of the PR and defense minister; and Alain Madelin, vice president of the PR and minister of enterprises and economic development. Their names appear in connection with financial and property transactions that may result in criminal charges of forgery, misuse of public property, and influence peddling. The four-page report drawn up by Renaud Van Ruymbeke brings to the attention of the Rennes public prosecutor, and the justice minister, facts which the judge discovered during his investigations, although they do not come directly within his sphere of competence.
