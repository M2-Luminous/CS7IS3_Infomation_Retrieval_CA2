That is why his bloodthirsty butchers spent the entire night charging and attacking at all the defense lines. They attacked the Grmusko-Srbljanski Plateau, Hasin Vrh, Grabez. In many of these places hand-to-hand fighting continues. Bad weather conditions are not deterring the Chetnik artillery from further destroying civilian buildings, destroying Bihac, [word indistinct], suburban districts, and Cazin. [Words indistinct] that Fikret Abdic yesterday sent to Tudjman, Karadzic, Milosevic, Boban, and his other superiors, to urgently help his so-called army defend itself against the 5th Corps. Obviously, (?he too) fears the growing awareness of the people of Velika Kladusa. This has been Mirza Sadikovic reporting for Radio Television Bosnia-Herzegovina.
