Three Irish people have died of the disease in the past two years and this year more than 60 cases have been diagnosed and treated in Ireland. Not only are more Irish people visiting malaria-endemic regions, but many do so with neither the administration of the necessary drugs nor knowledge of how to protect themselves. There is no vaccine against malaria which kills up to 2m annually, far more people than AIDS. The medical battle against the disease is severely hampered by the fact that the mosquito, which transmits the malaria parasite from person to person, is becoming increasingly resistant to insecticides. The mosquito could be "the most dangerous animal in the world" according to Dr John Dalton, senior lecturer in molecular parasitology at Dublin City University, in an article in Technology Ireland. Research shows that 97pc of British travellers to Africa receive some advice on the malaria risk before departure but only three-quarters understood the disease is transmitted by mosquitoes and of these only one-third were aware of their night-biting habits. Dr Dalton says that while no statistics are available for Irish tourists, one can presume they behave similarly to the British of whom only 46pc take the drugs prescribed before, during and after their holidays.
