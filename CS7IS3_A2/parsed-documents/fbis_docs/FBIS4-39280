This opinion was voiced in an interview which the U.S. President gave to Tom Brokaw, a leading NBC TV commentator, on board a U.S. warship off the Normandy coast. Clinton defended his administration's foreign policy, claiming that it takes a long time to elaborate a long-term foreign policy because the world situation since the end of the Cold War is not black and white and is completely unparalleled. "The main thing is that we have not gone away, we have become involved (in maintaining international peace)," the president said, speaking about the foreign policy strategy which will soon be presented to the public. In Clinton's opinion, the DPRK has no grounds for considering an economic blockade an act of war and will not take actions against South Korea or Japan. In reply to Tom Brokaw's question on whether the administration's indecision over Bosnia and Haiti will not have the effect of toughening Pyongyang's position, Clinton said that he believes that this will not happen because North Korea "will get a very clear signal" from the group of states interested in observing the principles of the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons.
