"All the decisions taken in Moscow will be implemented and all of the necessary preliminary agreements have been reached," he said. The goal we have pursued for several years -- the economic unity of Russia and Crimea -- has been attained, he added. Meshkov said that the problem of making the Russian ruble a legitimate payment unit in Crimea has practically been solved. "The technique and methods of doing so is Crimea's affair," he said. He also added that it was vitally important for the Crimean economy to have the ruble as a payment unity by the beginning of summer. "No one should shun benefit," he stated. "In Crimea reforms will develop the traditional way, and the systems of civil laws will be levelled up to create a legal foundation for uniting the Crimean and Russian economies," he told Interfax-Ukraine. "We cannot neglect the processes which are going on in Russia and which will occur in Ukraine," he said. To quote the Crimean president, Russia is well aware of Crimea's economic problems and has a favorable attitude to Crimea. "Unfortunately, this cannot be said about the officials representing the Ukrainian economy," he said. He noted, however, that Russia's positive attitude to Crimea did not mean a demonstrative rupture of economic ties with Ukraine. On the contrary, we'll have more opportunities for broadening our relations," he said. He announced that Crimea's trade and economic mission will be established in Moscow to coordinate relations with Russia. He suggested that the missions of Russia and of Crimea's neighbors -- the Krasnodar and Stavropol territories and the Rostov-on-Don region -- would be set up in Simferopol. He said that only God Almighty was higher than the level of the Moscow talks. Commenting on the appointment of Yevgeniy Saburov to the post of Crimea's premier, he said that this particular appointment was extremely advantageous. He noted that he did not call Kiev to give an account of his talks in Moscow to the Ukrainian president. He said, however, that a delegation of the Crimean Cabinet, led by Acting Prime Minister Anatoliy Franchuk, had arrived in Kiev. The preliminary results of the talks are positive, he said.
