FR941003-1-00015 FR941003-1-00002 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE Bureau of Prisons 28 CFR Part 542 [BOP&hyph;1014&hyph;P] RIN 1120&hyph;AA20 Administrative Remedy Program AGENCY: Federal Bureau of Prisons, Justice. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: In this document, the Bureau of Prisons is proposing to revise its regulations on the Administrative Remedy Program. These regulations describe the process through which inmates may seek formal review of any issue related to their confinement. The proposed changes are deemed necessary in order to attend to increased numbers of remedy requests occasioned by the continued growth of the inmate population. Proposed procedural changes include increases in the time limits set for inmate filing of requests and for Bureau responses; additional specifications for the provision of assistance to inmates; and increased access to Administrative Remedy indexes. DATES: Comments due by December 2, 1994. ADDRESSES: Office of General Counsel, Bureau of Prisons, HOLC Room 754, 320 First Street NW., Washington, DC 20534. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Roy Nanovic, Office of General Counsel, Bureau of Prisons, phone (202) 514&hyph;6655. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Bureau of Prisons is proposing to amend its regulations on the Administrative Remedy Program. A final rule on this subject was published in the Federal Register on October 29, 1979 (44 FR 62250), and was amended December 27, 1979 (44 FR 76726), November 20, 1991 (56 FR 58634), and on October 29, 1993 (58 FR 58246). The proposed revision set forth below is the first major change to the Bureau's Administrative Remedy Program since its adoption on October 29, 1979. Subsequent growth of the inmate population has resulted in an increase in the number of remedy requests filed. As a means of effectively addressing this situation, the Bureau has reorganized its regulation, currently entitled Administrative Remedy Procedure for Inmates, for the sake of clarity, and is proposing various efficiencies in the procedures for processing remedy requests. Procedural efficiencies include making adjustments to the time limits for filing requests by inmates and for responses by the Bureau. The time limit for submission of an initial remedy request by an inmate has been lengthened to 20 calendar days following the date on which the basis for the request had occurred. Current regulations specify a 15-day limit. The time limit for submission of an appeal to the General Counsel has been lengthened to 30 calendar days following the date Regional Counsel signed the response. The proposed time limits for agency responses have also been lengthened, from 15 to 20 calendar days at the institution level, and from 30 to 40 calendar days at the Central Office level. Additional revisions include additional guidelines in the following areas: informal resolution, forms, and assistance to inmates. Also, advances in recordkeeping technology have now made it possible to expand the provisions for access to remedy indexes. The Bureau of Prisons has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action for the purpose of E.O. 12866, and accordingly this rule was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. After review of the law and regulations, the Director, Bureau of Prisons, has certified that this rule, for the purpose of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354), does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Interested persons may participate in this proposed rulemaking by submitting data, views, or arguments in writing to the Bureau of Prisons, 320 First Street, NW., HOLC Room 754, Washington, DC 20534. Comments received during the comment period will be considered before final action is taken. All comments received remain on file for public inspection at the above address. The proposed rule may be changed in light of the comments received. No oral hearings are contemplated. List of Subjects in 28 CFR Part 542 Prisoners. Wade B. Houk, Acting Director, Bureau of Prisons.
