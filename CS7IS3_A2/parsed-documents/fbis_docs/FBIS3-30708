FBIS3-30708 "dreeu026__a94080" FBIS-EEU-94-026-A Document Type:Daily Report 8 February 1994 ANNEX Slovakia Parliament Refuses To Debate Controversial Bill AU0302165394 Prague CTK in English 1424 GMT 3 Feb 94 AU0302165394 Prague CTK Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Bratislava Feb 3 (CTK) -- The Slovak Parliament today refused to include an amendment bill to the Penal Code in the agenda of its current session. The amendment recommends that Articles 102 and 103 on defamation of the republic and the head of state be abolished. Sixty-four deputies from the total of 140 present voted for inclusion of the bill. Seventy deputies were against and six abstained. On Wednesday [2 February], the Slovak Government approved the deputy-drafted amendment bill, in light of recommendations by two organisations for the protection of human rights -- Amnesty International and the Helsinki Committee. The parliamentary opposition says the draft amendment has not been completed. It considers the government's striving for quick passage of the amendment to be an effort to acquit an active member of the government Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), the state secretary of the Privatisation Ministry, Ivan Lexa, who is being prosecuted for defamation of the head of state, President Michal Kovac.
