After being let through by an Indio woman holding a rifle, I went up to the second floor. Everything had been destroyed. Only the chandeliers hanging from the ceiling were intact. [Diaz] Your troops do not seem to be strong enough to march on Mexico City and overthrow President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. Are you not being too optimistic? [Marcos] Look, if you are worried that we may be marching on Mexico City, rest assured. We will wait for a little while longer. Anyway, speaking seriously, I can assure you that what you see here, in San Cristobal, is only a fraction of our troops, most of which nobody can identify since, in the countryside, they wear no uniform. There are more Zapatists in the Indio communities than you or the government can imagine. Therefore, we will not go to Mexico City with these forces alone, but also with all the others which are gradually building up. [Diaz] Your weapons are much less powerful than the Army's. Is this not an insurmountable handicap? [Marcos] Our weapons are the people and our knowledge of these mountains. [Diaz] Where were you born? [Marcos] I am Mexican, like all those who fight in the Zapatist army, but I am not from Chiapas. [Diaz] Where did you train to become a guerrilla? [Marcos] I have trained a lot, but that is all I am prepared to tell you. I am well aware of the difference between fighting in the countryside and in towns, in the plains or the mountains, in the jungle or the desert. [Diaz] Where do you stand in relation to liberation theology? [Marcos] We are fighting to liberate ourselves alone, without any help from theology. Among our people, there are Evangelists and Catholics, atheists, and witch-doctors alike. This story about witch-doctors is not a joke. I am speaking of the Chiapas witch-doctors. [Diaz] Is the Zapatist army calling for new elections? [Marcos] What is happening now, what they are doing to bolster the new presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, is only a masquerade. We all know very well that the votes count for nothing, and that the electoral law is a sham created by Salinas, who is a usurper and a traitor. We want real elections, in which all parties have a chance, not only the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party]. [Diaz] There are indications that the "coletos," as San Cristobal's inhabitants are nicknamed, are not all that happy about this incursion in their town. In the streets, everybody is repeating that violence leads nowhere. Does this type of response from the people not worry you? [Marcos] Of course, I would like them to respond somewhat differently. But I would like to stress that those who are not Indios, the so-called "coletos" and "ladinos," are very racist. If one of them steps into a bus and a "Chamula" [Chamula Indian] is seated, they make him get up. If they see an Indio on the road, they step on the gas and barely miss him. If people who behave like this disapprove of the Zapatist army, you will understand that I am not in the least concerned. As far as violence not leading to any results is concerned, I could answer that it is precisely the institutional violence into which Salinas has plunged the country, as well as violence in the form of death from cholera, malaria and measles, violence in the form of hunger and deprivation, which has led us to opt for this extreme solution. We are not aiming to establish an autonomous government, we are only demanding a democratically elected government, and respect for all the indian tribes. Another thing that I would like to make clear is that I am not the Zapatists' leader. We do not have a head, but rather a committee.
