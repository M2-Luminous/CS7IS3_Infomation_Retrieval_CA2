Esteemed Leonid Makarovych. I think that the question is to Ivan Stepanovych Plyushch, too. Isn't there a contradiction in the fourth, fifth, and eighth points of chapter six on chairmen of councils of the relevant level -- when they are elected by the people -- but here the issue comes up that they are subordinate to the appropriate council. [passage omitted] One can be elected by the people, but removed from one's post by the president. With all due respect to the president, well, that is, one can be removed not by those bodies and people by whom they were elected. [Kravchuk] I think that there should always be some kind of mechanism. Well, for example, the question did not occur to you that the president is elected by the people, but the Supreme Council can remove him from his post by means of impeachment or by submitting the issue to a referendum. Such a question has not occurred. It did not occur. So why does the question occur here -- one is elected by the people, but if the person violates the Constitution, violates laws, and in that part especially where the state delegates functions for him to carry out, then naturally the representative body cannot remain without reacting to these matters, and neither can the government remain aloof from this if we truly want to create a strong and responsible executive authority. Therefore I think that a counterbalance should always be there, and the person should know that there is some kind of lever forcing him either to work responsibly or he will be removed from his post. [Deputy Starichenko] Esteemed Leonid Makarovych. Starichenko, Donetsk oblast. I have a question which perturbs my electors. We are submitting the basis of the constitution for examination and (?without) the main issue, which we have taken away from our electors, which was in the old constitution. That is the right of the individual to labor, to free education, the right to free health care and so on and so forth. The question is why the said issue has not been submitted in this basis. [Kravchuk] I share this point of view and the concern of your electors. For in our time we removed an entire 23 chapters from the constitution then in force, and now these clauses are not in our constitution either. That is, the present Supreme Council has removed them from the constitution. But they were in this constitution. But we, until now...[pauses] what is the law called? On the fundamentals, the fundamental constitutional principles regarding the organization of state authority and local self-government. That is, we have taken a narrow issue, which will be set out in the relevant chapters of the constitution. But the Supreme Council, which will be convened, I am convinced that it will, these chapters, and incidentally they are in the draft constitution too, but maybe not in this wording, but the Supreme Council will be adopting the constitution as a whole, and these chapters will find a place there without fail. [Unidentified deputy] I'm sorry, but this situation -- because that which I spoke about is not here -- these clauses, this situation could cause people simply not to come to the electoral districts to vote. Because they want to see in the constitution namely that which they had, and that which we want to take away from them now. [Kravchuk] Well, this also depends on us. If we explain to people that everything is not determined by this law or by the fundamental principles, then other issues have to be taken into account too. (?We have taken) a narrow issue. But they will certainly be in the constitution. But the Supreme Council can adopt this too, because this is the most acute issue, and as a rule the most acute debates occur regarding this. [Deputy Stepenko] Stepenko, electoral district 330. Leonid Makarovych, I have a brief question for you. Here in the second chapter, the second sub-point, the paragraph where it says that the Supreme Council works on a permanent basis, there is an omission in the second version. Is this a misprint or is it really an omission and is parliament going to work on a nonprofessional basis? And another question. Here, well we say that a strong presidential authority is needed. [passage omitted] But look, the president does not appoint or sack the Cabinet of Ministers. [passage omitted] And the last question -- on the last page -- the issue was discussed whereby the chairmen of oblast, rayon, and settlement councils are directly elected by the people and head the executive authority. But the directors of executive authority -- I am making this additional proposal -- are elected at council sessions, that is, to exclude personal appointments, which lead to servility and so on. [Kravchuk] Well, first about the professional nature of parliament. The present Supreme Council adopted a decision by means of a law that the parliament is a professional one and it has made an appropriate change to the constitution. It is already in the constitution. It is already in the constitution. We have not submitted everything. I repeat again. These are details here. Everything that has already been decided today is decided. As regards power and structure, we did not put it in this draft. That is the first thing. The second question concerned a strong executive authority and there being a link between strong executive authority and the president. In this draft, and we all agreed on this, the constitutional commission and council representatives agreed, that executive authority is fully concentrated in the hands of the Cabinet of Ministers. And it is entirely natural that if the prime minister is responsible for executive authority, then we should give him the right to form the government with which he wants to work. But we also give the Supreme Council the right to express no confidence in him or to propose another way, and then he leaves his post and forms another government. If the president is again going to be directly involved in these issues, then he must assume executive authority. This cannot be. Then a prime minister is not needed. One thing only is needed. That is why we agreed on this version. As for what you propose regarding the directors of executive authority, I think that this can be resolved by a certain clause. This does not necessarily have to be put into these fundamentals. [Deputy Marchenko] Marchenko, electoral district 347. [passage omitted] I am asking you one question, only one. Would you not agree for a third time to be true to your right of legislative initiative and submit to a referendum only one question -- on the need for the institution of the presidency in Ukraine? Thank you. [Kravchuk] Well, I understand that this is the stance of your party. For your party the president is now an eyesore, let us say, in Ukraine. You want this issue put to a referendum. But the Supreme Council adopted corresponding decisions. And I am guided by the decisions of the Supreme Council and not by the decisions of individual deputies. There is a decision adopted by this body on the referendum. Then they revoked it and adopted a decision on preterm elections of the Supreme Council and new elections of the president. What contradictions are there here? The time will come, and there will be elections. But you again want a referendum on whether a president is needed. It is not about the name of the president, but about a concrete figure, about the structure of power. If the people do not vote for these fundamental constitutional clauses, then imagine -- then the Supreme Council of the new convocation will adopt the decision it considers necessary, and on the institution of the presidency in Ukraine too, and on the nature of power too. But this will then mean that the people do not want such a structure and put themselves in the hands of the Supreme Council of the new convocation. But you want to again return to the issue of a referendum. [Deputy Petrenko] Volodymyr Petrenko for Azov Electoral District 195. [passage omitted] Following the logic of what is written -- and I, for example, am not happy about -- I am also going to vote -- I am not happy about paragraph 2 of Chapter 4, Executive Power: The supreme organ of state executive power in Ukraine is the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. This is a collective body, whereas I would like a prime minister to head executive power. Thus, only because of one paragraph will I vote entirely against the whole of the fundamental provisions. So my proposal -- and I would like to know your view on that one -- is that we should remove these fundamental provisions because we are adopting this package when there is not yet a new parliament. Seventy percent of us will not be there. There will be new people who will have their vision but who will not, however, have the freedom of maneuver because people will have voted on this. Thank you for your attention. [Kravchuk] Well, I would like you to listen to what I think. I cannot see, for example, how the whole of executive power can be vested in the sole person of the prime minister given that he as a person is appointed by the Supreme Council. Executive power has to concentrate in the Cabinet of Ministers as a body, while the prime minister -- it is there further on, do have a look under what the prime minister can do -- heads this power and heads the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, forming the government and the composition of the Cabinet of Ministers and exercising control over the Cabinet of Ministers, coordinating and so on. In other words, the organ itself represents executive power and the premier is at the head of it. So what you are saying is there, and I cannot see any differences here. However, the person is not elected democratically, but appointed, so do you really want the whole of full executive power to be given to one person? In that case, what is the role of the government? That is to say, this has to be explained, as simple as that, just explained. [passage omitted] [Deputy Charodeyev, in Russian] Charodeyev for Donetsk's Proletarskiy rayon. [passage omitted] The question is this: Leonid Makarovych, I am carefully watching what you are saying now and you said earlier that the questions on bilingualism and state symbols could not be put up to a referendum, saying that this question was unconstitutional. In many civilized countries, this is a constitutional question. Where the leadership is wise and makes the right decisions, it does so without a referendum. Here the question is ripe. [passage omitted] Maybe the people in the east will see that the majority in Ukraine is in favor of this -- if it is in favor -- and maybe they will calm down. Believe me, there is the total unacceptance of either the symbols or monolingualism, and not only in eastern Ukraine. There are letters from western Ukraine, in Ukrainian, that to us, yellow has always been the color of harlots, traitors, and the soft-headed. That is why it is a referendum, rather than [Pavlo] Movchan or [Larysa] Skoryk [both pro-Ukrainian people's deputies], that can resolve this question. If you think there will be dangerous consequences, tell me what they are. I would sincerely like to make this issue clear to myself. I, however, will prove in a speech that you are mistaken being under pressure from Rukh people and unscrupulous advisers. [Kravchuk] Well, you know, if we cannot reach a decision here, given that we have not been able to reach it since May 1990, this is because there are different points of view. However, under enforcible enactments and the procedure of work of the Supreme Council, decisions here are made by a majority of votes and nobody makes any distinction between deputies from the West or East voting. It is a majority, period. Now, imagine such a scene -- we have already seen it and here; I am not making anything up; it has already happened -- as Ukraine's western regions voting for the yellow and blue flag and the east -- I do not know what for and I will not make any forecasts now -- and they then (?secede). Then it is not that the deputies cast their votes at the Supreme Council as a body, that will be said. There will be a territorial division as to who voted for what flag. You will say that by a majority this flag should be hoisted here and you are bound, bound, to cause confrontation. This is first. Second, as democrats -- please listen, this is an important issue, and it will anyway have to be settled... [Plyushch interrupts and trys to restore order] [Kravchuk] As real democrats, the issue in general and the formulation of the issue on the state language, as it is, is absurd, i.e. it fails to withstand any criticism. In this case, however, it is about supporting the state language. That is all. That is why I cannot see why this issue should be included in the constitution. This can be settled by a law on languages. This law exists, by the way, and it can be worked out, corrected and adopted in the form the Supreme Council deems necessary. This is a democratic way. But to impose on the people and divide them according to the linguistic determinant will simply be dangerous for the state, trust me, and passions will all the time be inflamed over this, whether you want it or not. The thing is that there is the situation that is in existence in Ukraine today. That is why what I am saying about this is that there is no need to include [the issues of state symbols and bilingualism] in the constitution, moreover by a referendum. Settle it by a law and everything will be all right. Perhaps the Supreme Council will consider that two or three official languages are spoken in Ukraine, Ukrainian, Russian and some other. [Plyushch] The second microphone. [Deputy Romanov] Romanov for Odessa's District 294. [passage omitted] We have a document called the Declaration on the Sovereignty of Ukraine, where it is written down that the declaration is the basis of a new constitution. We have now prepared another document, which is the [fundamental constitutional] provisions, that are also the basis of Ukraine's new constitution. My understanding is that the adoption of a [new] constitution will be carried out by a new Supreme Council. That is why, so that there would not be variant readings, and since it will be the basis of a new constitution, I think it would be all right to write the following clause -- I would like to know your attitude toward this -- in the general provisions, which is Chapter 1 -- so that we then would not be accused of anything: The right -- in Paragraph 4 -- the right to work, education, scientific development, and environmental protection shall be ensured for the future generations. If we do not write this down, anything can happen after a referendum. And the next question: In Chapter 5 on judiciary power, nothing is said on the role of the office of the procurator. My opinion is that this particular issue should by all means be elucidated. The issue of the responsibility of the organs of power for violations of the current legislation should also be elucidated. What is your attitude towards these chapters? [Kravchuk] Well, first of all let us assume the right to everything you say is ensured. Ensured by whom? The state? For everybody? Well, in that case, we have to say one more thing, which is that there shall not be, shall we say, any insurance medicine or any private colleges. No, no, no, no -- wait, wait, wait. Once we are saying A, we have to say B. That is to say, the state in accordance with the budget takes it upon itself fully to finance and ensure social security, which is how it used to be. Let us talk openly: Is it realistic in transition to a market, socially oriented economy? The next question to you then is this: I am not just saying that we should write it down. Anything can be written and paper will cope with it, but if we write down unrealistic things we will simply ... [responding to a call from the audience and changing thought] What you are saying is correct, but what you have following this is another course of the development of our society. Let us then write down that we are returning to the old styles of work and to the old system of labor and everything, and this all can then be written down. That is why I would like to say this: If the Supreme Council ... [pauses] Why is it important that this issue should be examined by the Supreme Council? It is because it will weigh up every situation and will specify it and can differentiate something -- I do not know. It cannot just be written down for the state then to say: I have no base to do so, our economy is different. Throughout the world, human beings have the right to use their talents, their capabilities and conditions, rather than having it immediately provided at any cost. You will not find it to be the case anywhere. So let us now take a realistic look at things. If you are now in favor of this course, then finally say how you formulate it and what we are to vote for. [Plyushch] There was the office of the procurator. We agreed that by a law on the office of the procurator... [Kravchuk, interrupting] The office of the procurator -- it is moved outside judiciary power. Our office of the procurator is separate, it is to be established by a law on the office of the procurator. You know that it is not included in the system of judiciary power. Then a separate chapter will be needed. [passage omitted] [Unidentified deputy] I have several questions: Why are the fundamental constitutional provisions on the organization of state power prepared so as to suit a personality, a personality, rather than the state and the people? Let us so far consider them to suit you as president and some... [Kravchuk, interrupting] Can you be more specific? [Deputy] I can say specifically... [Kravchuk] Please. [Deputy] This is the first question: Why is it that you are elected for five years and the parliament for four? [Kravchuk] You are welcome. First [words undistinct]... [Deputy, interrupting] Why is it that you elect the judges and we approve them? [passage omitted] [Kravchuk] My explanation is this: If it is about the election of the president for four years, I am ready today to alter the number of years, and by the way, it was not I who put it forward. Second, about why it is me who proposes the judges [passage indistinct] why the president does the proposing is because every society has to have counterweights. If it is the Supreme Council that does the electing, then someone must do the putting forward. You may not elect someone who is proposed, and the president will have to put forward another candidacy. However, it cannot be that an organ grabs everything. Let us say the Supreme Council and president are elected democratically, right? Why should one organ have more rights, more functions, more powers, and more levers to exert pressure than the other who is also someone elected democratically? One does the putting forward and the other does the voting. There are not any discrepancies here. [Deputy] I have a second question. A second question. Do you agree in accordance with your statement on re-election as president in June? [Kravchuk] The Supreme Council has adopted a resolution on this. [Deputy] Are there going to be elections or not? [Kravchuk] Do I really decide this? The Supreme Council decides this. Why are you addressing me? The issue has already been resolved. Make a correction [as heard]. I repeat, the Supreme Council commission, Oleksandr Pavlovych is right here. I read it today. The draft has been distributed to you -- vote for it. I cannot vote for the Supreme Council. Kozarenko there is saying that this is not in the constitution. The Supreme Council adopted a resolution from my proposal. And the Supreme Council should secure this. [Deputy Tkachuk] Anatoliy Tkachuk from the town of Khmelnitskiy. Esteemed Leonid Makarovych. Please tell me, to this first question, do you believe that when two documents exist in Ukraine, namely one document voted for at a referendum and a second document called the Constitution of Ukraine, and which is referred to here, that this eliminates turmoil in the hall? In my view, this will only increase turmoil. This is the first question. And the second question: please tell me, have you made a psychological analysis of the situation on elections of presidents of oblasts, an analysis of the Ukrainian mentality, when anarchists are even praised in our songs. And in two years you did not manage to remove your representative, whom you appointed in Sevastopol. Will you remove such a representative, when he is elected by the people? [Kravchuk] I will start with the second question. First, it is entirely untrue that I could not remove him. Simply I could have removed him on the following day whenever I wanted to. So one should not say that I did not manage to. This should be precise. To continue. You say that there will be two constitutions. I will show you an example. I will show you with one example, let us say with the example of executive authority. The Supreme Council takes this as a basis -- that in Ukraine the Cabinet of Ministers has executive authority, the Cabinet of Ministers is the higher body -- takes this and on the basis of this adopts a law on the Cabinet of Ministers. Then there is no debate as to who is the head. The people will already have granted fundamental powers to the Cabinet of Ministers. The Supreme Council elaborates a law on the Cabinet of Ministers and it begins to work fully. And there is no discrepancy here. [passage omitted] There is no fear here. There will only be fear if a new Supreme Council comes to power with nothing in the way of a constitution and begins once again going over what to give to whom. Then they will divide up into blocs, some here, some there, and in this way we will never agree on anything. The people express their will, and the Supreme Council will then act in accordance with the will of the people. [Deputy Tkachuk] Aren't you afraid of little presidents in oblasts? For instance, I do not fear this. If the oblast entrusts one person with leading it, then let him lead. [Kravchuk] Well finally, let us, well, I understand the complexities. I understand the ambiguity of our situation and life, but when we trust the people to elect a leader in the localities, this has more possibilities, because they know their own people best. Second, if he violates the law and constitution, he can be removed -- this is envisaged -- removed by the Cabinet of Ministers. And more, he can be removed by the representative body if deputies assemble and vote for this. That is, there is a counterbalance here. I am saying there is a counterbalance. And there is no need to be afraid. And then you will not be putting questions to me about why I did not sack the representative of the president in Sevastopol. Because this will be decided on the basis of the will of the people. [Deputy Yatsenko] Yatsenko, Korosten region, electoral district 157. [passage omitted] Why not determine approximately five to seven selected issues that would more or less determine where we are really going? Then the people would understand and politicians would understand. And they would work for the people and not for something else. And I would like to reduce the second question to the second point regarding the president. The president is the guarantor of human rights and freedoms. Does the president have levers to implement, well, this protection of the people? Evidently all of this is a matter for the judicial authority, which has these levers. What do you think? Thank you. [Kravchuk] Well, where we are going and what we are doing -- this is an eternal question. It is not, for instance, a question to which one can reply unambiguously. If one is to take the division of society on a historical scale into some kind of formations, this is simple to do, to capitalism or to socialism. This we know and studied five...[changes thought] you understand, social and political formations. And one can clearly define them. If you are talking about general rules, they are here, freedoms before the law irrespective of one's parentage, social and property freedoms, so that all forms of ownership are safeguarded and all people are protected. But if you have a specific proposal to formulate, then please formulate it. Please do. It can be submitted. But I repeat, this is about authority and what it should protect. But can the president secure rights and freedoms? I think that, for instance, in an abstract sense he is obliged to do this, and in a concrete sense, certainly. But can the Supreme Council ensure rights and freedoms today? No. This means that this is a realistic mechanism when an individual should live in a lawful, economic and social space, which protects his interests. And everybody should do this -- and the president above all -- if he is elected by the people. This question has to be asked without fail. If it is not asked at all, then this question is left up in the air: Who ensures these rights? [Deputy Zakharuk] Dmytro Zakharuk, Snyatyn electoral district 205. I have a question to both co-chairmen and authors of the said draft from this aspect: first of all, one draft was distributed, which truly said that the Supreme Council works on a permanent basis. [passage omitted] So what do you think of submitting this point (?to a referendum), that the Supreme Council works on a permanent basis. [Kravchuk] I noted in the draft that the parliament works on a permanent basis, but not to note how many deputies. [Zakharuk] Not to note down how many, but just that it is on a permanent basis? [Kravchuk] I agree with this. Because just imagine now. I will name one figure now: 450 deputies and 450 assistants -- 900 offices. The current Cabinet of Ministers has 870. And I am not even mentioning motor vehicle transport, apartments, or anything else. So maybe the new parliament will pay attention to the situation. So I would note -- on a permanent basis -- but not the number of deputies. [Deputy Zakharuk] And the no less important issue is the establishment of a balance between legislative power and the president as to confidence and non-confidence in the Cabinet of Ministers. This is to prevent such a happening as the Supreme Council expressing non-confidence in the Cabinet of Ministers, followed by it being once again full of the same people as before composing it. Do you think a norm has to be brought in here for no more than one third of the people from the old Cabinet to be able to join a Cabinet of Ministers of the next composition if the Supreme Council expresses non-confidence in the Cabinet of Ministers? [Kravchuk] What there can be is this: As it happens, I have never been a supporter of, shall we say, unequivocal decisions. But if you put it this way, then it cannot be one third. If, shall we say, the Supreme Council expresses no confidence in the Cabinet of Ministers, nobody can reenter a new Cabinet of Ministers. Otherwise, how can it be divided? What does one third mean? How will they be distinguished? Is one better than the other? You are either in or out. The truth, however, is that, as we saw, there are people among the government that, shall we say, are not responsible for separate sins, whereas the whole of the Cabinet of Ministers is made to resign. I think what we have here is that if we take the road of confidence in the prime minister, and the prime minister is responsible for the state of executive power and is accountable and responsible to the Supreme Council, he then should have our confidence. When he resigns, he forms a new government that is again agreed upon by the Supreme Council. I cannot see it happen in any other way. [Plyushch] Leonid Makarovych, your time is up. [Kravchuk] Thank you.
