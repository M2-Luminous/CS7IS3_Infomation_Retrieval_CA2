The head of state was welcomed at Luanda's international 4 February airport by National Assembly Chairman Dr. Franca van Dunem. [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] How did you find the inauguration ceremony? [Dos Santos] It was a well organized ceremony. It was an historic time and many foreign delegations were there. I think that South Africa is now entering a new stage in its history. Let us hope that the new government will not only respond to internal expectations but also to African expectations. [Correspondent] Mr. President: Do you think that Portuguese President Mario Soares (?can) influence Jonas Savimbi concerning peace in this country? [Dos Santos] No, you know full well that the Angolan peace process has a well defined framework provided by the Bicesse Accord, the relevant UN resolutions, and, eventually, an accord that may be signed in Lusaka. I had a meeting with President Mario Soares but I only asked him to ask Savimbi what he wants. [end recording] The Angolan head of state was also welcomed by Prime Minister Marcolino Moco, Attorney General Domingos Cololo, and other government officials.
