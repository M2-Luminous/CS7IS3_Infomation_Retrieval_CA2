Instead, government sources report, a directorate on the coordination of administrative organs' activity led by Valeriy Pavlov, former first deputy state secretary, has been created. Simultaneously, a new position has been introduced in the Council of Ministers apparatus -- government secretary for national security, whose rank is close to that of ambassador at large. Appointed to this post has been the former state secretary, Gennadiy Danilov, whom observers in Minsk describe as one of the most influential people among those closest to the premier.
