(i) If a guaranty agency decides to garnish the disposable pay of a borrower who is not making payments on a loan held by the agency, on which the Secretary has paid a reinsurance claim, it shall do so in accordance with the following procedures: (A) The employer shall deduct and pay to the agency from a borrower's wages an amount that does not exceed the lesser of 10 percent of the borrower's disposable pay for each pay period or the amount permitted by 15 U.S.C. 1673, unless the borrower provides the agency with written consent to deduct a greater amount. For this purpose, the term ``disposable pay'' means that part of the borrower's compensation from an employer remaining after the deduction of any amounts required by law to be withheld. (B) At least 30 days before the initiation of garnishment proceedings, the guaranty agency shall mail to the borrower's last known address, a written notice of the nature and amount of the debt, the intention of the agency to initiate proceedings to collect the debt through deductions from pay, and an explanation of the borrower's rights. (C) The guaranty agency shall offer the borrower an opportunity to inspect and copy agency records related to the debt. (D) The guaranty agency shall offer the borrower an opportunity to enter into a written repayment agreement with the agency under terms agreeable to the agency. (E) The guaranty agency shall offer the borrower an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with paragraph (b)(10)(i)(J) of this section concerning the existence or the amount of the debt and, in the case of a borrower whose proposed repayment schedule under the garnishment order is established other than by a written agreement under paragraph (b)(10)(i)(D) of this section, the terms of the repayment schedule. (F) The guaranty agency shall sue any employer for any amount that the employer, after receipt of the garnishment notice provided by the agency under paragraph (b)(10)(i)(H) of this section, fails to withhold from wages owed and payable to an employee under the employer's normal pay and disbursement cycle. (G) The guaranty agency may not garnish the wages of a borrower whom it knows has been involuntarily separated from employment until the borrower has been reemployed continuously for at least 12 months. (H) Unless the guaranty agency receives information that the agency believes justifies a delay or cancellation of the withholding order, it shall send a withholding order to the employer within 20 days after the borrower fails to make a timely request for a hearing, or, if a timely request for a hearing is made by the borrower, within 20 days after a final decision is made by the agency to proceed with garnishment. (I) The notice given to the employer under paragraph (b)(10)(i)(H) of this section must contain only the information as may be necessary for the employer to comply with the withholding order. (J) The guaranty agency shall provide a hearing, which, at the borrower's option, may be oral or written, if the borrower submits a written request for a hearing on the existence or amount of the debt or the terms of the repayment schedule. The time and location of the hearing shall be established by the agency. An oral hearing may, at the borrower's option, be conducted either in-person or by telephone conference. All telephonic charges must be the responsibility of the guaranty agency. (K) If the borrower's written request is received by the guaranty agency on or before the 15th day following the borrower's receipt of the notice described in paragraph (b)(10)(i)(B) of this section, the guaranty agency may not issue a withholding order until the borrower has been provided the requested hearing. For purposes of this paragraph, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, a borrower shall be considered to have received the notice described in paragraph (b)(10)(i)(B) of this section 5 days after it was mailed by the agency. The guaranty agency shall provide a hearing to the borrower in sufficient time to permit a decision, in accordance with the procedures that the agency may prescribe, to be rendered within 60 days. (L) If the borrower's written request is received by the guaranty agency after the 15th day following the borrower's receipt of the notice described in paragraph (b)(10)(i)(B) of this section, the guaranty agency shall provide a hearing to the borrower in sufficient time that a decision, in accordance with the procedures that the agency may prescribe, may be rendered within 60 days, but may not delay issuance of a withholding order unless the agency determines that the delay in filing the request was caused by factors over which the borrower had no control, or the agency receives information that the agency believes justifies a delay or cancellation of the withholding order. For purposes of this paragraph, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, a borrower shall be considered to have received the notice described in paragraph (b)(10)(i)(B) of this section 5 days after it was mailed by the agency. (M) The hearing official appointed by the agency to conduct the hearing may be any qualified individual, including an administrative law judge, not under the supervision or control of the head of the guaranty agency. (N) The hearing official shall issue a final written decision at the earliest practicable date, but not later than 60 days after the guaranty agency's receipt of the borrower's hearing request. (O) As specified in section 488A(a)(8) of the HEA, the borrower may seek judicial relief, including punitive damages, if the employer discharges, refuses to employ, or takes disciplinary action against the borrower due to the issuance of a withholding order. (ii) References to ``the borrower'' in this paragraph include all endorsers on a loan. * * * * * (Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1078, 1078&hyph;1, 1078&hyph;2, 1078&hyph;3, 1080a, 1082, 1087, 1091a, and 1099)
