FBIS4-13799 "drnes079dd_94012" FBIS-NES-94-079 Daily Report 22 Apr 1994 Palestinian Affairs Hamas Statement Reaffirms Opposition to Israel Hamas Statement Reaffirms Opposition to Israel PM2204141894 London AL-HAYAH in Arabic 22 Apr 94 p5 PM2204141894 London AL-HAYAH Arabic BFN [Unattributed report: "Hamas: We Will Continue Operations Against Israel Until the Liberation of Palestine From the Sea to the River"] [Text] London, AL-HAYAH -- In two statements, one dated 20 April and the other 21 April 1994, the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) emphasized that its political program does not include "forfeiting a single inch of Palestine" nor does it include "recognition of the Zionist entity's right to exist on our territory." The first statement was an "explanation" of the statements made by the chairman of Hamas' Political Bureau and carried by some media recently. The second, a more detailed statement, declared that Hamas' military operations will continue "against the occupying enemy...until the liberation of all our usurped Palestinian territory from the sea to the river." Following is the text of the statement issued by Hamas' Political Bureau on 21 April 1994 under the heading "An Important Statement Issued by Hamas' Political Bureau on the Latest Developments": "In the light of the political concept proposed by Hamas and in the light of the various official and media reactions to that and the statements made by the U.S. secretary of state, enemy government officials, and officials of other states, Hamas reaffirms the following: "1. Escalation of the valiant popular resistance, jihad, and military operations against the occupying enemy will continue as long as there is Zionist occupation of our blessed Palestinian territory...and until the liberation of all our usurped Palestinian territory from the sea to the river. "2. Hamas believes that the current so-called settlement negotiations between the PLO leadership and the Zionist enemy will fail because they are based on the perpetuation of injustice, aggression, and occupation, are held in an atmosphere of Zionist hegemony and arrogance and official Palestinian and Arab weakness, reflect submission and capitulation to Zionist and American terms and diktat, and run contrary to the will of our patient masses and their struggling forces. Hamas also reaffirms its clear position rejecting the feeble autonomy. "3. Hamas outlined its political concept in a statement issued by its Political Bureau and in statements made by the chairman of its Political Bureau. It was crystal clear, leaving no room for confusion or speculation. Some information media reported it ambiguously and partially, giving the impression that there has been some change in Hamas' policy, programs, and concept of the conflict with the occupying enemy. Some even went too far by trying to interpret Hamas' views to mean that Hamas was offering an initiative for peace with the occupying Zionists or that its views meant recognition of the usurping Zionist enemy, and other such erroneous claims and interpretations. "4. The Hamas political concept proposed to our people and their struggling forces calls for the following: "A. Unconditional withdrawal of the Zionist occupation forces from the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and Jerusalem. "B. Dismantling and removal of the settlements and evacuation of the settlers from the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and Jerusalem. "C. Holding free general elections for the Palestinian people inside and outside [the occupied territory] to elect the people's true leadership and representatives. That elected legitimate leadership would be the only party authorized to express the will and aspirations of our people and to decide all the subsequent steps in our conflict with the occupation. "5. Hamas explained, through statements by the chairman of its Political Bureau, that if, after the general elections to choose our people's leadership, Hamas and its known political program win the confidence of our Palestinian people, then Hamas will express the will of the people and will seek to implement its program for the mobilization of our people's resources, forces, and capabilities and to unite their ranks for the liberation of their territory and holy places. If the election results prove to be different, then Hamas will respect the view of the majority but will adhere to its constant principles and program and work for their fulfillment, and it will express its views most freely and strongly. "6. The aforementioned statements and declarations did not include what some tried to claim was a Hamas recognition of the usurping Zionist entity nor did they include acceptance of Security Council Resolution 242 or abandonment of Hamas' programs and constant genuine Islamic principles which regard Palestine as an Islamic territory which must not be given up, forfeited, or subjected to bargaining."
