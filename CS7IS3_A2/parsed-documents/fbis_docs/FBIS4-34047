FBIS4-34047 "drlat115_k_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-115 Daily Report 11 Jun 1994 SOUTH AMERICA Argentina Arrest of Peruvian `Terrorist' Confirmed Arrest of Peruvian `Terrorist' Confirmed PY1406183194 Buenos Aires NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS in Spanish 2240 GMT 11 Jun 94 PY1406183194 Buenos Aires NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS Spanish BFN [Text] Buenos Aires, 11 Jun (NA) -- Today, Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf linked the alleged Shining Path [SL] member who was arrested in Tucuman with the social outbursts that occurred recently in the interior of the country, indicating that those who escaped when the Peruvian was captured "have been identified and arrest warrants have been issued." Ruckauf confirmed that the alleged member of the Peruvian Maoist SL organization is under arrest. He has been identified as Jorge Diaz Reategui. The minister added that those who were with him at the time of his arrest "have been seen wherever social outbursts have occurred." Reategui's arrest took place at a hotel in the poor district of El Bajo, near the Tucuman city bus terminal. At the time, he was meeting with other alleged guerrillas, who managed to escape. The interior minister indicated that those who were with Reategui "have been seen in other parts of the country, participating in public outbursts." He emphasized: "They have been identified and arrest warrants have been issued." Reategui was questioned during the afternoon of 10 June by Judge Ricardo Maturana, who heads Federal Court No. 2 of the city of Tucuman. Details of the questioning were not revealed. Police sources have confirmed that special security measures have been implemented regarding Reategui to prevent any rescue or escape attempt by his comrades in arms. Authorities are concerned because Tucuman Province, where the terrorist was arrested, has been identified as a refugee camp for SL members who clandestinely cross the border. The Maoist guerrillas, infamous for their violent actions, presumably install themselves in Tucuman Province to train Peruvian and Argentine militants who support their ideology.
