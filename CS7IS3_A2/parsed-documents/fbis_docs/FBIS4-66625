According to information obtained from my departments, the pseudowitness is reported to be a former prisoner who was serving several sentences and was known throughout the area, although no doubt better known for his crimes than for his abilities as a witness and an observer. My comments, in fact, pose the issue of the quality of such information. The authors of the article, no doubt seeking something sensational, did not fail to accept as truthful information which, far from helping uncover the truth, has not failed to enflame matters with their very debatable stand, all the while offending the professional dignity of those who, like myself, attempt to carry out a dangerous and very difficult mission to serve the interest of public order. 2. According to his statements, 300 individuals armed with Kalashnikovs had entered the village of Tazoult-Lambese at about 1700 according to a plan that had long since been drawn up in minute detail. How could this witness have been in possession of such information? 3. Furthermore, he claims to have seen two (2) vehicles, one yellow J5 and one Lada automobile going towards the gendarmerie and the police (now between the gendarmerie and the police there is a distance of more than 800 meters as well as buildings). How could he have seen or known if the two vehicles were driving towards two different places, i.e., towards the gendarmerie and the police? 4. He states he saw two Sonacome-make trucks parked in front of the jail's main gate; so where could he have been? 5. The witness says he saw the director rush out of his house and speak to his guards saying: why have you shot your colleague; he goes on to state that two (2) shots were fired at the director, missing him. Now from the outside you cannot see the director giving orders to his subordinates. It is up to you to decide where this witness was in order to see and hear everything that was being said (either at the gendarmerie or at the police). With respect to the professional qualifications of the current director, it should be stated that his professional skills and background are known to the prison administration and in particular to his employer, who is in a better position to appreciate his competence and service record. Regionalism has never been one of the professional criteria known to one and all. Among other qualifications, the current director is an electrician and has in addition a proven record of 27 years of administrative experience. I supply this correction so your readers and public opinion may have the right information.
