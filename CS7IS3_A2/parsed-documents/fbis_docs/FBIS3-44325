According to official figures, 117 villages and enterprises in the county generated an output value exceeding 100 million yuan in 1993. The county's product last year totalled 12 billion yuan, averaging more than 10,000 yuan per capita, increases of 43.2 and 42.2 percent respectively over the previous year. Its gross industrial and agricultural output value amounted to 47 billion yuan, up 36.4 percent over the previous year. A county official attributed the good result to deepening the reform and scientific upgrading; concentrating on the development of industry, especially the service trade; and leasing out small enterprises while organizing enterprise groups. Last year saw the county's industrial enterprises spend 3.5 billion yuan on technical transformation and extending cooperation with research institutions.
