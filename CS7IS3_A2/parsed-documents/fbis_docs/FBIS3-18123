"However, we are satisfied with the chancellor's clear statement that, if the voters so wish, he wants to continue the coalition with the FDP, and with his graphically formulated rejection of a grand coalition." If the CDU relies exclusively on Chancellor Kohl "and nothing else," this is exclusively its own business. Lambsdorff notes with surprise that the CDU is willing to give up the internationally tested trademark of "social market economy." Ludwig Erhard would also be surprised, he says. "For me this results in a call on the FDP not to miss this opportunity. If the CDU speaks only of social and ecological market economy in the future, then the FDP should stick emphatically to the term `social market economy.'" Its ecological commitment has always been undisputed; there has never been any doubt that "social" means consideration for man and also for the environment where man lives. The keyword of social market economy has such a positive connotation that one can only wonder which public relations agency or which party body recommended the CDU to give up this term. Even the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] already speaks of the social market economy, "but fortunately one believes them even less. I, personally, will do everything to pursue the 1994 election campaign with this term." The fact that the chancellor's relationship with social market economy is a bit strange is nothing new, Lambsdorff noted. His repeated claim that he does not want to win the Ludwig-Erhard prize but the Bundestag elections makes it clear how incorrectly he assesses matters. Kohl does not know what Walter Eucken [economist, 1891-1950] called the interdependence of order: One cannot preach market economy in a party congress speech and, at the same time, say that agriculture, mining, and shipyards are excluded. And one cannot, like Kohl, call for the restructuring of the social state and a change of thinking among the Germans and, at the same time, recommend raising the basic wages in the public sector and then present such an agreement as a pilot agreement for all other wage areas. "Raising basic wages always leads to basic unemployment." Kohl had better talk about the exemplary nature of the agreement for the chemical industry. Incorrect Wage Recommendations for the Public Sector "Anything else I hear from the party congress and its economic policy decisions makes me wonder. When Mr. Goehner speaks of new values and an epochal change, I have no idea what that means if I do not get any further explanation. However, this is only a basic program, and, as is known, one can make exceptions from basic principles." One must wait and see what is now going to happen in practice: Will privatizations really be carried out, in particular at the laender level, and will the federal post, for instance, really be changed in such a way that one can speak of privatization and deregulation in the sense of the opportunities for development of an industrial sector? In tax policy it sounds good when one can hear in Hamburg that, on principle, indirect taxes -- "I ask, which ones?" -- are to be raised and direct taxes are to be lowered. However, when one looks at the insufficiently thought-out ideas that were presented at the coalition partner's election congress under the catch word of "family policy," one wonders whether, e.g. the additional burden of 17 to 30 billion German marks [DM] for the introduction of the "family splitting" should be financed from the increase in petroleum tax or in value-added tax? Lambsdorff: "The question is already the answer: Of course, this is completely impossible." And the abolition or limitation of spouses' splitting to finance family splitting would require a restructuring of civilian and social law. The CDU also wants to restructure the social state. "Everybody knows that the institutions of our social state, which are financed by contributions, are at least not unendangered. At the same time, the same CDU wants to introduce a nursing-care insurance that is financed by contributions from employers and employees. This is not a restructuring of the social state, but a further move forward into the social policy dead end." All this is not convincing. However, it is not decisive for the election campaign, either. The election campaign is decided by the answers to the problem of unemployment. Saxon Minister-President Biedenkopf made an analytically remarkable contribution without, however, presenting any solutions. Jobs do not develop in the large companies, but in small and medium-sized companies. "In view of the development of labor costs in Germany, we cannot rely on the expectation that, investments will lead to more and new jobs to the usual extent. Everywhere investments are capital-intensive and are made in such a way that as little human labor as possible is used." FDP Strictly Rejects a Technology Council Thus, jobs develop in the sphere of medium-sized companies, many social institutions, and in the service sector. Germany cannot become a country with just a tertiary sector, it must remain a production site. However, this production site will be operated by far fewer people than in the past. One can compare the current structural development with the mechanization of agriculture 25 or 30 years ago, when labor was reduced there radically and was taken up by industry. A farm, which was worked by 20 people in the past, can now do with the labor of one family and one helper. Similar things are currently happening in the producing industry. "We cannot avoid this trend if we want to remain a high-wage country. And we must remain a high-wage country, if we want to more or less maintain our high social level." Some comments made in Hamburg regarding industrial policy give reason for distrust. Thus, a technology council was recommended, for instance, which is strictly rejected by the FDP as a step toward a republic governed by commissars. The FDP does not want mixing responsibilities. No one in such a technology council -- no chancellor, no economics minister, no expert who gives advice there -- subsequently accepts responsibility if following this advice leads to bankruptcies and unemployment. Responsibility remains with the companies. A mere exchange of opinion and information between industry and companies is, of course, harmless [sentence as published]. The fact that Heiner Geissler harshly attacked the SPD was very satisfying in Hamburg. The SPD is the actual opponent in this election campaign. The SPD's irresponsibility in foreign policy must be laid open. What Scharping sold as his party's attitude at the security conference, the former military defense conference, was as far away from the truth as the sky is from the earth. And what the SPD is spreading in terms of economic policy ideas makes one thing quite clearly: "Voting for the SPD in 1994 means voting for something extremely expensive." The citizens would suffer if the SPD implemented its tax policy slogans. Scharping speaks of unjustified income and assets that could be removed by taxes. Lambsdorff: "Unjustified incomes are probably the interests from the state bonds of Rhineland-Palatinate; and unjustified assets are probably what children inherit from their parents." Whoever wants to put higher taxes on that, obviously has absolutely no idea of the connection between saving, capital formation, investments, and the resulting jobs. Compared With the SPD, the CDU Is the Better Coalition Partner The SPD wants a higher inheritance tax, higher standard values of real estate property, and a higher property tax. In this case, the SPD's ironic election poster of the past "German worker, the SPD wants to take away your villa in Ticino!" might indeed become true. "If the SPD wins, the issue is not the villa in Ticino but the one-family house in Meckenheim. If higher standard values, higher land taxes, higher property tax, and higher inheritance tax coincide, then many of the little people will not be able to maintain their small house, which they built with great effort by means of saving for building purposes. The children will then have to sell their house so as to be able to pay inheritance tax. And this is precisely the opposite of what we need in Germany." Thus, in Lambsdorff's view it is more important to deal with the SPD than to quarrel among each other. "The election campaign was officially opened in Hamburg. It will be decided in economic policy. Here the CDU is not necessarily our ideal as a coalition partner, but if I have the choice between a cold and pneumonia, I prefer the cold."
