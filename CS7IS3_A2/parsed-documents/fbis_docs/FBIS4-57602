He explained that they must wait for the computer technicians to complete their work. The specialists are evaluating a claim made by the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD) regarding differences between official JCE reports and the results offered to the parties on diskette. The investigation reportedly began yesterday following a resolution issued by the JCE itself. Garcia Lizardo said he was unable to give a specific date for the announcement of the winner, but stressed that he would try to make it as soon as possible. Last night, the JCE issued the last official bulletin detailing the presidential vote tallying process. There are still 233 voting tables yet to be tallied, and it was reported that it will still be a while before those results are in. The JCE president announced that next week, the board would decide on the many claims presented at the JCE "so everything is out in the open." He said the members of the JCE would soon be meeting to decide on all of these petitions. The Board is currently considering a request by the PRD for copies of the lists used at the voting tables on election day to compare the lists with each of the tally sheets and then the official results issued by the JCE. The board also must review the charges filed against two of the board's magistrates, who the PRD has accused of having acted in favor of the ruling Social Christian Reformist Party (PRSC). The magistrates are Leonardo Matos Berrido and Jose Henriquez Almanzar. There is a petition outstanding with the board filed by the "Committee of Witnesses of the Civil Pact" for a review of each of the individual voting table tally sheets filed during the election. The committee, known also as the "civil pact follow up committee," is made up of renowned Dominican figures, among whom are German Ornes and Rafael Herrera, the directors of the EL CARIBE and LISTIN DIARIO newspapers; Bishops Agripino Nunez Collado and Jose Arnaiz; and Former Chief Justice Manuel Berges Chuppani of the Supreme Court of Justice.
