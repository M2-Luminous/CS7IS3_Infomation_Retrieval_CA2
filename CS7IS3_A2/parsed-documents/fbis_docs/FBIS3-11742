Although the monitoring started on 1 January, it was increased on 21 February. The Army has continued to intercept and record EZLN short-wave radio communications in the jungle, the mountains, and the city. Communications were intercepted and the exact position of the EZLN delegates and Subcommander Marcos at the cathedral during the peace talks were pinpointed with laser sound-wave emission and reception systems, high-sensitivity microphones, and a satellite. Using this same system, Military Intelligence monitored the EZLN delegates' private conversations, their plans, and decisions. A high-ranking Mexican Army officer, who asked to remain unnamed for security reasons, confirmed these monitoring actions. "Not even Camacho himself is aware that we know everything he said. We know everything. What the Zapatists thought is the only thing we still do not know," he said. The officer said that Military Intelligence installed a sound-tracking system using high communications technology imported from the United States. With the aid of a map of the Cathedral of Peace and a laser system, the Army pinpointed the living quarters of the EZLN delegates and Subcommander Marcos, as well as the dining and meeting areas. "Sound waves reached us via a laser that was inside the Cathedral. The laser beam captured sounds, words, phrases, and entire conversations, and relayed them back to us," he said. During an interview with the officer, he detailed the Military Intelligence's tracking and monitoring systems. The Cathedral of Peace was the monitoring target. That is where negotiations were held beginning on 21 February between Peace Commissioner Camacho, 18 EZLN delegates, Subcommander Marcos, and mediator Bishop Samuel Ruiz. By tracking the Cathedral by satellite, Military Intelligence located the living areas, the delegates, Subcommander Marcos, as well as the security personnel. The officer added that there are still temporary military "bases" in San Cristobal de las Casas and the 31st Military Zone. He said there are boards with radio communication sets, scanners, and telephones at these bases. Other boards hold laser beam systems, parabolic antennas, monitoring and reading systems, and microphone recording systems called "small birds," which read sounds from inside the Cathedral. Four Military Intelligence members work 24-hour shifts at each base. They wear earphones and are in constant communications with the main base. The information is gathered with the high-sensitivity systems. The military prepares a daily report on the conversations monitored and sends it to the 7th Military Region in Tuxtla Gutierrez. The same report is sent to National Defense Secretary Antonio Riviera Bazan. The monitors receive sound waves at the monitoring stations, the location of which the officer failed to mention. "The systems currently in use and during the talks include very sophisticated microphones planted in the outer walls of the Cathedral of Peace. They are very well concealed. They pick up information through the walls," he said. "The only way we could not listen would be if the walls were covered with lead. The laser beam could not penetrate them then and magnetic waves could not pass through." The Mexican Army's actions are carried out clandestinely. A cease-fire and the suspension of military actions were agreed upon by the EZLN and the commissioner to begin the negotiations. Espionage Activities In addition to espionage activities aimed at taping private conversations and negotiations between the delegates and Subcommander Marcos, they also scan EZLN communications in the jungle and mountains and from there to the Zapatist communications center in San Cristobal de las Casas. Even before 1 January, the EZLN had been using a short-wave radio system of clandestine radio communications. Military Intelligence intercepted these EZLN classified conversations. They currently have a file with cassettes including conversations revealing their codes, locations, and activities. EL NORTE was able to obtain some of the cassettes taped by the military. Officially, these activities "do not take place", just like these cassettes "do not exist." The cassettes procured by EL NORTE were forwarded, along with others, to the 7th Military Region. Each of the cassettes are numbered and carry the date when they were taped. Approximately three cassettes carrying Zapatist conversations are taped daily. Taped Messages Some of the taped messages say: "Copy... we must go to the watch tower... pending the saints and check on the men with the large hats" [Copiado ... hay que ir al mirador... pendiente de los santos y checar a los sombrerudos]. Some of the cassettes examined by EL NORTE's correspondent includes several codes indicating the names of bases, leaders, and information exchanges as well as cattle rustling activities and even the 18 February arrangements to transport the Zapatist delegates to the cathedral. Most of the messages are either in tzeltal or tzotzil [Indian dialects], with a few in Spanish. Some of the conversations taped include events like the CNDH's [National Human Rights Committee] visit to several Zapatist regions, the presence of reporters, and some EZLN activities. There are also talks on changing clandestine communications channels and cattle rustling activities. These are some EZLN conversations taped by Military Intelligence and transcribed by EL NORTE: 1. "They were beaten up or something like that, over. I am being asked if they can go ahead with the preparation of the record even if it is for its sake, over... 2. Affirmative, but together with the CNDH. 1. Copy... 2. Together with a copy, and send that bastard with the milk because they left and the only thing you know about is the presence of the federales. 1. Send the big ears over there. If possible, try to brand them. At the house of the big hats, there are cots, refrigerators. Take all you need since you can use them. I do not know how many can come over here either. 2. I do not know, copy. 1. Come on Thursday. Well, if you can make it on Friday, it is to stay. 2. Buffalo says to go to crab [cangrejo]. They had the contract. We were the only ones to fail, but he knows why. I am going to send someone to represent me. You are going to have a talk with the contractor and he is going to tell you what he needs. 2. Copy. 1. If you know that the number of the base, try to get it out of him. 2. If you are hungry just get a hold of a big ears. There are salt bags there, use them. Codes -- big ears mean cattle, buffalo is the EZLN leader, Zapatist soldiers are known as workers, and maseca which means base -- are part of the communications system. According to the taped conversations, the Zapatist bases are identified by names of saints and EZLN operations are coordinated by contractors. Marcos: We Were Already Aware At one of the EZLN camps located in the jungle, Subcommander Marcos pointed out that they were already aware of Military Intelligence surveillance. "We knew we were being taped and spied on during the dialogue and that is why we took some precautions. We, as well as the mediator, were aware they were taping our conversations and everything else we said in private with the commissioner," the subcommander said. "We are also aware that intercepting our communications right now is contrary to the cease-fire and contrary to what they say is a search for peace." As a result of the eavesdropping, the subcommander indicated that they began to modify their codes as well as taking other measures.
