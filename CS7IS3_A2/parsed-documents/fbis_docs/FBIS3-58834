General boredom seemed to be the reason numerous correspondents saved themselves the trip to Brussels. "You have realized that not much is happening here," government spokesman Dieter Vogel apologized for his unexciting statements. Had something escaped the attention of Vogel and the correspondents? Diplomats at the Alliance headquarters in Brussels and in Bonn and other capitals expressed extraordinary satisfaction a few days later. "A new NATO was created on Monday [10 January]," Bonn officials stated jubilantly. "The declaration by the 16 heads of state and government is a significant breakthrough. It was the most important NATO summit since the end of the Cold War." It is true that, nearly unnoticed, the 16 allies set a new course in security and defense policy. The quarrel between the "Europeans" and the "Atlantic-minded" on the role of the European Union in security policy was settled. Not only does the United States accept that, but it even applauds the European allies in the community of 12 for their efforts to create their own "security and defense identity." The defense pact Western European Union [WEU], which the United States viewed suspiciously for many years, is now considered "the defense component of the European Union" by the U.S. ally. Thus, no one else but the community should be authorized to strengthen the "European pillar of the Alliance." This was no controversial subject at the summit. Everything was settled in advance, and NATO is now characterized by a harmony that it has not seen in the past 14 years after the controversial dual track decision on nuclear rearmament was adopted. The trans-Atlantic quarrel over whether the European allies should be allowed to safeguard their own joint security-political interests was more than the topic of debates among insiders on the diplomatic stage. It undermined Washington's determination, particularly that of Congress, to ensure European security and gnawed at the foundations of the Alliance. The squabbling started at the beginning of the 1980's as a result of U.S. readiness to grant the Soviet Union strategic parity. The strategic balance among the superpowers made Moscow's military superiority vis-a-vis Europe appear in a new light. Prior to U.S.- Soviet arms control talks in March 1985, for example, the WEU states wanted to meet -- outside NATO -- to discuss the situation. The United States objected. It insisted on complete U.S. control over security and defense policies so long as it had to protect Europe. If the Europeans had something to say, then they should do so within NATO. Thus, the WEU sank into oblivion for another two years. In 1987, however, the European Community adopted the project of the single market, and the idea of an economic and monetary union gained ground in France. A combination of these two concepts was bound to nourish dreams of a "political union" that would accompany Europe's economic integration with unification in the sphere of foreign and security policy, and later even with a joint defense policy on the basis of the WEU. From that time on, France and Germany did not abandon this topic any more, particularly since the Cold War ended two years later and Europe had to make a larger contribution to its own security. Yet, the Bush administration did not give up its resistance -- not least because it mistrusted France, which was not integrated in the command structure of NATO, and that, with its support for the WEU, aroused the suspicion that it wanted to create a structure of European armed forces outside the U.S. sphere of influence. In May 1992, U.S. NATO Ambassador William Taft stated frankly in Brussels that he did not understand why the 10 states of the European Community that belonged to the military integration of NATO could not make it clear to their French partner "that France's vision of a common defense can only be realized in the institutions of NATO." It is not sufficient to cooperate occasionally with the Alliance, he stressed. However, the U.S. position softened slowly. President George Bush accepted the WEU as early as at the NATO summit in Rome, "if it does not represent a European alternative to NATO." Reginald Bartholomew, Taft's successor, stressed in the autumn of 1992 that the Alliance should remain the supreme "defense forum." However, a change of power at the White House was apparently necessary to transform America's resistance into agreement. Strobe Talbott, the new U.S. deputy secretary of state, admitted shortly before the most recent summit that this resistance against an independent European defense identity was "pure theology" -- which was quite unfounded because, with the exception of France, the European partners were never interested in founding an organization rivaling NATO. Quite the contrary. "We support the WEU as a strong European pillar of the Alliance," the declaration adopted by the NATO summit reads. For the defense officials in Bonn, it is hardly conceivable for WEU countries not to be NATO members. Europe's security-political elements are now forming a complete mosaic. "It was clear that if the United States renounces its theology, the French will also give up their dogma of Charles de Gaulle, according to which strict independence and distance vis-a-vis Washington is to be ensured," a Bonn diplomat pointed out. Bonn officials have always believed that a European defense identity would bring France closer to NATO and not increase the distance between Germany and the Alliance. They were right in the end. The agreement that the WEU may use the military apparatus of NATO is proof of that. In addition, France will occasionally participate in the Alliance's defense planning -- that is, the meetings of the defense ministers. Out of consideration for U.S. feelings, Great Britain and the Netherlands have so far kept away from the Eurocorps. Now that the Strasbourg Armed Forces have been generally accepted, the Netherlands and the Germans want to complete them with a second corps. Great Britain is currently not participating. In fact, time was also on the side of the Europeans after the end of the Cold War. The United States, which reduced its troop presence to one-third in Europe, was hardly in a position to deny the old world an independent defense initiative. Also, it was not possible for the Americans to insist on having the final say while, at the same time, calling on the Europeans to assume their global share of work. This was Clinton's message at the Brussels summit. He considers NATO the authority that is ultimately responsible for the global strategy of the West, including the military one. The European Union, however, should concentrate on economic reconstruction -- with the United States, in the case of Russia -- and, above all, the democratization of East Europe. Allies who are expected to fill these task do not have the feeling that somebody is putting a spoke in their wheels.
