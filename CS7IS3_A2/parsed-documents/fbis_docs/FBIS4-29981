He said the failure of the talks between the Phnom Penh government and the Khmer Rouge faction in Pyongyang recently was due to the fact that the Khmer Rouge put forward proposals that did not totally lend support to the integrity of Cambodia. The Khmer Rouge asked for self-rule, which is impossible for the Phnom Penh government to accept. Meanwhile, on a separate occasion, Prince Ranariddh, first prime minister of Cambodia, reiterated the Phnom Penh government's wish to open a Cambodian Embassy in Jakarta as soon as possible. According to Ranariddh, this will intensify efforts to step up bilateral economic and trade ties with Indonesia. He said that the Phnom Penh government has worked out several incentives to attract foreign investment in Cambodia.
