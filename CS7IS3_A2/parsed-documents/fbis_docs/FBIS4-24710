M. Weng said Wednesday [1 June]. Weng, a legislator, noted that the investment project in suburban Belfast, which calls for a total investment of 157 million British pounds (US$235.5 million), has already been fixed. Britain, which has offered various financial incentives to lure foreign companies to make investment, "invited" Hualon to establish such a mill, he stressed. Hualon is scheduled to enter into an investment subsidy agreement with the British Government on June 9, which was approved by the Executive Commission of the European Union (EU) in early May, he elaborated. Under the agreement, he said, the London government will provide 61 million British pounds (US$91.5 million) in subsidies to the Hualon project. The textile mill is expected to create 1,800 jobs in Northern Ireland, where unemployment reaches as high as 15 percent. Weng made the remarks in reaction to news reports that European textile manufacturers are prepared to bring a complaint against Hualon, The dissatisfaction with Hualon might stem from Hualon's strong competitiveness, Weng said, noting the combined production of its mills in Taiwan and Malaysia has made Hualon the world's largest man-made fiber producer. He pointed out that the Northern Ireland investment plan was made by the Hualon Corp., a key affiliate of the group. The company is chaired by his younger brother Weng Yiu-ming. Meanwhile, a CNA dispatch from London said that the London-based FINANCIAL TIMES Tuesday reported on the controversies surrounding the Hualon project. The EU Executive Commission gave the green light to the Hualon investment plan after intensive lobbying by British officials and parliamentarians, the dispatch quoted the paper as reporting. The paper also revealed that the two Weng brothers have been charged with breach of contract in Taiwan, which the CNA dispatch said has hurt Hualon's reputation.
