Social democrats had seven mandates in Seimas, so they could only support political forces which claim the resignation of the Government, member of labour democratic faction Albinas Lozuraitis told a news conference. According to Lozuraitis, non-confidence in the Government could be expressed just by the right-wing political forces, but they remained silent. The right-wing opposition promised to hold a news conference on Wednesday [26 January] during which it was hoped to hear its opinion on the issues, however, the news conference was canceled. During the news conference Lozuraitis said that the accusations brought by social democrats were not well-grounded. The ideas of social justice declared by them were supported by labour democratic party as well. Decisions adopted by the Government did not differ much from the requirements of social democrats, Lozuraitis noted. Representatives of labour democratic party said that the reason of these accusations could be traced back to the rejection of the draft law on property declaration which was supported by labour democrats.
