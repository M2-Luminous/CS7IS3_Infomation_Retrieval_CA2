FBIS4-33962 "drlat114cp_94005" FBIS-LAT-94-114 Daily Report 11 Jun 1994 MEXICO Envoy: Oil Agreement Possible During Salinas Cuba Visit Envoy: Oil Agreement Possible During Salinas Cuba Visit PA1206161594 Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 1929 GMT 11 Jun 94 PA1206161594 Mexico City NOTIMEX Spanish BFN [Text] Mexico City, 10 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Cuba's ambassador to Mexico Abelardo Curbelo has said that the visit Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari will make to Cuba Monday "is an expression of a political nature." In an interview with NOTIMEX, the diplomat did not rule out the possibility of some cooperation agreement, which may include the oil sector, being signed as part of the Mexican president's activities during his six-hour visit to the island. The diplomat said: "The essence of (Salinas') meeting with Fidel Castro is to increase the ties of friendship that exist between the two countries in all fields." Curbelo added: "This minisummit is an expression of a political, not economic nature, but I will not deny that some kind of cooperation agreements, such as the one Mexpetrol negotiated with Cuban firms to send Mexican crude oil to the Cuban refinery, could be signed." Curbelo explained that the negotiations process between a Cuban firm and Mexpetrol, a subsidiary of Mexican Petroleum, was reached between the two enterprises, without government participation. The diplomat said Cuba and Mexico are continuing negotiations in sectors such as telephone, tourism, and others "about which we prefer not to talk and which we keep quiet about in order not to obstruct them." Curbelo said the Cuban Government permits the participation of foreign capital -- from Mexico as well as from other countries -- and agreements do not depend on the presidential visit or official events because the agreements are among enterprises themselves. The ambassador noted: This is why the signing of agreements do not depend on a deadline or a meeting. If we find that an agreement can be signed Monday, however, it will be done in a symbolic way. Curbelo explained that Cuba is seeking oil agreements with various nations to stabilize oil supplies "based on market conditions and not on preferential price treatment, which is not our objective right now." He said plans for securing stable oil supplies must be based on the Cuban economy's capacity and efficiency within the framework of world market conditions. "These are our objectives," he said. If preferential prices are granted, he explained, this will depend on the other countries, on the possibility of them buying Cuban products, and on Cuba's export capabilities. President Salinas will visit Cuba Monday. He will stay there six hours and review the bilateral agenda and issues of common interest with Fidel Castro. President Salinas will attend a dinner hosted by Castro, and later he will travel to Colombia where he will participate in the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, which will be attended by the presidents or heads of state of Spain, Portugal, and 21 Latin American countries.
