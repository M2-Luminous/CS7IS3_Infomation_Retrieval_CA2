Police stated today that several Turkish and Kurdish organizations have announced their participation in the demonstration against the deportation of Iranian asylum-seekers from Turkey to Iran. The ban is extended to substitute demonstrations which have not yet been registered. The ban has been imposed against the background of the serious clashes between left- and right-wing Turks last weekend when four people were injured. Three arson attacks were carried out on Turkish establishments on Sunday, which police assume were connected to the clashes.
