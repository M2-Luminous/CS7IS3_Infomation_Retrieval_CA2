At the vote in the Federal Executive Committee, which consists of 48 members, four members abstained, FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel told the press. The Executive Committee thus followed the vote of the 12-person FPD Presidium, which had unanimously voted in favor of continuing the coalition with the CDU/CSU on 11 April, upon Kinkel's recommendation. In Bonn it is not doubted that the FDP Congress, which has the last say, will also agree to this decision in Rostock at the beginning of June. Kinkel said that the clarification of the coalition statement has strengthened the FDP's ability to act in material issues. Polls confirm that the Liberals are "on their way up." The prospects for a success of the coalition on 16 October have improved considerably. The CDU and the CSU now must also contribute their share to a positive result. The FDP will pursue the election campaign with a view to the coalition partner, following the slogan "marching separately, attacking together." The FDP chairman announced that the FDP election program, which is to be adopted in Rostock, will be the basis of the negotiations with the CDU/CSU for the next legislative period. He said that the FDP is a guarantor against a red-green coalition and against a grand coalition. In his view, a red-green government would lead to a crisis of trust in foreign policy and to a disaster for the economy and for jobs. A grand coalition would be "autocratic rule by two."
