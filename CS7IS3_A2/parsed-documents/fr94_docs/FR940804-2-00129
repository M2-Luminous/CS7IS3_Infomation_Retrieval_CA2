FR940804-2-00129 FR940804-2-00071 [Docket No. 93&hyph;4] Timothy H. Reese, M.D. Denial of Application On September 29, 1992, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Timothy H. Reese, M.D. (Respondent), of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, proposing to deny his application for registration as a practitioner. The Order to Show Cause alleged that Respondent's registration would be inconsistent with the public interest as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823(f). Respondent, through counsel, requested a hearing on the issues raised by the Order to Show Cause, and the matter was placed on the docket of Administrative Law Judge Mary Ellen Bittner. Following prehearing procedures, a hearing was held in Arlington, Virginia, on May 18, 1993. On March 8, 1994, in her findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommended ruling, the administrative law judge recommended that Respondent's application for DEA registration be denied. No exceptions were filed by either party. On April 8, 1994, the administrative law judge transmitted the record to the Administrator. The Deputy Administrator has carefully considered the entire record in this matter and, pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.67, hereby issues his final order in this matter based upon findings of fact and conclusions of law as hereinafter set forth. The administrative law judge found that the Respondent is an emergency room physician who completed a three-year residency in family practice in 1977, and then became affiliated with medical groups that provided emergency room coverage for various hospitals. Respondent also maintained a small, private practice until April 1989. In 1984, an investigator for the Ohio State Medical Board (Board) obtained from a pharmacy various prescriptions for controlled substances written by Respondent. Most of the prescriptions bore the address of Respondent's residence, and were written for members of Respondent's family. The investigator interviewed some of Respondent's family members that were purportedly issued prescriptions by the Respondent, and they denied ever receiving prescriptions for him. Thereafter, the Board subpoenaed Respondent's patient records, however, Respondent indicated that they had been destroyed. Respondent was then requested to appear before the Board to explain why he wrote the prescriptions at issue. In his deposition before the Board, Respondent states that he did not know what controlled substances were, what schedules certain controlled substances were in, and that he wrote these prescriptions mainly for weight loss. In 1986, the Board's investigation of Respondent concluded with no charges being filed.
