Thus, a source of profiteering is on the decline in both provinces, or at least that is the expected end result. This is the result of an experiment that began in early March, with Operation Agriculture-94 [Agro-94]. [First speaker] "We stop them here. If they are carrying too many products, we confiscate the products and then fill out a confiscation form and send the products back to the units." Local authorities affirm that in Guira de Melena alone, 109 quintals of agricultural products were confiscated between January and March, products that allegedly would have ended up on the black market. So far, 623 people have been arrested. [Second speaker] "Several checkpoints were set up along the access roads to the city as well as measures implemented at distribution centers and grocery stores in Havana, which allow the authorities of the different organizations in both provinces involved in this campaign to work jointly." Someone said: If we do not do something, all Guira de Melena is going to be moved into Havana. In any case, this provincial traffic unit official affirms that these measures are not excessive. [Third speaker] "Any individual citizen can come and solve his immediate problem with a stalk of plantains or a little bit of malanga for home consumption. What we confiscate here are the large quantities seized from people from Havana who come, buy from the farmers, and resell the produce on the black market. "I wanted to clarify this. People are saying that we confiscate even a bag with three potatoes in it at the checkpoints. That is not true". It seems the problem is abating: The flood of bags of agricultural products transported via bicycles, trucks, and cars [words indistinct]. This experiment can serve as an example for the rest of the country.
