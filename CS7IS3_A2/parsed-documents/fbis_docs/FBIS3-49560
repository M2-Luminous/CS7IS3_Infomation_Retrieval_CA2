[Kwasniewski] I am convinced that mutual cooperation will not weaken our countries, but will enhance their domestic and international status. Therefore, I do not consider the course of action being followed by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, who is trying to incorporate Bohemia into a united Europe behind the backs of the Visegrad Group, to be a very fortunate one. I think our position will be better if we proceed together. A race to see who will be first, for example, in the European Union, will not speed up this incorporation process, rather it will slow it down. Apart from this, I think it would be beneficial to intensify economic cooperation in the region, for example, by establishing free trade zones or by adopting a joint course of action to acquire or restore markets, first and foremost, in the East. [Minarik] Developing a security system in Central Europe should also be one of the main areas of cooperation among the Visegrad Four. [Kwasniewski] I am absolutely in favor of us coordinating our steps for entry into security structures, including NATO, because we all face the same problems. First and foremost, we have to convince the West to open up to us, but, on the other hand, we cannot turn our relations with Russia and Ukraine into antagonistic ones. [Minarik] Are you worried by the victory of [Liberal Democratic Party] V. Zhirinovskiy in the Russian elections, especially by his controversial statements about Poland? [Kwasniewski] Zhirinovskiy's victory was remarkable, but the question still is what kind of influence will he have in Russia. The fundamental issue is how will the man who wields real power in the country behave, that is, Boris Yeltsin, who is responsible for the new constitution. It is crucial whether he embarks upon a policy of strengthening the democratic processes and becoming involved in security systems or whether Zhirinovskiy will scare him and he embarks upon a policy of nationalism and restoring power-wielding whims. I think, however, that Boris Yeltsin realizes that Russia needs to cooperate with the West and Europe and that he will also direct his steps toward this end. [passage omitted]
