The statement was given by Army Spokeswoman Berta Edith Vargas de Marroquin, who did not provide additional information on the number or identity of the rebels who sought amnesty or their current whereabouts. She has said the number of URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity] members to be demobilized in September will be less given the events that have resulted from the latest agreements signed in Mexico. They accept the amnesty's legal norms, and the Army is implementing a special protection plan so they will not be attacked after deciding to become part of our society, she has added. The spokesperson has also said the former fighters were members of various guerrilla factions, and they have approached military zone facilities located in different departments of the country; she added they have provided important information on their activities. Marroquin has said: From the military viewpoint, the recent signing of an agreement, which included the United Nations' international verification, has made them reconsider their actions, and the Army is happy about this, because it results in fewer attacks on society. The spokesperson also mentioned the URNG's charges that soldiers executed a peasant in the village of Santo Domingo, Sayaxche, Peten Department. She categorically denied this, saying it involved a military clash that occurred on 3 April in that same place. She has said a unit from the 21st Military Zone in Coban, Alta Verapaz, clashed with 10 terrorists at 1300 that day. A subversive was injured in the clash, and he jumped into the river, leaving behind his weapon, an AR-15 rifle. The Army spokesperson has said she did not know the name of the man who died in Santo Domingo, but she said he had a bullet wound and later drowned. She has said the military is prepared to organize a trip to the place so the media can talk with local residents and confirm the truth. Referring to Peten, Marroquin has said the Army is still concerned about the safety of Guatemalans whom the Belizean authorities have asked to vacate the areas where they settled along the border. She has said the Armed Forces are ready to act in accordance with the situation.
