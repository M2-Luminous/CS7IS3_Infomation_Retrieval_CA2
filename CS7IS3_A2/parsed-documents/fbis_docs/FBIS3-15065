That is what comes to mind when you look at the official hysteria that has unfolded in the United States over the arrest of the Ames couple, who have been charged with spying for Russia. They have been under surveillance for over 10 months. The President was informed of all the suspicions, which did not stop him visiting Moscow and agreeing on a "mature partnership" with Russia. And now suddenly the Ameses have been dragged into broad daylight, like the old marshal's kepi, so that Washington has something to stamp on in anger. One can hardly say seriously that this entire tale of espionage, which has caused a major cold spell in relations between Moscow and Washington, was the reason for this cooling. In actual fact, people in the U.S. capital are bound to realize that Russia, even if the charges against the Ameses do accord with reality, did not go beyond what is permissible. After all, as far as one can judge from articles in the press, Ames informed the Russian special services about U.S. agents operating in Russia. To be honest, Russia's desire to find out which of its citizens is working for a foreign state is quite justified. But what is the real reason then for the demarches, in which all the administration's top leaders have been involved? To tell the truth I do not think that people who link what is happening with the ratification of this year's U.S. intelligence budget are right. After all, the prestige of the CIA has not so much been strengthened as weakened. And, what is more, given the really serious uncertainty in the world it is hardly necessary to use scandalous arrests of foreign agents to persuade congressmen of the need to allocate money for the special services' activity. Those who link the hysteria in Washington with Russia's unexpected and extremely successful Bosnian settlement initiative are closer to the truth. The initiative as such is not the issue, however. Since, if we are talking about the crux of the matter, Moscow's initiative has indeed eased the implementation of the Western approach to the settlement. It has enabled the Serbs to "keep face" and NATO members to avoid an utterly unprecedented operation that would be the prologue to a long and bloody conflict. Russia has found a solution acceptable to everyone. Moreover it risked its soldiers' lives in doing so. So what has driven Washington berserk? In my view, Moscow's successful initiative in the Balkans confirmed once and for all the fundamental changes in Russian foreign policy. Changes for which U.S. strategic planning made no provision at all. After all, over the last few years Washington has already gotten accustomed to feeling that it is the only world leader, the only superpower. This power could dare to ignore world public opinion when missile and bombing raids were inflicted on Iraq. It can even put up with the obvious fiasco of Somalia. And its world lead does not seem to have been disputed at all. At least no alternatives were given. But this time the United States found itself on the sidelines of the settlement process owing to the actions taken by Russia, which it had long since struck off the list of main participants in international politics. But no, in everyone's eyes Russia remained an important, perhaps the most important factor in world politics. A passive inward-looking factor, so to speak. Russia was primarily of interest to the rest of the world because of the dangers that will arise if disturbances or civil war break out in a country that not only has nuclear but also other destructive potential. And so, in order not to "cause trouble," the West, primarily the United States, was willing to provide some financial and economic aid for Russian reforms and mostly talk endlessly about the terms of this support. With the same end in view -- in order not to elicit a pathological reaction from the Russian public -- our country continued to be ritually called a great power and invited to take part in resolving various global problems, without being thought capable of really accomplishing anything. People say that fashion reflects people's ideas. Thus, "Russian refugee" style is gaining a foothold in the world: shapeless pants, a vest, and a shawl worn on top of a sweater with the ends tied at the back. Like it or not, that is how we are seen. Yet suddenly it emerges that Russia, which had already been written off, is beginning not only to announce but also to implement an active foreign policy course. It is not enough that it is resolutely promoting reintegration within the CIS and trying to carry out peacekeeping functions in nearby foreign countries. The West could have somehow put up with that. But a country in crisis is being successful in an area where Western states have been impotently marking time for two years now. It emerges that, despite its own crisis and the occasionally obvious inconsistency in its policy, Russia still has considerable prestige, and quite possibly not just in the Balkans.... The question now is, as France's LE FIGARO wrote, how far the United States is prepared to agree to the expansion of Russian influence. At the moment Washington is displaying its irritation. Someone has been very skillful and timely in bringing up the Ameses. After all, the incident is extremely useful for those circles that have no interest in a real partnership between the West and Russia. And these circles exist in virtually all countries. MAINICHI SHIMBUN has just reported that U.S.-Japanese staff exercises are still being conducted, based on the possibility of a Russian attack on Hokkaido. Now, when the sides are reassessing their own role and the role of partner, those people who feel uncomfortable in the present situation may quite easily see their chance. They could quite easily try to use the cold spell to once again dig up the "enemy image" that we are long since sick of. Yet one cannot say that their plans are totally groundless. The train of events shows that the switch to new relations with the West has by no means become irreversible. The old fears and old ways rear their heads again at the slightest complication. And menacing speeches can already be heard in the U.S. Congress. A Russian diplomat has already been expelled like during those memorable times. And this at a time when the U.S. President has over the last few days clearly been backpedaling, reluctant to jeopardize the whole set of Russian-U.S. relations. However the conflict seems to have the potential to escalate on its own. A great deal now depends on Russia. It must retain calm dignity. One can hardly talk seriously about its meeting the absolutely unacceptable demand for the unilateral cessation of intelligence activity in the United States. But it is also important not to succumb to provocation today. We are by and large being incited to make brusque statements. Firmness is what is needed here. It is necessary to show the United States and other Western states from the example of recent crises that a partnership with Russia is indeed a vital necessity for everyone. And that the rules of conduct within this partnership are the same for everyone. That there are not junior partners who must know their place and not interfere in the adults' conversations and actions. Nor are there any older partners who have the right to put children in their place or even just vent their spleen on them.
