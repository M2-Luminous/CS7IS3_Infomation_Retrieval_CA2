President Vaclav Havel has supported the possible attacks, while Premier Vaclav Klaus was opposed to them and said on Monday [14 February] that he was "fully" convinced that NATO would not launch any attacks in Bosnia. In the independent MLADA FRONTA DNES Jiri Leschtina writes under the title "The Protracted Malaise of Foreign Policy" that the ultimatum has once again laid bare "the insufficient coordination of stances pronounced by the president, premier, and head of diplomacy (Josef Zieleniec)." "At the moment when NATO made the decision the president and foreign minister were thousands of kilometers away on a state visit (to India). But this was by no means a reason for the premier to speak in Prague about the Czech Republic's fear of outside intervention in Bosnia, followed by the president in Bangkok expressing his satisfaction with the North Atlantic Alliance's "baring its teeth." "Given the present level of technology, what prevented Vaclav Havel, Vaclav Klaus, and Josef Zieleniec from coordinating their vocabulary?," Leschtina asks. He says that this was probably the "old well-known grating" between the president, premier, and foreign minister, "which has already produced the premier's and foreign minister's different stances on the creation of a commission to negotiate with the Sudeten Germans, and on the shoot-out between Vaclav Klaus and Vaclav Havel over Rushdie's visit." Leschtina says that these were only matters concerning the Czech Republic and its neighborhood, but warns that "the Czech state cannot afford differences of opinion between its president and premier on the possible bombardment of a not remote European country." "There exists a mechanism (for leaders) to use the same vocabulary: the Council for Foreign Policy Coordination, whose existence was advocated by Zieleniec and which comprises the president, the premier, the foreign minister, the heads of the coalition parties, and other officials. But it has met only once since November. Now, during one of Europe's most fatal moments, it has a good opportunity to prove its viability," Leschtina stresses. In the left-orientated RUDE PRAVO Robert Dengler writes that "however much Klaus may now be repeating that his and the president's stances differ only in emphasis, the premier's attitude last week was unequivocal: Not to bombard, because it would be unfair to the people, producing only further massacres and disasters. In fact there was no difference in emphasis, but the two attitudes are entirely different." "The ensuing confusion around clarification of the real official stand (on such a serious matter as the war in the Balkans), can eventually threaten the credibility of figures (?individual) and create the impression that not even statements by constitutional officials are reliable," Dengler stresses. In the right-oriented daily TELEGRAF Martin Danes writes: "The fact that keeping a certain distance from the conflict does not improve, to say the least, the Czech Republic's fame abroad, has probably been comprehended even by Foreign Minister Zieleniec, who had rather espoused the premier's stance at the beginning. Zieleniec's silence during the president's (Asian) trip, on which he accompanied him, amounts to agreement with his views." The independent daily LIDOVE NOVINY asked Jiri Payne, chairman of the parliamentary Foreign Committee, to comment on the differences. Payne, a member of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS), of which Klaus is the chairman, said: "If Vaclav Klaus' view on such a serious matter differs from that of another important constitutional official, he must have his own reasons for this. But the difference need not be essential. Each of them has different information.... It does not mean that he who resolutely supports a solution by force has more morals than he who hesitates. It is simply a question of weighing the pros and cons. I personally do not feel that I have enough information to take a clear-cut stance." The chief of staff of the Czech Army, Jiri Nekvasil, told LIDOVE NOVINY that "to advise NATO whether or not to launch aerial intervention in Bosnia would not be correct, the more so because the Czech Air Force would not take part in the attack. I can only confirm that the armies of the alliance have equipment which can precisely hit selected targets... But the question must be asked what would follow."
