In a statement made in Makhairas after a memorial service for Grigorios Avxendiou, Kliridhis said that in his first report the UN secretary general will not say much. He added that the report will say that both sides have accepted the UN secretary general's proposals in principle and will call on them to intensify their efforts so that a way to implement the CBM's is found. Kliridhis said that Butrus-Ghali will attribute responsibilities, if any, in his next report, which will be submitted three weeks after the first one. Responding to a question, the president said that he will not go to Athens now because there is nothing new.
