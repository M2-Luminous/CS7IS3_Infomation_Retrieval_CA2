FBIS3-34502 "drnes027_k_94013" FBIS-NES-94-027 Document Type:Daily Report 9 Feb 1994 IRAQ U.K's Major Ridiculed Over Kurdish `Safe Haven' JN0802153594 Baghdad INA in Arabic 1130 GMT 8 Feb 94 JN0802153594 Baghdad INA Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Text] Baghdad, 8 Feb (INA)--The newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH says that the problem with British Prime Minister Major is that he, just like the other politicians whose calculations have proven to be wrong, thought that playing the Kurdish card would result in destabilizing the Iraqi regime. The end result is that he has placed his country and the U.S. Administration at an impasse. In its editorial today, the paper ridicules Major's statements that "the Kurdistan region is safe," wondering when it was actually more safe -- now or before the anti-Iraq aggression. The paper answers this question, saying that all fair-minded people, even Major himself, cannot deny that the Iraqi Kurdistan region enjoyed stability, security, a high standard of living, as well as the potential for rapid growth before the onset of the aggression. AL-JUMHURIYAH adds that, before the aggression, there was a kind of tranquility along the Iraqi-Turkish borders--a tranquility that was marred by only few minor clashes between the Kurdish Workers Party and the Turkish authorities. The paper points out the current situation in the Kurdistan region, including the military interventions there, as well as the Turkish and Iranian attacks on some positions in the region. It also mentions the incidents witnessed in southeastern Turkey, which have been stepped up since the anti-Iraq aggression. The paper also speaks of the impasse in which Major placed the U.S. Administration, as manifested by the presence of the so-called Hammer Force in the region. The opposition is wagering on the continued deployment of this force. However, this force is stuck there. It can neither stay there forever, nor withdraw, because it has failed to turn the region into a "safe haven." Likewise, this force cannot establish a Kurdish state there, because Turkey, Iran, Syria, Iraq, and other states strongly oppose this. AL-JUMHURIYAH adds: There are indications of another impasse in Iraqi Kurdistan. For the armed agents in northern Iraq are confused. Worse still, they feel that they have reached a dead end, and that they have been exposed as terrorist gangs that are willing to slay one another for trivial reasons, to betray Kurdish nationalism, and to collude with the enemies of Kurds just to maintain their oppression of our Kurdish people. The paper goes on to say: The people of Kurdistan have begun to speak publicly, expressing their desire to return to Iraq's lap. They are singing the praises of His Excellency President Saddam Husayn and writing graffiti expressing their sentiments toward his excellency the president. Concluding its editorial, the paper says that our Kurdish people's return to Iraq's lap would grant them the warmth, security, and stability they have been denied in the false "safe haven" created and protected by the British and Americans. The "safe haven" the British and Americans created is even robbing its creators of security, the paper maintains.
