FR941230-1-00016 FR941230-1-00004 2. Definition of loan. Any transaction that is treated as a loan for federal tax purposes is a loan of proceeds. Generally, transactions that result in an expenditure of proceeds, such as a grant, do not give rise to a loan. However, tax increment and similar financings, in which proceeds are, in form, granted to a nongovernmental person with the debt service on the bonds to be paid from incremental tax revenues may be treated as a loan if the recipient of the grant makes special agreements regarding payment of the taxes (for example, an agreement not to contest the assessment). 3. Tax assessment bond exception. Section 141(c) provides that certain tax assessment loans are not treated as loans in applying the private loan financing test. A tax assessment loan is a loan that arises from the imposition of a tax or assessment of general application for specific, essential governmental functions. The proposed regulations generally define essential governmental function to have the same meaning as under section 7871. To qualify for this special exception, owners of business and nonbusiness property must be eligible to make assessment payments on an equal basis. Guidance is provided on the types of special arrangements regarding payment of an assessment that cause the assessment to fail the equal basis requirement (for example, due-on-sale clauses). The proposed regulations clarify that loans qualifying under the tax assessment loan exception may still result in satisfaction of the private business tests. G. Sections 1.141&hyph;3 and 1.141&hyph;6␣Measurement of use and allocation and accounting rules 1. Measurement of private business use. The proposed regulations provide specific rules regarding the measurement of private use. For facilities that are simultaneously used for both private business use and government use, the regulations generally permit the use of reasonable methods of measuring the private business use. Thus, for a building with separate portions used for private business use and government use, the amount of private business use is based on the relative portion of useable space used for a private business use. If the private use occurs at different times, the private business use is based on a comparison of private business use to total use. Except as described below for output facilities, annual periods are used to measure the amount of private business use and the private business use is equal to the greatest amount of private business use in any annual period. As under the industrial development bond regulations, the proposed regulations do not provide that private business use is measured over the entire term of the issue, except for output facilities. For example, a stadium that is used for private business use 30 days out of a total use of 200 days in one year generally meets the 10 percent private business use test (regardless of the use of the facility in other years). 2. Financing a portion of a mixed use facility. If a facility is used for private business use in an amount that would cause the bonds to be private activity bonds, in many circumstances the proposed regulations permit tax-exempt bonds to be issued for the government use portion without causing the bonds to meet the private business use test. This special rule applies only if the government use portion of the facility is a separate and discrete portion of a facility (such as a floor of a building), or an undivided ownership interest in an output or similar utility facility. In applying this rule, an allocable portion of the cost of common areas may be financed as government use. Generally, if the private business use of facility does not occur in a separate and discrete portion of the facility or in an output or similar utility facility, the proposed regulations do not permit tax-exempt financing of any portion of that facility. For example, for a stadium used 30 percent of the time for private business use, tax-exempt bonds may not be issued to provide 70 percent of the cost of that stadium. 3. Allocation of proceeds to expenditures. The proposed regulations provide that the allocation of proceeds to expenditures for purposes of section 141 must be made in the same manner as and consistently with allocations of proceeds for arbitrage purposes under §1.148&hyph;6. As further described below, the proposed regulations would amend §1.148&hyph;6 to provide significant flexibility regarding when these allocations are required to be made.
