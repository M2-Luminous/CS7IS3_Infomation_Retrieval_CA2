The Turkish side has expressed its satisfaction with this. But you cannot say the same thing about the protection the Turkish side is offering our staff who serve in Turkey, because recently, unidentified people have not only harassed and threatened these staff, in word and deed, but they have even targeted their family members. The Turkish side's attention is drawn to the repercussions that similar actions might have, for which Ankara would be responsible. It is demanded that every measure be adopted to end the harassment and protect our official staff and their families in Turkey. All of the above was stressed in relevant representations made to the Turkish Foreign Ministry and to the Turkish Embassy here, the Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement concludes.
