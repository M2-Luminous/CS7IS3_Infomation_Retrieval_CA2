Medvedev, president of Rosavtotrans, by M. Yevsyukov, deputy chief editor of AVTOMOBILNYY TRANSPORT; date and place not given: "Our Task is to Protect the Interests of the Founders (A conversation with the president of the Russian motor transport joint-stock company `Rosavtotrans')"] [Text] At the threshold of the new year the editorial staff of AVTOMOBILNYY TRANSPORT has applied to the president of the "Rosavtotrans" company, V. Medvedev, with a request to tell about its work and its prospects. We report his conversation with M. Yevsyukov, deputy chief editor. [Yevsyukov] Vasiliy Dmitriyevich, there is now in principle no division whatever, at least officially, of motor transport into general-use and departmental transport, although the tasks and the work which general-use motor transport performed have remained. You won't get away from them under any privatization, setting-up of joint-stock companies, etc. By the way, all this was intended precisely to improve the work of motor transport in servicing the top priority needs of society. However, as yet all has not gone well with this. The Russian motor transport joint-stock company "Rosavtotrans" has now been created and is in operation. Please tell us about its work, functions, and tasks. [Medvedev] Let's begin with the fact that "Rosavtotrans" has been created on a strictly voluntary basis. It doesn't perform any state functions and commissions whatsoever. Territorial joint-stock companies, which basically all general-use motor transport enterprises have become members of, have created it. The tasks and functions of the company are defined by its charter. What functions would I call the most important? At the present stage the most important function, in my opinion, is to protect the interests of the possessors of general-use motor transport in the structures of state power. This is against the ministries of transportation, finance, economics, and defense (many of our enterprises are rather firmly connected with that ministry) and with other state power structures where general-use motor transport has interests. The next basic functions are the questions of the material-technical support of our enterprises and the coordination of their work. This is the basic group of questions on which our company must work. We don't have at our disposal any official powers whatsoever with respect to the territorial associations and enterprises that are the founding members. We perform only that volume of work and only those functions which the founders have entrusted to us. That is, both planning and the work itself goes from the bottom to the top. What now are the main problems today and what are the ways of resolving them? One of the main problems is the presently inadequately developed system for the realization through our company of the interests of the founders in the state power structures. Old approaches frequently prevail in these structures, including the Russian Federation Ministry of Transportation. They think there that their decisions are, as it is said, final and irrevocable and all these decisions must be unhesitatingly implemented in the localities. [Yevsyukov] And what, this is wrong? In my opinion that's the way it should be. All decisions should be implemented; only then will there be order. [Medvedev] All that is true, but I don't want to talk about that. You see the whole point is how these normative documents and legislative acts are to be prepared. As I have already said, our company has not been endowed with any official functions relative to motor transport structures in the localities but must protect their interests. But how is this to be done? Primarily through tracking, monitoring, and participation in the development of all normative documents. However, we all have come out of a single power structure--the Russian Ministry of Motor Vehicle Transport. In its time it was entrusted with both official functions and protection of the interests of the enterprises. We're all from there: both the workers of the Ministry of Transportation, the Department of Motor Vehicle Transport, and our company. That is why there remains a psychological inertia among executives and a command style of work survives. Of course they ought to constantly bring us in and we should find the time and the opportunities to participate in the development of all normative documents. However, it doesn't always turn out that way. Frequently the workers of the Department and the Ministry of Transportation think that they know everything without us. This applies to document elaborations, the distribution of budget resources, and other questions. And we, probably, don't announce ourselves loudly and persistently enough. But nevertheless a reciprocal "rubbing" takes place. I think that not much time will be needed for mutual recognition and mutual understanding to be established. Otherwise neither the ministry nor we will be able to operate. The second main direction of our activity, as I have already said, is the work regarding the material-technical support of the company's enterprises. One cannot assume that each of the company's 2,200 enterprises will be able to completely resolve independently all the questions of material-technical support. Today already about 60 percent of these enterprises have been privatized and the remainder are in the stage of becoming joint-stock companies. Delays are occurring because there are complications with the privatization of the numbered vehicle convoys. [Yevsyukov] Incidentally, about the privatization of these convoys. Has the Russian Government's decree on this question finally been issued? [Medvedev] As yet there is no such decree. Its draft has long since been prepared by the Ministry of Transportation with the direct participation of the "Rosavtotrans" company and been endorsed by the Ministry of Defense. However, it hasn't been signed as yet. [Yevsyukov] But the fact is that there already was a decision of the State Committee on the Administration of State Property regarding this question, where everything was specified already. Only a decision of the government was needed. Why is it being obstructed? [Medvedev] Both the interests of the state and of our vehicle convoys should be provided for in the government's decree. But the decision of the Russian Federation State Committee on the Administration of State Property is one-sided. Only what the vehicle convoy should do and how it should answer to the state for the performance of mobilization functions is stipulated there. But what the state should do to ensure the performance of these functions is not indicated there. And if it is not the system will not work. The fact is that today, given such extremely high prices and the size of interest rates on bank loans (210 percent and more), it is practically impossible to acquire the motor vehicles needed to perform mobilization functions. That is why the state should stipulate its own obligations to the vehicle convoys in the decree. These are both preferential financing and tax abatements and a number of other questions which would contribute to ensuring the mobilization readiness of the vehicle convoys. So that the question of the privatization of numbered vehicle convoys is very difficult and it is precisely among that group in which the company must protect the interests of its founders in the state power structures. However, let's return to material-technical support. Now it is being implemented on a fundamentally different basis. If before we shared what the government allotted us, now there is nothing to share. Go, come to an understanding with the producers and suppliers, and decide all these questions. Of course, it's difficult even to assume that every enterprise could send specialists to solve supply questions to hundreds of plants located in different points of the former USSR and especially abroad. Suppose, let's assume, one is to obtain buses at the Lvov plant or trucks in Belarus and deliver them to a location? These are already different states. Licenses to export motor vehicles and fuel and a great deal more of what is needed are required. It is precisely these functions that the "Rosavtotrans" company will undertake. We conclude the appropriate contracts with our founders and with suppliers and perform this work. [Yevsyukov] And the company, I mean its staff, has something to do with this? [Medvedev] Questions about the upkeep of the company's executive staff are decided by its founders. In the case in question they have voted for the transfer to us of 2 percent for the KamAZ group of motor vehicles and 1.2 percent of the value of any other motor vehicles delivered. One must say that this money is not enough even to maintain the staff. In order to make ends meet we have to engage in other work which is not always connected with our founding members. We do work on material-technical support not only in Russia and the CIS countries, but also, as they say now, with the countries of the far abroad. In particular, today we are resolving the question of acquiring second-hand motor buses of the Mercedes, MAN and Magirus firms which we can operate for three to six years. The cost of such motor buses and their service lives correspond with the lives and cost of our new motor buses. [Yevsyukov] What number are we talking about? [Medvedev] For now the number is in the tens. However, we intend already this year (1993) to acquire 300-400 of them and to bring the number up to 1000 in the beginning of 1994. If we can implement these plans, we will deprive the Likino plant of the privileges it enjoys as the monopoly producer of urban motor buses in Russia. It constantly dictates its conditions to us which now and then are not well-founded and simply impracticable. By this we will force it to enter into a competitive struggle. [Yevsyukov] But don't you regret it? You see, when there's no demand for Likino motor buses, the plant may go bust and western firms with their motor vehicles past their best will win the Russian market. Our automobile industry will find itself in a great state of neglect in the process and perhaps will, in general, be overwhelmed by the West. [Medvedev] I simply don't see other ways of restraining the overchargings of this plant. No kind of diplomacy and logic helps. That is why we have come to such a decision. And what they will come to I don't know. Let them think themselves. The market is the market. In the end we are, you see, bound to transporting tens and hundreds of millions of passengers everyday and we cannot wait while our motor bus producers mature to an understanding of the necessity and extreme importance of performing this task. There is, it is true, hope in KamAZ, which has developed and approved a program for the production of urban motor buses, their output to begin in 1994 and the volume of production to be brought up to 10,000 in 1996-1997, which would supply our needs. [Yevsyukov] Vasiliy Dmitriyevich, you have said that one of the main tasks of the company is the coordination of the activity of its participants, its founders. How is this to be done? [Medvedev] First of all, I would like to say what is now to be understood under the term "coordination." This is not at all an instruction to someone to carry how much and when, to deliver how many motor vechicles, to whom, and to where, etc. The most important thing now is to determine conditions on the transportation market. Transport operations in the pure form now frequently become disadvantageous and unprofitable. The volumes of transport operations are shrinking rather sharply. What is a motor transport enterprise, which has motor vehicles, a production base, and, what is the main thing, people to do under these conditions? If it is to do nothing and to guess when transport operations will develop, then it can collapse completely. And meanwhile during the last two years the volume of transport operations has shrunk almost in half in connection with the reduction in the volumes of industrial production and construction. This means that one has to reorganize one's work. We have for a long time already and at all levels talked about the need for a drastic increase in the volumes of transport and dispatching work. But until now these were basically appeals and declarations. This work was perceived as unnecessary trouble by the transport workers on the spot. There were cargoes, there were orders, and there was no point in engaging in such turbulent business as dispatching. Now life is developing so that if one is not closely and seriously engaged in transport dispatching, then the existence and survival of general-use motor transport will be under great question. It needs to be said that this business is indeed profitable and promising. One needs simply to investigate it carefully as one should, comprehend, and, finally, to master oneself. One needs to change priorities. Of course, this is not so simple, but it must be done. And some, although so far not so many of them, are beginning to engage in this work in real earnest. It needs to be said that satisfactory results are being obtained. For example, in Sergiyev Posad the former Zagorsk vehicle convoy has built a small terminal and the enterprise has 17 percent of the total revenue from it. And only 15-17 persons (not counting the drivers of international hauls) of the more than 1,500 persons employed work at this terminal. Now the decrease in the volume of transport operations for this motor transport enterprise is not extreme. It is able to increase the volumes of transport and dispatching services and to live normally and develop. That is why we are thinking of examining questions of the reorientation of the direction of the work of freight transport at the company's council of directors at the end of 1993. And generally speaking, one needs to anticipate by several steps the implementation of the policy and tactics of the work of the company's enterprises. Now, as I have already said, the volumes of transport operations are falling. What's the use if we only ascertain this? One needs to find, and quickly besides, ways out of the situation that has been created. We have a powerful production base. It must be utilized efficiently, precisely in those directions which are the most effective from the viewpoint of the organization of the transportation process and the survival of the motor transport enterprises. Finally, I want to say that we, in any case very many, have retained a great deal of inertia both in thought and in actions. Because of that, under present conditions a great deal of work and significant efforts and expenditures of resources are to no purpose and futile and yield only losses. On the other hand, inertia is manifested in inaction and the anticipation of edicts, recommendations and help from above. One needs to get free of this. One needs to understand once and for all that if we won't take care of ourselves, no one will do it. One can make a fuss, complain, and appeal to all levels of authority as much as one wants. But it will be the same as appeals to God. Pray as much as you want, but in order for there to be some results, one needs to use one's head, hands, and often even feet, by oneself. As the saying goes, "God is God, and you're not bad either." Of course, the government will give us concrete assistance. It is even now giving it in the area of passenger transport operations. But such help, I think, will not be increased and will be reduced or transferred to local budgets in due course. That is why I emphasize again that all the structures of the "Rosavtotrans" company, especially the regional ones, need to foresee events and work with anticipation. [Yevsyukov] But can the company implement large-scale regional or interregional projects? Is there some kind of centralized fund for this? [Medvedev] We don't have any such funds at our disposal. Only the founders themselves can create such a fund. It could be at the disposal of the company, which the founders constantly monitor. But as yet we don't have such a fund. This, of course, does not mean that it is not needed; the financial resources needed for this simply don't exist. As it is said, who would give us credit and we, for now, aren't able to give credit to anybody. Today the financial status of our motor transport enterprises is such that they find money for wages and fuel with difficulty. However, such a fund is extremely necessary and, I think, the company will create it in due course. But we hope that the state also will not turn its back on our problems. We will try not to allow this. It is very fashionable now to allude to foreign experience, to the achievement of a market economy. But I would like to emphasize that in all countries the comprehensive transport and dispatching servicing of the population and of enterprises is always under the control and protection of the state and the government. That is why terminal servicing systems are highly developed there. This enhances a country's economy as a whole, and reduces enormous losses of state resources for transportation costs in the national economy. [Yevsyukov] Vasiliy Dmitriyevich, you talked about the Zagorsk motor transport enterprise. Incidentally, we also wrote about it in our magazine (AVTOMOBILNYY TRANSPORT, No 2, 1993. "`SPAK' Goes Abroad"). Are there many such enterprises in the company? [Medvedev] There has been some animation during the past two years but I regard this as no more than animation. There are individual enterprises where leaders with initiative have been engaged in this business, but no more than that. [Yevsyukov] In short, these are individual episodes and not an overall trend? [Medvedev] Yes, one can say that roughly. Of course, one cannot expect that in the very near future all enterprises may take such a path. However, in the European part of Russia, in the Far East, and even in the Urals (for example, Chelyabinsk) such work is proceeding rather actively. But in many oblasts as yet a "stirring-up," as they say, is going on. [Yevsyukov] How do you see the prospects for the development of general-use motor transport in 1994? [Medvedev] Unfortunately, I can say nothing about an increase in the volumes of freight hauls. Here, as I have already said, we need to earnestly reorient ourselves to transport dispatching so as not to lose our production potential and not to allow a reduction of the specialists and workers we employ. Our other task is not to lose the ability to manage the sector (upravlyayemost otrasli). This is not only an important production factor but also a psychological one. When we talk about the ability to manage, then right away we recall collegiums, all kinds of meetings, conferences, aktivs, etc. However, the fact is that one should not consider the ability to manage only from the viewpoint of dressing-downs, reprimands, etc. Under present conditions the ability to manage is necessary in the interests of realizing the goals both of society as a whole and of the company and each of its founders. There is a host of such problems which cannot be resolved one by one. Take the gathering of the harvest. Society now incurs a great deal of losses and waste because of the poor ability to manage motor transport in these operations. We intend to work on these questions in the coming year. In the name of the workers of "Rosavtotrans" I would like to wish all motorists of Russia and all readers of the magazine a happy New Year and to wish them good health, success and personal happiness. [Yevsukov] Thank you, Vasiliy Dmitriyevich. The editorial staff heartily joins you and on its part sends wishes for health and success to all workers of the "Rosavtotrans" company.
