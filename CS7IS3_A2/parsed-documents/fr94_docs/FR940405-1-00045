FR940405-1-00045 FR940405-1-00013 The ability of tobacco smoke to elicit irritation may be enhanced by low relative humidity and varies according to concentration [Ex. 4&hyph;239]. Irritating components of ETS are contained in both the vapor phase and the particulate phase (see Tables III&hyph;6 and III&hyph;7). These effects have been studied in both experimental (e.g., animals studies; clinical and chamber studies on humans) and field (e.g., surveys and epidemiological studies) studies. The NRC report [Ex. 4&hyph;239] summarized these studies and concluded that even though the specific components of ETS that cause irritation were not identified, the overall effects were eye and throat irritation and immunological responses. Weber [Ex. 4&hyph;317] reported the results of a field study that included 44 workrooms where smoking was taking place. Eye irritation was reported by 52 out of 167 workers. Nonsmokers reacted more than smokers to the ETS; 36 of the 52 workers who reported eye irritation at work were nonsmokers [Ex. 4&hyph;317]. Asano et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;18] reported significant eye irritation, as measured by blinking rates, in both healthy smoking and nonsmoking adults following exposure to ETS. Nonsmokers reported more eye irritation than smokers did. Effects such as eye irritation and nasal stuffiness were reported to OSHA in comments to the docket [Exs. 3&hyph;38, 3&hyph;58, 3&hyph;59, 3&hyph;188, 3&hyph;438D, 3&hyph;440A]. 3. Pulmonary Effects Much of the literature relevant to the association between non-cancerous health effects and ETS has focused on children. Because children are undergoing development and maturation, they are not physiologically equivalent to adults exposed to the same conditions. Therefore, findings in studies conducted with respect to ETS and children may not be directly applicable to adults. However, a number of studies have investigated the relationship between ETS and pulmonary health effects in adults. Studies which are restricted to adults vary by numerous factors, such as the population studied, the measures used to estimate exposure to ETS, and the physiologic and health outcomes examined. The studies also varied in the consideration of potential confounders. A number of studies have found relationships between ETS exposure and pulmonary health effects. These studies have: (1) used pulmonary function tests, which may be more sensitive than methods used in other studies, to detect physiological changes occurring in the small airways of the lungs (e.g., forced mid-expiratory flow rate (FEF 25&hyph;75 ), and forced end-expiratory flow rate (FEF 75&hyph;85 )); (2) studied older populations with a longer history of exposure to ETS; (3) stratified the level of ETS exposure with significant findings more likely to occur in persons with higher exposures; and (4) more frequently found significant changes in lung function in men, although adverse pulmonary effects to ETS have also been shown in women. The following discussion summarizes the results of these studies [Exs. 4&hyph;18, 4&hyph;37, 4&hyph;62, 4&hyph;148, 4&hyph;173, 4&hyph;176, 4&hyph;178, 4&hyph;180, 4&hyph;209, 4&hyph;210, 4&hyph;278, 4&hyph;295, 4&hyph;321].
