Hryb said that changes may be introduced in the text of Article 5 of the Belarusian-Russian agreement to avoid changes in the Belarusian Constitution. In line with the existing Belarusian Constitution, the Republic's national bank is a the only body with the right to shape monetary policy independently. In line with the Russian-Belarusian agreement, these functions are carried out by the Russian Central Bank under conditions of a single monetary system. Asked by INTERFAX to assess the initiative by Kazakh President Nazarbayev on the creation of a Euro-Asian union, Hryb said that so far the idea had not been discussed officially. Meanwhile, the CIS executive secretary Ivan Korotchenya in an interview with Interfax on the same day in Minsk said that Nazarbayev's idea suggests the thought for closer unity among the CIS countries, though the European model of the community is prefered by many Commonwealth states. Korotchenya believes that it will take time for CIS states to agree to Nazarbayev's idea. He did not rule out the probability of the fact that with time the leaders of the CIS states may return to the idea of a Euro-Asian union.
