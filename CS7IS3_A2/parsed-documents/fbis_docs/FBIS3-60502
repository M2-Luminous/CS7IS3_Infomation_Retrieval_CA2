Unlike last year, when more than 400 cases were recorded, this year there have been only 11. This proves that the regular information given to the citizens on how to protect themselves from that disease has begun to yield results. Furthermore, teams of experts regularly check the herds in the private and public sectors and conduct examinations, after which any animal suffering from brucellosis is destroyed immediately.
