SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This interim final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 929 [7 CFR Part 929], as amended, regulating the handling of cranberries grown in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon, Washington, and Long Island in the State of New York, hereinafter referred to as the ``order''. The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act''. The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing order provisions now in effect, cranberries grown in 10 states are subject to assessments. It is intended that the assessment rate as issued herein will be applicable to all assessable cranberries during the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year beginning September 1, 1994, through August 31, 1995. This interim final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. There are approximately 30 handlers of cranberries grown in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon, Washington, and Long Island in the State of New York who are subject to regulation under the cranberry marketing order and approximately 1,050 producers of cranberries in the regulated area. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of cranberry producers and handlers may be classified as small entities. The cranberry marketing order, administered by the Department, requires that the assessment rate for a particular fiscal year apply to all assessable cranberries handled from the beginning of such year. The budget of expenses for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year was prepared by the Committee, the agency responsible for local administration of this marketing order, and submitted to the Department for approval. The members of the Committee are producers of cranberries. They are familiar with the Committee's needs and with the costs for goods, services, and personnel in their local area and are thus in a position to formulate an appropriate budget.
