One of the flights departed Friday morning but did not receive permission from the Chinese Government to land in Shanghai en route and was forced to return to Nagasaki. The flight's routing was changed to go via Taipei and both flights departed around 7 P.M. A total of 263 Vietnamese refugees had been scheduled to be repatriated, but one withdrew a request to return to Hanoi prior to Friday's departure. The refugees had arrived in Japan by boat between November 1989 and October 1993 and were being held in the detention center and a temporary reception center in Omura, Nagasaki Prefecture. The Geneva-based UNHCR returned about 200 Vietnamese from Japan to their home country under a voluntary repatriation scheme last year.
