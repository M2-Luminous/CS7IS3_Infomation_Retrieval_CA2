[Amorim] I believe that a very important step was taken with the approval of the Social Emergency Fund [FSE] by Congress. This approval will allow the government to eliminate the public deficit, thus taking the first step toward controlling inflation. [EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO] Is the success of the economic plan still endangered by any political hurdle? [Amorim] Evidently everything can be politically negotiated, but the most difficult aspect of the plan was really related to the approval of certain taxes, which had to be debated within the framework of the constitutional revision. This difficulty has already been overcome, in a first round. We trust that it will also be approved in the second round, because the issue protects the interests of the country, and not of the government. [EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO] How long will it take for the effects of the stabilization program to begin being noticed? [Amorim] They will be noticed in the very near future, I believe. The plan's approval by Congress has already had a positive psychological effect. Naturally, the plan also has a monetary stage. In this stage, the inflation rate will have a more concrete and immediate decrease, although it may take two or three months for this to happen. [EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO] This sort of program generally brings about a stabilization of the national currency. In this case, will the value of the real cruzeiro increase? [Amorim] We are seeking to stabilize our national currency, but we want to do it without falling into the other extreme, which is economic recession. Brazil has many inhabitants and a labor market full of young people. It is very important that the process does not hinder economic growth. [EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO] Will the government try to prevent the exchange rate from falling, harming export products? [Amorim] The stabilization of the exchange rate will result from domestic monetary stabilization. It will not be the result of a law ordering the indexation of the cruzeiro to a foreign currency. It will come about naturally, as a consequence of a public deficit equal to zero and of the monetary measures which are being implemented. [EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO] The other Southern Cone countries are expecting an opportunity to increase their exports to Brazil. This is why the exchange rate aspect of the stabilization program is important to them. [Amorim] I believe that the growth of the Brazilian economy is what will really favor those who export to Brazil. When the economy grows, as it did in 1993, our partners' exports to our country increase a great deal. I think that this is more important than the type of exchange rate. [EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO] Everything leads one to the conclusion that in 1995, Mercosur [Common Market of the South] will have a unified tariff system but will not yet be a common market. When do you believe the conditions will be adequate for coordinating macroeconomic policies, and reaching the goal established by the Asuncion Treaty? [Amorim] Some fundamental stages must first be overcome. We are moving very fast, in a manner that has perhaps not occurred anywhere else in the world. We are completing the trade liberalization process. In 1995 we will have a unified tariff system, which may not be perfect, at least not with regard to all products, but there will be a schedule to unify the tariffs of the products that still have different tariffs. I believe that this naturally results in creating harmonious policies for various fields, such as for example rules for the capital markets and financial flows that have been agreed upon by the Mercosur member countries. I therefore believe there will be a natural unification resulting from the requirements of the trade liberalization process and of the Common Foreign Tariff. [EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO] Will the full enforcement of a common market depend in the domestic stability of the member countries? [Amorim] This is taking place very fast. You can see that so far Europe still has no overall monetary policy, because it does not have a single currency or a single central bank. I therefore believe that the common market can exist with free capital flow and hand labor, which are other elements of the common market, even before the creation of an entirely completed macroeconomic policy. Surely there must be agreement about these policies, but I believe they will come about naturally, because all countries are engaged in the same process.
