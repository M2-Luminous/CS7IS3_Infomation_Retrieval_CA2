(SNARK) -- "Recent events in Abkhazia which resulted in new victims among the civilian Georgian population represent an intended action aiming to prevent the peace settlement process of conflict", said in his exclusive interview to SNARK Shalva Pitchkhadze, the state adviser of Georgian President. Characterizing the military actions in Feb. 7 and 8 as "bacchanalia", developed by Gudauta separatists against the Georgian population, the result of which were hundreds of innocent civilians, Eduard Shevardnadze's adviser observed: "Abkhazians deliberately torpedoed the Geneva negotiations process. Naturally, the refugee's return to Gali region since Feb. 10, as agreed in Geneva, is out of question". On these days, said Pitchkhaladze, Eduard Shevardnadze will appear with a statement on recent events in Abkhazia.
