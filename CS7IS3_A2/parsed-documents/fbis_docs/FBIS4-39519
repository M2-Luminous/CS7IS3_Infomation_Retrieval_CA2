Interviewed by ITAR-TASS, the admiral stressed the urgent need to set up such units. There are only Russian disengagement forces were on the territory of the CIS at present, but their status does not correspond to the U.N. mandate on peace-keeping forces. According to Mochaikin's forecast, not all the CIS nations will be ready to assign their troops for peacekeeping missions, but their contribution, he believes, could be financial or in the form of equipment deliveries. In case today's appeal to the MPs to set up CIS peace-keeping forces is met, the question will have to be discussed at the level of the CIS council of defence ministers and council of foreign ministers so that corresponding proposals could be submitted to the next plenary meeting of the interparliamentary assembly.
