The United Nations will contribute $1.019 million to the Cuban program against drug trafficking. This will help to acquire supplies and equipment for Interior Ministry units and Customs. This was announced in Havana by members of the Cuban Drug commission. Dr. Zenaida Osori, first vice minister of Justice, pointed out that Cuba's geographical location between suppliers and consumers requires constant vigilance. Cuba's efforts in this regard have been praised by diverse international organizations. The members of the commission went on to explain that the increase in Cuban tourism requires maximum quality and that all those involved in the fight against drugs are working toward that goal. It was also announced that as of 30 December 1993, 79 operations took place and that 3,364.297 kg of cocaine and 1,353.291 kg of marijuana washed up on Cuban shores. So far this year, however, there have been only 11 cases, not of smuggling, but of foreigners carrying small amounts for personal use. The members of the Cuban Drug Commission wonder whether drug traffickers have stopped using Cuba as a bridge or if Cuba has improved its operations. Cuba is waging the war of good against evil.
