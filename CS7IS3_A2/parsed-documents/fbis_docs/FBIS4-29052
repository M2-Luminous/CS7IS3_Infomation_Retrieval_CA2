Fujii, speaking at a press meeting, was referring to a report that U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen made a renewed request in a letter. "The basic direction remains unchanged," he said, noting the government and ruling parties are at the "final stage" of deciding on the tax reform. Japan promised in its March market-opening package to detail the tax reform by the end of this month and make it into law by the year-end. This came after criticism from the U.S. over a 6.2 trillion yen tax cut adopted in February for the current year only. The aim is to implement multi-year tax cuts, and a consumption tax hike not only to offset the tax cuts but also to secure funds for welfare in the aging society in the 21st century. Fujii neither denied nor confirmed the existence of the letter, saying he is in constant contact with the U.S. side to exchange views. The two sides have agreed not to comment on these regular talks, he added. According to the letter reported by a Japanese daily, Bentsen called for greater income tax cuts and freezing of the tax hike until the Japanese economy recovers clearly. The letter dated Tuesday came on the same day as the government's tax commission prepared the basis of its report due out next week. The report will include a three-year gap between tax cuts and hike, and a net revenue surplus. Pressed by reporters about the prospect of winning U.S. support, Fujii refrained from commenting directly. The tax issue is a domestic issue but Japan is working on it from the standpoint of contributing to the world economy as well to coordinate policy with other leading nations, he said. "There are some compromises involved, and we must make efforts to win understanding," he said.
