Kasoulidhis said the measures must be implemented in a way that will not directly or indirectly recognize the pseudostate. He said some of the points in the report will be discussed if and when the Turkish side replies positively to the three UN documents. The spokesman said: It would be a great diplomatic mistake to say that the Greek Cypriot side will negotiate the methods suggested by the experts, who will be a point for negotiating themselves. Kasoulidhis said President Glavkos Kliridhis does not intend to convene the National Council to discuss the substance of the confidence-building measures or the reports by the UN experts. He concluded: The National Council discussed the tactics and strategy.
