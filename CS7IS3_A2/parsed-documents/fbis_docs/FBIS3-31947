We have statements by the Zapaca Department governor as well as by Antonio Ramirez Rivas, president of the Department Electoral Board. We will listen first to Governor (Augusto Cesar Riaza's) comments on this event. The department governor will now address our listeners via Emisoras Unidas, and he will let us know if any incidents have occurred and announce any other information he can provide concerning the referendum. Good morning, Mr. Governor; the microphones are yours. [Riaza] Since the voting centers opened this morning at 0700, voting throughout the ten municipalities has been taking place quite peacefully. We know of no abnormal incidents that could tarnish the referendum. [Castro] Mr. Governor, have you traveled throughout the other municipalities or just certain ones? [Riaza] I personally toured three municipalities, but some of ny assistants are keeping me abreast of what is developing in the various municipalities. They have advised me that voting is taking place quite normally and that there are no problems now. We expect [words indistinct] there has been low voters turnout in certain places. I believe this is because it is still too early. About 10 or 20 minutes ago we received reports from [word indistinct], where only 6 percent of the total number of voters has already voted. [Castro] Mr. Governor, we have observed security forces near the voting centers. Have you received any special instructions in this regard? [Riaza] Yes we did. The security forces have been placed near the voting centers. According to a request by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE], the security agents will not be stationed inside the voting centers, but they are close by should any incident take place. As I already mentioned, no incidents have occurred so far. [Castro] I appreciate the information provided by Governor (Augusto Cesar Riaza) and his participation here today. The Department Electoral Board president will now state why the Zapaca voting centers will be closing at 1700 and cite other information he can about the voting centers. [Ramirez] First of all, I would like to thank you for the opportunity to address the Guatemalan people. You are always where the news is to be found. I would like to say the legislation regulating the referendum and the political parties allows us to establish when voting is to conclude. Considering the events that have been taking place during the past days regarding attacks and the possibility that electricity may be cut, we have decided it would be better to conclude at 1700, because there will still be enough light at that time, and we will be able to receive information from the voting centers. We have already issued a press bulletin in which we officially announced that voting will conclude at 1700. So far, the municipalities have reported that voting is taking place quite normally and peacefully. Our observers have noted, however, low voter turnout. By 1000, our observer at Rio Hondo reported that only 200 voters had participated. [Castro] Will we be having another report soon, and what time will it take place? [Ramirez] I would like to say, according to information I have received, every municipal Electoral Board president must report to us by 1400 and 1600. They must notify us via telephone.
