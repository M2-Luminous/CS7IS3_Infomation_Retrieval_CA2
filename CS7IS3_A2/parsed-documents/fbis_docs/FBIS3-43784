Chief government negotiator Roelf Meyer says yesterday's talks were exploratory discussions to see whether there can be any basis for commonality. He says while no agreement had been reached, certain positions could now be taken back to the various parties's principals for approval. The government and ANC have been trying for months to reach a political settlement with the alliance which has rejected the interim constitution. The alliance is demanding a stronger federal system than provided in the constitution. The government and ANC have set 24 January as the deadline for the completion of negotiations on the constitution.
