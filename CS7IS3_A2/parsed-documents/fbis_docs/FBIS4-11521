Secofi believes that greater tariff elimination can take place in one or two years when the dynamics of NAFTA integration have changed market conditions or when the sectors have made strategic alliances, joint-ventures [preceding word in English], or mergers, but not just four months into the trilateral pact. The topic of tariff elimination has become a "thorny" issue between the Mexican and U.S. Governments, to such a degree that Canada's Minister of International Trade Roy MacLaren told EL FINANCIERO that it is "a bilateral affair." The United States, in press statements, has said that "it will exert pressure until it gets the greatest possible number of tariff reductions" from the list of 600 items published in the March issue of the Federal Register. Meanwhile, Secofi Secretary Jaime Serra Puche and Under Secretary Herminio Blanco agree that "if there is no agreement with private enterprise and no consensus between the government and businessmen in Mexico, no tariff elimination will be negotiated." NOTIMEX reported that the telephone conversation planned yesterday between U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor and Jaime Serra Puche was postponed until Wednesday. A reliable Mexican source said decisions are still at a "preliminary" level, despite the closeness of the established deadline (120 days from 1 January). Private sector sources say that while the United States is in a hurry to gain concessions as soon as possible (before Congress goes on summer holidays), Mexico does not want to grant any more concessions until it sees the results of what it has already negotiated. In fact, they said that U.S. demands -- included in two lists, the first with 600 tariff items and the second with more than 1,000 -- are so pretentious that they seek to eliminate tariffs as if the two countries were operating under the same conditions. They added that even though the United States claims that the Mexican tariffs are "too high," they should not forget that the difference in tariffs represents the negotiation between an industrialized country and a developing country. Jaime Serra Puche warned that Mexico is only interested in taking to the negotiating table four groups of products: shoes, fruits, vegetables, and preserves. The United States, however, wants to negotiate under Article 302, Part 3, their lack of participation throughout negotiations. Herminio Blanco explained that they decided to include the NAFTA clause to give the text flexibility in case there were future changes in the economic situation, or in the event of joint-ventures or mergers between the country's industries. U.S. sources said Herminio Blanco warned businessmen that Mexico "has no commitment to reduce tariffs" and will only do so if they are accepted by Mexican production plants. Blanco admitted that "it is too early to renegotiate the market access chapter," because in four months of NAFTA operations, conditions have not changed. Blanco contends that within a year or two the tariff renegotiating process could become an issue. U.S. sources commented that within the next few weeks, the Federal Registry will publish what products are in the first round of negotiations. They believe that these will be goods that both countries agree require tariff reductions. This includes frozen white potatoes, rice, crude sunflower oil, prepared peaches, wines, tobacco products, chemical and pharmaceutical products, wood and paper products, shoes, ceramics, glass, and home appliances.
