[Kim Yong-sam] The ROK and Russia have established constructive and reciprocal relations, and the ROK and Uzbekistan have built a basis for stepping up substantive cooperative relations. It is important, in particular, that the ROK and Russia have stepped up a cooperation system to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue, confirmed that the North Korean-Russia Mutual Assistance Treaty would be nullified, and that Russia promised it would stop supplying weapons and parts to North Korea. I think another big achievement is that I have inspired a sense of pride in ethnic Koreans in Russia and Uzbekistan and that those two countries promised that they would not discriminate against those ethnic Koreans. [Yi] Separately from sanctions by the UN Security Council, the ROK, the United States, Japan, and other countries have reportedly been discussing independent sanctions against North Korea with regard to the North Korean nuclear issue. Is it true? [Kim] The UN Security Council adopting a resolution on sanctions against North Korea is the most important task at the moment. I do not think it is appropriate to mention any other sanctions other than those by the UN Security Council at a time when multilateral consultations have been under way to impose sanctions through the UN Security Council. [Yi] Have you examined ways to induce North Korea to come to dialogue to give it an opportunity to prove the transparency of its nuclear activities? [Kim] North Korea unilaterally continued to replace fuel rods and, thus, destroyed a basis for dialogue. Our government's clear position is that we cannot turn a blind eye to one or even half of a nuclear weapon. North Korea does not seem to realize that if it continues to develop nuclear weapons, it will lead to its own destruction. The prevailing international atmosphere is that North Korea must no longer be left intact and that no group that commits such acts must exist. I will discuss sanctions with U.S. President Clinton over the telephone. Therefore, if North Korea again wants dialogue, it must come up with a method that can facilitate such dialogue. We think the international community must take appropriate measures regarding North Korea's unilateral action. I do not think it is time for the ROK and the United States to discuss ways to induce North Korea into dialogue. [Yi] If the intensity of UN sanctions increases and if North Korea tries to find a way out of this, will the tensions intensify? [Kim] North Korea has threatened us by saying sanctions would lead to war. Therefore, the possibility is that tensions would intensify as the intensity of sanctions increases. However, we will not tolerate any reckless action by North Korea. Unlike in the past, we have sufficient strength to deter war and are following North Korean movements around the clock. We have on hand countermeasures against any unforeseen accidents and a few scenarios. [Yi] Do you have a way in mind to persuade China to join in UN Security Council sanctions? [Kim] It will be difficult for China to veto a UN Security Council resolution on sanctions. We have discussed this matter with China, as the United States has done. China profoundly perceives the seriousness of the situation. China has not said it would veto a resolution. China has a sense of responsibility because the UN Security Council adopted a presidential statement at China's request, even though the ROK and the United States at first pursued to pass a resolution. China knows very well that North Korea has not shown any sincerity, even though the countries concerned have made efforts for a peaceful solution. I think, therefore, China will eventually join in the international efforts. [Yi] Would you consider invalidating the joint declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula if North Korea's nuclear transparency cannot be verified in the end? [Kim] The joint declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula deserves respect in terms of establishing the order for nuclear-free peace. Our government's will to comply with the joint declaration on the denuclearization remains firm. However, I am afraid that if North Korea does not stop developing nuclear weapons, our government's will to comply with the joint declaration on the denuclearization will be seriously challenged. [Yi] Many people observe that reunification by absorption will be inevitable. Are you willing to modify the reunification program in a more practical way? [Kim] It is the government's firm stance that reunification should be achieved step-by-step through negotiations between the South and the North. In this way, reunification can be achieved with minimum aftereffects and in the meantime a bright future for the nation will be guaranteed. Thus, at the moment, I do not feel the need to modify the reunification program. [Yi] Some people point out that the ROK people are relaxed about security. What is your plan for consolidating security and redressing military appearance, which has been downgraded? [Kim] Our security is only possible when all our people bear a solid sense of security and when a strong Army is maintained to safeguard peace. However, I am concerned that some people tend to be too optimistic about the situation on the Korean peninsula where North Korea is still a threat. Common sense cannot be used when judging North Korea. Our people are too ignorant of this. They think North Korea is not a match for us, but you never know when and what they will do. We can prevent misjudgment about North Korea when all the people bear in mind that a cornered North Korea might be provoked anytime and be fully prepared for it. I have endeavored through reform to form a clean Army free from political influence. I am sure military morale is up rather than down because military reform has a pure intention and was desired by the majority of the soldiers. There had been temporary pain in the beginning, but now the Army is respected and loved by the people. I recently visited frontline units and witnessed that many officers and men are silently working to fulfill their duties. The ROK people should recognize and respect the utmost devotion of the officers and men in defending the country under difficult conditions. [Yi] What is your plan in the humanitarian aspect regarding North Korean fugitives in China? [Kim] Our government is deeply concerned about and seeking resolutions for the safety and freedom of North Koreans who escaped to China. Please understand that it is difficult to reveal the details.
