Chen Minzhang, the Minister of Public Health, stressed on Wednesday in Beijing that provincial governments should further increase their budgets for endemic disease control and people from all walks of life must be persuaded to join the national campaign against endemic illnesses. Endemic diseases--including snail fever, iodine deficiency diseases (IDD), the plague, and endemic fluoresces--have been reported in 2,413 counties, or 85 percent of the counties in China. Chen made the remarks at the founding of the Endemic Diseases Society of China. The society is a nongovernmental organization composed of specialists in endemic illnesses and volunteers from different State departments, institutes and industrial enterprises. The society was founded to help spread State policies and regulations on endemic diseases control and launch publicity campaigns. It will also organize academic exchanges to introduce new techniques on prevention and cure of the illnesses to grass-roots health workers. The minister said he hoped a national endemic disease control network will be established as a result of the work of the society. Snail fever, or schistosomiasis, a parasitic illness eliminated in the early 1950's, reappeared in the early 1980s. Currently, endemic snail fever is rampant in 381 counties in the country. More than 3.6 billion square meters of land in China's lake and mountain regions are still infested with snails putting 40 million people in danger. The most serious epidemic cases are in rural areas and in poor counties. In 1991, the disease was found in 1,212 counties, accounting for 43 percent of the country's total. About 300 million people are threatened, 26 percent of the total population. There are 43 million dental fluoresces patients and 1.6 million skeletal fluorosis victims. IDD, like endemic flouride poisoning, is prevalent in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions except Shanghai. IDD has become one of the major factors affecting the mental development of Chinese children. On the same day, a deputy provincial governor of Shanxi Province said the provincial government has decided to allocate an additional 1 million yuan (about $175,000) annually starting this year for endemic disease control in the province. The regular budget for the work in Shanxi, one of the provinces in China that has a major problem with endemic diseases, is 1.4 million yuan about ($245,000) each year. The province has five kinds of endemic diseases in 107 counties and prefectures, 81 per cent of the province's total. Some 3.4 million of the residents, or 12 percent of the province's total population, suffer from the various illnesses. Zhang Weiqing, the deputy provincial governor, said the provincial government is to loan some 3 million yuan (about $526,000) each year to help develop health-related industrial enterprises. The province is to subsidize scientific research institutes by as much as 500,000 yuan (about $87,000) each year for carrying out research in the field. Researchers who achieve outstanding results will be rewarded.
