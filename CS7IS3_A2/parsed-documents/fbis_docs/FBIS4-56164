FBIS4-56164 "drlat084__a94011" FBIS-LAT-94-084-A Daily Report 25 Apr 1994 ANNEX Brazil Amorim Signs Trade Accord With Czech Premier Amorim Signs Trade Accord With Czech Premier AU2604063094 Prague CTK in English 1841 GMT 25 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU2604063094 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Brasilia, April 25 (CTK) -- This afternoon, Premier Vaclav Klaus and Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim signed an agreement on economic cooperation and the mutual granting of most-favored nation status. The agreement calls for cooperation to increase trade turnover between the two countries, to diversify goods traded, and to share expertise and technology in the production of machines and equipment. It also provides for the mutual exchange of information on future investment programs. Brazil, thanks to its large and unsaturated market, is one of the Czech Republic's most important Latin American trade partners. Trade relations between the two countries date back to 1918. However, trade with Brazil has been decreasing over the past three years. In 1991, trade amounted to $90 million, but last year it reached only $45 million. Exports from the Czech Republic over the past three years remained relatively stable, amounting to $13 million per year. On the other hand, exports from Brazil decreased from $77 million in 1991 to $32 million last year. One of the reasons for this situation is that many industrial enterprises have ceased to use the services of foreign trade companies and are trying to penetrate the Brazilian market directly, according to Karel Klima of the Czech Embassy in Brazil, who met with Czech business people in Rio de Janeiro. Businesses desiring to sell on the Brazilian market but lacking familiarity with the country should take advantage of trade fairs and the services of commercial chambers to establish contacts in Brazil. The Czech Republic supplies mostly whole plants to Brazil. At present nine large electricity plants and 10 cement plants built by Czechoslovakia are operating in the country. During their stay, representatives of Prerovske Strojirny hope to reach an agreement on further supplies of cement plants, according to sources from the Czech trade mission. Brazil exports to the Czech Republic include mostly soy groats (39 percent of total exports), coffee, tobacco, animal hides, iron ore, and fruit. The agreement signed today also calls for the creation of a commission to increase trade and economic cooperation between the Czech Republic and Brazil. The commission is to submit to the two countries' governments proposals concerning the development of relations, to propose new cooperation projects, and to support the exchange of economic information. The commission will meet once every two years, alternately in Prague and Brasilia. Klaus also discussed today with Brazilian President Itamar Franco cooperation in the field of international politics and in the United Nations.
