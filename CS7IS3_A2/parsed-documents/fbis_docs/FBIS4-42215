They are to be built by the Peene shipyard in Wolgast for the Russian Ohodsk Fishing Company, which moved to the tax paradise of Limassol, Cyprus. Bonn wants to subsidize the order volume of 200 million German marks [DM] with DM11.85 million. Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania is to contribute the same amount; negotiations are currently going on. The deal would secure 500 shipyard jobs for about two years. However, "in this way we are financing Russian tax refugees," a confidant of Economics Minister Rexrodt (Free Democratic Party of Germany) stated critically. Officials in the ministry are currently examining whether money from the Russian mafia is being laundered in the deal. The fishing company, which already has 26 fishing ships, belongs to Russians who apparently want to circumvent the high taxes in their homeland. Johannes Ludewig, head of the Department for Economics and Finances in the Chancellor's Office, arranged the deal during Russian President Yeltsin's visit to Kohl. Nobody knows why Yeltsin supported the Ohodsk group so much. However, there is another snag to the deal: Schwerin wants to wait for Brussels' agreement to the contract before it forks out subsidies -- and it is not certain because the amount of the subsidies exceeds the permitted European Union framework of 9 percent.
