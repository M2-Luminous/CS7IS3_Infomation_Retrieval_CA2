FR940617-2-00205 FR940617-2-00116 Section 405 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, in addition to making other amendments, removed the priority for ELIHPA-eligible projects and imposed certain exclusivity restrictions on Flexible Subsidy-assisted and ELIHPA- and LIHPRHA-eligible projects. These provisions have been repealed by section 103(b) of the Multifamily Housing Property Disposition Reform Act of 1994 (the 1994 Act). Section 201(n)(1) of the HCDA, as amended by section 103(b)(3) of the 1994 Act, authorizes the Department to set aside assistance for Capital Improvement Loans for projects that are eligible for incentives under ELIPHA. In addition, under section 201(n)(1), the Department is authorized to make this assistance available on a noncompetitive basis. This notice supports preservation efforts by announcing a set-aside of $20 million for Flexible Subsidy Capital Improvement funding to insured projects that are eligible under ELIHPA to receive incentives in exchange for extending the low- to moderate-income use of the projects under plans of action approved in accordance with 24 CFR part 248, subpart C. B. Allocation Amounts The Flexible Subsidy Fund is comprised of excess rental receipts paid to HUD from owners of Section 236 projects, interest earned on the fund, repayment of Operating Assistance loans made by the Department in past fiscal years, and amounts appropriated by Congress, if any, to carry out the purposes of the Flexible Subsidy Program. The Capital Improvement Loan portion of the program is required by statute (Section 201(j)(4)) to be funded at a minimum level of $30 million or 40 percent of the amount in the Flexible Subsidy fund, whichever is less. This year, $30 million is less than 40 percent of the fund, and therefore, is the amount designated for Capital Improvement Loans. Of the $30 million set aside for Capital Improvement funding, $20 million is available under this NOFA for preservation projects. The remaining $10 million was made available under the Flexible Subsidy NOFA, published on January 13, 1994, at 59 FR 2270. C. Eligibility. 1. Types of Projects. The following types of rental or cooperative housing are eligible for Capital Improvement Loans: a. A project which meets the definition of ``eligible low-income housing'' as set forth at 24 CFR 248.201; and b. Has received preliminary approval of a plan of action pursuant to 24 CFR 248.233 which provides for a sale to a nonprofit or a limited equity cooperative. 2. Conditions. Flexible Subsidy assistance will be made available in accordance with Section 201 of the Housing and Community Development Amendments (HCDA) of 1978, as amended by Section 103 of the Multifamily Housing Property Disposition Reform Act of 1994. Assistance can be provided only if the following conditions are determined to exist when a plan of action is approved: a. The assistance is necessary, when considered with other resources available to the project; it will restore or maintain the financial or physical soundness of the project; and it will preserve the low- and moderate-income character of the project. b. The owner has agreed to maintain the low- and moderate-income character of the project for a period at least equal to the remaining term of the project mortgage. c. The assistance will be less costly to the Federal Government over the useful life of the project than other reasonable alternatives of preserving the occupancy character of the project. d. The project is or can reasonably be made structurally sound, as determined in accordance with an on-site inspection. e. All reasonable attempts have been made to take all appropriate actions and provide suitable housing for project residents. f. There is evidence of the existence of a feasible plan to involve the residents in project decisions.
