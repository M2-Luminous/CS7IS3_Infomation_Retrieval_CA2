The United States has set 20 January as the date on which it will impose sanctions unless agreement is reached. With the deadline close at hand, the Japanese Government has sought the understanding of the U.S. Government by working out an action program, including a plan to introduce the general competitive bidding system for public works in April. For those projects sponsored by prefectural governments that will be eligible for the bidding system, the Japanese Government has set the cost of projects at "more than about 2.3 billion yen." The U.S. Government, however, has demanded that this ceiling be lowered. Moreover, although the Japanese Government intends to abolish in April the major project arrangement (MPA), which was exclusively worked out to help American companies, the U.S. Government wants it continued. It is expected there will be some tough talking before an accord is reached.
