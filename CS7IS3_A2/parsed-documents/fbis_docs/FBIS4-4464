What we should underline from Suharto's remark is his warning that the disagreement over the issues of the environment and human rights could become new source of conflict in North-South relations. True enough. The indications of this are there all right. In the last several weeks the escalating war of words between the United States and China over human rights issues linked with China's most favored nation trading status has soured their relations to such an extent that, as Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen expressed the other day China has threatened "to live without any trade relations with the U.S." Other Asian countries, like Vietnam and noticeably Malaysia, also have raised the hardliner's flag. Even Singapore, a country which is known for its close association with Western countries, snapped back a few weeks ago when President Clinton protested the Singapore court decision to sentence an American teenager to six strokes of the cane and four months in jail for spray-painting cars. While we acknowledge that human rights conditions in many Asian countries, including Indonesia, need much improvement, and that foreign pressure has helped the situation to improve, there are reasons to be concerned that without a proper switching mechanism, the still developing row could lead into a tragic collision course, something which we believe nobody wants. Judging from the heated nature of the words being shot back and forth, many Third World countries are becoming ever more fed up with the conditions imposed by the developed countries. But, different from the situation a few years back, they now have economic clout to back their hardliner stance: Asia's economic growth has boomed to an extent the failing Western countries' economies cannot simply ignore. Some Asian countries, like China, for example, have even come to the conclusion that Western countries need them much more than they need the Western countries. The statistics and the projections seem to support these views. For example, by the year 2000, Asia will have one billion consumers with sufficient spending power which will certainly create some of the biggest financial opportunities in history. Over the next decade, non-Japanese Asia is said to be planning to spend US$1 trillion on infrastructure projects, something which Western companies are surely eager to be a part of. But, if these developed countries are overzealous about Asia's human rights conditions, they may lose this huge market. On the other hand, Western countries like the U.S., are bound to their commitment to environmental and human rights causes. In the case of President Clinton, he cannot back off on these issues because Congress and other pressure groups would crucify him. Hence, a nation's credibility is at stake. In the midst of this dilemma some sort of compromise and face- saving solution must be sought. To a certain extent, foreign pressure on Asian human rights conditions have yielded positive results. This can be seen not only in the improvement of the human rights conditions themselves, but more importantly in the spreading awareness of the significance of human rights and the encouraging of local peoples to fight for their rights. Thus, to a certain extent, the pressure and the momentum thus achieved must be maintained. But different approaches must be taken. For example, Western countries should drop their "high and mighty" approach, which amounts to dictating their concepts of democracy and human rights to Asian countries. Nothing much will be gained from playing "globocop" now. The response is bound to be annoyance, resentment and possibly rage.
