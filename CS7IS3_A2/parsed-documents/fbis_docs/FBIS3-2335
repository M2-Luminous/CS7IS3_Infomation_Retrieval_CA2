Proceeding from improving the quality of troop leaders and strengthening management of the armed forces in the new period form the new situation in the building of the armed forces and the objective demand of the building of the contingent of cadres. Cadres at all levels, grass-roots cadres in particular, are leaders of management of the armed forces and people who carry out practical work in this respect. If cadres lack dedication, do not have a strong sense of responsibility, are not willing to do management work, or do not know how to carry out management work because their management ability cannot meet the needs of the new situation, it will not be possible to properly carry out various kinds of management work. Leaders and leading organs at all levels must earnestly make greater efforts to adopt effective measures to improve the quality of troop leaders. To strengthen ideological education of troop leaders, to deepen the dedication and the sense of responsibility of troop leaders in building the armed forces, and to encourage cadre willingness to carry out management work are basic engineering steps to improve the quality of troop leaders. Viewed from the present situation of the armed forces, both the problems of cadres not being willing to manage and cadres not knowing how to manage exist, but the former is the major one. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out powerful ideological education in light of the actual ideological problems of cadres. It is necessary for cadres to take a correct attitude toward the soldiers, establish the concept of cherishing and understanding soldiers with great enthusiasm, show concern and care for soldiers, understand and respect soldiers, and become close friends with solders, thus acquiring the qualifications for leading troops. It is necessary to proceed from the nature and purpose of the armed forces and and from education on function, and to arouse the sense of mission and the spirit of dedication among cadres so they will fulfill their duties and do a good job in managing the armed forces. On the other hand, leaders and leading organs at all levels should show concern for cadres and energetically solve practical problems for cadres, particularly practical problems of grass-roots cadres. All reasonable requests and problems which can be granted or solved should be enthusiastically and actively granted or solved in order to create conditions for cadres to wholeheartedly manage the armed forces. We should believe that all our cadres, directly nurtured by the party and the armed forces, have grown to maturity and they have deep feelings toward the armed forces. Only if thorough and meticulous ideological work is carried out, as many practical problems are solved as possible, and cadres are used in a fair and rational manner, the enthusiasm of cadres can be aroused and the problem of being not willing to manage can also be gradually solved. The issue of not knowing how to manage is also important in improving the quality of troop leaders. At present, management of the armed forces is faced with many new tasks. It is necessary to guide cadres to strengthen study and exploration of these tasks in light of changes and characteristics of soldiers in the new period, grasp objective laws, integrate development of the fine traditions of the armed forces with modern management, and constantly improve methods for leading troops. The leadership at all levels should do a good job in training grass-roots cadres at their posts in a planned manner, organizing cadres to study the good traditions of management of the armed forces, acquiring knowledge and study methods of modern management, and, in light of the difficulties and major problems in management of the armed forces, exploring measures to deal with them, summing up experience, and improving the ability of leading troops in the new period. "What is important is that cadres should identify themselves with soldiers." Setting examples for soldiers and influencing and inspiring them by exemplary acts are indispensable qualities of troop leaders. Comrade Deng Xiaoping once pointed out: "If a company commander or a political instructor cannot set a good example, he cannot bring up good soldiers; and if a leading cadre cannot set a good example, he cannot establish good common practice or enhance combat effectiveness." If cadres at all levels can set an example in taking the lead in observing rules, regulations, and discipline, in being the first to charge at the enemy and the first to bear hardship, and in taking the lead in fairly and honestly fulfilling their official duties, the entire armed forces will, guided by "noiseless orders," regularly and in an orderly manner carry out various kind of work under new historical conditions.
