A Foreign Ministry official here said Borujerdi arrived Friday for a five-day visit that will include meetings with Afghan leaders. Borujerdi came amid an ongoing leadership dispute in Wahdat between incumbent 'Ali Mazari and his challenger Akbar 'Azimi, a former member of the party's central committee. Sources in the Iranian-backed faction said the row, which triggered fighting between supporters of the two men late last month, had caused the indefinite postponement of plans to hold party elections. Wahdat is loosely linked with an alliance fighting to overthrow Afghan President Borhanoddin Rabbani, which is made up mainly of Prime Minister Golboddin Hematyar's Hezb-e-Eslami and forces of the Uzbek warlord General 'Abdol Rashid Dostam. Iran, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have frequently urged the warring Afghan factions to settle their differences to end the five months of fighting that has left more than 2,500 dead and at least 17,000 injured. Borujerdi has held talks with Rabbani and sources said he was due to travel to Hekmatyar's nearby base at Charasiab late Saturday to meet with the president's arch foe. He may also meet in Kabul with former defence minister Ahmad Shah Mas'ud, Rabbani's strongman, the sources said. According to the Foreign Ministry official, Pakistani Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali was expected to visit Kabul in the coming week.
