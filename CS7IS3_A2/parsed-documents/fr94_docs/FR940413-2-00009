FR940413-2-00009 FR940413-2-00005 Department's Position: We disagree with respondents that we relied excessively on CV. Specifically, we disagree with their claim that a ``macro'' test, rather than a model-specific, or ``micro,'' test, is the appropriate method of determining what below-cost sales should be disregarded. Section 773(b) of the Tariff Act directs us to disregard below-cost sales in calculating FMV. As FMV is based on a model-specific comparison and focuses on the prices actually used for FMV, employing a model-specific methodology is the most appropriate approach to the 10/90/10 test. For this reason, we have rejected using the ``macro'' test and have only tested individual models for sales below-cost. We also disagree with respondents' argument that we should drop all below-cost third-country sales before creating our product concordance, or model-match groupings. Section 771(16) of the Tariff Act defines such or similar merchandise and provides a hierarchy of preferences for determining which merchandise sold in the foreign market is most similar to the merchandise sold in the United States. Whether a model is sold in the home market or third countries at prices below cost is not a criterion for determining what is most similar merchandise under the statute. Therefore, we rejected the product concordances proposed by respondents, which eliminated most similar models when those models were sold at prices below cost. In determining whether third-country sales were made at prices below the cost of production (COP), we compared the sales prices of each model to its COP. Below-cost sales were disregarded on a model-specific basis in accordance with the 10/90/10 rule. If we found that less than 10 percent of the sales of a model were made at less than cost, we included all third-country sales of that model in the calculation of FMV. If between 10 and 90 percent of third-country sales of a specific model were made at less than cost, we disregarded those sales made at less than cost and used the above-cost sales in the price comparisons. If more than 90 percent of third-country sales of a model were made at less than cost we disregarded all sales of that model. For the preliminary results, where there were more than one equally similar model, in accordance with our model match criteria as set out in Appendix V of our questionnaire, we selected a single most similar model, based on the cost differences between the third-country and U.S. models. That is, we selected the one with the lowest cost difference. If more than 90 percent of the sales of a model chosen as the most similar third-country model were below cost, we used CV as the basis of FMV. For these final results, rather than choose the single most similar model based on cost differences, we used the pool of equally similar models as long as those models were within the 20 percent cost differential. When there was more than one equally similar above-cost model, we adjusted the FMV of each model for differences in merchandise, and then weight averaged the results. If any of these models were found to be below cost, we excluded them from our analysis and used only the above-cost models. Comment 2: Respondents argue that in calculating COP for the final results, the Department should use the respondents' 1990 selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) rather than the 1990&hyph;91 average SG&A. They contend that most sales in this review were produced in 1990, and because MMF sweater production and shipments vary from season to season, SG&A for a full fiscal year should be used. Department's Position: We agree with the respondents that we should use SG&A expense data from full fiscal years to account for seasonality. All the data which were averaged for the preliminary review results were, in fact, full fiscal year data, derived from the companies' annual financial statements. We disagree, however, with respondents' argument that we should rely exclusively on 1990 SG&A. For the final results for Kee Ryung, Suhcheon, Young Woo, and Yurim, whose fiscal years are also the calendar year, the period of review includes an equal number of months from each of the fiscal years and, therefore, we have continued to use a simple average of 1990 and 1991 SG&A. For Chunji, we have continued to add Chunji's SG&A for the fiscal year July 1, 1990 through June 30, 1991, to the average of its related company's SG&A for the fiscal/calendar years 1990 and 1991. Twelve of the 16 review months occurred during the July 1, 1990 through June 30, 1991 period; of the remaining four months, we have data only for the two months in the prior fiscal year, but not for the two months in the subsequent fiscal year. Thus, it is appropriate to only use SG&A expenses from the one fiscal year for Chunji. For Tae Kwang, we used a weighted average SG&A, weighted three-fourths for the fiscal year covering the period September 1, 1990 through August 31, 1991, and one-fourth for the fiscal year covering the period September 1, 1989 through August 31, 1990, since twelve months of the review period occurred in the first fiscal year, and four months occurred in the second. Comment 3: Respondents state that the Department incorrectly adjusted for the value added tax (VAT), by increasing reported costs such as foreign inland freight, foreign brokerage, containerization, commissions and packing, by 10 percent for both the U.S. and third-country sales. Respondents contend that VATs ``paid'' on purchases of goods and services are not costs because they are rebated upon payment and thus do not constitute an expense to the company.
