FR940217-1-00062 FR940217-1-00013 The long-term success of the watershed ordinances and the Edwards Rules in protecting water quality is unknown. Based on the water quality data and changes observed in Barton Creek (see discussion under Factor A), some level of water quality degradation in this area has already occurred (City of Austin 1991; Librach, in litt. , 1990). Even if the Edwards Rules and the watershed ordinances are determined to be effective at protecting water quality, about 50 percent of the area (most of which occurs in Hays County) affecting the waters of the aquifer and Barton Springs is not covered by these City and State rules and regulations. Hays County recently filed a lawsuit against the City of Austin to remove Hays County from the city's extra-territorial jurisdiction, which would further reduce the area covered by the watershed ordinances. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that the SOS Ordinance or any of the preceding ordinances will remain in effect. A lawsuit has been filed to invalidate the SOS Ordinance. Several bills have also been proposed in the Texas Legislature aimed at restricting local environmental regulatory powers, and could prevent the City of Austin and other local governments from implementing water quality protection ordinances such as the SOS ordinance. The Balcones Canyonlands Conservation Plan (BCCP) is being developed for Travis County to obtain a section 10(a)(1)(B) permit allowing incidental taking of certain endangered species. Parties involved in the preparation of the BCCP are TPWD, City of Austin, Travis County, and Lower Colorado River Authority. The current draft regional plan does not explicitly provide for conservation of the Barton Springs salamander (City of Austin et al . 1993). Proposals to acquire land within the Barton Creek watershed will provide benefits to the salamander by preserving the natural integrity of the landscape and positively contributing to water quality in Barton Creek and Barton Springs. The BCCP participants are currently working toward providing additional surface and groundwater quality protection, including retrofitting existing developments with non-point pollution controls and protecting the aquifer and Barton Springs from catastrophic pollution events. The BCCP has not yet been completed or approved and applies only to Travis County. The BCCP does not remove threats from development activities in Hays County. While the City of Austin has voluntarily committed to revising pool cleaning and other maintenance operations in Zilker Park to assist in protecting the salamander and its surface habitat, no legal agreement or other incentive is in place to ensure that these efforts will continue for the long term. To protect water quantity in the Barton Springs segment, the BS/EACD has developed a Drought Contingency Plan. Barton Springs has always flowed during recorded history and one of the BS/EACD's goals is to assure Barton Springs springflow ``does not fall appreciably below historic low levels'' (BS/EACD 1990). The BS/EACD regulates municipal and industrial wells that pump more than 10,000 gallons per day (about 60&hyph;70 percent of the total volume that is pumped from the Barton Springs segment) and has the ability to limit development of new wells, impose water conservation measures, and curtail pumpage from these wells during drought conditions. According to the BS/EACD (Bill Couch, BS/EACD, pers. comm., 1992), water well production in the higher elevations of the Barton Springs segment has been limited during periods of lower aquifer levels in recent years. However, the ability of the BS/EACD to ensure the plan's success is limited, since it has limited enforcement authority and does not regulate 30 to 40 percent of the total volume that is pumped from the Barton Springs segment. Furthermore, the BS/EACD is not authorized to curtail groundwater withdrawal specifically for the protection of the Barton Springs salamander and its habitat. E. Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence. The very restricted range of the Barton Springs salamander makes this species especially vulnerable to acute and/or chronic groundwater contamination. Since the salamander is an aquatic species, there is no possibility for escape from contamination or other threats to its habitat. A single incident (such as a contaminant spill) has the potential to eliminate the entire species and/or its prey base. Crustaceans, particularly amphipods, on which the salamander feeds, are especially sensitive to water pollution (Mayer and Ellersieck 1986). Based on acute static toxicity data for 63 species tested against 174 chemicals, the Service (Mayer and Ellersieck 1986) has identified amphipods as being the third most sensitive taxonomic group tested.
