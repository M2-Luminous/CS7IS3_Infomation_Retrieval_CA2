The candidate expounded on his economic program, which envisages bringing the rate of inflation down to 6-10 percent by the end of the year (whereas now it stands at over 50 percent). Those attending the meeting were also interested in problems connected with the breakup of the Soviet Union. Many people, particularly the older generation, are criticizing the former speaker, claiming that the USSR was destroyed at Belovezhskaya Pushcha. Answering his critics, Stanislav Stanislavavich noted that the Soviet Union had in effect broken up before the meeting of the leaders of the Slav states at Viskuli. He reminded them that seven republics -- Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Moldova -- had not taken any part in the referendum on the future of the USSR, thereby expressing their negative attitude to the empire. Kazakhstan conducted its referendum with a different wording. Over 90 percent of residents in Ukraine voted for sovereignty. In the opinion of Shushkevich, it was for this very reason that an attempt was made at Viskuli to preserve economic ties between the Republics and to give them a new impetus through the creation of the Commonwealth of Independent States. The presidential candidate believes that this averted a "Yugoslav scenario," which could well have taken much more dangerous forms.
