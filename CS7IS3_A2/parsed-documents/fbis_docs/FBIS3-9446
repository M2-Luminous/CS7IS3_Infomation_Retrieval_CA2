Albania is cooperating with NATO and fully supports it, offering air and port facilities. Albania also supported its ultimatum and signed the Partnership for Peace agreement, participating as a serious and active partner. Zhulali stressed the need for signing a bilateral agreement, which was welcomed by the Belgian foreign minister. In this framework, Zhulali said that the Albanian Army can be further supported by NATO member countries and Belgium in the field of education, training and preparation, material assistance, etc. After assessing the economic and political progress in Albania, Belgian Foreign Minister Claes assured Zhulali that all West European institutions are ready to support the democratic process in Albania. Conveying greetings for Albania's participation in the Partnership for Peace agreement and cooperation with the Western European Union, Claes expressed a readiness for bilateral relations, stressing the possibility of direct contacts between the defense ministers. Focusing on regional problems, both welcomed the progress achieved in the peace process, confirming that there cannot be a solution to the problems in the former Yugoslavia without resolving the Kosova problem. We are interested in developing bilateral relations in all fields with reciprocal interest, Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi said to Claes at the beginning of the meeting. Albania wants to be integrated into Europe, not as a burden but by progressing forward with your assistance. That is why we are open to Belgian investments, especially in infrastructure and communication. At the same time, Belgium can support Albania economically and politically, even in the framework of the European Union [EU] by assisting with an associate agreement. Belgium is willing to cooperate on a multilateral basis, Claes said. I think that lifting the double taxation and protection of investments will be a good step in this direction. I would simultaneously insist to Mr. Delors to undertake concrete initiatives to sign an associate agreement with the European Union. Claes expressed his support for other initiatives in the fields of education and science. In his meeting with Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes, National Bank Governor Dylber Vrioni expressed a desire to cooperate in the financial field as well and negotiate the debt that Albania owes to Belgium. Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes also held a meeting with members of the parliamentary Foreign Policy Commission. They mainly discussed Balkan issues and the opportunities for cooperation between our two parliaments. Before his departure Claes and Serreqi gave a news conference in which both personalities assessed the bilateral talks and their results. The two officials also answered correspondents' questions, which focused on Belgian and Albanian attitudes toward a solution to the Kosova question in the framework of the crisis in the former Yugoslavia.
