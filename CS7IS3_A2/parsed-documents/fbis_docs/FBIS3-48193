The branch will be promoted from a representative office, set up in August 1992, under the Korea-China financial agreement that was concluded last year. The Korea Exchange Bank already opened a branch in Tianjin in late December. Capitalized at 12 billion won (about 15 million U.S. dollars), the bank of China's Seoul branch is expected to focus its banking services on companies dealing with China. It will also provide counseling services to businesses planning to invest in China. Capitalized at 5.2 billion dollars, the Bank of China has 6,183 branches in China and 448 overseas. Two other Chinese banks -- the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and the People's Construction Bank of China -- now maintain a representative office each in Seoul.
