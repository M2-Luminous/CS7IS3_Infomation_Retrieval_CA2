Mr Zhu, who took over as head of the central bank on July 2 last year, is expected to be succeeded by People's Bank Deputy Governor Zhu Xiaohua. Bank sources said the Vice-Premier was only appointed bank governor as an emergency measure after the failure of the incumbent Li Guixian to deal with the financial crisis which hit China in the first half of 1993. It was "perfectly normal" that Mr Zhu should give up the post and appoint a specialist full time head for the central bank once the crisis had passed, they said. "Zhu Rongji as Vice-Premier has a very broad range of responsibilities concerning overall economic policy but being the governor of the People's Bank is a very demanding job requiring a lot of energy," a source said. "It is impossible for one man to do both jobs for a long period of time, the demands are too great," he added. "The governor should be a specialist who can take on the responsibility of managing the financial sector while Zhu Rongji concentrates on the important task of directing overall economic reform and development," he said. Another reason given for the Vice Premier's imminent retirement from the People's Bank is that the Government is determined to give the country's central bank at least the appearance of independence. A key element in the financial reforms to be implemented this year is making the People's Bank more autonomous from the central Government and as one source pointed out, "You cannot have an independent central bank which is governed by the Vice-Premier." The man expected to take over as governor of the bank, Zhu Xiaohua, is a former deputy head of the Shanghai People's Bank who worked closely with Mr Zhu while he was mayor of Shanghai in the late 1980s. He is widely admired both within the People's Bank and the foreign banking community in China, as a highly skilled and competent financial official who could carry out the difficult and complex reforms which will have to be undertaken if the institution is to become a genuine central bank as recognised in the West. Zhu Xiaohua was appointed Deputy Governor of the People's Bank after Zhu Rongji was made Vice Premier in 1991 and became the economic czar's most trusted adviser after he took over as head of the central bank last year. With Zhu Xiaohua as governor of the People's Bank, sources said, the Vice-Premier would feel comfortable the central bank was being managed in accordance with his own economic policies. But while Zhu Xiaohua is the Vice-Premier's choice as successor, it is by no means certain the rest of the state council will agree to his appointment. It is understood Zhu Rongji still has a lot of lobbying to do before his man is confirmed as the new governor of the People's Bank.
