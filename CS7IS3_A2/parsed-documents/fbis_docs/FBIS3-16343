At a Tuesday news conference in Moscow he stressed that the visit did not worsen relations between his country and Russia. Commenting on the negative response of the Abkhaz leader Vladislav Ardzinba to the plans of sending a peacekeeping force to Abkhazia, Advadze said that Russia, the U.S. and the UN "have the power to bridle aggressive separatism." According to the ambassador, Ardzinba was guided by separatism when he launched the war, even though he spoke of Abkhazia's willingness to join Russia. The diplomat added that Ardzinba "will not agree to any treaties or compromises, he will not be content with any federation or confederation, he wants only full independence." The ambassador stressed that the United States and the UN Security Council like Russia before them have supported Georgia in matters of territorial integrity.
