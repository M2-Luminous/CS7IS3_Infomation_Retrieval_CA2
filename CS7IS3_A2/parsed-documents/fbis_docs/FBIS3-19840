These studies were commissioned by the government from various research institutes, but Foreign Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen (Conservative) was anxious to point out yesterday that the conclusions are those of the institutions, not the government. EU membership will give new thrust to our economy and also boost employment. The study, carried out by the Industrial Research Institute [ETLA] on the economic effects of membership, indicates that, outside the EU, Finland would become a marginal region failing to attract many investors. Agriculture is recognized as a problem sector, but the same would be true if the country were to stay outside the EU. Integration is not a decisive factor in regional policy. The proper efforts of enterprises and the activities of the regions are more important. The Foreign Policy Institute survey states that EU membership will not entail problems if Europe becomes integrated and a new split into two parts can be avoided. But a new two-way split could cause Finland problems if it is in the EU, but militarily uncommitted. Minister Salolainen denies that the government has attempted to keep these studies secret or delay their publication. The idea was only to obtain a sufficient amount of information about the negotiation results to have a basis for the evaluation of the studies. Finnish membership in the EU will give a positive new thrust to the country's economy. There will also be beneficial effects on employment after a transitional period. Outside the EU, Finland would become an economic fringe area in the far north, from which foreign investors will shy away. Those are the views that Industrial Research Institute [ETLA] Director Pentti Vartia outlined to the parliament on Monday [14 March] when he presented his researchers' reports on the subject of Finland and the EU. Vartia points out that there are certain economic differences between EEA [European Economic Area] and EU membership. One of the main differences is that, as an EU member, Finland must adapt to the EMU [European Monetary Union]. The consequences of this are currently being analyzed in detail in a separate study. But the decision to opt for the EU has a direct influence on businesses' inclination to invest; foreign investments here began to pick up the moment Finland decided to submit its application for membership. There are also direct effects on trade policy. The EU is a customs union focusing on a common trade policy, Vartia added. He thinks that outside the EU, Finland would go back to its old patterns, the current structural changes would come to a halt, production and trade would focus on concentration more than competition, and the agricultural sector would return to its traditional forms of subsidy. ETLA's researchers point out that, outside the Union, we would not have the same opportunity to exert our influence as within. Trade and agriculture issues would affect Finland even if we were to stay outside the Union. As a member, at least we can make our voice heard and influence decisions: "Finland's influence within the EU is much greater than our size actually warrants," Vartia said. Membership is more likely to strengthen than weaken our sovereignty. Vartia stated that membership will actually cause only marginal changes to economic policy. There will be costs due to our share of the EU budget, but national and local budgets will remain the same. Another consequence, if Finland were to stay outside the EU, would be that we could not participate in the EMU which, Vartia said, is a good anchor for economic policy. Within the EMU, there are fixed currency exchange rates, which is of special importance for smaller enterprises. EMU and a common currency can however cause problems for Finland, Vartia said. Our economy and the occasional disorders resulting from differences between exports and the domestic cost level have hitherto required measures such as currency rate adjustments. Shared interests Only as a member of the Union can we ensure that Finnish products have free access to the European market, ETLA's researchers pointed out. Finland and the EU share the same interests in the main areas of trade policy. The EU as a region is far more protection-oriented than any of the individual member countries, Vartia added. "Only membership can offer Finland the opportunity of taking advantage of the Union's support program for countries like Russia, for example. As a member, we can get assistance with environmental projects in neighboring regions and benefit from our position as a gateway to the East," Vartia said. Finnish taxation does not have to be changed if the country becomes a member of the EU. The EU has no right to collect taxes in individual member countries but it can propose measures of harmonization. The decisions must, however, be unanimous and Vartia gives greater credit to the prospect of fiscal competition where member countries, rather than increasing taxation, will vie for industries and manpower through lower taxes. ETLA also sees an improvement in the employment situation if Finland joins the EU, rather than being content with EEA membership. Lower prices and costs will boost employment and improve our competitiveness, the reseach institute predicts. The Union will not, however, influence Finnish social security. What is true is that a country with a strong economy is in a better position to ensure the social welfare of its population than a poor one.
