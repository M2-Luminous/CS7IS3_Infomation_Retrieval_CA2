He had just completed fruitful and positive discussions with ministers of the Belgian Government concerning the employment dimension of the White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment. This was the ninth step of his tour of capitals. With the Corfu Summit only a few weeks away, Commissioner Flynn pleaded for greater vision to ensure the future of employment in Europe, a plea which he had made in a major presentation delivered on Tuesday [17 May] in the University of Leuven. In that sometimes controversial address to academics, politicians and the wider Flanders Community, Commissioner Flynn warned that "we ignore at our peril the human damage and dislocation caused by the scale of unemployment we face." In a clear message to member states in the run up to the Corfu Summit, he stated that his tour of capitals, to discuss follow-up to the White Paper, had heartened him in many ways, but had left him with some concerns. "I do not believe that member states have yet fully grasped the enormity of the challenge, the urgency of the need for collective reflection and coordinated action". Mr Flynn went on to give a strong warning against the temptation to simply wait for growth as the solution to the union's unemployment problems. "Let us be careful. We need to consider the implications of the choices we now make. Do we continue with our short-term -- even day-to-day -- approach to managing political, social and economic affairs, or do we really engage in a longer term strategy. Do we just sigh with relief at the glimmer of returning growth, or understand that it is very welcome but far from enough." Commissioner Flynn urged the union to commit itself to an ambitious and balanced strategy now. He believes that the messages which emerge from the Council in June must be affirmative and must offer both hope and credibility. "We need to mobilise support on a massive scale, before improved, and very welcome, growth offers the illusion of relief from the pressure for change. We need to use the breathing space which growth will bring over the next couple of years. Or the next downturn will be bigger, for more people, than the one we have just suffered. The last crash was traumatic for Europe. It shook the union, and its reverberations continue." "Make no mistake," he stressed, "if we do not grasp this opportunity, we will have left behind too many people and families by the time the next crash arrives, as it surely will." But aspiration must be joined to substance in addressing such complex problems. In this regard the commissioner outlined the importance of translating growth into jobs, and stressed that, to do so in a sustained and effective way, structural change was required. He described the way that new balances could be achieved in the design, operation and interplay between taxation, social protection and regulation. He believes that it is crucial for governments and the social partners to look at how to develop new ideas on working time and work organisation, new technology and quality of human resources, competitiveness and greater employment generation. Mr Flynn stressed the importance of the new synergies between manufacturing and services, the difficulties and opportunities represented by demographic change, and the clear need for social protection and taxation systems to be transformed into pathways to employment, not barriers to access. At Leuven, Commissioner Flynn recalled that President Delors had chosen the single market project as the way to relaunch the European endeavour when he became president-elect in 1984. The commissioner stated that "in my view the new commission in 1995 should set as its number one priority the design and implementation of a new Europe- wide employment strategy, for without this, talk of further integration will ring hollow in the hearts and minds of ordinary people, European Union citizens." Mr Flynn pointed out that the White Paper offers challenges as well as opportunities to all those invested with decision-making responsibility, not least in the way that they, themselves, now operate, and suggested that perhaps government has to reinvent itself, that the dynamics of government, not just the workplace, have to change. "Europe can be the crucible for future development for the world, a Europe of quality leading the way, engaging its citizens. But it is in danger of being looked back on as a transient bloc, that did not serve and draw the most potential from its human resources," he said.
