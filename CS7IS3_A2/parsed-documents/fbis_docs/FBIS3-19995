The stance of the Bundesbank, in particular, can no longer be justified on economic grounds. Signs are increasing in the Federal Republic that the recession has not yet hit bottom. Industrial production in the fourth quarter of 1993 was again 4 percent below last year's low figure, and incoming orders also failed to reach the level of last year's quarter. Because of the strong effect of losses, caused in part by the government's economy measures and tax increases, a further setback in the first quarter of 1994 cannot be ruled out. This view is reenforced by even lower than generally expected collective wage agreements, which will cause revenues to decline more than anticipated. Almost 12 months ago, industrial producer prices stopped rising. In December 1993 they were 0.1 percent below the level of 1992. Wholesale prices indicated complete stability. Even the rate of retail price increases had only a 1 before the period. Today, the rate of price increases in all of West Europe is the lowest since the beginning of the nineties. Geuenich: "Interest rates, nevertheless, continue to drop much more slowly than they did in the United States when it was in a similar economic situation, and much slower than in all previous German downturns. The interest rate policy of the European Union is chained to that of the German Bundesbank." An imminent revival of investment activities is therefore not expected in Europe, especially since consumer confidence in almost all countries is just as low as it is in Germany. Therefore, since Europe is the center of the German export trade, there is no hope for a lasting revival of the Federal Republic's exports. Geuenich: "The government and the Bundesbank never tire of giving pedantic advice during ongoing wage negotiations. Whether they like it or not, they are now caught in a cul-de-sac of paralyzing inactivity. They can get out only by initiating reassuring, expansive measures." Interest Rates Must Drop Quickly to Much Lower Levels This clearly means that the Bundesbank must quickly allow interest rates to drop considerably. The current discount rate, which has a 5 in front of its period, used to be associated with times of boom, but never with such a full-fledged recession as we experience today. After all, because of the Bundesbank's policy, the volume of consumer credits, current accounts, and discount credits of roughly 500 billion German marks [DM] is more expensive. The Bundesbank must act to remove this barrier to demand. How can fear of inflation still be rampant in Frankfurt when in almost all European countries, including Germany, prices of goods not affected by the government do not rise, but decline, and when capacity remains greatly underutilized? Nor can the Federal Government, according to Geuenich, forever defend itself with the argument that it lacks fiscal flexibility. Raising investment grants by, let us say, 10 percent for equipment and commercial construction investments, provided the volume exceeds that of 1993, for example, would reduce tax revenues by an estimated DM2.5 to 3 billion. The Institute for Economic Research has determined that for 1992, investment grants created 350,000 permanent jobs. Considering the overall cost of DM42,000 for each unemployed worker, the cited effect on the job market saved the public DM15 billion. The Location Security Legislation passed a few months ago cannot be accepted until doomsday as an alibi to demonstrate that economic policy has been done justice. The Federal Government and the Bundesbank talk incessantly about "investor confidence." However, with their paralyzing inaction they, themselves, are responsible for a climate of insecurity and disincentives. Geuenich: "The trade unions are doing their duty in an exemplary manner; now the pedants in Bonn and Frankfurt have to make a move." In contrast to the Federal Republic, the United States has found a way to initiate its monetary and fiscal policy successfully. A change in monetary policy toward expansion occurred in the United States as early as the beginning of 1990, just one year after the start of the recession. American corporate investments for equipment showed a particularly strong increase, and in 1992 and 1993 real growth exceeded 10 percent. Financial policy, too, did not switch to consolidation until early in 1993; in 1992 it still contributed heavily to the stabilization of the recovery.
