In a statement issued today, the ministry said that Baudys' activity "has created an absolutely unacceptable situation from the point of view of the Czech Republic's foreign political interests and harmed its good name." With such a line of action, Baudys has definitely gone beyond the powers of a cabinet member, the ministry said. The statement, given to CTK by Foreign Ministry Spokesman Vit Kurfurst, says that Baudys did not consult either the Foreign Ministry or the government about his proposal. The Foreign Ministry first knew about its content from its foreign partners which, especially in view of the current visit of Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, has created an absolutely unacceptable situation from the point of view of the Czech Republic's foreign political interests. The proposal was handed to representatives of foreign states and international organisations by Czech military and Air Force attaches at Czech representative offices abroad. Such an action harms the Czech Republic's good name abroad and the efforts of its diplomatic activity aimed at creating a picture of the Czech Republic as a reliable and predictable international partner, the statement says. The ministry points to the fact that, regardless of the content of Baudys' proposal, his course of action represents a definite transgression of the powers of individual cabinet members as set down in the Czech Constitution and in the law on power sharing. The method Baudys chose for submitting his proposal rules out the possibility of this act being understood as the move of a private person if it were theoretically allowed for cabinet members to come into contact with foreign partners as private persons, the statement says. Baudys informed journalists about his proposal for ending the Bosnian conflict on Saturday [19 February]. At the same time, he admitted that he had not consulted with either the government or parliament on it. According to Baudys' proposal a "committee of good will" to be entrusted by the united nations with overseeing the situation in the crisis regions should play a major role in Bosnia. According to Baudys, this committee should be made up of representatives of seven states religiously connected with the warring sides in Bosnia.
