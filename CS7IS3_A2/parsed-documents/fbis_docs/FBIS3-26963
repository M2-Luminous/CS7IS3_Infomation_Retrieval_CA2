Wu Jianmin, the spokesman, made the remarks when asked to comment on a meeting between the king of Thailand and Li Denghui of Taiwan. He said the essence of Li Denghui's holiday-making diplomacy is to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan", which is resolutely opposed by the Chinese people, including the people of Taiwan. He hoped that the countries concerned should strictly abide by the joint-communiques and the promises they have made when setting up diplomatic relations with China.
