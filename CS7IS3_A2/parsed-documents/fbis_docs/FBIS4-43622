However, in view of the persisting economic instability in Turkey, the people tend to believe "it is not the right time to consider a customs union." Nevertheless, those who are well aware of the matter believe that Turkey stands to significantly gain from that process. If we wish to improve our economy in the long run, then a customs union is the most reliable system we should adopt.... Ankara will host an important visitor tomorrow. He is former Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van den Broeck, who is now responsible for the EU Foreign Relations Committee. He will hold talks with officials to establish the political inclinations in Ankara. Prime Minister Tansu Ciller seems to maintain her decisive approach on the matter. Meanwhile, significant progress has been made in the talks between the two sides in Brussels. The EU-Turkey Council will meet in October and the process of achieving a customs union will begin at the end of 1994. Whether it likes it or not, Turkey is moving toward establishing a customs union with the EU. Of course, neither side can force the other to agree to that process. In other words, Turkey may decide to abandon it at the last moment. However, as things stand at the present time, Turkey can decide to abandon that process only if the EU adopts a completely unacceptable approach. The two sides are involved in bargaining talks and mutual maneuvering at the present time. [passage omitted] We Must Achieve What We Want on Two Basic Issues Turkey is concerned with two basic issues: 1. To redeem its loss. Turkey will incur a loss from its customs taxes and revenues from the Communal Housing Fund when a customs union is realized. An optimistic estimate is that Turkey stands to lose $2 billion. However, the Ministry of Finance has disclosed that Turkey's loss will total $6 billion. It must have probably added the flies to its calculations. The officials in Brussels will be appalled if that figure is mentioned to them. We should abandon our old habits and draw up a convincing report based on basic information. The EU is already aware of what Turkey stands to lose. Furthermore, it is ready to help Turkey redeem its loss. So, let us not exaggerate the matter. What is left to consider is Greece's obstruction. Obviously, the Turkish officials should move to visit the EU capitals to discuss the two matters. That is unavoidable. 2. Question of Limitations. Turkey will apply the customs union system with certain limitations on imported commodities to protect various sectors in the country. For example, the automotive industry sector will comply with the customs union on a reduced scale for a certain period. Naturally, the representatives of almost all the establishments in the private sector have rushed to Ankara to appeal to be included on the list of the establishments that will be exempt from the customs union to a certain degree. However, a point that should be considered is as follows: The EU officials are gladly expecting Turkey to submit its list on the commodities on which it wishes to impose limitations. That is because they have their own list. Obviously, they will extend their list as much as we extend ours. Turkey's textile industry is an important item on their list. So they are looking for an opportunity to place a reservation on our textile industry to prevent it from taking over the EU markets. The warning the EU officials have made is as follows: "Do not bring up the question of limitations right at the beginning of the talks. Discuss the matter at the end of the negotiations." Unfortunately, no one seems to heed that and similar warnings in Ankara. Apparently we will make a serious mistake if we move to raise the question of limitations at the beginning of the talks. Naturally, the agreement to be reached on a customs union will have to be approved by the EU capitals. Regardless of how the matter is considered, the EU capitals will decide on the matter. We shall suffer an unnecessary loss if we fail to adopt a sensitive approach and if we do not do what has to be done until the last moment. (That is what we usually do.) Let us not repeat our old mistakes, at least, let us not do so on this matter.
