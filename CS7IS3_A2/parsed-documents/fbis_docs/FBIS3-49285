Not a single draft has reached the Sejm yet. However, two proposals concerning the method of work of the new constitution have been drafted, one by the KPN [Confederation for an Independent Poland] and one by the Union of Labor. The Union of Labor suggests referendums in which society would vote on specific constitutional issues, whereas the KPN wants the Constitutional Committee to resume the work it carried out under the previous government and consider the constitutional drafts that were submitted then. The KPN argues that in this way, those parties that failed to win parliamentary seats this time around will have a chance of taking part in the work on the new constitution, and will enable it to be adopted sooner. But the Constitutional Committee, led by Aleksander Kwasniewski, prefers the so-called zero option, in other words making a brand new start on the constitution and declaring all the constitutional drafts submitted under the previous government as null and void. The Sejm is to decide whether the committee will consider the six draft constitutions that have been produced by the Democratic Union, SLD [Democratic Left Alliance], Central Accord, KPN, Senate, and jointly by the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] and Union of Labor. Even if the Sejm does accept the zero option, that does not mean that work on the new basic law will not begin until six months' time. Sejm speaker Jozef Oleksy has urged the Constitutional Committee to produce its own draft constitution in an effort to speed up the adoption of the new basic law, work on which has dragged on for four years already. In Moczulski's opinion, the SLD's Kwasniewski, who harbors presidential ambitions, may cause the new constitution to be adopted in the middle of 1994 so that he can call a premature presidential election in the autumn. Such a scenario is possible because if the SLD and PSL were to produce their own draft, their parliamentary majority would bring about the acceptance of this draft and the defeat of all the others. But there are two major obstacles to this -- the increasing political differences between the PSL and SLD, and the stance of President Walesa. Before the elections, the PSL and SLD came out strongly in favor of a parliamentary system, leaving the president with the mere role of arbiter. But these days, Kwasniewski is making it clear that the SLD is prepared to expand the president's powers considerably. If the PSL fails to agree to this, the SLD, in its bid for a strong presidency, may count only on Walesa's Non-Party Bloc in Support of Reforms, and perhaps the KPN. In turn, if the SLD does accelerate work on the constitution with the intention of bringing about an earlier presidential election, Walesa will object most strongly. The president said recently that he will not allow an earlier presidential election, and made it clear that if the ruling coalition tries to make him resign over the constitution, he will call an earlier parliamentary election. Since becoming chairman of the Constitutional Committee, Kwasniewski has said that he has no intention of curtailing Walesa's presidential term, of which there is still two years left.
