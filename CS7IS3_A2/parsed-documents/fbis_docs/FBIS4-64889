Tjeenk Willink has been appointed to assess on behalf of the crown whether a proposed government cabinet will succeed. This means that the formation of a government is now really under way. With appropriate caution, because the beginning is always difficult and somewhat arbitrary when the result of the election does not point all that clearly in one particular direction. There are now two serious possibilities: A "purple" coalition (comprising the PvdA, [Labor Party], the VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy], and the D66 [Democrats 66]) and a center left coalition. A center right coalition consisting of the CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal], the VVD, and the D66 will only be a real option if "purple" turns out not to be a possibility and the D66 and the PvdA are taken apart. The opinions of the four main parties revealed a few differences. All in all, however, they lead to the conclusion -- incidentally, not very surprising -- conclusion that H. Tjeenk Willink must first test the political will of several parties. Certainly, bearing in mind the attitude of the PvdA and the VVD, it would be imprudent to start negotiations on one of the two plausible coalitions without mature consideration. Regarding the liberals, it is not clear whether they really want or will dare to embark on a "purple" coalition. Perhaps they are ultimately hoping for a right-wing coalition, while some are also thinking of a continuation of the opposition deemed to be profitable. The PvdA is hesitant and divided. One section of the new party and Minister Van Thijn are calling for the coalition without the CDA. This is entirely understandable following the voters' punishing treatment of the Lubbers III government. However, PvdA leader Kok, the vice prime minister in that government, appears to be more in favor of complementing his preferred coalition with the D66. When forming a government, the right policy does not consist of negotiating a coalition, while a couple of negotiators are in fact trying to let these negotiations fail in some devious manner. Such hidden intentions spoil the atmosphere between the various parties and give politics the reputation of shiftiness and incompetence. Moreover, they may have tiresome consequences for the negotiators themselves. Next time, they may even find themselves kicked out, or in a weak position compared with the newcomers on that occasion. For example, if Kok deliberately sabotaged the "purple" option, he would have little defense left against ministerial posts requested by the CDA, provided that he has not already been marginalized by the D66, because of his destructive attitude. Over the next few days, Tjeenk Willink must evaluate the political will of the VVD and the PvdA as accurately as possible. On the other hand, these parties must make a serious choice, even if it proves worse than their expectations. If they opt clearly for a "purple" coalition, as is to be hoped, then the formation of such a coalition could still fail for reasons connected with its content. However, that must not be allowed to occur due to the lack of goodwill and due to excessive inflexibility. It is understandable that some members of the PvdA and the VVD in particular harbor doubts regarding the possibility of a "purple" coalition. One important argument, however, is that taking a crumbling CDA as a partner in government would have definite disadvantages, namely entailing a shaky leadership, internal reproaches, and a great desire to establish a fresh image among the electorate. Not a pleasant mixture.
