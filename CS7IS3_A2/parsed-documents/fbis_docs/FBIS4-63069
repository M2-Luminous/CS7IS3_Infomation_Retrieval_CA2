It was carried out at the initiative of the Republic's President Nursultan Nazarbayev. No state of emergency was imposed in Alma-Ata [Almaty] or the other cities, Kairbek Suleymanov, state councillor of the Republic of Kazakhstan, underlined in his interview for KRASNAYA ZVEZDA. But the rising crime had become so "burning" an issue that the situation called for tough measures, which proved sudden to some extent. The first unusual thing was that substantial law and order forces, including internal troops, were brought in to impose order in towns and populated centers. No Army units were deployed. The job done is not small. According to the state councillor, 50,428 people came under scrutiny of the patrols and militia bodies during the week. Naturally, those are people only detained for offenses. During the week 333 kg of narcotics were seized. The militia's "hauls" were sometimes between 0.5 to 1.5 kg. Suleymanov does not dispute that some regular routes for drugs coming from Tajikistan were discovered, but in 11 instances the "goods" were carried by citizens of that Republic. Some 1,500 illegally stored weapons were seized. Militia seized a submachinegun and a "Mukha" hand-held grenade launcher from Oleg Osadchiy, a military officer, who was attempting to sell them. The operation is over. On the whole it yielded the expected results while one cannot say that crime in Kazakhstan has been finally defeated.
