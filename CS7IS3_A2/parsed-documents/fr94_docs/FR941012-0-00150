FR941012-0-00150 FR941012-0-00011 At paragraph (i)(8) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that training be conducted by a designated person. As discussed above, a designated person is an employee who has the requisite knowledge, training and experience to perform the specific duties. The proposed rule did not contain a similar requirement. Some commenters said that it was important that training be conducted by a qualified or certified person (Ex. 9&hyph;3, 9&hyph;13, 9&hyph;16). OSHA has included this provision in the final rule because the Agency wants to assure that regardless of whether employers rely on their own personnel to conduct training or utilize outside experts, the person providing training must have the necessary qualifications and background in the subject matter being taught. Paragraph (i)(9) of the final rule requires that training required by this section be presented in a manner that the employee is able to understand. This provision also requires that the employer assure that training materials are appropriate in content and vocabulary to the educational level, literacy and language skills of the employees being trained. A similar provision was not contained in the proposed rule. OSHA has added this provision in the final rule as a way of ensuring that all employees, regardless of their cultural or educational background, will receive adequate training on how to perform their job safely. OSHA notes that this requirement applies to both logging and first-aid training. Paragraph (i)(10) requires the certification of training. While this provision was not contained in the proposed rule, several commenters stressed the need to document training (Ex. 9&hyph;16, 9&hyph;18; Tr. OR 137, 558&hyph;59, 643&hyph;44). OSHA agrees with these commenters that documenting training is necessary. First, in the final rule OSHA has allowed prior training to be acceptable in lieu of initial training. In the proposed rule, OSHA had required that each new employee, regardless of experience and prior training, receive training prior to initial assignment. In order to accept prior training in lieu of new training, OSHA believes employers must establish a process for determining whether the prior training was adequate. The certification procedure provides that process without imposing a significant burden. Second, several commenters said that many establishments do not currently document training (Tr. W1 95, OR 92). As such, employers do not have any records to indicate whether appropriate training has been provided. Third, some commenters testified that all training programs should be written programs (Ex. 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;42). While many large logging establishments already have implemented impressive written training programs, OSHA is also aware that a written training and recordkeeping requirement would impose a paperwork burden and significant burden on small employers in this industry (Ex. 5&hyph;44). OSHA believes that training certification is a less burdensome way of documenting whether employees have been adequately trained. OSHA notes that the time and costs of training certification have been included in the final regulatory impact analysis. Paragraph (i)(10)(i) of the final rule requires that the employer verify compliance with paragraph (i) of this section by preparing a written certification record. This provision also requires that the written certification record contain the name or other identity of the employee trained, the date(s) of the training, and the signature of the person who conducted the training or the signature of the employer. In addition, this provision requires that if the employer relies on training conducted prior to the employee being hired or prior to the effective date of this section, the certification record shall indicate the date the employer determined the prior training was adequate rather than the date of actual training. The proposed rule did not contain a certification requirement.
