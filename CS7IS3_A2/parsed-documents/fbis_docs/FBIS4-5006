Linkage of networks of the two companies will provide for an integrated system offering international data communications services. They will offer improved services encompassing an expansion of service areas and increased sophistication in services offered. INTEC and Sprint signed an "International Communications Mutual Linkage Contract." Based on this contract, INTEC's packet switching net known as "Ace Telenet" will link up with and use the "Sprint Net Service"--operated by Japan Sprint, Sprint International's Japanese subsidiary--as a gateway. This arrangement will enable INTEC to provide services without changing its status as a domestic special class II operator. INTEC's service area will expand to over 40 countries. Currently, it services 10 countries, including the United States, Great Britain and Southeast Asia, but the service areas will be expanded geographically to include Australia, South America, the European continent and the former Soviet republics. Services offered will be expanded from the current rate system based on volume of usage to fixed rate systems and rates for circuit use which bypasses Japan. Companies with branches in multiple overseas locations can utilize a variety of services with options covering such aspects as purpose, data volume, optimum linkage times as well as arrange direct communication links between their overseas branches and billing and settlement of service fees on a consolidated basis via their Japan headquarters. INTEC is scheduled to initiate the new services effective the first part of April. It claims that its fees will be 10 to 30 percent lower than those of other long-distance service companies.
