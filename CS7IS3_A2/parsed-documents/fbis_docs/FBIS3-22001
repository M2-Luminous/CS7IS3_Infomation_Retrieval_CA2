The Argentine officials will assist the Clinton administration in drafting the agenda for the so-called Summit of the Americas, to be held in Miami at the end of this year, which is to be attended by the presidents of the Americas to discuss issues pertaining to narcotrafficking, corruption, and terrorism, among others. The Argentine proposal, which is still being drafted, suggests an overall modification of penal regulations to prevent drug cartels from continuing to take advantage of legal gaps. According to a communique issued last night by Lestelle's office, "at the suggestion of President Menem the antinarcotics struggle will be included on the agenda of the Summit of the Americas." Menem wants to arrive in Miami with his homework done. He will therefore be launching an offensive at the legislative level to promulgate a series of laws based on measures that have been suggested by the United States. Menem believes that for the time being, no new scandals involving the government with ill-gotten money will show up. In view of this he has decided to take advantage of this situation to push for passage four laws that he personally put on hold when the scandals broke involving the suitcases belonging to [Menem's sister-in-law] Amira [Yoma] and Monzer Al Kassar's citizenship. During his visit to Mar del Plata, where he attended the ordinary meeting of the Inter-American Commission for the Control of Drug Abuse (CICAD), Gelbard gave his blessings to the four draft bills that Lestelle uncovered when he learned that Amira would be acquitted before the end of 1994. Three years after learning about Yoma's bizarre activities, Lestelle is supporting the following initiatives: -- Repentant: It authorizes magistrates to reduce the sentences of those drug traffickers who agree to cooperate with the courts. The implementation of this legal figure resulted in the dismantling of the gang to which Amira Yoma reportedly belonged. The government is not worried about Mario Caserta, the only one arrested under the Narcogate deal, because it is expected that Menem's former friend will be released before the approval of the repentant law. -- Informer: It lifts the penalty of those involved who supply information on the operations of drug cartels. It is one grade lower than repentant. -- Undercover Agent: It allows security force members to infiltrate drug cartels under the control of the courts. -- Cargoes Under Court Surveillance: It authorizes the continuation of drug operations to detain those responsible in the country where the drug is received. Referring to the issues he discussed with Gore during an impromptu news conference, Menem said: "We discussed the scourges of narcotrafficking and terrorism, and the urgent need to undertake joint efforts to combat them." The president did not explain to the journalists what these "joint efforts" would be, but he did give an indication of the U.S. Government's aspirations, which go beyond the bills the Argentine Government has promised to promote in Congress. -- "Is there any possibility that the Armed Forces would participate in the counternarcotics struggle?" a journalist asked. -- "Not for the time being," answered Menem. -- "Why not for the time being?" -- "Because that is the way it is: Not for the time being. A politician cannot make predictions. A politician talks about facts. I am talking about a fact: Not for the time being."
