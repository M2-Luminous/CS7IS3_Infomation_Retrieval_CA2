FR940412-0-00011 FR940412-0-00004 40 CFR Part 271 [FRL&hyph;4856&hyph;2] Texas: Final Authorization of State Hazardous Waste Management Program Revisions AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Immediate final rule. SUMMARY: The State of Texas has applied for final authorization of a revision to its hazardous waste program under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed Texas' application and decided that its hazardous waste program revision satisfies all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Unless adverse written comments are received during the review and comment period provided for public participation in this process, EPA intends to approve Texas' hazardous waste program revision, subject to the authority retained by EPA in accordance with the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984. Texas' application for the program revision is available for public review and comment. DATES: This final authorization for Texas shall be effective June 27, 1994, unless EPA publishes a prior Federal Register ( FR ) action withdrawing this immediate final rule. All comments on Texas' program revision application must be received by the close of business May 27, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of the Texas program revision application and the materials which EPA used in evaluating the revision are available from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday at the following addresses for inspection and copying: Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, 1700 N. Congress Avenue, Austin, TX 78711&hyph;3087, and U.S. EPA, Region 6 Library, 12th Floor, First Interstate Bank Tower at Fountain Place, 1445 Ross Avenue, Dallas, Texas 65202, phone (214) 655&hyph;6444. Written comments, referring to Docket Number TX&hyph;94&hyph;4, should be sent to Dick Thomas, Region 6 Authorization Coordinator, Grants and Authorization Section (6H&hyph;HS), RCRA Programs Branch, U.S. EPA Region 6, First Interstate Bank Tower at Fountain Place, 1445 Ross Avenue, Dallas, Texas 75202, (214) 655&hyph;8528. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dick Thomas, Region 6 Authorization Coordinator, Grants and Authorization Section (6H&hyph;HS), RCRA Programs Branch, U.S. EPA Region 6, First Interstate Bank Tower at Fountain Place, 1445 Ross Avenue, Dallas, Texas 75202, (214) 655&hyph;8528. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background States with final authorization under section 3006(b) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA or ``the Act''), 42 U.S.C. 6926(b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous waste program. In addition, as an interim measure, the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (Pub. L. 98&hyph;616, November 8, 1984, hereinafter ``HSWA'') allows States to revise their programs to become substantially equivalent instead of equivalent to RCRA requirements promulgated under HSWA authority. States exercising the latter option receive interim authorization for the HSWA requirements under section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g), and later apply for final authorization for the HSWA requirements. Revisions to State hazardous waste programs are necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority is modified or when certain other changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR 260&hyph;266, 268, 124, and 270.
