The candidates made brief statements after 95.6 percent of the votes were counted and the results announced, giving them a wide margin over the remaining 16 candidates. Liberal candidate Samper regretted that he did not win in the initial elections and thanked the residents of Santa Fe de Bogota who gave him a relatively broad margin compared with the rest of the country. The liberals expected to garner more votes and the climate, although festive, was one of concern at the Orquidea Real Hotel where Samper kept abreast of the vote count. The Pastrana supporters, on the other hand, were euphoric in the Tequendama Hotel because the slight margin garnered by Samper augurs well for them in the runoff elections. Pastrana thanked his family, his supporters, and all of those who voted for any candidate and invited them to join his bandwagon. Candidate Antonio Navarro of the Commitment with Colombia movement, who obtained a little over 3.5 percent of the votes, said he "was calm because despite all the difficulties that existed during the campaign, we obtained a decent and dignified vote which leaves us in a position to do well in the future."
