FBIS4-13202 "drnes075dd_94002" FBIS-NES-94-075 Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 Palestinian Affairs Hamas Political Bureau Issues Statement Hamas Political Bureau Issues Statement JN1904103094 Amman AL-SABIL in Arabic 19-25 Apr 94 p 9 JN1904103094 Amman AL-SABIL Arabic BFN [Statement issued by the Political Bureau of the Hamas; place and date not given] [Text] Since he took office, the terrorist Yitzhaq Rabin has been pursuing repression against all sections of our Palestinian population and ordering the occupation troops to shoot at our people without discriminating between armed and unarmed or young and old people. He has also unleashed armed gangs of settlers to terrorize and kill our people and profane their holy sites. Unprovoked and ongoing killings carried out by the occupation troops and settlers have targeted women, children, and the elderly. Despite Rabin's peace protestations, the launch of the Madrid-Washington process, and the signing of the Oslo accord, the Rabin government's crimes against our people have doubled as have the draconian security measures, including collective punishment, and the closure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. In response to these criminal policies, our people have stepped up their resistance to occupation and their confrontations with its tools represented in the troops and settlers, which is the same strategy of Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]. The Rabin government's repressive measures have gone too far and climaxed when his soldiers colluded with the settlers in the hideous Hebron massacre against kneeling worshippers at dawn prayers. Moreover, soldiers opened fire on pregnant women while at home or standing in their doorways, thus spurring our people to escalate their resistance to occupation and to avenge the martyrs of the horrific Hebron massacre. To honor the martyrs' blood, the martyr 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions active across our country decided to take revenge for our martyrs' blood. Two of our heroic mujahidin carried out two acts of martyrdom in 'Afula and Hadera against soldier and settler targets. The operations were mounted in the face of the strict security measures instituted by the Rabin government to attend celebrations marking the anniversary of the theft of our country. The failure of the Rabin government's measures to preempt our heroic mujahidin on the eve of launching an implementation of the Oslo accord and against the backdrop of his promises of security and tranquility for the Zionist public as a result of that accord and the disgraceful PLO concessions, coupled with rising Likud opposition to his policies, has left him frustrated and feeling a sense of doom and confusion. Hamas would like to make the following points: First: The terrorist Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has issued a threat to brother Jordan, claiming that the Movement maintains its headquarters on its territories. Rabin demanded that Jordan crack down on Hamas in a wretched attempt to capitalize on a confirmation by the Movement's representative in Amman that al-Qassam Battalions were responsible for the heroic operations in 'Afula and Hadera. Rabin and his criminal government colleagues know only too well that the planning, execution, and announcements on the battalion's operations all originate in the occupied territories. Using a combination of his inability to forestall these operations and the exposure of his deceptiveness in the settlement process, Rabin issued the threat to Jordan to advance the following goals: 1. To shift attention away from the failure of his draconian security and repressive measures to thwart the heroic acts of martyrdom executed by al-Qassam Battalions and our people's resistance throughout the land. 2. To use the clout of the United States to press Jordan into signing a unilateral peace agreement with his government on the Oslo accord model. This threat fits in with the inspection of merchant vessels bound for the Port of al-'Aqabah as a lever of pressure on brotherly Jordan and the retention of Syria on Washinton's list of nations sponsoring terrorism as a tool to press the Syrians into backing down on their demand for a universal settlement on all fronts. Hamas is not unaware of what the enemy hopes to reap from peace -- the Arab parties' capitulation to its demeaning terms and a consolidation of its dominance over our region, while it stays in our territories. Rabin and his government's allegations are false and groundless. Our Movement's single-minded purpose is resistance to occupation until victory and liberation. Hamas hereby underlines its concern for the security and stability of all the countries where it has political and media representatives who observe their respective laws. Hamas strives to deny any grounds for the occupying enemy to apply pressure on any of these countries. Second: Hamas' established policy had been that 'Izz al-Din al-Qassam Battalion's operations should be directed exclusively at occupation troops and its military agencies, as well as the settlers as army reservists. Al-Qassam Battalions had taken pains to spare civilians in their anti-occupation action. However, the Rabin government's strong-arm tactics running counter to the most basic human rights and the failure of the enemy military and settlers to distinguish between fighter mujahidin and unarmed civilians prompted al-Qassam Battalions to adopt the principle of reciprocity, which has been sanctioned by temporal and divine laws alike. The 'Afula and Hadera attacks that targeted concentrations of troops and settlers and hit some civilians were meant as a deterrent for the savage Zionist aggression on our people and a legitimate revenge for the blood of the martyrs of the hideous Hebron massacre. The actions were not a constant policy for al-Qassam Battalions, but an exception dictated by the enemy government. Hamas is prepared to reconsider this exception, provided the enemy prime minister, his government, and army undertake to stop killing unarmed civilians of our people. Our objective is to guarantee the security and safety of our people and deter killers so that our people are not made easy targets for enemy soldiers and unrestrained settler gangs. Hamas will adhere to its policy of resistance as long as occupation remains. Third: The quickened pace of jihad and heroic operations by our mujahidin in al-Qassam Battalions fits in with the Movement's game plan of resistance until occupation is routed and our sacred land liberated. To cover the abysmal failure of the Rabin government to thwart our mujahidin's heroic operations, this government claims that the Hamas' actions are designed to undermine or abort the peace process, in an attempt to discredit Hamas in the eyes of the internationaal community. We want to make an oft-repated statement that Hamas is not adverse to the principle of peace. However, the kind of peace offered by the enemy government is not peace; it is a consolidation of occupation and the iniquity to which our people are subjected. We are aware that the Oslo operation is one of humiliating surrender by the PLO leadership and capitulation to the Zionist and American terms and dictates. The operation carries the seeds of its own destruction; built on unjust and false foundations, it is destined to crash. The right beginning lies in the following steps: 1. A full Zionist withdrawal from our Palestinian land and the dismantlement and removal of the settlements. 2. Free and fair general elections in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in which our peole would choose their representatives and leadership. 3. It is the elected leadership that reflects the hopes and ambitions of our people and decides on the next steps and the future of the Palestinian cause. This is to shed light on Hamas' stands and to expose the lies and frivolities of the enemy prime minister. In the meantime, Hamas promises our people to sustain the jihad and martyrdom until the liberation of all of Palestine.
