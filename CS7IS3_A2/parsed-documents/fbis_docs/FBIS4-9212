How would you assess, from that new position, the current political, economic, and social situation in our country? [Constantinescu] From the political angle, I believe that a simple qualitative and quantitative analysis of the current balance of forces could not be conclusive if it is done by ignoring the economic and social context. Currently the fact that three separate public opinion polls reached the same conclusions raises two issues: the CDR [Democratic Convention of Romania] is leading, closely followed by the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania], and, contrary to all expectations, the audience for the extreme left parties has proved to be limited. I believe that the growth of the CDR occurred owing to mutations within the opinion of the workers while we also managed to keep our traditional electorate. That shift was caused by the fact that beginning in December 1993 the CDR accepted the trade unions' proposal to establish a real social pact that should be guaranteed by a coalition government set up by the major political forces in the country. The CDR did so while the PDSR delayed making a decision merely to opt, after four months, for a monochrome government pursuing a harsh policy with respect to the trade unions. The second issue concerns the number of the PRM [Greater Romania Party] and PSM [Socialist Party of Labor] followers and it consists in the fact that the aforementioned parties were unable to gain in their ratings because they could not use their principal weapons -- demagoguery and populism. Those weapons pulverized from the outset, in the very moment they decided to support a government that is distrusted by 70 percent of the population. Under such circumstances I believe that in the future a major role in the changes we all wish will be played by the peasantry. [Radulescu] You said that the program you presented last week offers solutions and stages that have to be completed over the next 18 months. How should one interpret that deadline -- is it signalling that you have given up the idea of early elections, is it an offer made to the current ruling party, or is it neither of them, but rather a third solution found by the CDR? [Constantinescu] We pondered all possible variants because Romania's current situation is so grave that one cannot afford to hesitate or perform experiments. The deadline of 18 months was believed to begin the moment a new government begins its activity. That government should be an anti-crisis one and if it were to be set up by the opposition alone, it might well be a sacrifice government with a mandate that is limited in time to 18 months. But even in such a case agreements should be reached with the PDSR and the unions. No serious policy can be conducted without dialogue and agreements based on mutual respect and trust. [Radulescu] This means that there is no firm CDR option to hold early elections... [Constantinescu] The opposition cannot trigger early elections. That can be solely achieved by the president of the country in cooperation with the parliamentary majority. The opposition should be prepared for elections. I would like to point out the PDSR's cynical way in which they approach this issue, on the one hand, by saying that early elections would be a catastrophe for the country, and, on the other, they launch the electoral campaign. Probably, they want to trap us by luring us into an electoral campaign in which the material means and the possibilities are unequally distributed and thus distract the attention of public opinion because currently they cannot offer them bread so they offer them circus shows. In the short run the opposition will continue to protect the interests of the citizens, while in the long run it will protect national interests. Our priority is not to gain victory, as a political force, but rather to halt the decay of the economic and social situation. [Radulescu] The CDR, as an alliance, is currently facing a number of internal difficulties, such as the recent problems with the PAC [Civic Alliance Party], the "convulsions" of the liberals within and outside the CDR, and, generally, the multitude of ideologies condensed within the alliance. Is this formula still viable? [Constantinescu] Over the last one and a half years everyone has been predicting the disintegration of the CDR. However, that event has not occurred and now it is hard to anticipate that any political grouping belonging to the CDR could afford, despite lesser fits of vanity, to secede from the alliance. Of course, life is not easy inside the CDR, but reality has proved two things: We managed to elaborate a program that suits all doctrinal and ideological tendencies and we managed to have all our documents adopted by consensus. My creed and my role is to maintain our unity. [Radulescu] Mr. President, about a month ago the "battle" for Transylvania also began. The PDSR and the PD [Democratic Party] have conquered very important positions in that area. What is the CDR's offer regarding its national policy and its policy with respect to its ally, the UDMR [Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania]? [Constantinescu] All that agitation has been generated by the weakness of the PUNR [National Romanian Unity Party], by its erosion caused by its long cooperation with the current rulers and its participation in gambling schemes. As far as the CDR's relations with the UDMR are concerned, things have not always evolved smoothly, but eventually most of the disputed issues could be settled. I believe that the national issue is a very serious one, but one should also keep in mind that merely 8 percent of the population is concerned over the inter-ethnic issue, whereas a much larger percentage focuses on economic and social issues. As a matter of fact, running on separate lists in the last elections, the CDR obtained the most votes in Transylvania. [Radulescu] How do you assess the future evolution of the CDR's relations with the state power? [Constantinescu] The CDR's intention, which was also expressed in the manifest published a fortnight ago, is to replace general and theoretical discussions by talks intended to spot practical solutions to overcome the crisis situation. However, the PDSR is currently blocked by its electoral pledge, namely implementing a reform that does not hurt, as well as by its nature of being a party of cadres, which makes it be the defender of a group of interests made up of the political, economic, and administrative bureaucracy, which is not interested in reform. This makes it difficult for us to give it a blank check in the form of a PDSR government enjoying the support of the opposition. Cooperation is still possible, but first we have to conclude very precise agreements regarding a number of concrete measures to be taken before exact deadlines, as solely this could make us selectively support them in Parliament. [Radulescu] You are the personality that obtained the best ratings among the opposition. However, within the CDR there are also strong pro-monarchy tendencies. Is that not a contradiction? [Constantinescu] The pro-monarchy options of some of the CDR member parties do not contradict the constitution. Abiding by the constitution, there is a complicated procedure to change the state order, the whole process requiring at least two referendums. The whole campaign that was waged against me and the CDR was based on allegations that we want to change the constitution. However, no one in the CDR has raised that issue. The largest part of the percentage of votes obtained by the PNTCD [National Peasant Christian-Democratic Party] might coincide with the one of the pro-monarchy option, but one has to respect the freedom of opinion of a certain part of the population.
