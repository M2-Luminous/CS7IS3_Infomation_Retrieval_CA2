A Spate of Resignation Begins Among Republic's Leaders"] [Text] It became known the other day that in the capital of Kazakhstan, Alma-Ata [Almaty], Uzbekistan's special services kidnapped well-known opposition leader Murad Dzhurayev, whom they had been hunting for his part in publishing the ERKH newspaper. Dzhurayev was grabbed in a private apartment. According to some information, Erkin Ashurov, director of the Samarkand tea packaging factory, was arrested with him. To all appearances the kidnapped men were taken out to Tashkent. When Kazakhstan human rights activists asked the Republic's prosecutor's office and the Ministry of Internal Affairs for clarification regarding this, yet another incident involving Uzbekistan's special services, the reply was once again that the local law enforcement organs "had not been notified" about the holding of the "operational measure" by Ministry of Internal Affairs operatives of another state on territory within their jurisdiction. It can also be stated that the agreements on cooperation between special services and law enforcement organs of CIS states (the latest such agreement was signed between Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan in Dzhambul on 12 May) contain no mechanism to prevent abuses and violations of human rights on the part of these services. Meanwhile, in Uzbekistan they are vividly discussing a whole series of sensational resignations and "transfers to other jobs" of ranking leading lights including Mavlon Umurzakov, chief adviser to the president; and Islambek Yusufbekov, chairman of the State Committee on Science, among others. More remarkable in this series is the firing of Umurzakov, who was in charge of "cadre selection and placement" both when he was head of the organizational department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Uzbekistan and in the position of adviser to the president, and who has been regarded as one of the most powerful men at the top. His resignation touched off a whole chain of dismissals of officials of various ranks down to regional officials who used to be his "proteges." Umurzakov was sent, according to Karimov's order, to be "in charge of Syrdarya Oblast," only to disappear without a trace. Rumors have it that he is on the run because he had come to take bribes without moderation, thereby causing displeasure among his comrades and primarily another "gray eminence," Ismail Dzhurabekov, who had earlier been unrivaled in this department and had invariably been agricultural vice prime minister ever since Rashidov's times. According to one view, Karimov is getting rid of his closest but too despicable comrades in arms in this manner in a bid to bolster his positions, which have been seriously shaken of late. Local observers note an extremely nervous atmosphere among the president's entourage and among his staff as a whole. In their opinion, the staff is weary, harassed by constant contradictory and excessive demands, and whereas any official could dream of getting close to "the man at the top" in the past, now only few feel attracted by the prospect.
