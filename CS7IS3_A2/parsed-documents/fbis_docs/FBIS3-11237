The resolution reads as follows: After studying the case of Arcatao, San Jose de las Flores, San Isidro Labrador, and Nueva Trinidad Municipalities, all in Chalatenango Department, and for what the TSE believes are extenuating circumstances in those places, we resolve: That the 20 March elections in those municipalities be held simultaneously in the departmental capital of Chalatenango as well as in the respective municipalities. The TSE will be in charge of transporting the members of the Voting Table Boards and the party poll representatives with the support of Salvadoran Air Force helicopters. Once the voting is over in those municipalities, the ballot boxes and other electoral documents, as well as the members of the Voting Table Boards and party poll representatives, will be transferred by the same means to the departmental capital. Once there, they will proceed, according to the law, to open the ballot boxes, count votes, and issue the closing and vote count certificate, which should include the election results in the respective municipalities and in the departmental capital and which should be signed by all members of the Voting Table Boards. The security and the personal and moral safety of the members of the Voting Table Boards, party poll representatives, and Air Force crew members who will transport the personnel and electoral documents, as well as the safety of the helicopters, will be the responsibility of the mission of UN Observers for El Salvador, Onusal. For notification: This is the TSE resolution issued this afternoon in an effort to find a satisfactory solution according to Salvadoran law. We are sure we have found a solution within the legal framework by establishing voting procedures that take the requirements and conditions in those places into consideration but which also respect our laws. That is the announcement we wanted to make. We urge you to inform the Salvadoran and international public. [Reporter] It was said that conditions were not right for holding elections in those municipalities. What has changed? [Zaldivar] The solution says that extenuating circumstances persist. It is clear in the resolution. [Reporter] What factors made you change your mind? [Zaldivar] We have not changed anything. We have maintained the participation of voters residing in the departmental capital and the integration of the Voting Table Boards in the departmental capital for each of those municipalities. This has not changed. We are also giving facilities to those sectors who protested saying that they live in those places. Well, those who live in Arcatao will vote there; and voters from Arcatao who live in the departmental capital of Chalatenango will vote in Chalatenango. As I said, the resolution is intended to provide facilities so all voters legally registered in the Electoral Registry and who have a voter registration card can vote wherever they are. [Reporter] What extenuating circumstances [words indistinct] for the next government? [Zaldivar] No. I can mention two extenuating circumstances -- as stated in the TSE's initial resolution -- for the transfer of the members of the Voting Table Board from the municipalities to the departmental capital. The Municipal Councils of those four municipalities are not handling their official business in their respective municipalities but in the departmental capital. They have not been able to return. It has not been possible to install the municipal electoral boards in those municipalities and their activities are being handled in the departmental capital. We have received notes from those municipal electoral boards saying that they are in exile. [Reporter] What kind of controls will there be to prevent people from voting twice, as some will be voting in the departmental capital and others in the municipalities? [Words indistinct] to control that possibility? [Zaldivar] There will be controls throughout the country. Our voting system uses indelible ink, which ensures that each person can vote only once, not only in this case but throughout the country. Immediately after a person votes, his finger will be stained with indelible ink. Should he try to vote at another voting table, the first thing he will be asked to do is to show his hands to make sure that his finger is not stained with indelible ink. [Reporter] In general terms, how are preparations for tomorrow proceeding at the national level? Some irregularities have been reported with the electoral register [words indistinct] total number of voters? [Zaldivar] Magistrate Colindres will answer that question. [Colindres] As far as I know, complaints have been received from San Antonio de los Ranchos and Las Vueltas involving the electoral list. What happened? Certain citizens -- to be more precise, a little over 16,000 citizens -- requested voter registration cards and said they wanted to vote in a given municipality. After they received their voter registration card, they decided they wanted to vote in another municipality. When the TSE realized that these people had received their voter registration cards and then asked to vote elsewhere, it excluded them from the list of the place where they had received their voter registration card and then issued them another voter registration card so they could vote in the other municipality. Otherwise, these persons would end up with a voter registration card for the first place and one for the new place. Consequently, to guarantee....[pauses] As soon as a new voter registration card is issued, the previous one is eliminated. That is what happened with the 16,000 citizens who decided to change their polling place. [Reporter] Dr. Zaldivar, refugee liaison boards claim you have blocked the work for which they were elected because you do not want to accredit them to supervise the implementation of [words indistinct] the country's elections? [Zaldivar] The Pollwatchers Board members were sworn in on 26 May 1993 and have been accredited and working within the TSE since then. The Pollwatchers Board is made up of a representative and an alternate for each of the legally registered political parties. I do not know what they mean when they say they have not been accredited. [Reporter] Commander Gerson Martinez said you did not want to accredit the alternate members so they could work. [Zaldivar] They were accredited. I do not know what kind of accreditation they have in mind. They are working....[pauses] I personally swore in Gerson Martinez -- all of them -- on 26 May, so I do not know what accreditation they have in mind. [Reporter] Dr. Zaldivar, there were some complaints from Jutiapa, Cabanas Department. Apparently some of the ballots did not include the MNR [National Revolutionary Movement] flag. Do you know about that? [Zaldivar] No, we know nothing about it. [Reporter] Dr. Zaldivar [words indistinct] at the last minute concerning different polling places in the country. People in [name indistinct] municipality complain that the logistics failed there because they have yet to receive what the TSE promised them. [Zaldivar] What municipal voting board? [Reporter] There are reports from the representatives of the... [Zaldivar, interrupting] No, I mean what department. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] [Zaldivar] What was their complaint, please? [Reporter] They complain about logistics problems. They have yet to receive the material they were promised and they lack the human resources to handle tomorrow's elections. [Zaldivar] No, quite the contrary. The president and two members of the electoral board in San Salvador visited us at noon today. They came to report something we had learned of only minutes earlier, through the electoral project's management office. They said the Francisco Menendez National Institute had not been opened, and the electoral material could not be brought in. I immediately contacted the appropriate official, meaning the education minister, and the pertinent orders were given. We were surprised to learn that a polling place....[pauses] an education center that was publicly mentioned in this week's newspapers as one of the Education Ministry facilities requested by the TSE was not open. The Education Ministry publicly listed the education centers that would be used as polling places, and the Francisco Menendez National Institute was among them. Consequently, the minister issued the necessary orders and the facilities were opened minutes later. All the material has been delivered and is ready for tomorrow at 0600, when the Pollwatchers Board will be installed so voting can begin at 0700. [Reporter] Dr. Zaldivar, what will happen in the case of Jutiapa Municipality, for example, where apparently the MNR flag does not appear on the ballots for municipal councilmen? Will Article 325 of the electoral code be implemented to suspend the voting process? That is, if this is true, since the reports we have are unofficial. [Zaldivar] First of all, I cannot answer because we have no official or unofficial report on the incident. We knew nothing about this situation until now. Any case that may arise will be analyzed based on the legal provisions, and it will also be settled based on the same legal provisions. [Reporter] Dr. Zaldivar, this morning Dr. Zamora reported a series of irregularities concerning the electoral material [words indistinct] will be used tomorrow. He also spoke about transportation for the voters. Have you solved the irregularities [words indistinct] meeting this morning? [Zaldivar] Yes. The truth is that we did not discuss any irregularities. The most important topic of discussion was the Chalatenango municipalities. We could hardly refer to events that have not happened yet. For us, facts are only what is officially known and confirmed. [Reporter] Do you think the measures taken in Chalatenango contribute to reconciliation or polarization? Also, is there a formal agreement among all the parties? Did your people consult all of the parties, including the FMLN, for this effort? [Zaldivar] The code very specifically states that the determination of extenuating circumstances and their subsequent resolution are the exclusive responsibility of the TSE. Nevertheless, this tribunal has consulted the political parties when it has made decisions about the elections. One example is electoral procedure. Although the code empowers us to establish procedures for these elections, we have consulted the political parties. They have even signed records of these consultations expressing their acceptance of the election procedure. The same is true of other activities, which, although our authority is exclusive, we shared with the political parties. [Reporter] I also asked you if you think these measures contribute to reconciliation or polarization in these municipalities. [Zaldivar] We are convinced that this contributes to reconciliation because we are allowing voters to cast their votes in their areas of residence. In addition, voters who have reason not to return to their municipalities can cast their votes where they feel safer. I think both groups will feel safer. [Reporter] How many voter registration cards must still be distributed? [Zaldivar] I would like to clarify that there is nothing left to distribute because the deadline expired at 0000 on 17 March. We distributed 825,000 voter registration cards, which exceeds our goals. [Reporter] How soon does the TSE expect to have the (?election figures?) [Zaldivar] Well, as soon as possible. This is not a definite time, of course, but we expect to have results by 2200. We do not expect to announce final results by that time. We hope to be able to announce any wide margins in the vote count. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] [Zaldivar] There are 2,722,000 registered voters. I have said that 825,000 voter registration cards have been issued as part of the registration drive. [Reporter] How many cards have been issued in the country? [Zaldivar] A total of 2,600,000 persons have their cards. The figure I gave previously is the number of cards issued in the past few months. This figure, plus the cards that had already been issued, means that 2.6 million Salvadorans will cast their votes. [Reporter] The opposition parties tried to introduce a proposal whereby 60,000 youths who turn 20 would be permitted to vote. What happened to that legislation? [Zaldivar] You said it. They tried to introduce a proposal. The current law does not permit that. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] [Zaldivar] Let us not confuse things. The code does not say the blind cannot vote. [Reporter] How could they? [Zaldivar] We do not have a special procedure in the code or in Salvadoran electoral law to make it possible for the blind to vote. Guatemala has incorporated the Braille system onto the ballot so the blind can vote. In El Salvador, however, the blind are very smart. It is not necessary to mark a flag. You can even fold the blank ballot and put it into the ballot box. If he can make a mark, he can also do this. Their teachers could have instructed them on the approximate location of the blind person's party flag. In addition, they can be aided by a seeing person both in arriving at the Voting Table Board and also going into the voting booth, where he can make his mark by himself. Then his seeing companion will accompany him to the ballot box where he will cast his vote. It is perfectly possible for a blind person to vote. [Reporter] Mr. President, what is the total number of voting tables for tomorrow's elections? [Zaldivar] There are 6,981 tables. [Reporter] What did you talk about with [words indistinct]? Did it have anything to do with the municipalities? [Zaldivar] No. They came to request information. The secretary was preparing the final draft of the resolution as they arrived, so there is no relationship.
