[Kumagai] We have to pass the budget bill through the lower house as soon as possible. Japan and the United States must reach an agreement on the economic framework talks before the Naples summit in July. It is also hoped that suspicions attached to North Korea's development of nuclear weapons will eventually be cleared through peaceful negotiations; however, if the United Nations decides on imposing sanctions, we will cooperate within constitutional limits. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Do you mean the government's conventional view that the Constitution does not recognize the right to collective defense remains unchanged? [Kumagai] It is not necessary for the new cabinet to change the government's long-held views. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] What do you think about criticism of the existence of a dual power structure? [Kumagai] It is important for the prime minister to perform his duties using good judgment while increasing the openness of the decisionmaking process in his administration. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Do you see any possibility of a dissolution of the lower house and a general election under the current multiple-seat constituency system? [Kumagai] The Diet adopted a bill on a new electoral system. A dissolution of the lower house under the current electoral system would reverse the wheels of history. We have to avoid that. The next lower house election should be held under the newly adopted electoral system. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] How will the government promote discussion of the tax reform issue? [Kumagai] Discussions of tax reform would serve as an important step toward mending tattered relations with the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and bringing the party back into the coalition. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] What are the prospects for restoring coalition ties with the SDPJ? [Kumagai] There are points we have to reflect on, such as procedural mistakes. With this in mind, we have to talk persistently with the SDPJ to win its understanding. I believe the SDPJ will return to the coalition because the SDPJ agreed on basic coalition policies after thorough debate. We have to do our utmost to have the SDPJ back; otherwise, passage of our bills through the Diet will be impossible.
