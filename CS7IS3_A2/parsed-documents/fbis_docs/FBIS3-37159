Speaking at a news conference in Moscow on Monday [14 February], Fedorov said that the government adopts political decisions but has no means to carry them out. Fedorov described the figures in the proposed budget for 1994 as unrealistic and accused the government of lack of political will in order to reduce unjustified expenses. He also criticised the government for making concessions to coal miners and blasted the agrarian lobby for extorting state subsidies for the agro-industrial complex. Fedorov warned that this will only fuel inflation. He denied that he delayed the payment of state debts in December 1993 in order to curb inflation.
