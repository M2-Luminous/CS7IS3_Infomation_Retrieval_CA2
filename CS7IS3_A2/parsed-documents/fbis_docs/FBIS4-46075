The United States is seeking to encourage North Korea to be more transparent with its nuclear activities, including allowing full inspections of its nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci discussed the North Korean nuclear question with South Korea's special envoy for nuclear issues Kim Sam-hun on Monday and the two met Tuesday with Yukio Takeuchi, deputy director general of the Japanese Foreign Ministry's Asian Affairs Bureau. Washington has approved of North Korea's readiness to go along with IAEA inspections of its nuclear facilities and decided to resume high-level talks with Pyongyang, suspended last July, in an effort to reach a political resolution to the stalemate. In Washington, U.S. Government sources said an announcement on the scheduling of the talks will be made in the near future. Tuesday's meeting in New York reportedly went smoothly as the three parties agreed on their position in dealing with North Korea in the future, the sources said. The sources stressed that the high-level talks could be forfeited and the issue referred to the U.N. Security Council if North Korea continues with the refueling of its experimental nuclear reactor in the Yongbyon complex north of Pyongyang without an agreement with the IAEA on inspecting the spent fuel rods.
