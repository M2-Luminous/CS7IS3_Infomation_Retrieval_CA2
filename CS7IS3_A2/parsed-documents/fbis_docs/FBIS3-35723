Here is the text of the interview which was made public by the government press service. "I regret what happened. Of course, Stanislav Stanislavovich and I sometimes had certain differences over the ways to reform society and to build a sovereign state. By the way let me note that with the help of the press this fact was often exaggerated and, I should say, somewhat overblown. "However, on the whole Shushkevich and I managed to find a common language. We agreed on strategical approaches to the reform of Belarusian society, and we thought that our main goals were to guarantee the transition to a market economy in the republic without extremism or social disasters, to prevent a sharp decline in the living standards of the population, to gradually create necessary conditions for national revival and to preserve stability, accord and civil peace on our land. We did all we could to represent Belarus in the international community as a dignified state and to make it a European civilized power. "In today's complex situation we should act thoughtfully and carefully. Taking important political steps and decisions we should remember that we are living not in an isolated world, that our CIS neighbours and `far-away' foreign countries closely monitor the developments in Belarus, and count on the continuity of the policy pursued by the parliament and the government of the republic. "In recent years we spent too much time and effort on the destruction and settlement of political accounts. Obviously, it's time to stop that and to start a concrete creative work for the economic restructuring, the privatization in the interests of the people and the creation of adequate living conditions for the people. Let me state with all responsibility that the reform is irreversible. We will persistently continue the planned reforms, strengthening our union with Russia and developing friendship with other states. "And the last thing I would like to say in this connection. We should understand the current state of Shushkevich like human beings and support him at this difficult time." According to Shushkevich's press secretary Valeriy Vorobyov, currently the ex-speaker is in his personal countryside house. In the evening of the day he was dismissed the government communication line with his house was disconnected, but it was decided that a limited number of personal guards should stay with him.
