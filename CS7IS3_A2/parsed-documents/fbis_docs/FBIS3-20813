The basic framework of the budget is created by professionals at the Ministry of Finance (in cooperation with the Central Planning Office and the National Bank of Poland). It usually begins with an analysis of the current economic conditions, a forecast for the next year, and determination of the so-called fixed obligations of the budget. Only then is superposed a grid of political and economic priorities that can be debated. Any breach of this logic or any major error of the forecast can lead to a crisis of public finance. We have experienced such crises on our own skin; in the last few years the real world of the budget kept diverging from the assumptions. The Minister's Dream Errors could not be avoided in 1993 either, although this time they were positive errors, such as every minister of finance dreams of. Last year budgetary receipts were more than 4 percent (17.5 trillion zlotys, or Z17.5 trillion) higher than planned, while outlays were 2 percent (Z10 trillion) lower, and the deficit is certain not to exceed Z60 trillion instead of the anticipated Z81 trillion. These surprisingly good results were due chiefly to higher receipts from the personal income tax and a decline in the number of old-age pensions and annuities as well as the delay in revaluing them, along with lower outlays on servicing the foreign debt (a decline in interest rates, absence of an agreement with the so-called Club of London), and... the known difficulties in financing the budget deficit. At any rate, H. Suchocka's government bequeathed to its successors an underutilized "deficit cap," meaning that the growth in domestic debt was less (by Z28 trillion) than expected. When speaking of the dramatic condition of public finance it should also be borne in mind that in October 1993, for the first time in a long time, there was a budget surplus and in November the budget was balanced. Hence, a definite trend toward an improvement in public finance arose in 1993, which greatly facilitated the start of the new government under Prime Minister Pawlak. Likewise, the economic situation in 1993 (despite the unemployment and a negative balance of foreign trade) warrants an optimistic forecast for 1994. According to the recent report of the Central Planning Office, for 1993 industrial output will be 7 percent higher than in the preceding year; foreign trade began finally to improve as of last October (owing to the August devaluation); and the financial performance of enterprises and their possibilities for raising wages also are better.... Were it not for November and December, when food prices soared, inflation would remain at the planned level. [passage omitted] The macroeconomic assumptions for 1994 of W. Pawlak's government do not diverge from those announced earlier by the previous government: That is, a 4.5 percent increase in the GDP; 27-percent inflation (23 percent as measured from December 1994 to December 1993); a faster increase in exports (6 percent) than in imports; the maintenance of a creeping (in measure with the inflation) devaluation of the zloty; a limited growth of unemployment (to up to 190,000); and maintenance of civil-service salaries at the level of 91 percent of the wages paid in the private sector. We can thus expect a peaceful continuation and strengthening of positive tendencies in the economy. Fortunately, the rationale of the 1994 budget law contains no trace of the campaign rhetoric about the tragic recession, the need to stimulate growth by spurring inflation, a radical change in the exchange rate of the dollar, or printing more money in measure with the perceived social needs. As Deputy Prime Minister Borowski said recently in the Sejm, "Life has taught everyone to distance himself from promises and to perceive the reality humbly." Five Priorities I emphasize that the 1994 budget is largely predicated on continuing the economic policy of the preceding government, although that is certainly not politically convenient to the new government. But since I myself, following the elections last September, had expressed fears that the new government might "go on a rampage" and thus risk economic stability, I wish to state now that the government of Waldemar Pawlak is displaying a commendably realistic and responsible attitude. This does not at all mean that the 1994 budget draft lacks some leftist emphasis that clearly reflects the change in political priorities. When speaking of the 1994 budget, Deputy Prime Minister Borowski mentioned five assumptions on which its final draft was based: --Halting the decline in outlays on government operation. This concerns increasing civil-service salaries to keep in step with the inflation and maintaining the real value of material expenditures. --Strengthening the protection of the neediest by, among other things, increasing expenditures on welfare, raising the minimum old-age pensions and annuities, and providing funds for so-called housing allowances. --As to restructuring the economy, providing the funds needed for social protection due to the shutdowns of unprofitable mines, maintaining arms industry plants in operation by giving them government orders, building roads and highways, and providing debt relief for enterprises and banks. --Stimulating the economy by broadening investment tax relief; promoting exports and investments by, among other things, providing government loan guarantees and credit insurance. --Providing the funds needed to successfully complete the steps being taken to reduce foreign debt and to utilize foreign capital more efficiently. It is worth noting that these five priorities differ from the traditional so-called branch priorities. Thus, they make no mention of any privileged treatment of, e.g., education, culture, or health services, and neither are there any points devoted to agriculture, national defense, or the police. The proposed priorities are certain to meet with criticism from many deputies lobbying for the interests of their constituencies, but at the same time, on resorting to the transfer method, they should make for easier discussion with representatives of branch interest groups. However, an important provision is missing from the above enumeration, and this casts a huge reflection on the shape of the 1994 budget. Namely, the minister of finance has earlier declared, "The possibilities for balancing the budget by slashing expenditures are exhausted." As a result, the most characteristic feature of the 1994 budget will be a considerable increase in the outlays and receipts of the state. Receipts, Outlays, and the Deficit The 1994 budgetary receipts are envisaged at Z610 trillion, i.e., 35 percent more than in 1993, or, in real terms, after allowance is made for price increases, 6.5 percent more. As for budgetary outlays, they are envisaged at Z693 trillion, which means a nominal increase of 37.5 percent, or an increase of 8.3 percent in real terms. Hence, the planned budget deficit is to amount to Z83 trillion compared with, let me point out, Z60 trillion in 1993. We already know more or less where the higher receipts will come from. Chiefly from taxes: This year the government intends to collect Z506 trillion from taxpayers, compared with Z363 trillion in 1993. Thus, we have new income tax rates, the lump-sum tax payable by small businesses, the extension of the VAT to businesses with incomes of more than Z1.2 billion a year (previously the minimum level was Z4 billion), and the restrictions on certain tax exemptions and relief. The brunt of financing the greater obligations of the state budget will be borne by consumers and small businesses. On the expenditures side a special place is occupied by servicing the foreign debt (Z30 trillion) and the domestic debt (Z82 trillion). The nation's total foreign debt in 1993 was about Z1,000 trillion, and domestic debt Z360 trillion. Fortunately, we are servicing our foreign debt only partially, but even so, taken as a whole, the burden of servicing both the domestic and the foreign debt will consume as much as 16 percent of all budgetary outlays. To the government this is a warning to desist from hastily contracting any more loans for financing budgetary outlays and to utilize foreign credit rationally. Of the Z693 trillion in outlays, after the outlays on debt servicing are deducted, there remains about Z580 trillion, of which Z362 trillion is to be spent on civil-service salaries and similar government expenditures. In the budget draft the expenditures are listed in several hundred tables. In view of the occasional differences in calculating techniques, not all the figures are directly comparable with the expenditures in 1993. Even so, assuming the classical breakdown by ministries, the largest beneficiaries of the 1994 budget are the ministries of: labor and social welfare (outlays higher by more than one-third), transportation, foreign trade, and science. On the other hand, lower than average outlays are planned for construction, communications, higher education, the judiciary, public security, and national defense. Education will be given somewhat more money (relatively speaking) than health care. As regards the kinds of outlays, those increasing the most are, in addition to debt servicing, the outlays on housing loan guarantees (increased to Z7 trillion from Z2.6), the mortgage credit fund (to Z800 billion from Z100), expenditures on industrial restructuring (to Z6 trillion from Z2), and on old-age pensions and annuities for the defense ministry's personnel, and chiefly on subsidies for social security (to Z140 trillion from Z104). This listing reveals quite unambiguously the priorities of the current government. In any budget debate--and this time it will not be otherwise either--the question of how realistic the budget is must be raised. The 1994 draft budget seems to be very tightly stretched. The figures on planned tax revenues seem rather optimistic, as do the possibilities for financing the deficit, especially in view of the unbending attitude of the National Bank of Poland [the central bank], which has offered only Z30 trillion to support the budget. The inflation rate envisaged for this year seems rather optimistic, even if assuming slower price increases--and higher inflation may make shambles of the entire budget. In its turn, the marked increase in the tax burden may affect adversely investment and the growth in personal consumption, thus slowing down the anticipated rate of economic growth. Furthermore, the need to finance the high deficit may reduce the supply of credit available for the economy. The perils involved in executing such an expansive budget are numerous--and in this case, unlike in politics, the left side (receipts) must always be in accord with the right (outlays). In brief, the government has undertaken a risky attempt to increase public expenditures, motivated by important social considerations. Still, contrary to many previous fears, the presented draft budget does not exceed the limits of permissible political corrections, even though it is very close to the limit of economic safety. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Outlays of the State Budget | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |1993 in Billions |1994 in Billions |1994-93 in Percent| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Total |504,039 |693,000 |137.5 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Subsidies for sta-|20,117 |23,990 |119.3 | |te enterprises | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Debt servicing | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Foreign debt serv-|2,830 |29,786 |232.2 | |icing | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Domestic debt ser-|47,512 |81,913 |172.4 | |vicing | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Bank settlements |14,198 |19,885 |140.1 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Outlays on social |104,175 |140,903 |135.3 | |security | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Current governmen-|270,494 |361,766 |134.0 | |t expenditures (c-| | | | |ivil-service sala-| | | | |ries, etc.) | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Material outlays |23,671 |28,867 |121.9 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Subsidies for loc-|11,042 |5,490 |49.7 | |al governments | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Reserves of the C-|-- |400 |-- | |ouncil of Ministe-| | | | |rs | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1994 Budget Receipts--Z610 Trillion(in trillions of zlotys) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Tax receipts |Z505.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Indirect taxes |Z235.2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Personal income tax |Z157.4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Corporate income tax |Z81.2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Tax on wage increases |Z5.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Import tax |Z22.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Other tax revenues |Z4.2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Receipts from privatization |Z12.3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Nontax receipts |Z91.7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |From state enterprises |Z13.7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |From customs |Z45.2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |From National Bank of Poland profits |Z19.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |From "dividends" [levy on assets of s-|Z8.0 | |tate enterprises] | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |From other sources |Z5.3 | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
