Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin described it as "hard but realistic," adding that it "sets extremely strict parameters for financing the most vital state needs and programmes." In his speech to the Federation Council, the upper house of Russia's new Parliament, on Thursday he said the government will allocate not more that 183 trillion roubles for this purpose, compared to 240 trillion roubles requested by some industrialists. The draft allows for a deficit of 62.4 trillion roubles, or nine per cent of the gross domestic product, which is within the limits announced by President Boris Yeltsin in his state-of-the-nation address. The fulfilment of the budget will require additional measures to normalise the financial situation in the country, step up control over tax collection and seek new sources of budget revenues. Chernomyrdin stressed that the government will no longer put up with violations of tax regulations and tax evasion. "We will consider this as crime against the state," he said. "To my mind it is totally wrong to speak about the bankruptcy of the state," he emphasised. "The russian state is not bankrupt. It is capable of paying off its debts." However, he pointed out that it is necessary to "somberly realise that we should live according to our means and do not take unfulfillable obligations. Otherwise we risk to plunge ourselves into a new spiral of inflation and stamping out social conflicts." He said he mentioned this in connection with the continuing wave of strikes in several Russian regions. There can no longer be quick and popular solutions in the economy, the premier said. The situation in the country "remains extremely complex on the whole," the premier continued. He blamed this on the continuing production decline which causes stoppages in the work of industrial enterprises. As a result of such stoppages, 22 million man-days were lost at 4,000 enterprises in February. Chernomyrdin believes stoppages are caused by "difficulties in selling finished products." They account for the loss of 58 per cent of working time. One third of losses is caused by the shortage of material resources, six per cent "are connected with the conversion of the defence complex." He said inflationary processes have slightly slowed down. In february inflation was about ten per cent. In 1993 the number of people living beyond the subsistence level shrank twofold. Presently, there are 25 million such people in Russia. However, the premier warned against self-appeasement, saying it would be "premature and inappropriate" to feel elated about the decrease in inflation. The main problems in the economy "are directly connected with non-payments which are the most vivid indicator of the depth and intensity of crisis processes." As of March 1, 1994, "overdue credit debts exceeded 25 trillion roubles. Overdue debit totalled about 32 trillion rouble," he said. There are several factors behind the problem of non-payments, the prime minister explained. Among them he named "debts of CIS republics to the fuel and energy complex," "uncontrolled money movement" and "inability of many heads of industrial enterprises to increase labour productivity." Chernomyrdin stressed the need to "get rid of incapable leaders." To solve the problem of non-payments, the government has mapped out several measurers, including paying off the debt for 1993 estimated at 4.6 trillion roubles by the end of March. A new procedure for issuing centralised credits has been introduced. Under the new regulations, they will be issued to end users for targeted payments. There are also plans to introduce soon a mechanism for settling overdue credit debts through finance bills. Additionally, commercial bills will be introduced. Work is underway to prepare documents obliging tax payers to provide information about all of their bank accounts. "The government is taking measures to begin the process of halting ineffective industries and will actively use bankruptcy proceedings," Chernomyrdin said.
