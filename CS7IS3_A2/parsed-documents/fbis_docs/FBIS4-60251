The Majles met in open session yesterday chaired by Dr. Rowhani and the deputies from the cities of Ardel, Tabriz, Qa'enat, Gonabad, and Qa'em Shahr and Savadkuh gave preagenda speeches. Then the Majles went into consultation, and we direct the attention of our esteemed readers to the detailed proceedings. 'Ali Yusefpur, Deputy From Ardel Excessive increases in products have unfortunately weakened the Postal Company. The first preagenda speaker was Yusefpur, deputy from Ardel. During his speech he discussed the slaughter of Muslims by Western and especially American agents. He said: The international organizations, especially the United Nations, have closed their eyes to these vast crimes, and as time passes they are watching the destruction of the Muslim nation of Bosnia. In occupied Palestine, Egypt, and Algeria, although they are slaughtering the Muslims, unfortunately there is no sign of condemnation of the regimes dependent on the aforementioned countries. In Iran, however, when a few narcotics smugglers are condemned to death, these international organizations scream to high heaven. He added: Since its inception, the United Nations has served the goals of the Western world-devourers, and during the tenure of Butrus-Ghali the credibility of this organization has completely disappeared among the oppressed nations. Mr. Butrus-Ghali, you will live in infamy for closing your eyes this way to the slaughter of Muslims. The speaker then discussed the Second Five-Year Plan. He said: Although the government has tried to consider the views of the exalted leader in the Plan Bill, the Majles deputies must put these policies at the top of their agenda. They must create work and expert groups until it is possible to approve the aforementioned policies in the form of an organized and workable plan. Continuing, the deputy from Ardel discussed the paragraphs in the aforementioned plan. He said: It may be said with confidence and certainty that the government was very successful under the First Five-Year Plan in doing infrastructure work, but in my view, although some work was done under the First Five-Year Plan to privatize the government companies and reduce the size of the government's administrative structure, the work was not done quickly, and it did not produce change. The very heavy vote by the deputies to consolidate the ministries of industry is a part of the demand by the Majles deputies to expedite administrative change, and God willing the government leaders will work to move ahead faster on this important matter. He added: We want administrative structural reform on the Majles agenda in the form of a bill. Since the relevant organizations have taken no significant action since the completion of the First Five-Year Plan, the Majles deputies are obliged to present a bill on this matter. Clear and direct planning must be done in the Second Five-Year Plan in such a way that reform of the nation's administrative structure will proceed more quickly, and that privatization will be achieved in such a way that it is in the interest of the sacred government of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Yusefpur then emphasized: In the last year or two some profiteering and opportunist individuals, with the support of naive individuals, have undertaken to represent American products, even as the Western nations are subjecting Iran to an embargo on advanced industrial products and while in France, which considers itself the cradle of freedoms in the West, they will not tolerate head coverings on school girls and are expelling them. Then in revolution Iran a few profiteers and opportunists and a few naive people supporting them are permitting Coca-Cola, the products from General Electric and those of several other companies to be widely distributed. Gentlemen, don't you realize that Coca-Cola is the symbol of America and that they are trying to put up advertisements for this product on every street and in every quarter? If the producers of this product are telling the truth, why are they seeking only to produce and distribute consumer goods? If there is no hidden agenda behind what they are doing, if it is true as they say that their contract is with Ireland, then let them produce this beverage with Iran's name. Just as the heroic Hezbollah did not allow MacDonald's sandwiches to be produced in Tehran, they will go to any lengths to prevent the production of Coca-Cola and other American products. He discussed the provisions of the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget designed to resist high prices for government goods and services. He said: Unfortunately the Postal Company has made excessive increases in the prices of postal products. When the cost of mailing publications and books inside and outside the country has increased tenfold, how can the cultural institutions continue to operate? Fatemeh Homayun-Moqadam, Deputy From Tabriz Unlike our country, in most of the European nations, women staff employees have no security. The next speaker was Ms. Homayuni-Moqadam [as published], deputy from Tabriz. In her speech she said: In view of the hostility of the imperialist nations towards Islam and divine law, once again the Human Rights Commission has expressed unacceptable views concerning the rights of women in Iran. In general since the triumph of the Islamic revolution, women in Iran have achieved full human dignity under the commands of Islam, and this is unequaled in all the nations of the world. She added: Statistics show that millions of girls are studying in the elementary schools and high schools and that hundreds of girl students and thousands of Iranian women are studying and doing research at high specialist levels, and these numbers are several times the figures prior to the revolution. The growth of our women in specialist medical fields, especially the women surgeons and midwives, is something to be proud of. At the same time, in most countries women work as nurses while male physicians treat women's ailments. To make up for the shortcomings of the past, the Majles must require the government to bring women physicians up to a sufficient level of quality in the gynecological surgery fields, and it must also require the Ministry of Health Care and Treatment to reserve at least 25 percent of its admissions for assistants in the surgery, neurology, urology, and other fields for women. Ms. Moqadam then said: After the triumph of the Islamic revolution, a small number of the women, who had no social base because of not wearing the veil, served as slaves for imperialist plans. Now however, millions of Iranian women are involved in various political affairs. While in some countries women's rights are one-half the rights of men, in our country there is no such difference between the rights of men and women in any office or factory. In addition, women have special provisions to take time off and they can even ask to serve half-time with an appropriate salary. In most of the European nations, women staff employees have no security, but it can be said with confidence that in our country no one feels insecure in any office. Hoseyn Amini, Deputy From Qa'enat The important thing for the country to do to reduce its economic problems is to increase production and reduce consumption. The next speaker was Amini, deputy from Qa'enat. During his speech he said: The First Five-Year Plan is ending at a time when economic and production projects have begun to move and investment has been done. Continuing, he then added: The addition of 16,000 hospital beds and 6,000 health clinics; providing running water to more than 5,310 rural areas; increasing the capacities of factories; putting 80,000 new classes into operation and increasing the number of university students at the journeyman level and higher from 447,000 to 1.03 million; adding 5,200 megawatts to existing power plant capacities and providing electrical power to more than 6,000 rural areas; building 727 urban telephone centers, adding more than 1.7 million telephone numbers, adding 3,420 rural telephone centers; and increasing the number of gas service lines from 750,000 to 1.9 million. In agriculture, increasing wheat production from 7 to 10.8 million tons; in industry, annual increases of 39.6 percent for steel, 25.2 percent for copper, 16.6 percent for aluminum, 26.3 percent for heavy vehicles, 30 percent for light vehicles, 28 percent for road-building machinery, 42 percent for agricultural machinery, 11.4 percent for tires, 17.4 percent for vegetable shortening, and 14.2 percent for other goods that there is no opportunity to discuss, are some of the results of the First Five-Year Plan. And it is necessary to praise and thank the president of the republic, the toiling government and all the insiders and executive officers. Amini discussed the fact that one of the most important tasks for the Majles this year is to study and approve the Second Five-Year Plan. He said: It is hoped that using the experiences of the First Five-Year Plan and its strengths and weaknesses and with a realistic view, steps will be taken to solve existing problems, develop economic and cultural cooperation and prosperity, and to strengthen and perpetuate the government's political positions against foreigners. Continuing, the speaker then discussed points that must be considered while studying and approving the Second Five-Year Plan. He said: These points include taking into account the guidance from the exalted leader concerning social justice and giving serious support to the oppressed classes, attention to the problems of the people, especially those who have sacrificed, preventing waste and extravagance in spending, employment and alleviating deprivation, attention to agriculture, policy making to improve quality, develop domestic production and increase exports, supervision of the implementation of programs, reinforcing the defense foundation, and continuation of the foreign policy based on glory, wisdom and interests. In the same regard the speaker added: The important thing for the country to do to reduce its economic problems is to increase production and reduce consumption. In setting the needed laws and regulations in the Second Five-Year Plan, serious support must be given to production, and the existing obstacles to productive investment must be removed. A mechanism must be chosen that will divert loose money from the service sector and dependent and brokerage activity into production, and the banking system must serve the production system more than it does. Concerning industry, he then added: The nation's industrial strategy must be specified and the basic point must be accepted that the most important issue is to make existing industries sound. This restoration to soundness means creating circles of communication between the domestic industrial sectors and between industries, basic industries and production activities. He discussed the fact that investment must be diverted for several years to industries that are active producing raw materials, intermediate materials and conversion materials, and, to the extent possible, machinery and equipment for existing industries. He said: We must estimate revenue sources realistically, rather than in accordance with predetermined expenses. Amini discussed tax reform and reducing dependence on oil revenues. He said: It is necessary to make basic changes in the tax system in the Second Five-Year Plan. The tax system must be made vigorous, effective, and in accordance with the goal of social justice, in such a way that it will give direction to economic activities. Instead of putting pressure on low-income people and small businessmen, it can collect the government's due from those who have enormous and sometimes inflated incomes. Currently taxes are not appropriate for the incomes of individuals, and those with huge incomes are shaking off the tax burden in various ways. The deputy from Qa'enat discussed the need for serious attention to employment and preventing emigration, especially in the deprived areas. He said: Consideration must be given to expediting work in the education and training and research sectors and to developing technical and professional training, and the necessary attention must be given to the small agricultural conversion industries. In conclusion, he discussed the problems in his electoral district. He issued memos concerning the distribution of national and province credits to the Plan and Budget Organization, to the Ministry of Petroleum concerning expediting gas delivery in the south of Khorasan, to the Ministry of Commerce concerning the purchase, packaging and export of saffron and barberry, and to the Ministry of Agriculture concerning the creation of a research station. He asked the president of the republic to issue the necessary orders to help the region's farmers, who have been hurt by the recent cold weather. Mehdi Mehdizadeh, Deputy From Gonabad Limited resources and the correct economic viewpoint dictate that we economize on consumption. The next speaker was Mehdizadeh, deputy from Gonabad. During his speech he discussed the drought in large parts of our country. He said: The deprived farmers in parts of Khorasan, where irreparable losses have recently been incurred because of the severe cold, whose orchards have been completely destroyed, have increasing problems, and if their situation is not dealt with soon and if their losses are not compensated, they will abandon their homes and farms and go elsewhere. The speaker then discussed the situation of the people of Bosnia in the city of Gorazde. He said: This city, which has been declared secure from Serb attacks, has come to this state under UN supervision and with the direct cooperation of the Russians and with the cooperation of so-called civilized Western nations, including America. This is not the first time the aggressor has shown a happy face. Such an approach has been taken elsewhere before, including Palestine. We condemn these crimes, and we hope the Muslims will learn from this situation and awaken. He said the Security Council should call the aggressor Serbs to account for their war crimes. Continuing, he said: Our country is in a good situation in terms of economic resources, but they are being used improperly in most cases. In many cases, not only have investments not been profitable in various sectors, they have not even recovered the capital. In many factories the abundance of various machines has filled up the space, yet the level of their profitable utilization is quite low. Most foreign specialists who have visited our factories are surprised to see that a factory, and an advanced one at that, produces simple products in limited numbers. He also said: Limited resources and the correct economic viewpoint dictate that we economize on consumption. It is clear that economizing does not mean reducing the level and quality of life. With proper economizing fewer resources are used, while the proper quality is retained. Many economists consider the reason for stagnation and inflation to be the low level of utilization. Continuing, he said: Utilization means getting the most and at the same time the best use possible from the usable elements that have a role in the production of an item or the provision of a service, and the utilization coefficient is an indicator of this use. Today the economic growth of any society depends on the rate of the growth of utilization in that society. In the long run the importance of utilization in economic growth is much greater than the participation of the elements of capital and labor, and for this reason every country must try to make progress in utilization, in order to be able to expand its production with less consumption. This is the secret of success for any country. It is necessary to note that the rate of utilization in our country is low compared to that of other countries in many areas, and this must be corrected. The speaker then discussed the population increase and the excessive use of natural resources. He said: The rapid population growth in the last 35 years has always been ahead of projects and plans, and it has disrupted their implementation and progress. During this period the nation's population has tripled, and it will reach 100 to 120 million in the next 25 to 30 years. Those 40 million new members of society will need 8 million homes, 1.5 million new educational units and many other things. Already one person is born every 17 seconds. At this rate, a new classroom will be needed every 15 minutes, every day 16 new schools will be needed, and every year 25,000 classrooms will have to be built, yet the existing situation is very far from what is desired. He also added: Fighting excessive population growth demands national and universal resolve; it is not the responsibility of an organization or a ministry. He discussed forests and pastures. He said: Every year in our country 1 million hectares of pasture becomes desert, so that since the year 1341 [21 March 1962-20 March 1963] half our forests and pastures have been destroyed, and this process continues with the population increase and the lack of sufficient attention. Continuing, the speaker said: In our country, due to insufficient precipitation and improper use of existing water resources, water has become vital. Most of the canals and wells have dried up due to the drop in water tables and many farms and rural areas are being destroyed. Rivers and coastal areas have become polluted, and due to the lack of plant cover, instead of being a blessing, in many cases rainfall causes flooding which destroys farms and towns. Pressurized irrigation techniques, which produce a very high yield compared to traditional methods, have not come into general use, and in the cities excessive water use has created a problem for agriculture. Water, which is obtained at high cost using subsidies without being put to the best use, usually evaporates or soaks into the ground after being contaminated with chemicals and bacteria. In addition to polluting the soil and converting agricultural land for residential use, population increases cause the destruction and erosion of productive soil because of excessive pressure on agricultural lands. In our country more than 1 percent of agricultural lands and about 1.5 to 2 million cubic meters of soil is destroyed every year. The failure to prevent soil erosion could bring us to a bad end such as the one in Ethiopia, which has lost most of its productive soil. There, even in years with heavy rainfall the people are unable to fill their stomachs, and every year a large number of people die of starvation. Asgari Faqih, Deputy From Qa'em Shahr Asgari Faqih, deputy from Qa'em Shahr, was the final preagenda speaker. During his speech he said: The role of the masses in social change is a powerful and undeniable factor, but that alone cannot bring about basic and fundamental change. Other factors must be added to complete the role of the people. He added: Our people, despite all the rancor and mercilessness, have remained loyal to the shari'ah and the leader, and they have held on to this loyalty at the cost of their lives. They have faced one problem after another, but they have not bowed down and they have not surrendered to domination by the wicked who rule the world. He also added: This strong relationship and the cooperation between the people, religion and their leader, is highly sacred because of its vital role in reviving and preserving genuine human qualities and its conformity with pure human essence and orthodox religion. Continuing, he thanked the people of the province of Mazandaran for taking part in the funeral rites for 110 martyrs. He said: The call for obedience to the leader and continuing on the path of the martyrs and the cry of death to America and Zionism rang out in the sky of the area, and during these days the people said farewell to their martyrs. He then thanked the Karbala 25 Army and the Martyr Foundation for holding the funeral rites for the martyrs. He asked the president of the republic for help and cooperation to carry out basic projects and employ the area's material and spiritual capabilities, and he asked the minister of roads and transportation to convert the Tehran-Firuzkuh-Qa'em Shahr road to the North Tehran highway. In conclusion, the deputy from Qa'em Shahr asked the relevant officials to expand and rebuild Mazandaran's textile factories, to develop the activities of the Central Alborz Rock Coal Factory, to create war and conversion industry factories, to remove the obstacles to the building of industrial villages and to create textile and mining colleges.
