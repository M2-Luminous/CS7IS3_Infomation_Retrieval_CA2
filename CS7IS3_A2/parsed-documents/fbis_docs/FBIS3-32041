Such consultation is specifically related to the "Regulations on Fuels and Fuel Additives -- Rules for Improved and Conventional Gasoline," which the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency adopted last 15 December. For Venezuela, this regulation clearly violates GATT provisions, because it places controls on imported gasoline different from those placed on U.S. gasoline. By bringing this issue up with GATT, Miguel Rodriguez Mendoza, minister-president of the Foreign Trade Institute [ICE], explained that this is "a matter of great importance for Venezuela and a matter that requires special attention because, once more, we are faced with the use of environmental regulations with disguised protectionist intentions." Meanwhile, Rodriguez noted the discriminatory character of the aforementioned regulation and the adverse effects it will have on the export of improved gasoline to the U.S. market. According to preliminary estimates, approximately 50 percent of the export volume of Venezuelan improved gasoline will be affected by that measure, causing an economic impact for Venezuela to the tune of $150 million over a two-year period. Rodriguez also referred to the modernization program of Venezuelan refining plants that the national petroleum industry has undertaken with a view to adjusting to the new environmental demands, which contemplates investments of over $1 billion. The ICE president presented the aforementioned petition to the 49th Session of GATT Contracting Parties, the highest body of that organization held in Geneva, Switzerland, on 25 and 26 January. According to GATT procedures, consultation must begin by 14 February at the latest, namely 30 days after the request is presented. Additionally, there is a 60-day term for processing said request. The statements by Rodriguez regarding the ties between trade and the ecology were also addressed by B.K. Zutshi of India, president of the meeting, who in his opening speech warned of the need to prevent the conservation of the environment from becoming a new form of commercial protectionism.
