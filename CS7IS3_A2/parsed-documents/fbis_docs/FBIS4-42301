[Delors] It is in partly inevitable that national stakes should overlap European issues. It is true that in France this is more marked than elsewhere. We also get the impression that those people who are called pro-Europeans are afraid to come out firmly in favor of their convictions. Nothing is perfect in the process of European construction, but we could have hoped that these people would at least say what should be done to improve the situation. When you listen to all sides, you get the feeling that the situation is totally unsatisfactory. [LE MONDE] Do you not see a decline in the popularity of European construction? [Delors] Our opinion polls show that there is no longer the euphoric feeling that marked the period 1988-1990. However, we have not returned either to the feeling of indifference that characterized the years before 1985, that is before I took over at the Commission. Opinion is still very much in favor of a united Europe, but a number of factors conspire to make the expression of this opinion less wholesale and not quite as enthusiastic. [LE MONDE] The enlargement of the Union requires institutional reform. The French side seems convinced that this reform will be done at the expense of the little countries and the Commission. Is there an alternative way? [Delors] The fathers of the Treaty of Rome wanted to give the European Community institutions that would enable it to make decisions in due course and to act efficiently. In this spirit, everyone sees the European Commission as playing an essential role as a source of innovation, guaranteeing continuity and respect for the rules. If tomorrow we decided to change this institutional logic, we would run the risk of paralysis. The protagonists of the French campaign have decided to make the Commission a scapegoat charged with irresponsibility. The truth is that the European Commission is answerable to the European Parliament which may censure it at any time. Moreover, in July 1993, I was asked to see out a 5th term of office of two years, and Parliament voted me in with an almost 90 percent majority. No one ever remembers that in the debate. Of course, the operation of the institutions can be improved, but the problem is set out badly. [LE MONDE] What of the little countries in an enlarged Europe? [Delors] To date we have been able to work in the Community on the principle that no country, even the smallest, should be placed in difficulty when a vital interest is at stake. It is clear that, in a community with 25 or 30 members, this unwritten law may be more difficult to apply. Judge for yourself the gap between Germany on the one hand, with 80 million inhabitants, and countries like Malta and Cyprus on the other. Consequently, from this point of view, we have to think about a system that makes it possible to take into account specific national characteristics and which, at the same time, transcends these whenever we manage to identify a common interest. We will have to break new ground. [LE MONDE] Do you like the idea of a President of Europe? [Delors] The European Union needs an injection of personality. For the time being, even if I do not have the powers, in the eyes of some people I am the one who fills this role. In a European Union it would be useful if the European Council elected, every two and one-half years (twice in the life time of a European Parliament), someone who would be charged with representing the European Union, flanked by two vice presidents appointed in turn from all the member states. The issue is whether this president should at the same time head the European Commission. The second argument in favor of this solution is that of continuity, especially where foreign policy is concerned. It is important for the United States, Japan and the continents of Asia, Latin America, and Africa to be able to deal with one person representing the position of the European Union for a relatively long period of time (flanked by two revolving vice presidents -- one from a "big" country and one from a "small" country). [LE MONDE] Let us turn to a debate that has recently developed in France: Do you think Europe should demand the lifting of the Bosnian arms embargo? [Delors] Let me remind you what, as long ago as 1992, I told the European Parliament -- a statement for which I was reproached because it exceeded my prerogatives. I condemned the ideology of ethnic cleansing. I added that, unless there was a credible threat of an armed intervention, the bearers of this ideology would not stop. Unfortunately, what I said has been borne out by subsequent events. Now it seems to me that, if we lifted the embargo, we would risk becoming embroiled in an unending war which would extend to other countries or end in the defeat of our Bosnian friends, given the reserve potential of the Serbian Army. This is why I rally the praiseworthy and committed efforts of France -- in particular, Francois Mitterrand and Alain Juppe -- to try and bring all the belligerents back around the negotiating table on the basis of the European Union's plan which could be slightly reworked. However, there is one condition for this -- that the agreement that could be found in no way sanctions the ideological victory of those who reject the other protagonist to point of killing him. Thus, we need to increase the pressure we are putting on the Serbs. Politics is the art of choosing, at any time, the "least unfavorable" solution. I am not proud to have to say that, but I do not have the right to avoid your question. I should add that the intellectuals are only playing their role by questioning the politicians. [LE MONDE] Do you think that the discredit which has been heaped on the Twelve's ambition to create a joint foreign policy can be repaired? [Delors] It will be hard to repair this damage in the coming months, even assuming that we do manage to arrive at a peaceful solution imposed more by reason than what we feel in our hearts. In the Yugoslav tragedy I see the proof that Europe does not exist as a prime mover in foreign policy. What I would like is for the Twelve to decide on and carry through three or four joint foreign policy missions, where each country indisputably has the same interests at heart. You will notice that I am not talking about a joint foreign policy, but joint foreign policy action. I have never thought that our countries, given their traditions, interests, and geopolitical situations, could share a complete joint foreign policy. [LE MONDE] Let us return to the campaign in France. The candidates have no consideration for the Community institutions. In an interview on 19 April, [Socialist Party Chairman] Michel Rocard condemned "a European organization which bans the hunting of woodpigeons in the south of France but which is unable to ban the hunting of Muslims in the east of Bosnia." Dominique Baudis said much the same thing the very same day. How do you react to this kind of generalization? [Delors] It dismays me to hear such untruths. I have already spoken about Bosnia. Let us talk about the woodpigeon issue. In 1979, the member states of the Community unanimously agreed to adopt a directive for the protection of wild birds -- especially migrating birds, and thus woodpigeons -- which are part of our common heritage since they fly across Europe. The principle is a simple one: We put a ban on their hunting while they are on the way back to their nesting grounds to protect the species. The dates the hunting season opens and closes were left up to each state to decide. That is the reality of the situation. The Commission strives in this area, as in others, to leave the final decision to the states, or even the regions, since they alone can judge the situation since they are closest to the areas in question. [LE MONDE] People no longer seem to believe that Europe is capable of eliminating unemployment. Does the white paper you produced on the subject guarantee at least some concrete results? [Delors] Unemployment is a European disease, and I have drawn the attention of the heads of state and government on this issue. From 1970 to 1990, the United States created 29 million new jobs, while Japan created 12 million new jobs, and we managed 9 million. Incidentally, these 9 million new jobs were created between 1985 and 1991, thanks to the relaunching of the process of European construction aiming at the single market. After that, I asked myself: Were these years just a slight upturn, the swan song of a Europe in decline, or was what happened a good omen for the future? The answers to this question can be found in the white paper. These answers are encouraging. The decline and the situation of mass unemployment were not predestined. In this white paper we did not ask for extra powers for the Community. We said what we think should be done on the European level in the framework of our current powers (deepening the internal market, developing infrastructures, setting up an information society, and the necessary growth in investment and development research). We also said that at the national level there is much to be done for everything impacting on employment (education, training, work organization in companies, the operation of the labor market, unemployment benefit, etc.). In the light of national debates and the measures that have been taken, it is clear that the Europeans have decided to push for recovery. [LE MONDE] So what concrete results are you expecting? [Delors] At the next European Council in Corfu, I expect the following decisions to be made: Firstly, the adoption of an initial list of infrastructure projects and the means of funding them. In this way these projects will be able to get under way by the end of the year and provide support for the upcoming economic recovery while at the same time laying the foundation for more competitive structures and better town and country planning in Europe. Secondly, I expect to see confirmation that my intuition was right as far as the information society is concerned, that this is a veritable revolution and that we must quickly equip ourselves with the means to ensure that Europe is present in this area. Thirdly, I expect us to continue exchanging information and innovation regarding everything that makes it possible to create new jobs. Moreover, I am currently working on new sources of jobs. Indeed, it is quite wrong to say that our societies will suffer from a lack of work and hence a shortage of jobs on offer. [LE MONDE] The issue of Europe's borders has not really been debated by the Twelve so far. Do you have a conception of the limits of a greater Europe? [Delors] I think that the limits of the greater Europe lie at the borders of the former Soviet Union. This means that Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Albania, Cyprus, and Malta -- not to mention the three Baltic states -- could all belong to the greater Europe. In addition, if peace returns to the former Yugoslavia, why not include Bosnia, Croatia, Macedonia, and what will have become of the Serbian-Montenegro union after a lot of water has flowed under the bridge and the ideology of ethnic cleansing has been eradicated. I say this to illustrate the scope of the political and institutional problems you mentioned a little while ago. The other difficulty is that Russia is not enthusiastic about the idea of a greater European Union. We will only be able to build up this greater Europe if we offer Russia a very close partnership in the political and economic arenas, if we recognize Russia as a major power, and if we help it solve the problems arising in the former Soviet Union, especially in Ukraine. Hence the association agreements to be signed with Russia and Ukraine; hence our action to avoid the nuclear risk, especially in Chernobyl. [LE MONDE] You mentioned the institutional difficulties encountered in creating a greater Europe, but there are also economic difficulties. In France, the leaders of the two main lists are in favor of enlargement, but they never say anything about either the agricultural problems or the budget problems that this enlargement entails. [Delors] They are indeed very vague in what they say. That is also true for those who call the pro-Europeans a "club of the rich" without once mentioning the economic consequences and institutional structures of a greater Europe. The Commission is prepared to discuss these matters, whether it involves increasing the Community budget and the contributions of each participant, pursuing the basic objectives of the common agricultural policy, or the undoubtedly positive impact on economic growth and job creation. It is prepared to do this in liaison with the countries of East Europe, which have great needs to be met. I would add that, as a citizen, I am prepared to bear the costs of a greater Europe geared toward peace and solidarity, by paying a bit more in taxes. But who talks about that? [LE MONDE] What is your response to people who are worried about Germany's new influence since its reunification, or when faced with the prospect of an enlargement of the Union to the north and east? [Delors] I would reply: Do we have a choice? If we feel that Germany is drifting toward other horizons and if we precipitate this drift by turning our backs on European integration, what will happen to us? If someone says to me, and rightly so, that Germany will be strong -- and it will be, because right now it is making considerable efforts at economic restructuring which few people in France are aware of -- well then I would reply that France must make the same effort, with or without European integration. The most terrible and scandalous thing in the tale which certain candidates are spinning for the French people is that they are blaming Europe for changes in the world. The reality is that the world is changing for the better, and also for the worse. This can be seen in the new dangers which are appearing: ideologies based on rejecting others; confusion between faith and politics; fundamentalism; hypernationalism; etc. European integration is the only instrument that can enable us to confront this new world full of both danger and promise. [LE MONDE] Since the storm of August 1993, the European Monetary System has been going rather well and the Member States are following a policy of tight convergence. However, if new difficulties were to emerge on the foreign exchange market, would the system be able to withstand attacks by speculators? [Delors] I have noticed that operators on the foreign exchange market are talking increasingly of the prospect of economic and monetary union. In addition to that, there is the economic recovery, which will come about without aggravating imbalances or inflation. Economic and monetary union has regained credibility, and it must once again be considered a substantial element in a strategy aimed at promoting the concept of Europe. That is an encouraging observation. [LE MONDE] In the debate on Maastricht, certain people ([right-wing deputy] Philippe Seguin and [former Socialist Defense Minister] Jean-Pierre Chevenement) wondered whether Europe's economic policy did not pose a genuine danger to growth. Is this still a valid question? [Delors] Now that is a question. So far, we have based our thinking on the following experience: Those countries which had a stable currency have performed better in terms of economic growth and job creation than the other countries. However, even if that provides ammunition in favor of economic and monetary union, it is not enough. I am continuing to fight those who would reduce economic policy down to a strong currency and norms on budgetary balance. I feel that economic policy is more complex, that during slumps we have to accept a budget deficit, and that it is not a bad thing to go into debt in order to finance investments that will benefit future generations. It is my conviction that Europe will keep its model of society, while at the same time adapting to new situations, and that it will forge an original path of development which respects people's time and the environment. This Europe will keep its radiant personality enriched by its national and local diversity. In this Europe, our country -- France -- will have its own sizeable space for itself. Let us not be overcautious!
