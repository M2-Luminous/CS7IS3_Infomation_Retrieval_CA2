Zhu Rongji, vice premier of the State Council and governor of the People's Bank of China [PBOC], attended and addressed the meeting. It has been learned that some criminals have made banks their targets for wantonly carrying out all kinds of financial crimes since reform and opening up to the outside world, particularly during recent years when China accelerated the development of a socialist market economy. Under the leadership of the party Central Committee and the State Council and the strong support of the public security, procuratorial, and judicial departments, banks and finance companies at various levels in the banking system have persistently cracked down on economic crimes; carried out first the activities of "education, cleanup, and rectification" and then the work of "two preventions and one safeguard" -- which was mainly for "preventing fraud and theft, and safeguarding the security of funds in banks" -- and scoring some successes since the latter half of 1991. Zhu Rongji said: At present, criminal activities, such as financial fraud, have become a noticeable problem for the banking system. Cadres, staff, and workers of banking departments at all levels must conscientiously enhance their sense of responsibility for protecting state property and safeguarding state interests; strictly implement the state's banking laws, regulations, and rules; and try hard to improve their political and professional caliber, to make due efforts to guarantee a normal banking order for the state. In his speech, Zhu Rongji also stated his views on the current macroeconomic situation and the tasks facing the country's banking system. Luo Gan, state councillor and secretary general of the State Council, presided over the teleconference. PBOC Vice Governor Zhou Zhengqing and Public Security Vice Minister Mou Xinsheng addressed the meeting, expressing specific views on resolutely preventing and cracking down on the crimes of financial fraud, theft, and robbery, and safeguarding funds security in banks. Zhou Zhengqing pointed out: All in all, China's current economic and banking situation is good, with the banking situation continuing its smooth and healthy development, the banking order improving further, and the banking reform advancing steadily. In the course of progress, however, there remain some problems that deserve our attention. Among them, the crimes of financial fraud, theft, and robbery are a noticeable problem most seriously disturbing, damaging, and affecting current financial undertakings, financial reform, and opening up of the financial sector to the outside world. They not only brought to the state tremendous economic risks and losses and endangered the personal safety of bank staff and workers, but also disturbed normal social and banking order, seriously damaged financial institutions' reputation, and posed a serious threat to banking undertakings and even economic development. They will seriously compromise the smooth progress of our reform, opening up to the outside world, and economic construction, should we fail to take resolute, effective measures to stop and prevent their occurrence. Leading comrades at all levels in the banking system must have a clear understanding of this. All banks and finance companies should immediately mobilize all their personnel to act swiftly and struggle resolutely against the various financial crimes. Zhou Zhengqing stressed: To resolutely stop and prevent financial fraud, theft, and robbery, we need to take the following measures: 1) All banks and finance companies at all levels in the banking system must attach great importance to the work of "preventing fraud, theft, and robbery; and safeguarding funds security in banks." It is particularly important for principal leading comrades of banks and finance companies at all levels to place the work high on the agenda and carry it out as an important matter. 2) To resolutely expose and crack down on fraud under the cover of "foreign capital introduction," the utilization of foreign capital must be examined and approved in strict accordance with relevant state provisions and procedures. 3) It is essential to strictly observe banking laws and regulations and resolutely implement various rules and regulations. Banks and other financial institutions at all levels should do business in strict accordance with the stipulated terms of reference and within the approved scope of operation. 4) We should strengthen case investigation and handling to enforce banking discipline. 5) Efforts should be made to strengthen education and training for the vast contingent of cadres, staff, and workers on the "three preventions and one safeguard." Zhou Zhengqing said: After this teleconference, all units should promptly relay to all cadres, staff, and workers the conference guidelines and speeches of the leading comrades of the party Central Committee and the State Council, earnestly organize discussions, scrutinize loopholes and problems, and draw up realistic and feasible preventive measures. The head offices of banks and finance companies should arrange for the work of "three preventions and one safeguard" throughout their entire organizations; forward clear and specific demands; and conscientiously strengthen supervision, inspection, and guidance to prevent and stop financial fraud, theft, and robbery. Mou Xinsheng demanded that public security organs at all levels earnestly implement this conference's guidelines and -- under the leadership of local party committees and governments -- support and work closely with banking institutions in vigorously preventing and cracking down on fraud, theft, and robbery in banks and in safeguarding fund security in banks. Once they receive a report on bank theft or robbery, as well as forgery, theft, or illegal sale of value-added tax receipts, the public security organs should assemble competent officers and men to take swift action and decisive measures to contain and intercept the criminals and to try every possible means to take control of the illicit money to avoid or minimize losses. They should resolutely and completely destroy the lairs for forging or illegally selling value-added tax receipts to effectively safeguard the smooth implementation of tax reforms. Also attending the meeting were responsible people from relevant departments under the State Council, financial institutions, the Supreme People's Court, and the Supreme People's Procuratorate; and other departments concerned. Comrades in charge of banking work from people's governments at and above the county level as well as responsible comrades of financial and public security departments at various levels took part in the teleconference at more than 2,000 different locations.
