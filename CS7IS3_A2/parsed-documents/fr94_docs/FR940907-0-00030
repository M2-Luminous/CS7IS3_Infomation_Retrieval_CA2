FR940907-0-00030 FR940907-0-00015 Section 172 of the 1977 Act authorized EPA to grant extensions to those States that could not demonstrate attainment of the ozone standard by December 31, 1982 if certain conditions were met by the States in revising their air pollution control program. These areas became known as extension areas. Michigan requested and received an extension to December 31, 1987 for achieving the ozone NAAQS in Wayne, Oakland and Macomb Counties. This extension was granted on June 2, 1980 (45 FR 37196) and obligated the State to develop, for those counties, RACT regulations for sources that are addressed by the Group III CTGs (RACT III) and RACT regulations for major sources that are not addressed by a CTG (major non-CTG RACT). 2 2 On January 22, 1981, (46 FR 7182), USEPA published guidance for the development of 1982 ozone SIPs in ``State Implementation Plans: Approval of 1982 Ozone and Carbon Monoxide Plan Revisions for Areas Needing an Attainment Date Extension''. On May 26, 1988 pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(H) of the 1977 Act, EPA Region 5 notified Governor James J. Blanchard that the Michigan SIP was substantially inadequate to attain and maintain the ozone standard and requested that deficiencies in the existing SIP be corrected (EPA's SIP-Call). Among other deficiencies, EPA noted that the State had not yet submitted the RACT regulations for sources in Wayne, Oakland and Macomb Counties that were covered by the third set of CTGs. On November 15, 1990 the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 were enacted. Public Law 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399 (codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq. ). By operation of law, the Detroit area, including Wayne, Oakland and Macomb Counties, retained its nonattainment designation and was classified as a moderate nonattainment area for ozone. Section 182(a)(2)(A) of the Act requires each State to submit to EPA by May 15, 1991 revisions or additions to its SIP to correct deficiencies in its RACT rules for ozone. Section 182(a)(2)(A) of the Act applies to those ozone nonattainment areas classified as marginal or above, and requires States to adopt and correct RACT rules for such areas pursuant to pre-amended section 172(b) as interpreted in pre-amendment guidance. 3 Because the Detroit area (including Wayne, Oakland and Macomb Counties) is classified as moderate, the area is subject to this RACT ``fix-u'' requirement and the May 15, 1991 deadline. 3 Among other things, the pre-amendment guidance consists of those portions of the proposed Post-1987 Ozone and Carbon Monoxide Policy that concern RACT, 52 FR 45044 (November 24, 1987); ``Issues Relating to VOC Regulation Cutpoints, Deficiencies and Deviations, Clarification to appendix D of November 24, 1987 Federal Register Notice'' (Blue Book) (notice of availability was published in the Federal Register on May 25, 1988); and the existing control technique guidelines (CTGs). Other areas within Michigan also retained a designation of nonattainment and were classified by operation of law upon enactment. These areas are also subject to the RACT fix-up requirement. However, under EPA's pre-amendment guidance 4 interpreting the requirements of section 172(b) these areas were not required to adopt RACT rules for sources covered by the Group III CTGs. Therefore, for purposes of the May 15, 1991 deadline, only three counties were required to have RACT rules for Group III CTG sources. 4 The two memoranda are: May 21, 1984 memorandum entitled, ``Confirmation That Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) Regulations Are Required for Source Categories for Which Control Techniques Guidelines Have Been Issued'' and a June 25, 1984 memorandum entitled, ``Applicability of Group III Control Techniques Guidelines'' under the same signature.
