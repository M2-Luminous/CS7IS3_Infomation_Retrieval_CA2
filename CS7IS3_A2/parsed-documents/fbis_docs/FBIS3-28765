Noting with resentment that the United States and the South Korean puppet authorities are scheming to hold new large-scale military exercises integrating "Ulchi" and "Focus Lens" joint military exercises, the paper said this is a grave challenge to peace and reconciliation. It warned that if the United States and the South Korean authorities continued to cling to war maneuvers, they would be held wholly responsible for all consequences arising therefrom.
