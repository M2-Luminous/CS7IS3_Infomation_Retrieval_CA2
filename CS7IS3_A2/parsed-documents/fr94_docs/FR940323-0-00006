FR940323-0-00006 FR940323-0-00003 7 CFR Part 1011 [DA&hyph;94&hyph;07] Milk in the Tennessee Valley Marketing Area; Temporary Revision of Rule AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Temporary revision of rule. SUMMARY: This document revises certain provisions of the Tennessee Valley Federal milk order (Order 11) for the months of March through July 1994. The action was requested by Armour Food Ingredients Company (Armour), which operates a proprietary supply plant pooled under Order 11. This revision is necessary to prevent the uneconomical movement of milk and to ensure that producer milk associated with the market in the fall will continue to be pooled in the spring and summer months. EFFECTIVE DATE: March 1, 1994, through July 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Nicholas Memoli, Marketing Specialist, USDA/AMS/Division, Order Formulation Branch, room 2971, South Building, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456, (202) 690&hyph;1932. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Prior document in this proceeding: Notice of Proposed Temporary Revision: Issued February 8, 1994; published February 16, 1994 (59 FR 7665). The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule lessens the regulatory impact of the order on certain milk handlers and tends to ensure that dairy farmers will continue to have their milk priced under the order and thereby receive the benefits that accrue from such pricing. The Department is issuing this final rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have a retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with the law and requesting a modification of an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. This temporary revision is issued pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act and the provisions of ยง1011.7(b) of the Tennessee Valley order. Notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the Federal Register (59 FR 7665) concerning a proposed relaxation of the supply plant shipping requirement. The revision was proposed to be effective for the months of March 1, 1994, through July 31, 1994. The public was afforded the opportunity to comment on the proposed notice by submitting written data, views and arguments by February 23, 1994. No comments were received. Statement of Consideration This rule revises from 40 to 30 percent the supply plant shipping requirement for the period of March through July 1994. The Tennessee Valley order requires that a supply plant ship a minimum of 60 percent of the total quantity of milk physically received at the supply plant during the months of August through November, January, and February, and 40 percent in each of the other months. The order also provides authority for the Director of the Dairy Division to increase or decrease this supply plant shipping requirement by up to 10 percentage points if such a revision is necessary to obtain needed shipments of milk or to prevent uneconomic shipments. Armour states that it would have to make uneconomical shipments of milk to meet the 40 percent supply plant shipping requirement to continue its pool status. Additionally, the proponent states that its inability to meet the 40 percent requirement could jeopardize the continued association of its producers with the market. The reduction in the supply plant shipping requirement by 10 percentage points will enable a supply plant operator to qualify its plant as a pool plant without making inefficient and uneconomical shipments of milk. The revision will also allow producers who supplied the market in the fall to continue their association with the market during the flush production months. After consideration of all relevant material, including the proposal set forth in the aforesaid notice, and other available information, it is hereby found and determined that the supply plant shipping percentage set forth in ยง1011.7(b) should be reduced from 40 to 30 percent for the months of March through July 1994.
