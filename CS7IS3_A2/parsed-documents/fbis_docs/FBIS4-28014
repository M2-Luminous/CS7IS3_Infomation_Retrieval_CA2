Now the SDPJ has made public its immediate action policy for its return to the government on condition that the Hata cabinet resign en bloc following the passing of the budget. It is hard for the people to comprehend what the SDPJ is aiming at. Among the ruling parties are heard voices supporting the SDPJ's policy, making the future political development completely unpredictable. What is the aim of the SDPJ policy? How is it going to carry out the political realignment? SDPJ Secretary General Wataru Kubo, 65 years old, was interviewed as to what the party's real intention is. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] What does the SDPJ really intend in proposing the cabinet resignation en bloc after the passing of the budget and the SDPJ's return to the third coalition government? [Kubo] What are the immediate things to do to stabilize the coalition government? If a no-confidence vote is passed in the cabinet, the only way left is a general election. But the coalition is "against conducting elections under the plural member constituency system." Although the way to dissolving the Diet and then conducting elections is blocked, we can play the best card in the end. In my opinion, the plural-member constituency system may have to be used as the last resort. When the cabinet has to resign en bloc as the result of a no-confidence vote, there is no other way left than turning over the government to the leading opposition party (the LDP). I am opposed to that, so there is only one way left. That is to reconstruct the Hata coalition cabinet consisting of weak minority ruling parties. To make the third coalition government a stabilized one, the present regime has to resign en bloc following the budget's passage. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] In that case, is Mr. Hata eligible to run for premiership? [Kubo] Since the present coalition ruling parties are involved in the discussion, every head of a political party is eligible for nomination to premiership. Mr. Hata will not be eliminated. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] There is too much party interests and tactics for him to resign and assume the premiership again. [Kubo] Therefore, it is necessary for him to clarify the reason for the block resignation when he decides to resign. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Then, why did the SDPJ withdraw from the coalition government in the first place? Hata Cabinet's Mission Completed With Budget Formation [Kubo] The foremost reason the SDPJ withdrew was that faith, the most important element in the coalition, was betrayed. From the outset, the Hata regime had problems that compelled it to be vulnerable. Therefore, its mission will be finished with the budget's passage. At that point, it can liquidate the problems created when the second coalition government was formed. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Will not such a problem as the formation of the parliamentary group "Kaishin" occur again? [Kubo] It probably will. But it is irresponsible for politicians and political parties not to do anything for fear of it. A passive attitude must not be taken. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Is it all right not to liquidate the double power structure represented by Shinseito Chief Secretary Ichiro Ozawa? [Kubo] It is a big mistake to have the illusion that nothing can be done without Mr. Ozawa. He is surely an amazing politician in his reckless attempt to push through his strategy. In his handling of matters, I have noticed dangerous factors of trespassing on democratic principles. For that reason, a coalition must be formed. There could be battles as well as cooperation. He would think seriously and act accordingly when he faces a counterpart to fight against. I have the idea that a coalition is impossible unless Mr. Ozawa is excluded. I admit he has many excellent points. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Why is it not possible for the SDPJ to form a coalition with the LDP, when a coalition is possible with Mr. Ozawa, who has a different theoretical view of the state, to form a coalition with the LDP? No Policy Agreement Exists With the LDP [Kubo] There exists a complete agreement of opinions with Shinseito in our policy and basic agreements. No such agreements exist with the LDP. Mr. Ozawa's theoretical view of the state has been clearly made public in the Ozawa investigation committee's report and in his book, "A Blueprint for a New Japan." Even if we went to hell, there could be no agreement in these matters. But at present, Shinseito and the SDPJ have compromised to reach an agreement. It is possible for representatives of the political parties that share the regime to cooperate in government beyond the difference in theoretical views of the state. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] The chairman's and secretary general's positions on returning to the fold of the government sound different. Both Men in Agreement for United Efforts of the SDPJ [Kubo] We are in complete agreement in that the SDPJ will do its best to form a new coalition government. Mr. Murayama and his followers insist on opening a new phase by positively pushing for a general election, if there are no other means. I am insisting on the block resignation, to form a more democratic and more powerful coalition government by making the most of experience in the first coalition. We are looking at the same moon over the mountain from different sides of the mountain. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Do you not think the LDP is acting the same way the old SDPJ did? [Kubo] Well, it is a hell of a lot more unskillful an opposition party than the SDPJ used to be. (laughter) In their interpellation at the Budget Committee, they hit at mistakes at random but we did not attack that way. The LDP has not become a real opposition party yet. (laughter) On the contrary, they might be thinking that the SDPJ cannot become a ruling party as they expected. (laughter) [TOKYO SHIMBUN] How do you expect the political realignment will go? Worrying About Comeback of Big Conservative Alliance [Kubo] The reason I am insisting on the formation of a third coalition government originates from worries that a big conservative alliance will be restored if the present situation is left untouched. Prime Minister Hata does not think he can survive until the next Diet session. Some sort of strengthening measure is necessary. If we continue to refuse cooperation in that situation, we will be committing a grave mistake. As for the SDPJ, a partial alliance with the LDP that changes as the case may be is a possibility. With a wide list of choices, the SDPJ will secure and maintain its leadership in forming the next regime. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] What will its combination be? [Kubo] The government will be a coalition and the political forces will be tripolar for the time being. They are an "old conservative party," a "new conservative party," and a "new kakushin [reformist]," that is a congregation of liberal forces based on complete democracy. These tripolar forces will form a varied coalition government as they find possible bases for cooperation in policies. In the future, they will be contracted into the "new conservatives" and the "new kakushin," bringing in time two great forces, alternately taking control of the government. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Is not the single-member constituency system disadvantageous for the tripolar forces? [Kubo] I doubt that the LDP will really be in a predominant position. At present, the LDP holds a popularity rate of 20 percent, compared to the old days when it commanded 40-50 percent popularity. The new conservatives, all added up, have a nearly 20 percent popularity rate. If it tries hard, the SDPJ can come up with nearly 20 percent support. Thus the time has come for the tripolar forces to compete for one Diet seat in each constituency. If we have the thought that the LDP candidate cannot be defeated unless we stage a united campaign, it will lead us to a loss of confidence. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Is Hokkaido Governor Yokomichi a candidate for premiership? [Kubo] I want him to come back with vigor to the central political field. He must come back at the opportune time. He is unmistakably one of the leaders of a new time. But he is not the only one. He is a lot younger than I.
