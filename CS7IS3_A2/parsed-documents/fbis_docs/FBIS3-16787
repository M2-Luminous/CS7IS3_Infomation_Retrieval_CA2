According to the Central Electoral Commission, elections were scheduled for that day in the Belgorod, Vologda, Kamchatka, Kirov, Leningrad, Murmansk, Omsk, Orenburg, Oryol, Perm, Smolensk, Tver and Chita regions, the city of St. Petersburg and three autonomous districts -- the Aga- Buryat, the Komi-Perm and the Nenets districts. Elections to the supreme representative body of the Aga-Buryat Autonomous District, the district duma, have taken place. Residents of that steppe area showed a traditionally high activity: some 60 per cent of electors came to the polling stations. The elections were recognised as valid in all the 15 constituencies. The district duma will be made up mostly of heads of regional organisations, agricultural amalgamations and industrial enterprises. At the same time, the activity of electors in the Chita region was unprecedentedly low. According to preliminary data, a little more than 30 per cent of electors took part in the voting. An electoral campaign and elections will have to be repeated in five out of 21 constituencies, a spokesman for the regional electoral commission told ITAR-TASS. Candidates, nominated or supported by the democratic forces of the Baykal territory, suffered a serious defeat in the Chita region. Most seats in the regional parliament went to heads of industrial enterprises, farms and budget-financed institutions. The legislative assembly of the Orenburg region will not be able to start working. Protocols from local electoral commissions are still coming, but it is known already that the elections were not recognised as valid in 19 out of 47 constituencies: 12 -- in Orenburg, six -- in Orsk and one in Novotroitsk. Repeated elections will be held in three months in those constituencies, where electors did not come to the polling stations. According to the information, received by ITAR-TASS at the regional electoral commission, the elections were a complete failure in the city of Orenburg, which includes 13 constituencies. Only one deputy was elected, while in the rest of the constituencies the elections were recognised as invalid, because too few people took part in the voting. Kamchatka residents also failed to elect deputies to the regional legislative assembly with the first attempt. Elections were recognised as valid in five out of eight constituencies, while in three biggest four-seat constituencies, located on the territory of the administrative centre of the region, only 17 per cent of electors came to the polling stations. Thus, only nine out of 21 deputies were elected, a spokesman for the regional electoral commission told ITAR-TASS. According to his information, elections to the city dumas were valid in Yelizovo and Vilyuchinsk, while Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy was left without a representative body. A referendum on giving new names to the streets and moving monuments to Lenin to other places did not take place either. Today the regional electoral commission is expected to name the date of repeated elections to the legislative assembly. The regional assembly of people's representatives has been formed in the Belgorod region. The March 20 elections showed a comparatively high activity of electors: some 44 per cent of them came to the polling stations. However, the figures differ much in various constituencies. In rural areas the figure was 55 per cent, while in Belgorod -- 24.3 per cent and in Stary Oskol -- 24.4 per cent. As a result of it, the elections were recognised as invalid in three out of five constituencies of Belgorod and in two out of three constituencies of Stary Oskol. The overall result is that the elections were held in 16 out of 21 constituencies, and in all the 16 of them deputies to the regional assembly were elected. This is enough for the new representative authority to start working. About half of the seats went to heads and deputy heads of local city and district administrations. Elections in the Perm region did take place, but only 34.4 per cent of electors came to the polling stations. According to preliminary information, 37 deputies to the regional assembly were elected, while in three constituencies the elections were recognised as invalid because of a small number of participants. Two out of 14 seats in the Perm City Duma remained vacant. The Perm regional assembly will include nine representatives of business circles, ten senior executives of enterprises and seven heads or deputy heads of local administrations. In the Kirov region 36 per cent of the electorate took part in elections to the regional duma and local government bodies. The elections were valid in 45 out of 48 constituencies. The regional duma will include 13 heads of agro-industrial enterprises, 11 heads of local administrations, nine medics, one workers. One woman was elected to the regional duma. Elections were recognised as invalid in the Lenin and Oktyabrskiy districts of Kirov and in the city of Kirovo-Chepetsk, the second largest city of the region after the administrative centre. Only 25 per cent of electors came to the polling stations. Elections to the regional duma were a complete failure in Murmansk. None of the three constituencies registered the needed number of electors. According to preliminary information, only 20.6 per cent of them took part in the voting in the Lenin district of the city. The figure for the Oktyabrskiy district is 19.6 per cent, and for the Pervomaiskiy district -- only 13.4 per cent. Information from other constituencies is being specified.
