They said the resumption of negotiations between Japan and the DPRK on normalizing diplomatic relations, which have been suspended since November 1992, "is unlikely unless relations improve greatly." The sources said Pyongyang sees Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], a main force within the Hosokawa coalition government, as "a lackey of the United States" and it is unhappy with the alliance between Shinseito and the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], which once had friendly relations with the Workers Party of Korea [WPK]. These are the reasons for DPRK's bad impression of Japan, the sources said. Representatives of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) did not attend the SDPJ national convention and this seems to be the reflection of the opinion of the North Korean leadership. The SDPJ and Shinseito paved the way for normalization talks after Shin Kanemaru, (then) vice president of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], visited Pyongyang in the autumn of 1990. They were believed to have formed close relations with the DPRK. Therefore, a Foreign Ministry source said: "We have not expected that the DPRK has such a bad impression of Japan." The sources met with Hwang Chang-ye [name as published] and other North Korean senior officials in charge of diplomacy since the Supreme People's Assembly renewed the North Korean leadership last month. The sources said the North Korean leadership considers "relations with Japan below zero, compared to the U.S.-DPRK and North-South talks." The sources quoted a North Korean leader as saying: "The Hosokawa government is worse than the LDP government. The SDPJ has failed to establish its independece within the coalition government and it can no longer be considered friendly to the WPK. The SDPJ has joined hands with (Shinseito Chief Secretary Ichiro) Ozawa. Ozawa and (former Defense Agency Director General Keisuke) Nakanishi are puppets of the United States dressed in the clothes of the United Nations." They also quoted another North Korean leader as saying: "Pyongyang expects nothing from Japanese Deputy Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. We do not think he can do something in defiance of Ozawa's will." The sources indicated that prospects for resuming normalization talks are dim and that it would be difficult to carry out a plan of promoting bilateral exchanges at a political party level.
