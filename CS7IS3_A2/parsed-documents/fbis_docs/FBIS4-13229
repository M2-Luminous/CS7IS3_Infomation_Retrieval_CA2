He stressed that a solution to the Palestinian problem must not be at the expense of Lebanon. In an interview with the Lebanese newspaper AL-SAFIR published today, Buwayz said that many Palestinians in Lebanon want to return to Palestine or to other countries that will provide them with better residential and living conditions. He added that Lebanon cannot absorb such a large number of Palestinians because it is small in area and also because of its particular political structure; therefore it cannot provide them with jobs or health, social, and educational opportunities. He revealed that Lebanon has proposed to regional and international parties a political plan for solving the problem of the Palestinian refugees in Lebanon by returning 20 percent of them to the territories on the West Bank and Gaza that are to come under Palestinian authority and distributing another 25 percent in some Arab countries where they could be reunited with their families. The Lebanese foreign minister went on to say that there are some countries that accept expatriates, such as the United States, Australia, and Canada, and these could take the remaining Palestinians. He added that the multilateral negotiations will not be able to solve the Palestinian refugee problem until a comprehensive peaceful settlement in the region is reached. Buwayz called on the United States to deal more effectively with Israel. He said that Washington has not played the role of an impartial mediator and driving force and has not yet exercised dynamic mediation, as it promised when the peace process began. Buwayz stressed that the Arab side wants to provide every condition and opportunity for the success of these negotiations despite the difficulties and Israel's tardiness, for our side does not want to appear negative in the world's eyes. He held Israel responsible for the collapse of the situation in south Lebanon, stressing that Lebanon will never abandon the principle of resistance as long as the occupation continues and Israel refuses to implement Security Council Resolution 425, which is based on withdrawal from the Lebanese territories.
