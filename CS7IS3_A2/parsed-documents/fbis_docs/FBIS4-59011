According to these sources, Israel regards the U.S. mediation as an auxiliary element of the negotiations aimed at settling matters of principle, but believes the details must be discussed directly by the sides. [passage omitted] The senior political sources said that the gap between the Israeli and Syrian positions is very big and that detailed deliberations in working groups can only start after a framework for the negotiations has been determined. [passage omitted] 'Aqiva Eldar reports: The United States neither supports nor rejects the Israeli plan for an arrangement with Syria. Israeli and U.S. officials in Washington asserted yesterday that Secretary Christopher relayed the Israeli proposal to Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad without adopting a position on it. Referring to the banner headline in HA'ARETZ yesterday ("The United States Has Reservations About the Israeli Proposal"), Israeli sources said they had been told by senior State Department officials that Christopher had neither rejected nor criticized the Israeli proposals.
