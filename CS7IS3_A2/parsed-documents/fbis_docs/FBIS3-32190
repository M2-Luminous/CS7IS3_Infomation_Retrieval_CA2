How would you define your relationship with Eduardo Frei? [Garcia] It is very good, I greatly admire the president-elect... [ESTRATEGIA] Do you believe your appointment was decided by the president alone or do you think partisan interests were considered? [Garcia] I have no doubt I was elected by the president, but I also enjoy my party's support. [ESTRATEGIA] You are one of the youngest and most handsome members of the cabinet. What other virtue do you think will help you do your job as minister? [Garcia] I do now want to discuss my own virtues because this is for others to do, but I would like to talk about what I want to do "he says calmly and with a smile on his face which becomes more serious when he refers to his tasks in the ministry." From the economic viewpoint, Chile's great challenge lies in constantly increasing its competitivity, which is linked to two great aspects: increased productivity and increased quality of the productive apparatus. Chileans have become aware that these two issues are essential if we are to continue to grow successfully. This overall consensus has not resulted yet in specific working agreements or in a joint action of public and private sectors, or in the private sector itself. I want the Economy Ministry to reach these agreements and implement them. [ESTRATEGIA] In this sense, do you think the Economy Ministry has failed to do its job? [Garcia] No, on the contrary; I believe the ground rules have been set for a sound relationship between the Economy Ministry and the private sector that now allow them to work jointly. This formal dialogue is carried out through the institutional channels that have been created. The economy minister presides over the Committee for the Participation of the Private Sector in International Economic Relations [Comite de Participacion del Sector Privado Para las Relaciones Economicas Internacionales], which groups the main business and labor union leaders. These subjects have been placed on the agenda of the public as well as the private sectors. Therefore, an effort is being made to step up and continue a task that has already been started. [ESTRATEGIA] Taking this into account, what short-term plans do you have in mind? [Garcia] The main objective is to make progress jointly -- businessmen and workers -- to draft an agenda of concrete tasks that will make global agreements possible. I want this to be a joint effort so the agenda must also be drafted jointly. I have some ideas in mind but, above all, I want to discuss them and reach agreement with business and labor union leaders. [ESTRATEGIA] Have you started making the contacts? [Garcia] I have been talking with them but we will really get down to work when I assume as economy minister. [ESTRATEGIA] What do you think about the role of businessmen and workers during the current administration? [Garcia] Incredibly positive. In a very brief period of time a climate of dialogue that never existed in our country has been established between the government, businessmen, and workers. Confrontations used to be characteristic of the relationship between these sectors. During these past four years a method to define public policies has been established and the challenges that have surfaced have been tackled jointly. All involved sectors have revealed a national spirit that has allowed the country to grow; all sectors have revealed a great commitment with the country, not just with their sector, which must be maintained because that is their social duty which they assumed with great dignity. [ESTRATEGIA] Within this context do you believe the policy of consensus must be maintained? [Garcia] Absolutely...! [ESTRATEGIA] Do you think this is why the government has criticized for its "lack of audacity." [Garcia] I do not agree there has been a lack of audacity. On the contrary, I believe it was very audacious to progress on the path of consensus. It was very audacious because it was very new and needed great willpower. [ESTRATEGIA] What challenges will the country have to face in the macroeconomic field given the scope of the scheduled work? [Garcia] Our most important effort will be to stay on the present path. Conditions are right for the economy to grow at a stable pace of 6 percent, and current investment levels make us believe this is possible in the long term. We need only continue to encourage savings and we will finance all our domestic investments. The path we have chosen -- the gradual reduction of inflation -- will assure a more stable process and, therefore, our challenge is to continue the program. [ESTRATEGIA] Do you think estimates for 1994 on growth and inflation rates are correct? [Garcia] Yes. We should expect growth rates of between 4 and 5 percent and inflation slightly lower than last year. However, it is important for the country to be aware that the development path we have chosen -- which has yielded great results -- also increases the influence of the world economy on Chile's economy. Therefore, it is not possible to make economic evolution projections solely based on local conditions. There are signs of a recovery in the world economy, which is promising for our economy, but I do not think the process is definite. My impression is that 1994 will still be a year of slow international growth. [ESTRATEGIA] Would you say we should be optimistic or cautious during 1994? [Garcia] I would say we must face the year with austerity. [ESTRATEGIA] In your opinion, will Chile reach single digit inflation rate during the next few years? [Garcia] We must try to reduce inflation to one digit. Conditions are right. [ESTRATEGIA] During the presidential campaign, [Copper Corporation, CODELCO, executive president] Juan Villarzu's proposals were considered more liberal than those of Minister Alejandro Foxley. Whose proposals do you think are closer to your way of thinking? [Garcia] I was not aware there were differences. I do not know in what areas... [ESTRATEGIA] For instance, regarding capital accounts, privatization, foreign exchange policy... [Garcia] Minister Foxley encouraged the opening of capital accounts and this is currently paving the way. I have no doubt that Villarzu, Foxley, and the entire coalition agree that the opening of capital accounts is a crucial factor in our export development. Chile has a potential offer of services in the international arena. To materialize this offer we must open capital accounts. One of the usual hurdles in the commerce of goods has been the lack of follow up by the financial sector. We all agree on the absolute need to advance this opening process. We have defined a path that passes through the normalization of national capitals market, particularly the banking system which has sponsored this process. [ESTRATEGIA] But critics speak against the current government's gradualism. [Garcia] Speaking about the capital market, in the past few days we have seen a Minister Foxley rather annoyed by the slowness of the process that he is trying to speed up. It obviously does not depend on the willingness of the Executive Branch because the bill has been in Congress for more than a year now. [ESTRATEGIA] What is your position regarding privatizations? [Garcia] We discussed the issue at length inside the coalition. The important aspect of our position is that we do not have a set criteria as to whether privatizations are good or bad. Public companies must be efficient and competitive in order to fulfill their social function. If they are not, there is no reason why they should continue as public companies. To advance the privatization process, however, it is essential to create the mechanisms to ensure the preservation of the common good in areas where -- some times -- competition does not operate effectively. When privatizing companies in certain productive areas it is essential to create regulating mechanisms. Perhaps the most important part of our proposal is that no area should be off-limits for private initiative. On the contrary, we must do the utmost to encourage investments in areas that are traditionally public -- particularly in the field of infrastructure. For instance, the president-elect has said that all new investments in the ports will come from the private sector. [ESTRATEGIA] Does it mean then that the issue of privatizations is more an economic than a political issue? [Garcia] Absolutely. We are not politically prejudiced about the issue. [ESTRATEGIA] Do you believe a public company that is not administered well should be privatized? [Garcia] We should consider privatizing inefficient companies. Sometimes it is a better to rationalize a company than to sell it. But continuous inefficiency is a very good reason for privatization. [ESTRATEGIA] What companies do you think should be transferred to the private sector? [Garcia] I do not have any in mind right now. I could not mention a specific company. But we have agreed on certain criteria. [ESTRATEGIA] What about Codelco? Why is there so much fear about discussing it? [Garcia] There are two good reasons why the company should stay in state hands. First, the state can provide a broad field for possible progress in the areas of efficiency and rationalization; and second, the company has a great macroeconomic importance. [ESTRATEGIA] We have noticed a certain disorder in the administration of trade agreements during this government. What will be the role of the Economy Ministry during your administration? [Garcia] I would not characterize it as disorder. The economic opening is an objective for national development, and commercial agreements constitute one of the mechanisms to advance in that direction. It is, therefore, necessary for the Finance, Foreign, and Economy Ministries to participate in this process because they have areas of concern that must be present in any discussions. At the beginning of the year a formal organization was created -- the Participation Committee -- to call a national dialogue on this task. It is a mechanism that must continue. It is adequately facing its tasks. Besides, the participation of these three ministers converge in this area. I know [Foreign Ministry foreign debt negotiator] Eduardo Aninat and [Foreign Minister-designate] Carlos Figueroa quite well and I have no doubt whatsoever that we will constitute a good working team to perform this task. [ESTRATEGIA] Considering the progress achieved lately, what must be the objectives of Chile's international economic relations during Eduardo Frei's administration? [Garcia] We will try to continue to increase Chile's presence in international markets. There are areas, particularly the Asia- Pacific region, where Chile has great development potential. We will also seek to strengthen our presence in our traditional markets -- the United States, Japan, and the EC -- and to continue to work on market liberalization, a task that must be maintained. This is one of the challenges ahead of us. It requires the active participation of everyone, that is, the government and the private sector.
