FR940926-1-00003 FR940926-1-00001 Other positions. Several agencies reported specific situations in which competitive hiring procedures would not be appropriate or effective. However, because each of these situations is unique to the agency involved, issuance of Governmentwide Schedule A authorities would serve no practical purpose. Therefore, the proposed regulation would provide for exception of additional positions with prior OPM approval. Regulatory Flexibility Act I certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities (including small businesses, small organizational units, and small governmental jurisdictions) because they apply only to Federal employees. List of Subjects in 5 CFR Part 213 Government employees, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Office of Personnel Management. James B. King, Director. Accordingly, OPM proposes to amend 5 CFR part 213 as follows: PART 213_EXCEPTED SERVICE 1. The authority citation for part 213 is revised to read as follows: Authority: 5 U.S.C. 3301 and 3302, E.O. 10577, 3 CFR 1954&hyph;1958 Comp., p. 218; §213.101 also issued under 5 U.S.C. 2103; §213.3102 also issued under 5 U.S.C. 3301, 3302 (E.O. 12364, 47 FR 22931), 3307, 8337(h), and 8456. 2. In §213.3102, paragraph (i) is revised and paragraph (m) is removed and reserved, as follows: §213.3102 Entire executive civil service. * * * * * (i) Temporary and less-than-full-time positions, as follows: (1) Positions in remote/isolated locations where examination is impracticable. A remote/isolated location is outside the local commuting area of a population center from which an employee can reasonably be expected to travel on short notice under adverse weather and/or road conditions which are normal for the area. For this purpose, a population center is a town with housing, schools, health care, stores and other businesses in which the servicing examining office can schedule tests and/or reasonably expect to attract applicants. An individual appointed under this authority may not be employed in the same agency under a combination of this and any other appointment for more than 1,040 working hours in a service year. Temporary appointments under this authority may be extended in 1-year increments, with no limit on the number of such extensions, as an exception to the service limits in §213.104. (2) Positions for which a critical hiring need exists. This includes both short-term positions and continuing positions that an agency must fill on an interim basis pending completion of competitive examining, clearances, or other procedures required for a longer appointment. Appointments under this authority may not exceed 30 days and may be extended for up to an additional 30 days if continued employment is essential to the agency's operations. The appointments may not be used to extend the service limit of any other appointing authority. An agency may not employ the same individual under this authority for more than 60 days in any 12-month period. (3) Other positions for which OPM determines that examining is impracticable. * * * * * (m) [Reserved] * * * * * [FR Doc. 94&hyph;23716 Filed 9&hyph;23&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6325&hyph;01&hyph;M
