The exercise held with the support of KC-135 tanker planes was an extremely reckless war gamble aimed at examining overseas-based flying groups' capability of quick movement and deployment and entry into a war according to the war scenario of the U.S. imperialists. In separate action on February 7, formations of Japan-based fighter planes of different types flew above the operational zones in Yongwol and Pyongchang in an exercise of surprise attack and intensive bombing. Such war maneuvers of the U.S. imperialists, timed to synchronize with the heinous anti-DPRK campaign they have launched on the pretext of the fictitious "nuclear problem" of the DPRK, are premeditated acts of provocation designed to render the situation on the Korean peninsula further strained.
