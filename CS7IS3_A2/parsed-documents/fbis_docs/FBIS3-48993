[Begin Funar recording] We appreciate this initiative by President Ion Iliescu. PUNR supports the idea of concluding a political, social, and economic pact and will associate itself with the PDAR [Democratic Agrarian Party of Romania], which intends to sign the pact. I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to all political parties, especially those of the opposition, to associate themselves with us and sign the mentioned pact, which we badly need in these difficult times. We need national unity, and I hope that all political parties will prove to be sufficiently mature to go beyond all party ambitions and lend a helping hand to conclude the pact and especially implement it. I would also like to mention the second issue for discussion, which we have been invited to by President Iliescu, namely the International Monetary Fund memorandum and the discussion on it in parliament. We were happy to see that President Iliescu appreciates PUNR's petition that was issued a few days ago, by which it requests that the government should come to parliament and present the details on the accords concluded over the past years with the IMF, their consequences, as well as the accord planned for 1994 and 1995. We are certain that the prime minister [Nicolae Vacaroiu] will personally come to parliament to present those details so that our lawmakers can get acquainted with them and decide accordingly. In this way, the whole country can learn about the details, since many things related to those accords are presently unclear. [end recording]
