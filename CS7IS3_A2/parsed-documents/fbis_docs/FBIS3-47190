While this is seen to be due to impatience with the deadlock in Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks, it is also believed that statements by Japanese bureaucrats portraying the recent change in the U.S. position as "a concession to Japan" have enraged the U.S. officials. Such a war of words "does more harm than good" to the framework talks. Industry leaders in both countries are annoyed that "bureaucratic friction has surpassed actual Japan-U.S. economic friction in intensity; this is aggravating the problem." Recently, U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Mickey Kantor and Bowman Cutter, deputy assistant to the president (concurrently vice chairman of the National Economic Council), criticized Japanese bureaucrats in public, mainly for: 1) distorting U.S. proposals in the framework talks when presenting them to Japanese Government leaders and the Japanese people, and creating a "mistaken impression"; and 2) stopping the Japanese political and industrial sectors from taking steps to open markets, ease regulations, and reduce income tax. Senior U.S. officials are particularly annoyed that the Japanese counterargument which claims "the United States is obsessed with market share targets, and is forcing managed trade on Japan" has received international support, and has even given rise to criticism of the government in the United States. In any case, the Japanese argument is not entirely a distortion of facts. In the beginning, the Clinton administration had indeed made repeated statements which showed a preoccupation with market share targets. It is only in the past month, when reaching an agreement in the framework talks before the Japan-U.S. summit meeting in February has become the priority task, that remarks to the effect that "we are not obsessed about market share targets" became prominent. The truth is, the U.S. Government is extremely anxious that this recent shift of position may be taken as "a concession to Japan," and subjected to criticism in Congress. That is the reason why U.S. officials have criticized Japanese bureaucrats in public despite the possible adverse effects on the framework talks.
