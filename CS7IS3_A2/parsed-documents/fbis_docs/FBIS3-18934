Revealing the names of Publitalia chairman Marcello Dell'Utri, Publitalia managers Valerio Gerardelli and Romano Luzzi, and "three external managers, a husband and wife named Onorabile and a certain Lecci," the flagship Fininvest Canale 5 news admitted that it was "probably breaking the law" but stressed its intention was not to alert the named persons to take flight. The news bulletin also referred in passing to "another three detention requests people have been talking about, for a case of alleged kickbacks involving the ENEL [National Electric Power Board] electricity agency." "An unprecedented political attack...old and absolutely risible cases that could be cleared up in five minutes but are turned by the media into a looming dragnet," was the comment of the Fininvest owner, who stepped down from the helm of his media-to-retail empire when he took the political field with his Forza Italia (Go Italy) movement to beat the left in the March 27-28 elections. "This is an offence to the intelligence and rights of millions of Italians...(whom) Forza Italia calls on to punish with their votes those who would transform a clean-up by magistrates into a sad case of the political use of the judicial system," said the pre-election poll leader, who is also the AC Milan chairman. Reacting to "the reports of imminent arrest," Dell'Utri's lawyer said his client was "totally ready" to provide necessary clarification on the alleged false accounting, expressing the view that there was no need for preventive custody. The preventive custody requests were reportedly on the desk of preliminary hearings judge Fabio Paparella, but no official decision had been announced. One of Paparella's reported options was to pass them on to colleague Anna Introini, who has been working for months on alleged "parallel accounting" within the Fininvest group. [passage omitted] Fininvest issued a statement Wednesday evening [9 March] denying that Publitalia had ever issued false receipts and said it was the victim of a plot being orchestrated by certain factions in the judiciary and the press aimed at falsifying the election campaign. The statement stressed how only selected excerpts were being leaked by judicial sources to the press in an attempt to create a distorted picture of a judicial investigation "which could be clarified with extreme ease were there the will to do so." According to Fininvest, the investigation being carried out by Secit and the Finance Guard was focused on company's supplying Publitalia and thus had no connection with the Clean Hands investigation into graft, bribery, illicit party funding a corruption in general. "All possible clarification can be made, in respect to civil rules, in the course of a tranquil conversation with the magistrate" the statement said, "there being the obvious readiness for the interested party to offer the most ample collaboration." "However, the audacity to question a subject in a state of detention" the Fininvest statement stressed, "constitutes an illegal act of persecution which has the sole objective of falsifying the ongoing election campaign," against Fininvest owner Silvio Berlusconi and his Forza Italia (Go Italy) movement.
