Antic: "Belgrade's Lips Remain Sealed"] [Text] Pristina -- "As president of Kosovo, I gave my word to the citizens of Kosovo and I am promising that, according to the results of the 1991 referendum, I will nurture the will of the Kosovo citizens, expressed at that referendum." This will, let us recall, was: "An independent and sovereign state of Kosovo." This was stated, among other things, by Ibrahim Rugova in the latest issue of ZERI, in response to the question on when he expected the process of solving issues in Kosovo to start, that is, when he expected a dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina to start. Rugova said that he expected the issue of Kosovo to be dealt with by the international community immediately after the conclusion of the Muslim-Croat agreement in Bosnia. For the first time, he said that, expecting a reaction from the Serbs, he has proposed that the United States mediate in these talks, and that, as he said, the presence of the European Union, even Russia, cannot be ruled out. He said that he had opted for the Americans because their policies are pragmatic, whereas Europe is satisfied with a status-quo situation. Following Rugova's statement, almost all papers in Albanian language were preoccupied with the "start" of the Serbian-Albanian dialogue on solving the status of Kosovo. Analysts, commentators, and Albanian politicians are very frustrated, however, because "Belgrade's lips remain sealed."
