In a statement released by the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, Mondale praised the Japanese Government for its hard work in resolving the long-standing problem. "The government of Japan will take all available measures to ensure compliance with these commitments," the statement said. Among the commitments are "to build 159 new base stations, containing an additional 9,900 voice channels, according to an agreed quarterly schedule, to provide coverage for 95 percent of the population by December 1995, and to reallocate spectrum for use by the U.S. technology-based system," it said. "This agreement demonstrates that the U.S. and Japan can work together to achieve real market access in Japan," it said. Meanwhile, Posts and Telecommunications Minister Takenori Kanzaki issued a statement on the Japan-U.S. agreement, which read as follows: 1. Mr. Walter F. Mondale, U.S. ambassador to Japan, and I have come to a final agreement today on the cellular phone issue between Japan and the United States of America. 2. Nippon Idou Tsushin Corp. (IDO) has drawn up a plan for expanded installation for the North American-type analog cellular telephone system and transfer of a part of the spectrum currently allocated to the company to the North American-type system portion. The Government of Japan and the Government of the United States of America have decided to take measures including holding of regular meetings to assess implementation of the IDO measures. 3. The Government of the United States will terminate actions under Section 1377 of of the Omnibus Trade and Competition Act in response to these measures to be taken by the Japanese side. 4. I would like to pay respect for cooperation by Ambassador Mondale and the efforts made by the corporations concerned during the process leading to the resolution of this issue. I earnestly hope that the settlement will translate into maintenance and further development of the good economic relationship between the two countries. Later the same night, Mondale and Kanzaki had a joint news conference at the Post and Telecommunications Ministry. Mondale said the agreement is a good example for promoting the U.S.-Japan trade framework talks. He added that although the cellular phone negotiations are different from the framework talks, both sides should have heart-to-heart discussions with utmost effort. Mondale also said the agreement will facilitate competition in high technology and will eventually benefit Japanese consumers. Kanzaki said that Japan did not agree to setting of numerical targets with the agreement.
