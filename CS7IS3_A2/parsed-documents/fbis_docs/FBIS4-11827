Witnesses had earlier said several passers-by were lightly injured by the blast, which blew out the building's windows. The outlawed Islamic militant group al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah [Islamic Group] later said it had placed a time bomb under a parked car which exploded outside the branch of the Egyptian Trade Development Bank. The booby-trapped car and four others parked nearby were destroyed when they caught fire. The al-Jama'ah said in a statement sent to AFP that the attack had been carried out "in revenge for the torture and humiliations inflicted on Islamic detainees." It was the first bomb explosion at a bank during opening hours, despite a series of such bombings in recent months. The al-Jama'ah, which has been waging a two-year violent campaign against the secular government of President Husni Mubarak, previously claimed responsibility for about 10 bombings this month. The statement warned that more attacks would follow to avenge human rights violations in Egypt's prisons, which it alleged had "increased in recent days." It also repeated accusations that banks were involved in usury by charging interest, which is outlawed by the Koran.
