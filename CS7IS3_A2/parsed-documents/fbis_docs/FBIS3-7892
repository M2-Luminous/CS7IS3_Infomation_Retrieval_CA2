"This situation will no longer be tolerated. Stirrers will not be tolerated in the Army," the defence minister said in an open letter released today. Today's STANDART NEWS and KONTINENT reported that over the weekend the Defence Ministry and top state institutions were stricken by fear of mutiny. Officers and NCO's in Khaskovo (Southern Bulgaria) launched a sign-in campaign calling on parliament to appropriate 37,500 million leva for the 1994 defence budget. According to the dailies, the campaign is going on and has been supported by servicemen in other parts of the country. The campaign was discussed at a special meeting attended by the defence minister, deputy ministers, General Lyuben Petrov, chief of the General Staff, General Lilko Yotsov, the Armed Forces prosecutor, and other top brass. STANDART NEWS said Deputy Defence Minister Boyko Noev proposed that the masterminds of the campaign be dismissed on disciplinary grounds with immediate effect. According to an anonymous source quoted in KONTINENT, "the initiators avoided arrest by a hair's breadth." Aleksandrov briefed President Zhelev and Prime Minister Berov on the situation in the Army. STANDART NEWS said President Zhelev tried to calm down the Defence Ministry leaders saying this was hardly an organized mutiny. He called on them to seek ways to clear the matter up with the initiators of the sign-in campaign who, according to the President, demanded from politicians the same as the leaders of the Defence Ministry. In today's letter the defence minister said the Rakovski Legion had organized several sign-in campaigns in breach of the Armed Forces' statute. "Those who want an increase in the defence budget through sign-in campaigns and statements, knowing that their claims are absurd in the current difficult period, are taking undue advantage of the common interests of the military and are driving the Army to instability and politicization," the defence minister says. According to him, "in their attempt to protect their own interests, the organizers and fomenters of the campaign are ready to oppose the Army to society." "The leadership of the Rakovski Officers' Legion is being manipulated for political purposes," Aleksandrov says. Today's STANDART NEWS quoted the Legion's leaders who denounced "attempts to ascribe political ambitions to the `Khaskovo initiative.'"
