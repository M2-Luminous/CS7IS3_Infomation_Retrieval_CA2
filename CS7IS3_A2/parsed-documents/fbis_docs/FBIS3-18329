The law decree, which was approved by the cabinet February 21 but was only just published in the OFFICIAL GAZETTE, called for six additional Italian members in the Strasbourg Assembly in line with a decision taken by the European Council on February 1, 1993. The decree also ruled that political groups already present in the Italian Parliament and in the Strasbourg Assembly must collect signatures for the presentation of candidates in the European Parliamentary elections scheduled for June. Previously, groups already present in parliament were exempted from having to gather signatures. Now, whoever wants to be a candidate in all five of the Italian constituencies set up for the European Parliamentary elections must collect between 150,000 and 175,000 signatures. Furthermore, in each of these mega-constituencies, candidates must have at least between 30,000 and 35,000 signatures. Slates will not be accepted in certain regions if the signatures gathered do not add up to at least one-tenth of the total of signatures collected in a particular constituency. There are also changes affecting non-Italian community citizens resident in Italy. They can now be included in Italian voter lists and cast their ballots for Italian candidates and slates in their place of residence. The only formality required is that they file a request to do so with their local mayor up to 90 days prior to elections. The same option is open to Italians residing in another European Community country, in line with EU directives. However, those Italians who do no want to vote for foreign parties, can cast their ballots in special polling stations that will be set up in Italian consulate offices, cultural institutes, schools, and the like. Even Italians who are not resident abroad, but who find themselves temporarily in another EU nation for work or study purposes, can vote in these specially set-up polling stations. The decree also allows the presentation in Italy of candidates from other European Union countries -- as long as the EU citizen has not lost the right to run in elections in his native country.
