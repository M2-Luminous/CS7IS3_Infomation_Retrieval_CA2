FR941206-0-00033 FR941206-0-00006 These temporary regulations also increase the initial net worth requirement for all nonbank trustees to better assure that enterprises are sound and well-funded during their start-up period. Under the existing net worth requirements, every nonbank trustee must have an initial net worth that exceeds $100,000. Under these temporary regulations, all entities applying for nonbank trustee status must have a net worth of not less than $250,000 for the most recent taxable year preceding the applicant's initial application. The existing net worth requirements, as modified for SIPC protected assets, will continue to apply on an on-going basis after a nonbank trustee has obtained the approval of the IRS. In the absence of evidence that the on-going net worth requirements fail to meet the underlying objectives, these requirements (except with respect to SIPC protected assets) remain unchanged. However, the IRS recognizes that the nonbank trustee requirements have been in effect since 1979. Accordingly, the IRS and Treasury would welcome comments concerning the net worth requirements generally, as well as other aspects of the 1979 regulations. Special Analyses It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, these temporary regulations will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on their impact on small business. Drafting Information The principal author of these regulations is Judith E. Alden, Office of the Associate Chief Counsel, (Employee Benefits and Exempt Organizations). However, other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated in their development. List of Subjects in 26 CFR Part 1 Income taxes, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
