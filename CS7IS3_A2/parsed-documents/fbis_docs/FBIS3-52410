He said numerous problems have been solved after signing the Palestinian-Israeli agreement. He stressed Egypt's readiness to try to help overcome the remaining problems if requested to do so. The remarks came in a joint news conference held by Foreign Minister Musa and the director of the PLO Political Department, Faruq Qaddumi, following their talks in Cairo this afternoon. He said he and Qaddumi discussed the latest developments relating to the peace process on the Palestinian-Israeli track. He said they discussed issues relating to Egyptian-Palestinian coordination, noting that Qaddumi will leave Cairo for Amman tomorrow to complete discussions on Jordanian-Palestinian coordination within the framework of Arab coordination and boosting the peace process. Musa said the discussions in Cairo a few days ago were useful and very serious, noting that a paper containing the elements left outstanding has been prepared. He said there are numerous papers and ideas relevant to the remaining points and we understand both parties' positions. He stressed that the picture is not gloomy, because both parties are concerned with reaching an agreement to implement the Declaration of Principles signed by them. He said it is only natural that such a complicated issue should involve differences in views between the two sides, noting that numerous points have been resolved and the remaining ones are few in comparison. He said he expects the negotiations to resume soon. Qaddumi said the goal of his visit to Egypt is to explain all the developments in the Palestinian arena. He said: Our task focuses on relations between the PLO and Egypt and on completing coordination and cooperation with Jordan and Syria, because Arab coordination is an important factor that will enhance the negotiating position and maintain the peace process. He thanked Egypt for its efforts and role in advancing the peace process. Qaddumi said the PLO's relations with Jordan are distinguished and he described 'Amr Musa's visit to Jordan yesterday as important and fraternal, falling within the framework of achieving Arab coordination. He said there is no document of understanding between the Palestinians and Israelis but ideas for discussion. He said negotiations must continue and both parties should remain concerned with reaching an agreement, which should be reached eventually. Qaddumi pointed out that despite his opposition to several articles of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement, he is putting his hand in the hand of Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, because differences in views do not mean division, rather distribution of roles. He said PLO Executive Committee member Mahmud 'Abbas will continue to head the Palestinian delegation to the Liaison Committee meetings. He stressed that Israel's failure to implement the Declaration of Principles on time on 12 December is considered to be a violation of the agreement. He stressed that the Palestinians insist on continuing the negotiations and on honestly implementing the articles of the Declaration of Principles, highlighting that Israel should comply with this. He called on the United States to exert its good offices as a sponsor of the peace conference.
