Basindwah, a northerner, told Qatar's state-run radio that southern forces loyal to Vice-President 'Ali Salim al-Bid had fired 13 Scud missiles at the capital Sanaa since fighting erupted on Thursday. But he said northern forces backing President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih still had the advantage, saying 12 southern al-Bid warplanes had been shot down since Thursday. "The military situation is not developing in the favour" of southern leaders he said, calling on them to "turn themselves in immediately", pledging that they would receive "a fair trial." "Fierce fighting is raging near Aden," the main southern port- city, "between the (northern) army and the rebels", Basindwah said in a reference to al-Bid's forces. He added that Aden was under a northern blockade to "force the outlaws to surrender." Diplomats in Yemen said that a large concentration of northern troops was seen 50 kilometres (35 miles) north of Aden. Meanwhile Basindwah said the situation in Sanaa and all the northern provinces was "calm." He also said northern Yemenis were opposed to an emergency meeting of the Arab League to discuss the spiralling civil war as it was an "internal affair." His comments came just before the Arab League was due to hold an emergency meeting in Cairo to discuss an Egyptian proposal to send a peacekeeping force to Yemen.
