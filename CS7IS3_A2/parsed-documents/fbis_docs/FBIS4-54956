The first days of May were very tense in Kukes. A possible hunger strike had been announced some days previously as a consequence of the intolerable misery that is a result of the neglect of the demands of the inhabitants of 45 villages along the banks of the Drin. People's feelings brought them out on the streets. Gatherings increased on 1, 2, and 3 May. Warning strikes also began, while the government in Tirana remained silent at demands that were beyond the competence of local authorities. The strikers then decided to embark on that most appalling human act, a hunger strike. Perhaps this is the only way to make our governments come out to the people. This is indeed what happened. It took a group of 50 strikers occupying the meeting hall of the former Kukes District Executive Committee on the morning of 4 May for four ministers of the Democratic government to urgently descend on Kukes by helicopter. These included Public Order Minister Agron Musaraj. Ministers Manushi, Halili, and Xhaja flew with him. Why Did the Strike Begin? When the great dam of the Fierze hydroelectric station was built years ago, it did not occur to anybody that this project could later become the cause of major social problems that would lead people to consciously make sacrifices of themselves. The then regime made an extraordinary commotion about creating new socialist villages, about which even songs were composed. These are now turning into scenes of tragedy. About 30,000 inhabitants of the inundated villages were rehoused in 13 specially constructed so-called "socialist villages." At that time, these people who were uprooted from their land were content merely with a house each, which the state built for them. They made no great claims over their expropriation, because other cooperativist peasants were in virtually the same position. However, the start of the democratic movement, the collapse of the cooperatives, and the restoration of property left these inhabitants of inundated villages stranded like fish out of water. They could not return to their old land, because this was under the waters of the "lake of light." Moreover, the inhabitants of the villages where they had settled began to evict them, because of their own land ownership. This was when they started to raise their demands, which boiled down to a matter of life and death. They democratically created their association of those expropriated by flooding, which was recognized by law. In 1991, they also formulated their demands, which they submitted to the government. Here they are: -- about 2,000 hectares in compensation for the inundated land. -- rent for their land on the basis of the approximate value of the produce of the inundated land. -- recognition of co-ownership in any possible privatization of the hydroelectric station. -- compensation for the difference in house values then and now. -- the accommodation of emigrant families in areas with adequate land. But what concretely has been done with these demands between 1991 and now? Nothing, except that they have been recognized as fair, both then and now. In September 1993, representatives of the association meet with Arbnori and Selami, and as a result a government commission was created under Hasan Halili, now agriculture minister. This commission has apparently never met. The protests of the people of Kukes continued with a petition addressed to the president of the Republic, but all these efforts fell on the government's deaf ears. Under such circumstances, the association decided to use the final method of a hunger strike. Dialogue Followed by the Use of Force The government was faced with an accomplished fact: In the hall of the building in Kukes, the initial number of strikers had trebled. They threatened not to leave the hall alive unless their demands were met. Around the building, hundreds of other people expressed solidarity with those inside. The tension continually increased. The ministers came from Tirana. They started talks with the strike committee, the committee of the association, and the district council. All the district's political groups called the strikers' demands fair, as did the ministers, who attempted to extinguish the conflict with discussions and promises. They offered hope for the migration of some families, which had been approved by the relevant communes. However, the strikers insisted on all their demands and requested an urgent meeting with Prime Minister Meksi. Thus the dialogue became embittered, and the members of the government, who had not forgotten to bring with them some vehicles with special forces, decided to use coercion, and declared the strike to be illegal. Clashes began between citizens and the special police forces. Forces of the Kukes police were not used. There was no way in which they could strike at their parents, brothers, and sisters. There were inevitably gunshots and blows with truncheons and stones. A truly painful situation. The result? Exact information is not available, but official reports speak of 26 wounded, including 14 policemen and 12 demonstrators. The tension in Kukes, which has lasted five days, is continuing. The prime minister has still not gone there. The national highway by the bridge of the Drin i Zi linking Kukes with the rest of Albania was blockaded for one day, another harsh warning from the strikers' supporters. The number of people surrounding the building where the strikers are holed up sometimes rises, sometimes falls. It is said that Jah Trota, chairman of the strike committee from the village of Kenete, has spoken to Mr. Meksi on the telephone, but they wait for him in Kukes. Perhaps this would defuse the tension of recent days.
