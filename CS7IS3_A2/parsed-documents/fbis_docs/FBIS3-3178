We should never allow the bourgeois lifestyle to run rampant in China. Ai Zhisheng said: China has signed agreements of cooperation and exchange with over 100 countries and regions and many television programs are introduced from overseas. These practices are necessary. However, the problem is that we do not analyze and differentiate programs introduced from overseas, and consequently, a large number of movies, videotapes, and tapes even regarded as vulgar or pernicious in the West are introduced. Radio and television programs have been overflowing with vulgar popular songs, rock and roll shows, and beauty pageants in disguised forms. Ai Zhisheng said: Many movies and audio-visual products from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the West are brought into our country through various legal and illegal channels, and occupy most of the theaters in cities and townships. This severely affects locally produced movies. An overwhelmingly majority of these movies and audio-visual products are vulgar, and are very damaging to adolescents. Ai Zhisheng pointed out: It is equally notable that some people from overseas use money to entice others to make movies which smear the revolutionary history of China, play up the seamy side of things, and reject socialism. Some people from overseas also come to the mainland to hold various false "charity shows" and "beauty pageants" in disguised forms, and to use huge monetary awards to wantonly promote a decadent lifestyle which advocates consumption and hedonism, as well as negative and decadent ideologies and culture. These activities have brought about many grave consequences. Ai Zhisheng said that, in order to safeguard the interests of the construction of socialist spiritual civilization and to educate the younger generations in a better way, it is necessary to unswervingly implement Deng Xiaoping's instructions: "We must unswervingly implement the policy of opening up to the outside world and vigorously widen the scope of exchange with the outside world on the basis of equality and reciprocity; but, in the meantime, we must keep sober-minded and resolutely resist the corrosive influence of foreign decadent ideologies. We should never allow the bourgeois lifestyle to run rampant in our country."
