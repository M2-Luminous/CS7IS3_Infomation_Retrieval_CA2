Work Committee Secretary Zeng Qinghong pointed out at the meeting: Ideological and political work plays an important role in the party's entire cause. It is a crucial link that helps transform the party's line, principles, and policy into the masses' action of consciousness, an important approach that helps unite the masses of people and arouse their initiative, and a vital force and important guarantee for the smooth progress of revolution and construction. Zeng Qinghong said: Paying high regard to ideological and political work and giving full play to the role of ideological and political work is our party's fine tradition and politically strong points. As the administrative body of the CPC Central Committee, CPC Central Committee organs shoulder important responsibilities for formulating and carrying out the party's line, principles, and policy and play an important pivotal role in the party's cause. The position and role of the CPC Central Committee organs set higher and stricter demands on the masses of cadres and personnel in terms of politics, work style, and administration. Zeng Qinghong demanded that the ideological and political work of the CPC Central Committee organs must be guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line and closely centered around the party's central tasks. The CPC Central Committee organs must make efforts in ideological and political work to meet the needs of the developing circumstances and closely integrate it with administrative affairs of various departments and units. They must conscientiously strengthen ideological education; improve overall quality of their cadres and personnel; and cultivate a team of cadres and personnel who are promising, moral, cultured, and self-disciplined. They must fully arouse the enthusiasm, initiative, and creativeness of cadres and personnel; ensure the completion of various tasks in their departments and units; and serve the deepening of reform, promoting of development, and maintaining of stability. Zeng Qinghong said emphatically: To arm the entire party with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is a major task of party building in the new period and a major task of the ideological and political work in the new situation. The fundamental goal of the CPC Central Committee organs' ideological and political work is to unite the ideology of the masses of cadres and personnel with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line. Party organizations at all levels in CPC Central Committee organs must conscientiously and carefully study the theory in an in-depth manner. He added: Comrade Deng Xiaoping made a series of important expositions on the ideological and political work in the new period. These expositions have substantial content, deep intention, and distinct features of the times. These expositions are an important part of his theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. The masses of party members and cadres, especially those who are involved in ideological and political work, must conscientiously study these expositions, grasp their essence, and use these expositions as a guide to their work. Gu Yunfei, deputy secretary of the Work Committee for CPC Central Committee Organs, presided over the meeting.
