FR941219-2-00011 FR941219-2-00005 [C&hyph;614&hyph;701] Determination Not To Revoke Countervailing Duty Order; Certain Steel Wire Nails From New Zealand AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. ACTION: Notice of Determination Not To Revoke Countervailing Duty Order. SUMMARY: The Department of Commerce (the Department) is notifying the public of its determination not to revoke the countervailing duty order on steel wire nails from New Zealand. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 19, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Brian Albright, Office of Countervailing Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;2786. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On September 29, 1994, the Department published in the Federal Register (59 FR 49643) its intent to revoke the countervailing duty order on steel wire nails from New Zealand (52 FR 37196; October 5, 1987). Under 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii), the Secretary of Commerce will conclude that an order is no longer of interest to interested parties and will revoke the order if no domestic interested party objects to revocation and no interested party requests an administrative review by the last day of the fifth anniversary month. Within the specified time frame, we received objections from domestic interested parties to our intent to revoke this countervailing duty order. Therefore, because the requirements of 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii) have not been met, we will not revoke this order. This determination is in accordance with 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4). Dated: December 13, 1994. Joseph A. Spetrini, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Compliance. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;31141 Filed 12&hyph;16&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;P
