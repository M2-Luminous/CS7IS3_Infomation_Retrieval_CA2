Welcome. [Kwasniewski] Good evening. [Czajkowska] Recently in Davos [Switzerland], you publicly expressed your conviction that you have been handling people's frustrations and disappointments--which, according to you, are the real danger to the reforms in Poland--the right way. Now, what do you mean by saying you have been handling them the right way? What do you really mean by saying the SLD [Democratic Left Alliance] has been handling our frustrations the right way? Results of public opinion polls that are available to society do not confirm your optimism. [Kwasniewski] First of all, one must realize that these frustrations do indeed exist and that they are justified. Millions of people in the country have problems: They are unemployed, their retirement pensions and other types of pensions and salaries are low... [Czajkowska, interrupting] But we know all that. But my question was: What do you mean by saying you have been handling it the right way? [Kwasniewski] To handle it the right way means to suggest a program that will be changing the situation step by step by guaranteeing economic development first of all. This is what I talked about in Davos. I think Poland's great chance is the fact that last year we saw growth of the GDP of more than 4.5 percent, and also that, after the first two months of this year, we saw a 10-percent increase in production output... [Czajkowska, interrupting] But that is to be attributed neither to the SLD nor to the governing coalition. [Kwasniewski] You know, it is to be attributed primarily to people. I think that any politician who says this is to be attributed only to him is dishonest. But the fact is that, if these are the trends, they must be preserved and protected. And that is our biggest chance. So, when you remember the difficult budget we argued about, which the SLD took upon its shoulders, as it were, because the budget had been proposed by the then Finance Minister Borowski, and then we fought for the budget in the Sejm, the goal of all that was, step by step and while protecting the developmental trends in the economy, to create a chance to meet halfway those people who are frustrated and who have good reason to feel so. [Czajkowska] So when you said in Davos that the SLD has been handling things the right way, you simply meant all of the governments that ruled the country after 1989? [Kwasniewski] Even more than that. What I also meant was all the good in the country that we managed to create since the beginning of Poland's existence because it is my view that Poland began neither in 1989 nor in 1945. The point is simply to do in Poland whatever can bring us success and to avoid doing those things that contribute to our problems. That is my philosophy, as it were, the philosophy of a politician and the philosophy of a man. My view is that one must look for positive aspects and good solutions while avoiding bad ones, and that is why I regret many things that take place in our country and that I evaluate as bad things. [Czajkowska] And I hope this is what we will talk about in the program tonight and also that we get your replies as to how you think these difficult problems should be solved. [passage omitted] [Czajkowska] Sir, one does not have to be particularly observant to see that the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] is clearly being favored over the SLD. When the president, for instance, warned against greedy communists, he clearly meant the SLD. There is talk among people that the presidential constitutional initiative was rejected by Sejm deputies for the SLD, even though everyone knows that Sejm deputies for the PSL also voted against. Even Solidarity attacks the SLD while clearly taking an easy-going attitude--forgive me for using that popular term--toward the PSL. All that is not just a coincidence. What is your assessment? [Kwasniewski] You know, of course it is not just a coincidence. It can be concluded from this, that we [SLD] exist, while, in the year... [Czajkowska, interrupting] But the PSL also exists. [Kwasniewski] Yes, but the point is that, back in 1990, when the PSL was being born out of the old United Peasant Party, it was of marginal importance, as it were, and no one had any particular grievance against them because of that, whereas the SLD, or, actually, Social Democracy of the Polish Republic, which was being born in the spring of 1990, was confronted by the president's argument in which he said we will be finished within three months. Not only have the three months been going on and on for a long time now, but we also won the elections; let me remind you that we won the September elections by quite a big margin, to be quite honest, even though before, right-wing activists had been ascribing us the role of what they call postcommunist, or communist, remnants. [Czajkowska] But the PSL is your coalition partner. [Kwasniewski] Fine, but I will not say even one unfavorable word about the PSL tonight. Please, do not force me to do that. [Czajkowska] I am not forcing you to do that. I am just asking whether there are clear.... [Kwasniewski, interrupting] They are our coalition partner whom we treasure and with whom we want to cooperate. [Czajkowska] That is fine with me. [Kwasniewski] But, if you allow me to, I would like to finish my thought on why there are so many attacks against the left wing and the SLD, in particular coming from the president. [Czajkowska] Actually, I meant the PSL being clearly favored--that is the term our viewers used. [Kwasniewski] Fine, let it be so. The reason is that the SLD is disliked because we have shown that, through a peaceful exchange of arguments, lack of aggressiveness, and rational ideas, one can simply gain social confidence and win elections. I think that very many people on the right wing--and also, unfortunately, the president, I say with sorrow--still find it very hard to come to terms with the fact that we who had been condemned to be a marginal phenomenon--some even said we belong on history's rubbish heap--right now are winners in the elections, form a governing coalition, and, moreover, when you read Western newspapers, you can see that we are actually guarantors of the Polish democratic and free-market reforms. And I think that is the right perception. After all we went through, including some very personal experiences, we are very deeply convinced that there is no going back for Poland. I mean we cannot give up democracy, the free market, or our openness to the world. When it comes to our coalition partner, well, all I can say is that I envy the PSL a bit in that all groups have favorable opinions of the party. Both the Democratic Union and the Confederation for an Independent Poland have courted the PSL, as the president is doing now. But apparently the left wing is not suited to play the role of one who is courted. [Czajkowska] And do you not think, Mr. Chairman, that perhaps you yourselves are to blame for the PSL's being favored this way? From the very beginning of this coalition, the SLD has actually been teasing the PSL by trying to sermonize to it, by warning it, and by placing yourselves at the top of the reforms process--you said that yourself tonight, by the way--and by seeing in the PSL's measures a danger to the reforms. Recently, SLD spokesman Mr. Siemiatkowski made a comparison between Chairman Kwasniewski and a messiah who is supposed to lead the nation to a successful future without any problems. Is that not too much? [Kwasniewski] Of course, that was a lot, and perhaps it was too much, but, as far as I can recall, that interview by Mr. Siemiatkowski, he spoke there about the left wing. I think that, in that sense, what the left wing has gone through.... [Kwasniewski pauses] Of course, I am the kind of man.... [Czajkowska, interrupting] Are you trying to suggest that, when Mr. Siemiatkowski spoke about the left wing, he also meant the PSL? [Kwasniewski] No, I think he meant us, the political group that is us, and also.... [Czajkowska, interrupting] But it is you who was described as a Moses in that statement. [Kwasniewski] So is it a Moses or a messiah? [Czajkowska] I am sorry. I confused the two. [Kwasniewski] Please, do not.... [Czajkowska, interrupting] I think I am not the one you should address but rathe, Sejm Deputy Siemiatkowski, who described you this way. [Kwasniewski, hesitating] You know, that is of course a metaphor, and let us approach it that way. But there is no doubt that, when it comes to the left wing in the country, as I said, we managed to overcome the condemnation of a political nonexistence and become one of the ruling parties. Of course, that is by no means to be attributed to only me personally, but, on the other hand--let us not be too modest here--I think I played some part in the process. Very many people played a positive role, and attacks by some others were also helpful to us. But that is a closed chapter, and it is not the most important thing. The most important thing is what you asked me about our coalition partner. Well, my view is that there is no alternative, given the political configuration that was established after September of last year. Of course, we could get theoretical here in a number of ways, but the truth remains that the PSL-SLD coalition is creating a chance in Poland for a stable government based on a majority, for the first time in many months or even years. And one must.... [Czajkowska, interrupting] Forgive me for interrupting, but this is not what I meant. [Kwasniewski] So what did you mean? [Czajkowska] Let me refresh your memory: I am not willing to question the principles of the coalition's existence or the PSL's participation in it. All I am saying is that the favoring of the PSL at the expense of the SLD, which we talked about earlier, is perhaps caused--or at least there are such views--by the SLD's own behavior inasmuch as the party sermonizes to the PSL, teases it, tells it what to do, as if condemning the PSL to play a secondary role, which means the SLD leads the reforms. By the way, you yourself said that here tonight. [Kwasniewski] No, all I said was that we are absolutely in favor of the reforms that are taking place. As far as our coalition partner is concerned, we treat the PSL with all seriousness and in the most thorough manner possible, even though cooperation is of course difficult. One must be honest about that. There would be no problems or conflicts if the cooperation were perfect. As regards the sermonizing, of course I can be self-critical here and say that we are not without guilt here and that many things have been said unnecessarily, that is for sure. But, on the other hand, I also think that too many measures by our coalition partner have not been completely understood or accepted by us. [passage omitted]
