FR940930-2-00225 FR940930-2-00074 The Special Purpose Subsidiaries then will issue and sell their preferred securities (``Preferred Securities''), with a par or stated value or liquidation preference of up to $100 per security, at any time or from time-to-time, in one or more series through December 31, 1997. The Preferred Securities will be sold by the respective Special Purpose Subsidiaries in the following aggregate par or stated value or liquidation preference amounts: (1) Up to $175 million in the case of Alabama; (2) up to $300 million in the case of Georgia; (3) up to $15 million in the case of Gulf; (4) up to $15 million in the case of Mississippi; and (5) up to $10 million in the case of Savannah. Each Operating Company and/or its respective Investment Sub will acquire all of the common stock or all of the general partnership interests, as the case may be, of its Special Purpose Subsidiary for an amount up to 21% of the total equity capitalization from time-to-time of such Special Purpose Subsidiary (``Equity Contribution''). Each Operating Company may issue and sell to its Special Purpose Subsidiary, at any time or from time-to-time in one or more series, subordinated debentures, promissory notes or other debt instruments (``Notes'') governed by an indenture or other document, and the Special Purpose Subsidiary will apply both the Equity Contribution and the proceeds from the sale of Preferred Securities to purchase Notes of such Operating Company. Alternatively, each Operating Company may enter into a loan agreement or agreements with its Special Purpose Subsidiary under which it will loan to the Operating Company (``Loans'') both the Equity Contribution and the proceeds from the sale of the Preferred Securities evidenced by Notes. Each Operating Company may also guarantee (``Guaranties'') the payment of dividends or distributions on the Preferred Securities, payments to the Preferred Securities holders of amounts due upon liquidation or redemption of the Preferred Securities and certain additional amounts that may be payable regarding the Preferred Securities. Each Note will have a term, including extensions, of up to 50 years. Prior to maturity, each Operating Company will pay only interest on its Notes at a rate equal to the dividend or distribution rate on the related series of Preferred Securities. The dividend or distribution rate may be either fixed or adjustable, determined on a periodic basis by auction or remarketing procedures, in accordance with a formula or formulae based upon certain reference rates, or by other predetermined methods. Such interest payments will constitute each Special Purpose Subsidiary's only income and will be used by it to pay monthly dividends or distributions on the Preferred Securities issued by it and dividends or distributions on the common stock or the general partnership interests of such Special Purpose Subsidiary.
