Speaking at the seminar were Police General Chawalit Yotmani, secretary general of the Office of the Narcotics Control Board; Pricha Suwannathat, MP from Bangkok; Chatchai Sutthikrom, director of the Assets Examination Division of the Anticorruption Committee; and Dr. Bandit Nitthawon, deputy director of the Technical Department of the Bank of Thailand. The seminar, designed to find legal measures to facilitate suppression of international narcotics trafficking syndicates, was motivated by the legal charge by the U.S. Government against Thanong Siriprichaphong, a former MP of the Chat Thai Party from Nakhon Phanom Province, for his alleged involvement in international drug trafficking. However, Thailand has no law or any evidence to prosecute the accused. Without a law against money laundering, narcotics prevention and suppression works in Thailand are fruitless. Authorities are unable to trace sources of dirty money or money earned through illicit means. Dirty money, especially drug money, is purified and legalized after it has passed through the hands of financial institutions. Authorities can never confiscate it or take legal action against its owner. Money laundering is defined as an act of purifying through financial institutions money that is earned from illegal activities. The money is used to invest in stock markets or other businesses to prove that it is legally earned. After the laundering process, authorities cannot confiscate it or use it as evidence against its owner. An attempt was once made in Thailand to pass a money laundering law in accordance with the Vienna Convention. The Office of the Narcotics Control Board, Police Department, Office of the Juridical Council, Office of the Supreme Attorney General, international organizations, and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency worked together to draft the legislation. However, the Bank of Thailand and several domestic financial institutions voiced their disagreement by saying that enforcement of an anti-money laundering law would constitute a violation of individual privacy and was against the secrecy law which prohibits commercial banks from releasing personal information about their clients. But now the Bank of Thailand fully supports the passage of a money laundering law. Bandit Nitthawon, deputy director of the Technical Department, said that since Thailand is a financial hub, so it must adjust itself to meet world standards and enforce a money laundering prevention law. The law will also serve as a deterrence against all types of economic and political crimes and corruption. An anti-money laundering law is, therefore, a measure to prosecute law violators. The law will enable authorities to trace the origins of dirty money and gather evidence to prosecute its owner. Without a money laundering law, authorities will encounter enormous difficulties in filing criminal cases because they do not have evidence, nor can they use the illegally-earned money as evidence. The anti-money laundering law to be promulgated by the government must cover money from not only drug trafficking, but also other unscrupulous activities such as stock manipulation, weapons and contraband trade, and corruption. Moreover, financial institutions must be obliged by the law to keep authorities informed about accounts of their clients when amounts of money reach a fixed level. They are also required to keep records of the real and family names of depositors and notify agencies concerned about any suspicious transactions of money made by their clients so that authorities can take appropriate follow-up action. Promulgation of an anti-money laundering law is certainly not detrimental to investment or the free monetary policy of the government. On the contrary, it will assist efforts to turn our country into the financial hub of the region. It is beneficial in the long run because it can be used as a tool to trace the origins of illegally-earned money. Therefore, the government must expedite passage of this law in order to suppress wrongdoers.
