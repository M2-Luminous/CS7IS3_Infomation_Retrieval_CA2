[Arias] I do not feel responsible, nor do any of my men. We have never felt responsible for the situation. The responsibilities we assumed were determined by operational directives and dictated by our commanders. Of course some people died, but everyone tends to forget or they neglect to mention that the public forces' actions allowed us to rescue more than 250 hostages. [Vergara] Do you feel like the scapegoat for this whole thing? [Arias] Yes, I think so, judging from the results of the Attorney General's Office investigation, meaning the resolutions issued in 1989 implying that Colonel Edilberto Sanchez and General Arias were the only ones at the Justice Palace. This is not a matter of blaming someone else. The investigation should have been more thorough and decisions should have been based on the facts.
