Peslyak; from the "Vesti" newscast--recorded] [Text] [G. Kaurov, head of a department of the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy, identified by caption] Korea is, perhaps, capable of developing nuclear weapons now, but we have serious doubts that Korea is actually developing nuclear weapons. [Peslyak] So Russian nuclear specialists believe that Pyongyang does not have the bomb, while the West and South Korea stress in every possible way the reality of the nuclear threat in the peninsula. The problem, perhaps, lies elsewhere or not only in the dilemma of what course of action to take: Sanctions or conferences, pressure or a negotiated compromise? To count on inspectors being given access to Pyongyang's nuclear installations but in exchange for what? For direct talks with the United States? To give appropriate guarantees to North and South Koreas, to keep the peninsula nuclear-free? But what should be regarded as the cause of the current situation? In the West's view, it is Pyongyang's blackmail and bluff plus indirect support from Beijing which has just carried out an underground nuclear explosion. But maybe, partially the reason is a search for a new image of an enemy after the old one represented by Moscow does not exist any longer for the United States and NATO? After all, an opportunity has appeared to justify nonreduction of military budgets and carry out some preparations, referring to somebody's intransigence. One thing is clear: The Treaty on Nuclear Nonproliferation expires next year. If, in the international class, one pupil suddenly shows an indomitable temper in learning nonnuclear peace, will nuclear veterans have enough political tact and sensibility to use persuasion instead of arm-twisting? Other pupils will then see this as an equality-promoting experience.
