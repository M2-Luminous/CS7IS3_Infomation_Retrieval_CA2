Among the changes, the most important is to take the economic issue as a matter of national security and place it at the center of U.S. foreign activities. With the cold war over, the military threat posed to the U.S. by the former Soviet Union no longer exists and the strategy of global confrontation with the Soviets pursued by the U.S. Government in the past 40 years has lost its real significance. On the other hand, the U.S. is declining in its economic power with an enormous amount of resources put into the nuclear arms race, serious economic and social problems and a high unemployment rate in three consecutive years. Since taking office in January, President Clinton has taken economic recovery as the first priority of his administration and made efforts to push forward an "economic diplomacy" with the aim of expanding overseas markets, increasing exports of U.S. goods and services, cutting deficits in U.S. foreign trade and creating more jobs for Americans. As part of the efforts, the Clinton government made a three- pronged assault in the last few months to ensure success in three major aspects of vital interests to his country. First, through extensive and arduous lobbying, it won congressional approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to pave the way for the creation of the world's largest free trade bloc with Canada and Mexico. Second, after bitter bargaining, the United States reached a compromise with the European Community in the seven-year-long Uruguay-Round multilateral trade talks by the final deadline of December 15. If these two achievements still bear the trademark of the previous government, the move to develop relations with Asian countries is mainly a Clinton initiative. The sustainable economic growth in Asia, especially East Asia, since the 1980s has made the region the most prosperous part of the world. The vast market in Asia and its potentials have no doubt a strong appeal to the rest of the world, including the United States. Therefore, Clinton has changed a practice usually adopted by his predecessors soon after he entered the White House -- he went to East Asia for his first overseas visit. The President and his senior administration officials have not only repeatedly stressed the importance of Asia-Pacific to the United States, but have also frequently visited this region. In congressional hearings on foreign policies, the administration's polices on Asia-Pacific have also taken a very large proportion. At the fifth ministerial conference of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) held in Seattle in November 1993, Clinton took advantage of his position as the host and called an informal meeting of APEC leaders to discuss cooperation and development of the region. Proceeding from reality, the U.S. Administration has also adjusted its policies on China. During the Seattle conference, Clinton held a formal meeting with Chinese President Jiang Zemin, thus making a new, good start in Sino-U.S. relations. All this shows that the U.S. Administration has changed its traditional "Eurocentric" policy and begun to attach importance to developing relations with Asia in its foreign policies. As the sole superpower today, the United States, while valuing "economic diplomacy," has of course not forgotten its "status of leadership" over world affairs. In this regard, the Clinton administration, unlike its predecessors, has stressed even more seriously the linkage of U.S. foreign relations with the so-called issues of "democracy" and "human rights" of other nations. It forces other nations to act according to the American concept of values and constantly threatens rejectors with economic or trade sanctions. Furthermore, the Clinton administration has maintained that the United States and other nations adopt allied actions to interfere with regional conflicts and other "inhuman practices" under the name of the United Nations and other international organizations. This foreign security strategy of the Clinton administration's has been dubbed by the U.S. media as "collective interventionism" or "new interventionism." Whether it is "economic diplomacy" or "new interventionism," the fundamental purpose of Clinton's adjustment of foreign policies is to maintain the U.S. status as "the superpower" and to build a new world order in the interest of the United States. However, time brings great changes to the world -- many Western countries no longer act upon whatever the United States says and the voice of opposition to foreign interference from vast numbers of developing nations is becoming increasingly louder. The United States has sustained a series of setbacks in its military operations in Somalia; its once hardline positions on Bosnia-Herzegovina and Haiti also aroused strong reaction domestically, sparking off a heated debate on future American foreign policies. It has been noticed that the Clinton administration has begun to adopt more realistic attitudes on Somali and other regional conflicts. But, judging from the overall situation, it is noticeable that the overhaul of U.S. foreign policies has not yet finished as the foreign policy of the Clinton administration is still taking its shape.
