Uruguay has questioned the domestic components index of the products to be traded within Mercosur, fearing that its incipient industry might be devastated by Argentine and Brazilian competition. As compensation, it asked for the creation of an EPZ. The Brazilian Government does not agree to this, as it would deactivate the Manaus duty-free zone.
