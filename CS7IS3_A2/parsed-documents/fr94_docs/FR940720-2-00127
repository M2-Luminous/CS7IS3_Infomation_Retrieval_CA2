FR940720-2-00127 FR940720-2-00072 The Decision On April 14, 1994 (59 FR 17803), the PBGC published a notice of the pendency of a request by the San Francisco Baseball Associates, L.P. (the ``Buyer'') for an exemption from the bond/escrow requirement of section 4204(a)(1)(B) with respect to its purchase of the San Francisco Giants (the ``Seller''). According to the request, the Major League Baseball Players Benefit Plan (the ``Plan'') was established and is maintained pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement between the professional major league baseball teams (the ``Clubs'') and the Major League Baseball Players Association (the ``Players Association''). The Clubs have established the Major Leagues Central Fund (the ``Central Fund'') pursuant to the ``Major League Agreement in re Major Leagues Central Fund.'' Under this agreement, contributions to the Plan for all participating employers are paid by the Office of the Commissioner of Baseball from the Central Fund on behalf of each participating employer in satisfaction of the employer's pension liability under the Plan's funding agreement. The monies in the Central Fund are derived directly from (i) gate receipts from All-Star games, (ii) radio and television revenues from World Series, League Championships, intradivision play-offs and All-Star games, and (iii) certain other radio and television revenues, including revenues from foreign broadcasts, of regular and exhibition games. During the 1992 Plan year, approximately $34.1 million was paid into the Plan on behalf of all major league clubs. In that year revenues to the Central Fund exceeded expenses, including contribution to the Plan, by approximately $354 million. Effective November 20, 1992, the Buyer and Seller entered into an Asset Sale and Contribution agreement under which the Buyer agreed to purchase substantially all of the assets and assume substantially all of the liabilities of the seller relating to the business of employing employees under the Plan. The contract of sale provides that the Buyer agrees ``to contribute to the Plan substantially the same number of contribution base units which the Seller had an obligation to contribute to the Plan.'' The contract of sale further provides that ``[i]f the Buyer thereafter, but prior to the end of the fifth plan year commencing after the closing, partially or completely withdraws from the Plan, the Seller will be secondarily liable for any withdrawal liability it would have had to the Plan *␣*␣*.'' the final closing of the transaction occurred on January 14, 1993. The amount of the bond/escrow that would be required under section 4204 (a)(1)(B) of ERISA is $1,412,077. The estimated amount of the withdrawal liability that the Seller would incur if not for Section 4204 is $4,796,483. The Comment received by the PBGC suggested that the request for exemption be denied based on the possibility that revenues payable to the Central Fund may not be sufficient to provide contributions to the Plan in the future. In support, the commenter cited an expected decrease in revenues under the terms of a new network television contract, the primary source of revenue for the Central Fund; the possibility of a work stoppage during negotiations to implement a salary cap as part of a new collective bargaining agreement; and diminished fan loyalty and attendance due to high player salaries, inflated ticket prices, poor management, and other factors. The PBGC notes that the bond/escrow requirement is intended to assure the payment of the Buyer's withdrawal liability if the Buyer withdraws from the Plan in the five plan years following the sale of assets, and the Buyer is unable to pay withdrawal liability that would otherwise have been paid by the Seller had section 4204 not applied to the transaction. The factors cited by the commenter do not substantially affect the Plan's ability to collect withdrawal liability from the Buyer, as compared with the Plan's ability to collect withdrawal liability from the Seller had section 4204 not applied to the transaction. We also note that the Seller remains secondarily liable under section 4204(a)(2) for withdrawal liability, regardless of whether the Buyer receives an exemption from the bond/escrow requirement. In addition, the Plan's public filings indicate that the Plan is financially sound. The Plan's most recent annual return/report (Form 5500) states that the Plan had approximately $708 million in assets as of the close of the plan year on March 31, 1993. While the plan incurred approximately $63 million in expenses for that plan year, the Plan's investment earnings were nearly $100 million. Accordingly, based on the facts of this case and the representations and statements made in connection with the request for an exemption, the PBGC has determined that an exemption from the bond/escrow requirement is warranted, in that it would more effectively carry out the purposes of title IV of ERISA and would not significantly increase the risk of financial loss to the Plan. Therefore, the PBGC hereby grants the request for an exemption for the bond/escrow requirement. The granting of an exemption or variance from the bond/escrow requirement of section 4204(a)(1)(B) does not constitute a finding by the PBGC that the transaction satisfies the other requirements of section 4204(a)(1). The determination of whether the transaction satisfies such other requirements is a determination to be made by the Plan sponsor. Issued at Washington, DC, on this 14th day of July, 1994.
