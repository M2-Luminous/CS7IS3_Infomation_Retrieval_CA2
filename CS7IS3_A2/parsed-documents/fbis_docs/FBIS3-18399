The first is related to Iraq. An Iraqi delegation headed by an under secretary visited Turkey at the end of December 1993. It invited Ozdem Sanberk, under secretary of the Turkish Foreign Ministry, to visit Baghdad before it returned to Iraq. The Turkish Foreign Ministry is presently considering the way it will respond to that invitation. Until last night, the high-ranking officials were inclined to agree that Sanberk should visit Baghdad. However, the final decision will be adopted in the next few days. The decision is critical to Turkey because Ozdem Sanberk's arrival in Baghdad would be the first high-level visit by a Turkish official to Iraq since the Gulf War. Furthermore, it will pave the way for intensified relations between Turkey and Iraq. However, Turkey's allies do not favor the establishment of high-level relations with Baghdad at this stage. Nevertheless, they are gradually becoming aware that Turkey's situation is different. The current talks between Ankara and Baghdad seem only to be on the question of the oil pipeline between the two countries. Nevertheless, the question of northern Iraq continues to be a serious problem. Turkey wishes to convince Baghdad to adopt a more moderate approach on matters related to its citizens in northern Iraq. In short, Ozdem Sanberk's probable visit will be an important development. Message to Denktas for a Solution In accordance with Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's circular in January, a committee has been established to assess Turkey's foreign policy. Several ambassadors have been appointed as committee members. The committee will work under Prime Minister Ciller. Deputy Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin and Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin are among its members. It plans to hold its first meeting on Turkey's policy on Cyprus at the beginning of the week. It will be recalled that in the United States some time ago Ciller promised to do whatever she could to contribute toward the solution of the Cyprus problem after the elections in north Cyprus. The elections have been held and a new government has been established in north Cyprus. In view of that, the time has come for Turkey to design its policy on the matter. President Demirel has invited President Rauf Denktas to visit Ankara. He will arrive on Tuesday, 22 February. Time To Solve the Problem The committee met to assess Turkey's foreign policy at the beginning of the week. It decided that Rauf Denktas should be asked the following: "We have to adopt a decision on the policy we should maintain. Should we maintain the policy of no-solution or move to seek a solution to the problem?" A high-ranking Turkish Foreign Ministry official said: "The no-solution situation is a solution. However, we have to decide." Turkey is convinced that a solution has to be found to the Cyprus problem. In fact, Deputy Foreign Ministry Under Secretary Bilgin Unan's visit to Nicosia in January to initiate backstage activities for the acceptance of UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's proposals was the first indication of Turkey's approach in that direction. The Turkish Cypriot side has recently taken positive steps. However, world public opinion is convinced that it is opposed to a solution of the problem. Obviously, several other steps must be taken to remove that impression. So, Denktas' visit may be an important turning point. Turkey is now convinced that concrete steps must be taken to resolve the Cyprus problem. That will be explained to Denktas in detail on Tuesday. The question of Syria is the third point in Turkey's foreign policy that has aroused concern. Developments in domestic politics have overshadowed that problem. In view of that, little attention has been focused on whether or not President Clinton was able to influence President al-Asad when they met some time ago. A high-ranking official has said that President Clinton was able to do so. Intelligence reports Turkey has recently received indicate that Syria has seriously restricted Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] leader Abdullah Ocalan's activities in that country. Restrictions on Ocalan There are various rumors about Ocalan's whereabouts. He is reported to be living in a village between Syria and Lebanon. He has been informed that he must remain indoors during the day and avoid holding political talks. There are reports that the PKK camps in Syria have been closed down and the movement of PKK militants has been restricted. In short, Turkey's pressure seems to have achieved a certain degree of success. Meanwhile, the Turkish Foreign Ministry is worried that Turkey may be subjected to intensive pressure by Western countries on matters related to the Kurdish problem. It seems that the first signs of that pressure have come from the United States. In Germany, a motion on the Kurdish problem has recently been blocked in the Bundestag. Undoubtedly, it will be looked at again if a message is received from the United States. All this indicates that Turkey has to concentrate more seriously not only on the question of Iraq and the Cyprus problem but also on the Kurdish problem in southeastern Anatolia.
