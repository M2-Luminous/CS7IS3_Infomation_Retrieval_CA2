Even though it might not place first, it would certainly be the most captivating book this week. This special publication not only satisfies the curiosity of the general public about the wealth of high officials, but it also virtually changes the views of many people about government. Everyone finds, to their astonishment, that without money, one is virtually unable to practice politics. Furthermore, money means not just NT$1 million, but NT$10 million, or even NT$100 million. Of the 90 public servants whose wealth was published, it is estimated that, surprisingly, 14 had assets of as much as NT$100 million, and if President Li Teng-hui, who bought a villa at Tahsishan Village is included, one sixth of the public servants have a personal worth of NT$1 billion. Twelve of them are government officials, including Prime Minister Lien Chan [6647 2067], Minister of Interior Wu Po-hsiung [0709 0130 7160], Control Yuan members K'o Ming-mou [2688 2494 6180] and Li Shen-i [2621 0135 0001], ministers without portfolio Kuo Yuan-jung [6753 1238 1369] and Huang Shih-ch'eng [7806 4258 1004], Examination Yuan President Ch'iu Ch'uang-huan [6726 0482 3562], Judicial Yuan President Lin Yang-kang [2651 3152 3263], Grand Justice Li Chih-p'eng [2621 1877 7720], President's Office Secretary General Chiang Yen-shih [5592 1750 1102], and Deputy Director of the Planning Commission for Recovery of Mainland China Yeh Chin-feng [0673 6855 7685]. To use the term "diamond line-up" for this top echelon of power is no overstatement. Not long after issuance of the Control Yuan communique, the latest popular opinion poll fully reflected the people's concerns. Fifty-one percent of the public felt that government officials whose property holdings were reported had more money than they thought. Another 46 percent of those interviewed believed that these government officials could not have accumulated their present wealth from their fixed salaries. In other words, unless their ancestors passed tremendous family wealth along to them, or unless they had a wife or an investment advisor who was skilled at investing and managing wealth to help them rake in money every day, these billionaire government officials apparently deserved to be scrutinized by Minister of Justice Ma Ying-chiu [7456 5391 0046], who daily shouts his intention to crack down on grafters. Careful scrutiny of this list of names shows some have lived up to the story of "the sparrow that turned into a phoenix." Who can imagine that an utterly destitute youth who had to go everywhere to collect animal dung for his family use, could, after several decades as a government official, suddenly shake himself and become transformed into someone having a billion New Taiwan dollars in assets. Challenged by the outside world, quite a few government officials frequently "cry foul," saying that their assets have been overestimated. However, for people like Lien Chan and Wu Po-hsiung, who were born with silver spoons in their mouths, whether they are truly worth a billion is not important. Possibly more important is how this great wealth should be handled. Lien Chan, who has such good luck that even the sea gives way before him, and Wu Po-hsiung, whose only remaining constituency is Alishan, but who absolutely will not withdraw from the race for provincial governor, have been termed two immensely wealthy government officials; they are indeed. The wealth of both comes from land, and they also hold substantial bank shares. The difference between them is that Lien Chan's wealth stems not only from his father, Lien Chen-tung's [6647 7201 2639] patrimony, but also from his mother who reportedly was also quite adept at money management. In addition, he married Fang Yu [2455 3768], a well-educated woman from a well-to-do family. As a result of the combination of money and power, he has become known as the most wealthy government official since the removal of the Republic of China to Taiwan. This is no overstatement at all. Just how wealthy is Lien Chan? Leaving aside his large tracts of land and real estate, and just looking at the value and the variety of the jewelry that his wife displays, for which possibly a whole drawer must be set aside, is enough to shame wives of officials who are not wealthy enough to declare their wealth. This is because the jewelry that Fang Yu wears on each occasion costs NT$1 million at minimum. Jewelry that costs less than a seven digit figure is apparently not to her liking. Therefore, people joke that if ever Fang Yu takes it into her head to show off all of her jewelry, she will wear NT$3.5 million worth of yellow gold rings on her hands, diamond earrings worth NT$2 million in her ears, necklaces of the finest jade worth NT$1.2 million around her neck, brooches worth several hundred thousand new Taiwan dollars on her chest, wear a name brand diamond wristwatch and name brand clothing, and carry a name brand purse. She will be like NT$10 million that can move right before your eyes. Given the Lien family's circumstances and Fang Yu's background, the Control Yuan report figures may be somewhat low. Other antiques and works of art are not included in the report. People will find it hard to believe that the Lien family does not have a single calligraphy scroll or antique worth NT$200,000. Furthermore, the Lien family has invested more than HK$170 million in establishing the Yungsheng Investment Corporation, but information about how profitable this has been is also lacking in the report. Although the value of Wu Po-hsiung's real estate holdings is far less, he has savings amounting to more than NT$42 million, a figure that Lien Chan cannot match. Wu Po-hsiung's wife, Tai Mei-yu [2071 5019 3768], does not come from a well-to-do family like Fang Yu. Tai Mei-yu's father was killed in battle in Southeast Asia during the Japanese occupation period; thus, she grew up in the home of Wu Po-hsiung, Wu's father bringing her up. For this reason, when the family land was parceled out, Wu Po-hsiung received one portion more than the other brothers. Wu Po-hsiung comes from a family of medical doctors. In addition to the New Citizens Hospital, which he inherited from his ancestors, he has quite a large amount of other property. When this report on property was made, because of the difficulty in calculations resulting from the different apportionment among the brothers, there was some delay. Although Wu Po-hsiung studied enterprise management, he rarely manages his own finances. He has a special investment advisor to handle his financial affairs. Tai Mei-yu may carry as much as NT$10,000 in her purse, and if she uses it all, she can replenish it each day. Like Lien Chan, Wu Po-hsiung also set up an investment corporation -- the Chih-Te Investment Corporation -- in which he invested NT$140 million to obtain tax relief. Tai Mei-yu's and Fang Yu's jewels are as different as night and day. More precisely put, her most valuable necklace is worth NT$330,000. It does not qualify at all to be listed in a report with Fang Yu's assets. Tai Mei-yu was formerly a teacher. Her professional background, as well as the frugal character of the Hakkas, means that Tai Mei-yu has declared only two necklaces, and the two together are worth only NT$660,000. Rather oddly, Wu Po-hsiung personally reported one red dragon worth NT$200,000. Reportedly, he has kept this red dragon for almost 10 years. Originally, a friend suggested that Wu Po-hsiung by this fish for his home so that he would have fish and water, which would benefit the ambience and the atmosphere [the Chinese word for fish sounds exactly like the word for surplus and is a symbol of prosperity, and water symbolizes renewed wealth]. Thereupon, Wu Po-hsiung personally selected this red dragon. At first, Wu Po-hsiung pondered whether he should declare the red dragon, subsequently deciding that since it was worth more than NT$200,000, he should report it. Wu Po-hsiung has no golf club membership since he plays golf mostly when others invite him. Furthermore, some golf course owners are his friends. Therefore, for him, a golf club membership is not all that necessary. In addition, Wu Po-hsiung and his wife have purchased nearly NT$100 million worth of life insurance, which may be an extraordinary amount for a government official. Next August, Wu Po-hsiung may move to Tahsinshan Village at Hunghsi in Taoyuan to become a neighbor of President Li Teng-hui. The house that Wu Po-hsiung has purchased is only half as large as Li Teng-hui's. His original reason for buying it was that he wanted to maintain roots in Taoyuan while his old home there was being renovated. In addition, the geomantic influences at Tahsi are good, and he has ties there. So he bought a villa there. Today, thanks to the presence of Li Teng-hui, Tahsishan Village at Hunghsi has become an abode of the powerful, and prices have crept up too. Now, ownership of his villa alone makes Li Teng-hui a billionaire president. By comparison with Lien Chan and Wu Po-hsiung, Li Teng-hui has gotten ahead more through hard work. Henceforth, more and more young students will resolve to become president. Li Teng-hui has been in government service for more than 30 years, four years as vice-president and five years as president. He has virtually no inherited wealth, but he has NT$44 million in savings, more than NT$7 million worth of stock, a golf club membership worth more than NT$11 million, and jewels worth NT$1.8 million. This does not include calligraphic scrolls and objects of art that others have presented to him. Maybe it is nothing out of the ordinary to have so much wealth on a president's salary, but the man in the street may change his view somewhat about political personages on this account. An example is Ch'iu Ch'uang-huan whose "sexual escapades" were the talk of the town not long ago. Earlier, he often spoke about his hardships and difficulties as a youth in an utterly destitute family. The public learned, to its surprise, only after publication of his wealth that this Examination Yuan president has savings of NT$12 million, stocks worth NT$15 million, jewelry worth NT$3 million, and five parcels of land. Furthermore, his son, Ch'iu Che-i [6726 2548 3015], and his daughter, Ch'iu P'ei-lin [6726 0160 3829], each have a house with a market value of approximately NT$20 million located at Tishih Garden Square on Anho Road, East. What is more, Ch'iu Ch'uang-huan is paying more than NT$100,000 rent on the house that he is currently occupying. Ch'iu Ch'uang-huan's son, Ch'iu Che-ying [6726 3548 3379], feels that the public overestimates his father's wealth. He cites as an example the land located at Turtle Mountain in Taoyuan. He said that although these two parcels of land are zoned for building, they are too far distant from a highway. Entry is via a road that runs atop a ridge between fields. Furthermore, this place has high winds and is damp; thus, the value of the land is not high. Furthermore, land located along some fields is being used to grow fruit trees and bonsai that actually produce no economic returns. Six or seven years ago, some friends of Ch'iu Ch'uang-huan persuaded him to buy between 500 and 600 ping of land at Turtle Mountain. At first, some members of his family were opposed, and later on when it was found that this land was too much off the beaten track for development, it was decided to sell it in 1993. But there were no takers. The Ch'iu family's financial affairs -- particularly stock purchases -- are the responsibility of Ch'iu Ch'uang-huan's wife, Bai Ling-yu [4101 6875 3768]. Except for the buying of land, Ch'iu Ch'uang-huan seldom asks about any other investments. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ranking of Billionaire Government Officials | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ranking |Official Po-|Name |NT$ Value o-|NT$ Value o-|Total NT$ V-| | |sition | |f Real Esta-|f Movable P-|alue | | | | |te |roperty | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1 |Prime Minis-|Lien Chan |More than 70|More than 1.|1.82 billion| | |ter | |0 million |12 billion | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |2 |Minister of |Wu Po-hsiung|256 million |284 million |540 million | | |Interior | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |3 |Control Yua-|K'o Ming-mou|330 million |21.4 million|More than 35| | |n member | | | |0 million | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |4 |Deputy Chai-|Yeh Chin-fe-|210 million |9 million |219 million | | |rman, Mainl-|ng | | | | | |and Affairs | | | | | | |Council | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |5 |Judicial Yu-|Lin Yang-ka-|170 million |47.3 million|217.3 milli-| | |an president|ng | | |on yuan | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |6 |Minister Wi-|Kuo Yuan-ju-|150 million |22.5 million|172.5 milli-| | |thout Portf-|ng | | |on | | |olio | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |7 |President |Li Teng-hui |80 million |72.4 million|152.4 milli-| | | | | | |on | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |8 |President's |Chiang Yen--|78 million |42.7 million|120.7 milli-| | |Office secr-|shih | | |on | | |etary | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |9 |Control Yua-|Li Shen-i |120 million |570,000 |120.57 mill-| | |n member | | | |ion | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |10 |Judicial Yu-|Li Chih-p'e-|105 million |-800,000 |104.2 milli-| | |an Grand Ju-|ng | | |on | | |stice | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |11 |Minister Wi-|Huang Shih--|104 million |-1.45 milli-|102.55 mill-| | |thout Portf-|cheng | |on |ion | | |olio | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |12 |Director, P-|Ch'in Hsiao-|96 million |6 million |102 million | | |alace Museum|i | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Huang Shih-ch'eng, who is from Changhua, also feels his wealth is overestimated. His wife, Ch'en Chao-o [7115 2507 1230], who is a National Assembly member, said that all their land has been inherited, and that it is located in remote areas that even buses do not reach. One tract she visited only once, and her grandparents are buried on another plot. They are worth hardly anything at all. Before becoming magistrate of Changhua County, Huang Shih-ch'eng was a lawyer. He also ran a trading corporation located on Jenai Road in Taipei. Today, however, he neither practices law nor runs the corporation. He depends entirely on his salary. Chiang Yen-shih's billion still comes mostly from land. He gets more than NT$1 million a year from two houses, one on Anho Road, and the other on Ihsien Road. When another more than NT$24 million in savings, more than NT$2 million in stocks, and more than 1 million in gold bars are added in, to call him the "Diamond Secretary" is no exaggeration. Lin Yang-kang, who has designs on the president's seat, has no less wealth than Li Teng-hui even though he has yet to gain that seat. Although his NT$20 million in savings is only half that of Li, he owns a large tract of land, and he holds NT$5 million worth of bonds. His wife, Ch'en Ho-ping [7115 0678 1629], has more than NT$21 million invested in two corporations. Most curious is Lin Yang-hsiang's and his wife's leasing of 16 hectares of government forest land at Shuili Village in Yuch'ih Township, Nantou County. This matter has raised a lot of eyebrows. The after-the-fact explanation that Lin Yang-hsiang has provided is that he leased this land 40 years ago while still a student at Taiwan University. At that time everyone was very enthusiastic about afforestation, and his father was also an afforestation enthusiast. He positively has not used his position as president of the Judicial Yuan to lease the land. The return from this forest land is difficult to estimate. Maybe the young Lin Yang-hsiang developed the habit of "mountain climbing" because of his frequent inspections of forest land. This habit may be unexpectedly helpful to him in moving up to the office of president. Nevertheless, one thing is certain and that is that should the grasslands Yuan president want to become a grasslands president, he will certainly not have to worry about not having enough money to get elected. Control Yuan member, Li Shen-i, who frequently describes himself as the son of a peasant family in Tainan, was also ranked a millionaire in this communique on wealth, but he said with some pain, "This is really an overestimate!" Li Shen-i, who has been a lawyer for more than 20 years, did not deny his penchant for investing in real estate, but he describes this as land he holds with others. Maybe so, but the land that Li Shen-i holds with others is scattered everywhere. In 1978, he and some friends bought farmland on the Kuantu Plain, himself investing NT$2.5 million to buy 360 ping. In 1984, he and friends bought more than 3,100 ping of grassland located along Hsiukuluan Creek in Yuli Town, Hualien in which he has a one-sixth interest. He also spent NT$1 million for it. In 1990, he and a Rotary Club friend bought 80 chia of mountain land in Juifang, only 5 percent of which is his. He spent NT$2 million for it, but an appraisal company estimates the value of this land to be NT$200 million. In this connection, not only did Li Shen-i write a letter demanding a retraction from the media, but he also countered with the question as to who would be willing to buy the land were it to sell for 20 million? Subsequently, he also joked with reporters asking, "Would you buy it for 5 million?" Li Shen-i said that the land he bought is not suitable for building houses. As for the 300 ping of land for which he paid NT$210 million to the "Academic Community Preparatory Committee of the Central Research Academy," so far he has done nothing with it. In addition, Li Shen-i bought a membership in the Tonghua Golf Club. He explained that he bought it only because he had helped the club solve some legal problems in return for which the club permitted him to buy the membership in installments. His membership has a value of NT$2.5 million. As for the four dwellings bought in Li Shen-i's name, namely the ones he received following the renovation with friends of a 13-story building on 30 ping of land that his family had earlier purchased on Hoping Road East opposite the Science and Technology Building, one is his residence. The three others have been rented out, the proceeds providing retirement income for his father. However, in 1977, Li Shen-i bought more than 50 ping of land at the low price of several thousand New Taiwan dollars a ping in what is now the Hsini Planning Zone. This showed uncanny foresight. In 1993, he began selling off this land in order to clear up some personal debts, and to pay for his daughter's education expenses abroad. However, his asking price is NT$700,000 a ping, so because of the present depressed economic conditions, there have been no takers. This has irritated him somewhat. Li Shen-i said that estimates that he is worth NT$300 million are really far off the mark, but NT$100 million is a completely reasonable estimate. Minister Without Portfolio Kuo Yuan-jung's land holdings are also very substantial. However, Kuo Yuan-jung explains that her land in Taichung City was inherited, and that the land she owns in Neihu and Tamsui was bought during the 1960's. Originally, houses could be built on that land, but later it was zoned a protected forest area on which construction is prohibited. It is not worth very much money now. However, Kuo Yuan-jung and her husband, Ni Wen-ya [0242 2429 0068], have more than NT$20 million in savings and short term securities. Their appearance on the Control Yuan's list attracted particular attention. Kuo Yuan-jung said that inasmuch as she has always worked in a government agency, her financial management method is fairly "simple and clear." People from Taichung say that the land that Kuo Yuan-jung holds in the Liming section of Taichung is located in the seventh rezoned area and close to the center of the city. It is worth no small amount of money. Therefore, it is no surprise that Kuo Yuan-jung is listed as a billionaire level government official. Not only did Kuo Yuan-jung buy some mountain land, but Grand Judge Li Chih-p'eng also purchased between five and six chia of mountain land in Wanli Township 15 years ago. At that time, the price was a little more than NT$200,000 per chia. Li Chih-p'eng says that he bought that piece of land purely with retirement in mind, but the trees growing on that land today are between two and three stories high. The land was not bought with the idea of building houses on it. Commenting on being listed in the billionaire class, Li Chih-p'eng explained that houses like the one he is living in today at Neihu were bought for NT$500,000 20-odd years ago, but now the market price has risen to more than NT$20 million. "It's not my doing!" Palace Museum Director Ch'in Hsiao-i's declaration of calligraphic scrolls and antiques worth nearly NT$5 million also attracted some attention. However, his large free-standing home located in Lane 136 in Section 1 of Chihshan Road is also estimated to be worth more than NT$100 million. In order for him to be able to bury his head all day long in the study of historical relics, Ch'in Hsiao-i has been cloaked in a golden robe. Giving "a private matter" as a reason, he is unwilling to discuss this. However, members of the Ch'in family said that this is too preposterous. They have lived in this house for more than 20 years. How can a more than 20 year old house be worth NT$100 million? People in the market say, however, that Chihshan Road is a red hot section of the city today. The land for the tall building built opposite the Palace Museum cost nearly NT$500,000 a ping some time ago. An asking price of NT$100 million for the 160 ping of land and the buildings on which Ch'in Hsiao-i's house sits would not be an exaggeration. However, the Ch'in family notes that this house is only theirs to live in; they cannot sell it. Thus, it is really not very fair to say that they are billionaires. K'o Ming-mou, a member of the Control Yuan who is one of the champions whose assets have been published by the Control Yuan, was not listed in the Control Yuan's previous glittering listing. Today things are different. Of the 29 members of the Control Yuan, probably only Lin Meng-kui [2651 1322 6311] and Hsieh K'un-shan [6200 1507 1472] are richer than he. Current reporting on K'o Ming-mou and his wife shows more than 59 parcels of land alone, and all are located in either Changhua or Taichung cities. The K'o family's businesses -- Yusan Engineering and Yuisheng Construction Company -- also operate in these two areas. The land area that K'o Ming-mu has declared is also small, and his holdings are not great. Only three houses are under his name, but many people in Changhua believe K'o Ming-mou owns more houses than this. Nevertheless, a leader of Changhua's white faction, K'o Ming-mou has always adopted a political posture of being more interested in politics than business. His coterie and his money interests in Changhua have always been substantial, so it is no wonder that Li Teng-hui has called upon him repeatedly to run for county magistrate there. Furthermore, the election of Kuomintang candidates also depends on the degree to which they obtain K'o Ming-mou's endorsement. The present estimate of his assets at between NT$300 million and NT$400 million only includes the assets held in his name. The resources at K'o Ming-mou's command are surely greater than this. Finally, a person that must be specially introduced is the richest woman government official today, Yeh Chin-feng, the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission for Recovery of the Mainland who has been highly touted for election as the next secretary of the Haichi Hui [3189 1015 2585]. Yeh Chin-feng said that the reason she and her medical doctor husband have so much land is that virtually all of it was inherited by her husband, Lin Yao-tung [2651 5069 2639]. For example, the land in Fuhsing Township in Changhua County is all farmland that has not yet been divided up for inheritance, so she herself does not know where the land is located. Yeh Chin-feng also said that their four houses in Changhua City are dilapidated houses made of earth or galvanized sheet steel. The only building they have that is worth any money is the hospital on Minsheng Road that covers an area of nearly 400 ping, and this land was also purchased 20 years ago for about NT$10,000 yuan a ping. She also said that since her husband is very conservative about money management, the money he has is invested in houses and real estate. The two 30 ping of land houses they own in Taichung are located in the suburbs and not worth much money. Moreover, since she works in Taipei, she purchased a small house on 10 ping of land on Hsini Road, which is purely for convenience. Nevertheless, Yeh Chin-feng also admits that although most of the houses under their name are not worth much money, if they are renovated, they will be worth quite a bit. As for the estimate of her personal wealth at NT$200 million, she said, "How can you compare the price of land in Changhua with Taipei." Since Yeh Chin-feng actually did marry a medical doctor who has money and can buy property, becoming rich through her husband, a personal wealth of more than NT$100 million for Yeh Chin-feng is no exaggeration. It is just that her husband earned it. She herself is just a daughter who was married off, whose sole income is her salary. [passage omitted]
