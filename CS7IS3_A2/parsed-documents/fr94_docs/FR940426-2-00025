FR940426-2-00025 FR940426-2-00015 Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy [Case No. F&hyph;066] Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products: Decision and Order Granting a Waiver From the Furnace Test Procedure to Goodman Manufacturing Company AGENCY: Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Department of Energy. ACTION: Decision and order. SUMMARY: Notice is given of the Decision and Order (Case No. F&hyph;066) granting a Waiver to Goodman Manufacturing Company (Goodman) from the existing Department of Energy (DOE) test procedure for furnaces. The Department is granting Goodman's Petition for Waiver regarding blower time delay in calculation of Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency (AFUE) for its GMPV series central furnaces. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Cyrus H. Nasseri, U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Mail Station EE&hyph;431, Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585, (202) 586&hyph;7140. Eugene Margolis, Esq., U.S. Department of Energy, Office of General Counsel, Mail Station GC&hyph;72, Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585, (202) 586&hyph;9507. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In accordance with 10 CFR 430.27(g), notice is hereby given of the issuance of the Decision and Order as set out below. In the Decision and Order, Goodman has been granted a Waiver for its GMPV series central furnaces, permitting the company to use an alternate test method in determining AFUE. Issued in Washington, DC, April 1, 1994. Frank M. Stewart, Jr., Acting Chief of Staff, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. In the Matter of: Goodman Manufacturing Company. (Case No. F&hyph;066) Background The Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products (other than automobiles) was established pursuant to the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), Public Law 94&hyph;163, 89 Stat. 917, as amended by the National Energy Conservation Policy Act (NECPA), Public Law 95&hyph;619, 92 Stat. 3266, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act of 1987 (NAECA), Public Law 100&hyph;12, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendments of 1988 (NAECA 1988), Public Law 100&hyph;357, and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct), Public Law 102&hyph;486, 106 Stat. 2776, which requires DOE to prescribe standardized test procedures to measure the energy consumption of certain consumer products, including furnaces. The intent of the test procedures is to provide a comparable measure of energy consumption that will assist consumers in making purchasing decisions. These test procedures appear at 10 CFR Part 430, Subpart B. The Department amended the prescribed test procedures by adding 10 CFR 430.27 to create a waiver process. 45 FR 64108, September 26, 1980. Thereafter, DOE further amended its appliance test procedure waiver process to allow the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (Assistant Secretary) to grant an Interim Waiver from test procedure requirements to manufacturers that have petitioned DOE for a waiver of such prescribed test procedures. 51 FR 42823, November 26, 1986. The waiver process allows the Assistant Secretary to waive temporarily test procedures for a particular basic model when a petitioner shows that the basic model contains one or more design characteristics which prevent testing according to the prescribed test procedures or when the prescribed test procedures may evaluate the basic model in a manner so unrepresentative of its true energy consumption as to provide materially inaccurate comparative data. Waivers generally remain in effect until final test procedure amendments become effective, resolving the problem that is the subject of the waiver. The Interim Waiver provisions added by the 1986 amendment allow the Assistant Secretary to grant an Interim Waiver when it is determined that the applicant will experience economic hardship if the Application for Interim Waiver is denied, if it appears likely that the Petition for Waiver will be granted, and/or the Assistant Secretary determines that it would be desirable for public policy reasons to grant immediate relief pending a determination on the Petition for Waiver. An Interim Waiver remains in effect for a period of 180 days or until DOE issues its determination on the Petition for Waiver, whichever is sooner, and may be extended for an additional 180 days, if necessary.
