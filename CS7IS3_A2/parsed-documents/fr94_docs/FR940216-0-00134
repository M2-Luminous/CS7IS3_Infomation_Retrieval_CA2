FR940216-0-00134 FR940216-0-00010 2. Required Individual Baselines_Domestic Refiners EPA's final rule provides for a scheme to establish refinery baselines for domestic refiners that avoids giving parties options, and within this no-option constraint, that uses the best available data in setting baselines. As a general approach, parties are required to establish individual baselines using actual 1990 data (Method 1). However, EPA does not anticipate that many domestic refiners will have all the data necessary to establish an individual baseline based entirely on actual 1990 data. Therefore, where the actual 1990 data is not available, the baseline provisions provide for the modelling of 1990 parameters (Methods 2 and 3). These models are based on the absence of ``first choice'' 1990 data, and require that the affected party provide the ``next best'' data available from production subsequent to 1990 to establish a modelled accurate baseline. Domestic refiners are not permitted an option to revert to the use of Methods 2 and 3. Rather, refiners are required to use Method 1 if actual 1990 data is available. If the Method 1 data are not available, refiners are required to use Method 2, and if Method 2 data are not available, refiners are required to use Method 3. Domestic refiners are not permitted an option to use the statutory baseline. Domestic refiners are required to use independent commercial auditors to certify the accuracy and the availability (or non-availability) of data for any of the baseline setting methods, and to assure the proper application of those methods. This scheme does not give domestic refiners any choice in the manner in which baselines are set, thus avoiding the potential for ``gaming'' by individual refiners. Moreover, EPA is easily able to conduct enforcement audits of the baseline submissions of domestic refiners. In consequence, EPA believes that this scheme will result in the establishment of an accurate representation of the actual U.S. 1990 baseline gasoline fuel properties from domestic refiners. This baseline setting scheme is discussed in detail in Section VIII of this preamble. 3. Baselines_Importers of Foreign Gasoline The final rule provides that importers of gasoline must establish an individual baseline using actual 1990 gasoline characteristics (Method 1). Where actual 1990 data are not available, however, an approach that is different than the approach used for domestic refiners is necessary. In the absence of actual 1990 data, an importer is required to use the anti-dumping statutory baseline. Importers are not permitted to use Methods 2 or 3 because often it is simply not technically feasible to model an importer's 1990 baseline from gasoline imported during the years subsequent to 1990, for the following reasons. The foreign sources and production processes underlying an importer's post-1990 gasoline will have changed for most importers from those sources and processes underlying the importer's 1990 product. The model Methods are not designed to factor in such changes. In addition, it is exceedingly difficult to establish the refinery-of-origin of discrete products, due in part to the fact that foreign gasoline from different foreign refineries often is subject to fungible mixing prior to arrival at the U.S. 67 Accordingly, both the importers and EPA would be unable to verify the accuracy or reliability of an importer's modelled baseline. 67 In discussions with representatives of the U.S. Customs Service, EPA has been informed that the Customs Service has found it is virtually impossible to trace a batch of gasoline from point of entry in the U.S. back to the country of origin. Country of origin for gasoline is relevant for Customs purposes because import tariffs on gasoline differ depending on whether the country of origin has most-favored-nation trade status. To the extent the Customs Service is unable to verify even the country of origin of gasoline, the refinery of origin would be even more difficult to verify. As a result of the technical infeasibility of the application of Methods 2 and 3 to importers (change of gasoline source-refiners between 1990 and later years, and inability to track refinery-of-origin generally), and lack of adequate enforcement, all importers that are unable to produce actual 1990 production values are required to revert to the anti-dumping statutory baseline. In addition, EPA anticipates that most importers lack the actual 1990 testing data necessary for establishing a baseline using Method 1. As a result, EPA expects most importers will be assigned the anti-dumping statutory baseline. EPA considered giving foreign refiners, as opposed to importers, the option of either setting individual baselines using Methods 1, 2, and 3, or of being assigned the anti-dumping statutory baseline. This approach is flawed, however, because of the gaming opportunity it would give foreign refiners. As discussed above, such a gaming opportunity would result in an overall quality of gasoline in 1995 and thereafter that would fail to achieve the environmental goals intended for reformulated and conventional gasoline. A foreign refiner with an actual baseline dirtier than the statutory baseline would prefer to continue to produce to that baseline. However, a foreign refiner with an actual baseline cleaner than the statutory baseline would prefer to produce to the less stringent statutory baseline. Accordingly, the incentives to game the program would result in the average quality of gasoline imported to the U.S. being skewed to produce dirtier gasoline than the statutory baseline. Foreign refiners would collectively exceed the U.S. average gasoline parameters, resulting in dirtier U.S. air.
