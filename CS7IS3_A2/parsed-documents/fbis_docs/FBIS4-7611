This is the seventh day of the spring offensive by the so-called Bosnia-Herzegovina army aimed at reestablishing the green transversal from Sarajevo via Gorazde to Sandzak. The fiercest battles are being waged in the area of Potkozarje and Oglecevo. Serb military sources claim that the Muslims have given up attacking toward Cajnice via Gradine and Trebesevo because they suffered huge losses in that area over the past few days. The command of the Herzegovina Corps said that there were no casualties among Serb fighters in the past 24 hours.
