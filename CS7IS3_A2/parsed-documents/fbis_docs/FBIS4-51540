The sources in the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] said the 13-chapter policy drafted by China's State Planning Commission bars foreign automakers from producing vehicles with components shipped from their plants outside China. The sources said the draft aims to develop economical passenger car models designed for use by the public, signaling a departure from its past policy of emphasizing the development of vehicles for office use. In order to promote the development of the domestic automobile industry, emphasis will be laid on fostering parts manufacturers, they said. Along this policy line, the sources said, the draft policy calls for foreign automakers operating in the country to maintain the local content ratio or the ratio of locally procured parts used in the vehicle at 40-50 percent in the initial stage. The complete knockdown formula (CKD) to assemble vehicles with most components and parts brought in from outside the country will be banned, the sources said. They said the policy paves the way for Japanese automakers to produce vehicles in China through joint ventures with Chinese partners holding a controlling equity of over 50 percent. In view of the local content regulation, the Chinese auto market will be open only to foreign automakers engaging in auto parts production in advance, the sources said. China is regarded as a potentially huge market for auto makers, with domestic demand exceeding 15 million units in the year 2000. Under the existing principle, Japanese automakers now produce only minivehicles and small-sized cars in China while U.S. and European rivals engage in producing larger vehicles. Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's top automaker, which is interested in producing cars in China will be required to launch a joint part manufacturing venture before making full entry into the Chinese market, the sources said.
