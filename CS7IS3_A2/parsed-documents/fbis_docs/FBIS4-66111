Answering journalists' questions, Christopher said that the U.S. will follow with interest the democratic process in Italy. He stressed Italy's "great role" in Europe, saying that he would be talking with the new Italian foreign minister about Bosnia, trade issues, and the Group of Seven summit in Naples in July. Asked what he was going to say to Christopher, Martino replied: "The most important thing is reaffirming that the general lines of our Atlantic policy will be marked by great continuity with the past. We aspire to continue to be a faithful and essential ally of American foreign policy." Asked what he would like to hear in reply, he said: "The recognition that this relationship will certainly continue in the way both sides want." Earlier, the G-7 summit was also a key talking-point at Martino's meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, who said Italy now had the stability needed to continue on the road to financial and economic recovery. U.S. sources said Bentsen expressed appreciation, in particular, for last summer's inflation-pegging cost-of-labour accord, and said there was great U.S. investment interest in Italy, as shown by the recent takeover of ENI's [National Hydrocarbons Corporation] Nuovo Pignone. Martino illustrated the government's tax-cutting and job-creating plans, including the projected lowering of the top rate to 33 percent. Bentsen noted that the U.S. top bracket is 39.6 percent, saying that "in the past it had gone a lot lower, but that caused some public debt problems." One of Bentsen's advisors pointed to the uniformity of wages between north and south Italy, and Martino agreed that on this and other labour market flexibilty issues, Europe had much to learn from the United States. (An earlier meeting with the American Jewish Conference was described as "very positive" by its president, Lester Pollack, who added that "we have opened a dialogue that will continue in the U.S. and Italy." "This is the most pro-Israeli Italian government in the last 20 years," he said.) "The door is still open" for Italy's request to be included in the contact group on Bosnia (U.S., Russia, France, Britain and the EU [European Union] troika), Martino said after the meeting -- although Christopher pointed to "coordination difficulties" in enlarging the group. As for Italy's other key request to get a greater say in decisions that affect her, a place on the UN Security Council, Martino said he had received a pledge that this would be examined within the ambit of UN reform. He recognised that any decision here "will not be quick in coming" given the timeframe of the projected reform. Martino said he had reiterated the "unacceptable" nature of Italy being excluded from decisions directly affecting it: especially its exclusion from the Bosnian contact group. To Christopher's objection of "coordination difficulties," he replied by stressing the importance of Italian air bases in providing logistical support for missions. Martino stressed that the talking on this issue had only just begun. On UN reform, the two men examined an Italian proposal for appointing rotating members alongside the five permanent members of the Security Council, and a counter-proposal for 10 permanent members, today's five plus Germany, Japan, and three other members taken from Africa, Asia and Latin America. "A solution of this kind, leaving Italy out, would be unacceptable for us," said Martino. But the road to UN reform will be a long one, both men recognise, leaving time to assign new roles for countries like Italy which are among the major contributors to aid operations. Bosnia and the UN -- two points on which Christopher was not slow to praise Italy -- were not the only issues discussed in the talks, which lasted about an hour. Other points examined were U.S. President Bill Clinton's coming visit to Italy, the G-7 in Naples in July, and Italy's strategic role alongside the Balkans and at the crossroads of the Arab-Western world. Martino described his earlier meeting with the Conference of America's 15 largest Jewish communities as "extraordinarily important". He said he had reiterated Italy's traditional friendship with Israel and its support for the Arab-Israeli peace process. "There were no questions on the presence of ministers from National Alliance in the government," he said in reference to the rightist section of the Berlusconi government. "No one during my stay here asked me any questions on the so- called Berlusconi issue, that is the possibility of conflicts of interest between Berlusconi the premier and Berlusconi the businessman," said Martino in reply to a later question. But he added that the question had been raised "indirectly" by an editorialist at THE WASHINGTON POST, where he had a foreign policy interview this morning. On that occasion, he said, "I replied that if an entrepreneur wanted to use politics for his private business ends, he would not become the protagonist of the political scene, since as premier he would draw the attention of public opinion, the opposition, the press, the magistrature, and the head of state". Asked to comment on Left Democrat No.2 Massimo D'Alema's image of him having to tour foreign capitals, cap in hand, to reassure Italy's partners about an administration containing ministers with a neo-fascist past, Martino replied: "Going round with one's cap in one's hand means asking for money. That is not the case, and I don't know how to do it. If D'Alema means I was keen to get in touch with our international interlocutors, that is true. But I believe it is the first duty of a foreign minister". Asked if Bentsen had shown any concern over Italy's ability to put the economy and public accounts back on their feet, Martino said that "I am more worried on that score, to be frank... It's about time people were told that what has been said about the last two governments undertaking vigorous corrective measures is not true". Before leaving for Rome in the early afternoon Washington time, Martino also had talks with National Security Advisor Antony Lake.
