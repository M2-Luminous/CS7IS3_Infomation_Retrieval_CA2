FBIS4-12341 "drnes068dd_94010" FBIS-NES-94-068 Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 Palestinian Affairs Abu-Sharif on U.S. Actions, `Extremist' Groups Abu-Sharif on U.S. Actions, `Extremist' Groups JN0804101394 Amman SAWT AL-SHA'B in Arabic 8 Apr 94 pp 16, 20 JN0804101394 Amman SAWT AL-SHA'B Arabic BFN [Report by Riyad Mansur] [Text] The PLO has called on the U.S. Administration and the French Government to accurately monitor and control the Jewish extremist groups in these two countries. The PLO has also strongly rejected calls by Israeli Police Affairs Minister Moshe Shahal and the so-called Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert not to allow Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat to pray at the al-Aqsa Mosque. It said such calls are like throwing sand in ones eyes. Bassam Abu-Sharif, political adviser to the Palestinian president, stressed to SAWT AL-SHA'B that the Jewish groups in the United States and France maintain dangerous links with the extremist groups in Israel. This, he said, poses a serious threat to the entire peace process. Although Abu-Sharif spoke about the Jewish extremists' threats, he also hinted at the threats posed by the extremist Palestinian groups which receive support from states opposing the peace process, and which, openly, seek to foil and obstruct the current political process. In the first Palestinian reaction to calls by some Israelis not to allow 'Arafat to enter al-Aqsa Mosque, the Palestinian president's political adviser said: Entering Jerusalem and the holy places is a right of every Palestinian. He pointed out that no one can deprive them of this right. He noted that President 'Arafat and the group which will accompany him to the liberated lands will perform their religious duties in the holy places. He said that the occupation authorities have no right to prevent any Palestinian from performing his religious duties until the final status of Jerusalem is decided. He said that this issue should be guaranteed and safeguarded because Jerusalem is the city of the three religions and cannot be Judaized. He said that its nature and heritage must be maintained. Abu-Sharif expected that matters will go in two directions; the first toward entrenching the bases of a comprehensive peace, and the second will be embodied by the extremist groups attempts to foil, obstruct, and delay the peace process. He called for reaching an understanding on merging some of the clauses of the interim period and the final status stage. He said that entrenching the peace process requires the Palestinian and Israeli sides to work quickly to defuse any chance of explosion. He said that any such chance is based in the actions by the extremist Palestinians and Jews. He stressed that past dreams are over and that a new era has started. The Palestinian president's adviser pointed out that Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, who enjoys farsighted strategic views, knows what he means, and that Yitzhaq Rabin, as a prime minister and defense minister, who also has a lot of experience, knows what he means. He stressed that the events that have taken place have bypassed the Oslo agreement, and so, the Israeli Government should seriously think about synchronizing the settlers' withdrawal with the withdrawal of its military forces, or, otherwise, the settlers will turn into a party which will not only attack the Palestinians, but the Israelis as well. Abu-Sharif reiterated his call for setting up a Jordanian-Syrian-Lebanese-Palestinian operations room, whose task is to daily follow the peace negotiations affairs. He emphasized that a true and effective Arab coordination can attain Arab rights and foil Israel's attempts to deal separately with each Arab side.
