The drafting committee, which comprised, on the Palestinian side, president 'Arafat's political adviser Nabil Sha'th and Brigadier General 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Yahya and, on the Israeli side, 'Uzi Dayan, deputy director of the Defense Ministry's planning administration, and Yo'el Singer, legal adviser at the Foreign Ministry, held a meeting last night, which continued until dawn today. This meeting followed a three-hour private meeting between the head of the Palestinian delegation, Nabil Sha'th, and the head of the Israeli delegation, General Amnon Shahaq. Sources close to the negotiators told MENA that the Palestinian leadership will meet in Tunis later today to examine the new draft agreement on security measures and international protection in Hebron and to inform the two delegations of its view of the agreement. Afterward, the two delegations will hold an extensive meeting to discuss the details of the agreement. The same sources said the worsening situation in the occupied territories and the outbreak of clashes in which over 66 people were killed and wounded dominated the atmosphere of the negotiations, which was tense at first and relaxed gradually as the negotiators began to discuss substantial issues. The sources added that the Israeli side proposed the presence of 100 Palestinian policemen in Hebron and 70 international observers armed with light weapons and able to move freely. The sources said that if the wording of the agreement on security measures in Hebron is completed today, the negotiators will turn immediately, as of tomorrow, Thursday, to the discussion of issues concerning the Gaza-Jericho Accord. Discussion was suspended following the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron on 25 February. The agency has learned that intense international contacts took place with the Palestinian leadership in Tunis all day yesterday to make the Palestinian leadership give its delegation in Cairo the green light to restart negotiations on security measures and international protection in Hebron after the killing of six members of the Fatah Hawks in Gaza two days ago by a special unit from the Israeli Army and the death of a Palestinian woman and a man who were on the scene. The agency also learned that Israel agreed to vanguards of the Palestinian police force entering Gaza and Jericho directly following the resumption of the negotiations concerning Palestinian self-rule in these two areas.
