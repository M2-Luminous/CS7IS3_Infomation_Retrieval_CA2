Soviet foreign passports of foreigners living in Estonia on the basis of residence permits or as settlers who moved to the country before July 1, 1990 are registered in local bureaus of the citizenship department. A stamp of the department as well as an official stamp are put on the first page of the passport which is also signed by a bureau official. A registered passport remains valid until July 12, 1995 or the end of the residence permit. The Interior Ministry has advised persons planning foreign travels to take along their Soviet internal passports.
