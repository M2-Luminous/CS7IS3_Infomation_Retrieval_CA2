FR940606-1-00071 FR940606-1-00012 32. Section 154.1718 would be added to require that cargo spaces with submerged electric cargo pumps be inerted when any of the sever high vapor pressure cargoes are carried. This is required by the amended Gas Carrier Code. 33. Section 154.1720 would be updated to include the new cargoes for which indirect refrigeration is required. This is based on amendments to the Gas Carrier Code. 34. Sections 154.1721 through 154.1724 would be added to include requirements for separate piping systems for toxic products, flame screens on vent outlets, cargo tank quantity limitations, and vapor return connections. These requirements are based on the amended Gas Carrier Code. 35. Section 154.1745 would be revised to include all of the requirements from 46 CFR part 40 for vinyl chloride transfer operations. Existing §154.1745 references part 40, but there is no reason to have part 40's requirements contained in a separate part. As part 50 addresses only vinyl chloride, this proposal would remove all of part 40 and transfer its requirements to part 154. 36. Section 154.1760 would be revised to address the problem of stress corrosion cracking as it is addressed in the Gas Carrier Code. 37. Section 154.1765 would be added to set forth the requirements for the carriage of diethyl ether and vinyl ethyl ether in accordance with the amended Gas Carrier Code. 38. New §§154.1770 and 154.1775 would be added to set forth the requirements for the carriage of propylene oxide and mixtures of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide which contain no more than 30% ethylene oxide by weight. These requirements are consistent with the amended Gas Carrier Code. 39. Section 154.1818 would be revised to add new products to the list of products which may be carried if the shipper certifies that they are inhibited. This revision is in accordance with the amended Gas Carrier Code. 40. Section 154.1831 would be revised to list the qualifications of the person in charge of cargo transfer operations. Section 155.710 of 33 CFR, as referenced in proposed paragraph (a), was amended by a separate Coast Guard rulemaking (CGD 86&hyph;034; ``Hazardous Materials Pollution Prevention'') applying §155.710 to hazardous materials transfers as well as to oil transfers. 41. Section 154.1832 would be added to clarify the necessary separation of cargo containment systems for incompatible cargoes. This section is being proposed to ensure that incompatible cargoes are not allowed to come in contact with each other on the vessel. 42. Section 154.1834 would be revised to clarify the responsibilities of the person in charge of cargo transfer operations to ensure that the proper piping is used and to ensure that cargo vapors are properly handled. 43. Section 154.1850 would be revised to focus attention on the special problems caused by the gas absorbing qualities of internal insulation materials. This is in accordance with the amended Gas Carrier Code. 44. Section 154.1870 would be revised to update the list of cargoes which are prohibited from being transferred via bow or stern loading piping. This revision is based on the amendments to the Gas Carrier Code. 45. Section 154.7 and the table 4 following existing §154.1872 would be revised to include the minimum requirements for the new cargoes added in accordance with the amended Gas Carrier Code and to update existing requirements and references.
