Take notice that on October 27, 1994, Southern Natural Gas Company (Southern) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Seventh Revised Volume No. 1, the following tariff sheets to be effective November 1, 1994: Third Revised Sheet No. 136 Third Revised Sheet No. 138 Second Revised Sheet No. 212c First Revised Sheet No. 212d In compliance with the Commission's order issued in this proceeding on September 29, 1994, Southern has revised its new procedures regarding eligible deliveries for industrial customers behind Small Shipper delivery points and has reinstated its previous procedure of reallocating IT volumes to a Small Shipper's one-part, firm transportation agreement on days when it is not fully utilized. These revisions reflect that Small Shippers must use their one-part, firm transportation agreements prior to using any IT or capacity release services. Southern has requested all waivers necessary to make these sheets effective November 1, 1994. Southern states that copies of the filing will be served upon its shippers and interested state commissions. Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rule 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211). All such protests should be filed on or before November 7, 1994. Protests will not be considered by the Commission in determining the parties to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
