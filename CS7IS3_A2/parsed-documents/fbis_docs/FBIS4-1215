But ANC leaders remain confident of getting more than 60 percent of the national vote. The National Party [NP], which saw its share of the potential vote improving from a low of 13 percent to above 20 percent by the beginning of March, now has to fend off challenges from both the Freedom Front and Inkatha. Before the IFP entered the elections, many Inkatha supporters who planned to vote said they would back the NP. Now President F.W. de Klerk is desperately trying to prevent them reverting to the IFP -- which explains his blistering attack on IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi in Durban this week. He said Chief Buthelezi was fickle, intolerant, indecisive and two-faced. Chief Buthelezi's major problem will be getting the bulk of his supporters to the polls. Few of them have had access to voter education programmes and many do not have identify documents. But if he is successful the IFP stands a good chance of getting more than five percent of the vote. This will qualify if for seats in the cabinet although Chief Buthelezi says Inkatha will not accept any posts. Any success General Constand Viljoen's Freedom Front achieves at the polls will be at the expense of the NP. But the front is likely to struggle to reach General Viljoen's target of a million votes. The DP [Democratic Party] will also struggle to get sufficient votes to qualify for cabinet posts. Provincial Elections: Western Cape Before the ban on public opinion polls, the National Party had pulled ahead of the ANC but was short of the 50 percent of votes needed to ensure Hernus Kriel is elected provincial premier. The Democratic Party will need to get 10 percent of all the votes cast in province to qualify for a cabinet seat. The SUNDAY TIMES poll conducted in March showed the DP had just over 10 percent of potential voters. If the NP falls short of 50 percent the DP could determine the choice of the Western Cape premier. PWV [Pretoria Witwatersrand Vereeniging] The ANC looks set to win more than 50 percent of the votes in the province, ensuring tha Tokyo Sexwale will be elected premier. But the NP maintains the ANC will fall short of 50 percent. Its Transvaal leader Pik Botha spoke this week of forming alliances with other parties to elect a non ANC member as provincial premier. A key question is whether the DP will qualify for cabinet membership as the SUNDAY TIMES poll showed it had the backing of just under 10 percent of potential voters. KwaZulu/Natal The late entry of the IFP has thrown this contest wide open. The ANC is still likely to get the most votes, but the IFP could run a close second if it is able to rally its supporters to the polls in the short time available. The IFP could also benefit from the backing of those who plan to vote for the NP or DP nationally. It is likely that no party will get more than 50 percent of the vote in the province and there will have to be horse-trading to decide on the premier. Northern Cape Little is known about voting trends in the country's least populated province. But given the large number of coloured voters in the province and the predominant support for the NP in this community, the Nats must be regarded as favourities to win control of the province.
