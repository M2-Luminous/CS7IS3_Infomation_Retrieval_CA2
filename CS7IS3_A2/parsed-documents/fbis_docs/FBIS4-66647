It also aims at spreading fair, objective dialogue without charges and countercharges on the subject of democracy and pluralism in the period of transition from the age of revolution to the age of statehood. The reader will note divergent ideas and visions of the future in the participants' interviews and testimonies regarding the timing of reform, its needs and possibilities, and who exactly can bear the burden of advocating and undertaking the mission. First Interview: Introduction Many on the Palestinian scene support demands for reform. They see a need to end impromptu one-man action, build institutions, and put the right man in the right place. But they divide over timing. Some think that intensifying pressure on the Palestinian leadership at this time will weaken its negotiating ability, particularly as it is exposed to formidable pressures from Arab and international parties that for their part are exploiting the reformers' demands and the embarrassed position of the Palestinian leadership in order to demand concessions from it. Others think that this is the very time to build strong foundations for the coming national entity. They believe that by acceding to demands for reform, the leadership will strengthen its negotiating position and increase its immunity to Arab and international pressures. They say that the question of timing--that others might take advantage of public criticism leveled at misguided policies--has remained a sword waved over our heads for nearly a quarter of a century; yet our enemies hang out their laundry, talk to each other bluntly, make the necessary revisions, and emerge stronger. [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] To which of the two points of view do you incline, and why? Ridwan Abu-'Ayyash [Abu-'Ayyash] To begin, one must stress that the question of democratic dialogue within the one Palestinian household--to restructure and deepen it and build its institutions--is a vital demand for which the PLO has continued to work from its first inception and for which it has continued to fight to the present day. Certainly the issue now on the table is the continuation of a previous course. It is an assured necessity. No one disagrees about it who believes that the institutions of the revolution should be converted into state institutions as a structure that can shoulder the burdens of organizing the entire Palestinian people, establishing its sovereignty, and arranging its institutional authorities. When we talk about democracy or dialogue and about spreading an atmosphere of discussing these subjects among the ranks of the Palestinian people, I believe we all as a people bear full responsibility for such a structure. In other words, the prevalence of a spirit of initiative, organizing institutions, and strengthening the dynamic of their operation on a basis of description, classification, and institution building are matters that the people can undertake. Timing must be taken into account, just as one must make certain that the method and means are salutary: for using a effective, efficient mechanism at a suitable time that fits the goal will surely lead to good positive results. Spreading dialogue among the ranks of the people is a matter that rests on leaders' shoulders and falls under the category of indoctrination, direction, and good mobilization. When we talk about timing, I think the question is not when democracy and constructive, serious dialogue shall begin; neither is it when we shall or shall not approve it. Timing means choosing the best moment and time to make it succeed and to concentrate on it with the leadership. At the same time it must be built basically among the community's classes, institutions, and sections; for the leadership essentially is part of the people. When rules for the structure are produced and approved as a result of constructive dialogue, disagreements will be removed. The dimensions of disagreement will shrink, and the leadership's participation in the building process will become fruitful and fulfill its purpose. To further clarify the subject of the timing of the reform process, we say that democratic reform is not contingent on any particular time; however, before talking about it, one must define its meaning, goal, and means. These concepts must be brought to the grass roots so that they can interact, crystallize, and be framed, and so that consciousness of them can be spread. The soil in which the concepts grow thus will be made fertile. In any case, the concepts are a collective responsibility, not one limited to individuals. Therefore the question about reform and its timing should begin with another question: Has this subject been taken to the broadest ranks of the people? Who is doing so? Have we been able to bring the question to public notice and order its priorities, so that we can move from the base to the leadership? I want to stress now that we are not subject to a definite time in establishing and rooting democratic methods among the ranks of our people, who have fought and still are fighting for their realization. Salih Qallab [Qallab] Reform is something required in every regime and revolution. After each stage, one must turn a new page. One must look at the previous stage's mistakes, to correct them and reform its corruption, if there was any. As for what is being tried now--that is, raising the subject of carrying out democratic reform in the PLO and its organizations--the matter has been raised on the basis of the petition that was presented to Yasir 'Arafat. I do not think this memorandum will lead to any results, because the persons who prepared it were not qualified. For the most part they are members of the very PLO groups that have to be reformed or are cadres of the PLO itself. Those who presented the memorandum may have had a variety of motives. It may have been an unfortunate imitation of the Wafd Party in Egypt. If the intention was to form a political party that would prepare itself for a role in the coming Palestinian authority, I think this road will not lead to what is desirable. Many observations can be made about the performance of the Palestinian leadership. Far from being recent, these observations are very old. The reformists shared in the mistakes of the leadership on various levels. Indeed, most of them were spokesmen for the leadership: they were among those who played fiddle for it and cast its errors in favorable light. They were among those who incited its wrath against all demands for reform or correction. Now, when the Palestinian leadership is embarking on a fierce battle and fighting on many fronts, it would be better for these people--members of the Fatah Revolutionary Council or political bureau members of FIDA [Palestinian Democratic Union], the Palestinian People's Party, or any other organizations--to play their role in their organizations. For the road followed by the "reformists" has been badly exploited by enemies of Palestinian nationalism who hunt for small mistakes by the Palestinian leadership, not to correct them, but to defame this course in the minds of the Palestinian and Arab masses. Don't misunderstand me. Naturally, I am not saying that Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] is a democrat. It is unreasonable for us to demand that 'Arafat's leadership be collective, as if it were the leadership of a party in Switzerland or Sweden, not part of current Palestinian reality. [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Then your objection is directed at the individuals calling for reform. [Qallab] My objection is not to the individuals. All respect and love to them! But I do say that most of them are from the second-and third-echelon leadership. They are among those who participated in creating the Palestinian leadership in this form. I think most of them are out to improve their positions on the Palestinian ship of state or are seeking a special place in the current negotiating process. We know all about brother Hani al-Hasan's opposition. He was at the head of the reformists and those demanding an improvement in Palestinian negotiating performance. Yet, as soon as he was brought into the arena, he forgot what he had being saying since the Madrid conference. I think his fellow "reformists" are following in his footsteps. [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] But one notes that reform-minded independents are the backbone of the current movement--in addition, of course, to members of the groups. And the independents who have no link to the official Palestinian institutions are the most ardent of the current demanders of reform! [Qallab] The story about independents on the scene is ridiculous. In reality it is an invention of Abu 'Ammar, when he was displaying Fatah supporters who were not among the movement's official members as if they were independents. The fact is that bias on the Palestinian scene is not organization-related, but political. I think that the independents who are members of the Executive Committee and the Palestinian National Council are closest to the Fatah political line and to Abu 'Ammar specifically. Frankly, I would say that although people who are organizationally independent may exist, there is no one who is politically independent. In this sense, the independents among the "reformists" are not independents at all. [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Then do you object fundamentally to reform? [Qallab] I do not object to reform. As I said, it is constantly desirable. But I do not see what is to be gained from forming from among the Palestinian groups that participate in the PLO a current that announces that it wants to lead the reform. Why doesn't reform take place first within these groups and parties and then widen to include the PLO and its agencies? So if the brothers want reform, they should leave their groups and form a powerful reform current responsive to the will of the Palestinian people. Unfortunately, as people say, "Fodder is of no use at the time of the attack." The Palestinian people now need an entity--the establishment of a state--even if it is not democratic. A state first must be brought into existence. Afterward we can think about what can be called a luxury in the Third World--namely, democratic transformation. [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Why not create democratic foundations or democratic political life before statehood, to guarantee the sovereignty of a state of rights, law, and institutions? [Qallab] As I understand it, the "reformists" want to improve the performance of the Palestinian leadership in the negotiations; they do not want to lay foundations for the future Palestinian state. [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] The memorandum and the points of the program that were approved subsequently explicitly advocate a Palestinian state and the importance of participation by the talents of the Palestinian people in these building processes on democratic foundations! [Qallab] I believe that the Palestinian people, as a result of their special sufferings for more than 70 years, have produced a democratic reality--to differing extents and degrees, of course. The question now is whether we should put the cart before the horse. Now we want the enemy to withdraw from occupied Palestinian and Arab territory. We want to make a first step toward establishing an independent Palestinian state. [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Demands for democracy are always desirable and persistent. Emphasizing that the Palestinian state should be a state of institutions and laws is a correct position. However, I ask whether the storm now being raised about reform by a group of people from within the Palestinian organizations serves this goal. [Qallab] I think that even if intentions are good, this storm will not lead to [anything but] increased distortion of the Palestinian struggle and to its being portrayed as if it were merely embezzlements and misuse of authority. Reform from within the Palestinian scene must take place on the basis of conflict within unity. We must be careful to choose the steps required at each stage. In my opinion, the step required at this stage is to rally internally. That is the basis. [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] However, the "reformists" today are from inside the Palestinian household and are its sons. No one can impugn the sincerely democratic and reformist intentions of Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, for example. [Qallab] Let me say that the word "reform" has become a kind of romance. I think that Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi should not be behaving in this way. He is no onlooker; he belongs to the heart of the Palestinian political process. So he should by no means object like an outside observer, while he holds on to his position within Palestinian political activity. Why, for example, didn't the Israeli negotiator sitting across from Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi at the same table resign, given that he too was surprised by the Oslo agreement? Do you think the head of the Jordanian delegation knows everything the Jordanian Government is doing with regard to the Middle East peace process? Shim'on Peres agreed with Abu 'Ammar in Davos on a series of issues, and Yitzhaq Rabin did not agree on them. Yet Peres did not step aside from the negotiations, as Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas] did when Abu-'Ammar objected to the results of his talks in Cairo. [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] We are not talking about individual responsibilities, but about the absence of a system of institutions in Palestinian activity--the absence of collective decisionmaking and continued monopolization of decisions by the Palestinian president. [Qallab] The Palestinian case is very special. I am one of those who lived through the experience of the siege of Beirut, when Abu-'Ammar, despite the siege, made a point of collective decisionmaking. Being under siege, the Palestinian leaders had willingly entrusted all the reins of power to Yasir 'Arafat; which was something normal and understandable. I do not think that Yitzhaq Rabin makes his decisions after conducting a poll that includes all members of his party or the participants in his government. The most telling indication of this is the existence of the so-called inner cabinet, which makes decisions in Israel. Doesn't Yasir 'Arafat then have the right to have at his side a small consultative council that makes sensitive decisions and subsequently submits them to the wider and broader Palestinian cadres? [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Naturally it is his right. But the problem is that a considerable number of Palestinian talents who could form a trustworthy consultative council have left the ranks of official Palestinian activity--so many that it seems as if most of those around Mr. Yasir 'Arafat are the sort of men who tell him what he wishes to hear--not to mention their low competence level and major questions about their integrity. [Qallab] The Palestinian decisionmaking mechanism took shape under well-known circumstances. Since the onset of the Palestinian revolution in the mid-sixties, there has been a struggle between those who want Palestinian decisionmaking to be independent of certain Arab regimes and systems, but not from the Arab liberation movement, and those who constituted extensions of certain Arab regimes onto the Palestinian scene. [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Then are these Palestinian talents responsible for what his happening in the PLO's organizations? [Qallab] No, I am not accentuating Abu-'Ammar's constant fear of certain talents. I can state that many of those whom Abu-'Ammar has established in sensitive positions to the disadvantage of [other] talents have formed bridges to certain Arab regimes on the Palestinian scene and have penetrated Arab and non-Arab security agencies. There is a law in revolutions that holds that the leadership should be protected from errors. I think that by staying away from Abu-'Ammar, Palestinian talents have paved the way for the spread of the flabbiness and bureaucracy that we now see and that are the cause of the series of errors that we now are attributing to the head of the PLO.
