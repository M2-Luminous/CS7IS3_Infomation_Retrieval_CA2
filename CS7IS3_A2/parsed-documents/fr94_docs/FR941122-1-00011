FR941122-1-00011 FR941122-1-00001 In March 1994, the Department approved enhanced funding extension requests from four State agencies using this policy. The Department acted on these requests prior to the rulemaking so the State agencies affected would know their Federal funding status prior to the April 1, 1994 effective date mandated in the law. If a decision by FNS to grant a delay is made after April 1, 1994, an adjustment will be made so an affected State agency can receive enhanced Federal funding retroactive to April 1, 1994 for eligible costs. If approval is granted to delay the effective date, Section 13971 of the Leland Act provides that the delayed effective date would be the first day of the first calendar quarter which begins after the close of the State's regular legislative session. In such a case, State agencies would be required to promptly advise FNS in writing as to the actual date the next regular session of the State legislature is completed once such session is completed so the delayed effective date can be determined. Enhanced Funding for Low Payment Error Rates Under Section 16(c) of the Food Stamp Act and the current rules at §277.4(b), the Federal share of administrative costs specified in section 16(a) of the Food Stamp Act may be enhanced from the regular 50 percent rate to a maximum of 60 percent after the end of the Federal fiscal year if the State agency qualifies by achieving a low payment error rate. Costs which were eligible for greater enhanced funding rates under section 16 (a), (g), and (j) of the Act (fraud control costs, ADP development, and SAVE) were ineligible for the 60 percent enhancement. With the drop in the funding rate to 50 percent, these three activities now become eligible along with other costs funded at the 50 percent rate for the increased Federal reimbursement rate of up to 60 percent if the State agency meets the low payment error rate specified in §277.4. The enhanced funding may only be paid on costs shared at the 50 percent level to State agencies who qualify. The Department proposes to amend §277.4, to allow these three new activities to become eligible for the 60 percent enhanced funding by removing §277.4 (b)(1), (b)(10), (b)(11) and (b)(12), redesignating the remaining provisions, and by revising newly designated paragraph (b)(7). Deadline for Filing Claims for Retroactive Funding_Section 277.11 Current rules at §277.11 do not limit State agencies from making claims for prior year administrative costs. The one exception is that the provision at §277.15(b) limits 75 percent funding for fraud control activities to prior year costs incurred in the Federal fiscal year during which a State agency initially applied for 75 percent funding. However, State agencies may make claims for prior year fraud control activities at the 50 percent Federal reimbursement rate with no time limit. State agencies are currently required at §277.11 to submit a Form SF&hyph;269, Financial Status Report, on a quarterly basis to report program costs and to support the claims made for Federal funding. Final reports are due December 30 for the preceeding Federal fiscal year which runs from October 1 through September 30. In addition, after the fiscal year is over, State agencies may request retroactive funding for past years or pay back FNS for inadvertent overclaims by submitting an SF&hyph;270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement. It is the SF&hyph;270 adjustments which, under current rules potentially may go on without end. In Fiscal Years (FY) 1991 through 1993, FNS received SF&hyph;270 requests for retroactive funding from State agencies going back as far as FY 1981 and SF&hyph;270 payments from State agencies to FNS going back to FY 1979 and prior years for the Food Stamp Program.
