Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said any further discussions or an extension of the deadline would be counterproductive if there is no Turkish political will to reach a solution. Kasoulidhis was commenting on a statement by a U.S. official to the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation [CyBC] that he expects the Turkish side to be given two weeks to reply. Kasoulidhis said the Cypriot Government expects the UN secretary general's report to be submitted in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 902. He stressed that the report should fully describe the facts, which speak for themselves. He said there is no indication that the report and its conclusions is a temporary measure. In his statement to CyBC, the U.S. official said that if the Turkish side continues its negative stance after the two-week deadline, the UN Security Council will consider alternative ways to implement its resolutions. The U.S. official said Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department's special coordinator on the Cyprus issue, intends to discuss with the Turkish Government ways to overcome the latest obstacles. According to the same official, the basic obstacle is access to Famagusta. On this issue, Denktas demands satisfaction regarding who will guard the access and from what distance. The U.S. official said that eight of the 70 issues that Denktas asked clarification on are still pending.
