The report, which was presented and prepared by the Permanent Finance Commission, was submitted to the lawmakers in the lower chamber for analysis. It received the support of all parties forming the commission, but in the chamber vote the Radical Cause Party legislative wing voted against it. In their speeches, representatives of the different legislative factions explained that it was meaningless to approve the Emergency Banking Law without approving the Public Credit Draft Bill, which will permit Fogade [Deposit Guarantee Fund] to disburse the necessary resources to aid all financial institutions in need of assistance. This assistance will be given by issuing public debt bonds totalling 400 billion bolivares. Deputy Jose Miguel Uzcategui said the Permanent Finance Commission discussed various financing options for the law, such as tax reforms, issuing currency, and adopting budget measures. He added that the most expeditious, convenient, and orthodox way of generating resources is by going into debt, a debt that will not have an impact on the market and will not produce inflationary effects unless Fogade's authorized capital is increased. Uzcategui said that the issue will be discussed today by the commission, who will review the observations made at the Chamber. He added that during the afternoon session the bill will be approved in the second debate. Gustavo Tarre Briceno, chairman of the Permanent Finance Commission, said that the Executive Branch is issuing public debt bonds and placing the money at Fogade. Tarre Briceno said it is not a matter of spending 400 billion bolivares but of seeking the mechanisms to create greater confidence among savers and depositors throughout the country, offering 400 billion bolivares to support their savings as well as generating confidence again in the Venezuelan financial system.
