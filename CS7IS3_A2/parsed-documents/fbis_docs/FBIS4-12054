This emerges from remarks made by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in yesterday's cabinet session. Peres said that "we should treat the Russians with respect," reminding the ministers that there are 1.5 million Jews in Russia. "We have no business expressing reservations about Russia's involvement," he said. Rabin said that the United States praised the role the Russians played in the activity vis-a-vis the Serbs in the Bosnia crisis. "We have special relations with the United States, expressed through aid and strategic cooperation, but Russian foreign policy is more active than in the past and is not negative," Rabin said. The prime minister did not reiterate the claim he made during the past several weeks that Russia should coordinate its moves on the peace process with the United States. [passage omitted]
