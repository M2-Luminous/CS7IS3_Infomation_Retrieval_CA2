The National Council has implicitly agreed with the Upper House on resolving the final disagreements. The option of "slowing down expenses," an instrument which aims at imposing some financial discipline on parliament, remains open at this time. Both houses [of the Federal Assembly] have agreed to postpone to a later date the elimination of the optional AVS [special insurance plan] for Swiss citizens living abroad. They have also given up the idea of cutting subisidies to the disability pension fund. Parliament thus has reduced the savings projected by the Federal Council by SFr110 million. Slowing down expenses will be dealt with as a separate issue. The support of an absolute majority of members of parliament -- not only the majority of the deputies present -- will have to be obtained to approve new substantial expenses. The Council of States had considered this system too difficult to implement and sent it back to its commission for further examination. Moreover, the 1993 stabilization program includes measures which are under the sole responsibility of the Federal Council; they should allow yearly savings of SFr900 million. A third program is already being prepared. Its objective is to deal with the structural deficit -- independent from the economic situation -- and save SFr4 billion through a reduction in expenses and an increase in incomes. The Confederation recorded a SFr7.8 billion deficit in 1993.
