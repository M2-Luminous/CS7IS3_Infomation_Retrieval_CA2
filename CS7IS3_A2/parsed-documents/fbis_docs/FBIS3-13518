For months the Persian-speaking Tajik people witnessed the catastrophic crimes perpetrated by the Russian forces and antipopular government of Uzbekistan [as published] in the country. In this period, tens of thousands of Muslim men, women, youth, and children, have been dragged into blood and dust and the call to prayer has been snuffed out in most parts of the country. Theological schools have been closed down and most of the intelligentsia, writers, clerics, and university staff members have been martyred or arrested. Hundreds of thousands of people have been rendered homeless in the debilitating winter and are wandering in mountains and wildernesses. Most of the people are being shot with a hail of bullets before the eyes of their families merely for belonging to a certain tribe or district and the cities of Tajikistan have become the tramping ground for murderers and ruffians who enjoy Russian support. Even though the Western mass media has boycotted all news of events in Tajikistan in a coordinated measure, some reports squeeze through the cracks and tell of the depth of savagery and brutality of the former communists and supporters of Russia. There is no doubt that the Russian Government has had the main role in the events in Tajikistan in the past year. The people of Tajikistan will not forget Russia's obstructionism in preventing fuel and foodstuffs from reaching Dushanbe during the brief period that a popular government was in power in Tajikistan. The Tajiks are well aware that the puppet regime -- which right from the outset has brought nothing for the people but poverty, hunger, misfortune, killing, and plunder -- cannot survive even for a day without Russian support. Following the UN's announcement of the 16 March date for talks between the leaders of national Islamic groups of Tajikistan with the ruling regime and the Russian Government, Russia is seeking to wrest the initiative and to direct the talks toward its own longterm interests. It is being said that the Russian first deputy foreign minister has been in Iran for a few days and has had talks with the leaders of some Islamic national Tajik groups. Reports of these meetings were carried in some foreign media and in some Moscow publications. However, the officials of our Foreign Ministry have apparently not deemed it necessary to disseminate the news of these talks inside Iran as well! The Russian first deputy foreign minister has made immense efforts to convince the Tajik leaders to accept Moscow as the venue for the talks but they seem to have expressed a preference for Tehran or Islamabad. The Russians, who have played the main part in creating the present situation in Tajikistan, are now seeking to assume a new role of a mediator between the Tajik Government and opposition while retaining the role of big brother. The latest reports indicate that the Tajik group leaders have agreed that the first round of talks should begin on 16 March in Moscow. Our Tajik brothers and sisters should maintain as strong a stance in the talks as they displayed during their rightful struggle and should not succumb to the blackmail and whipping up of any kind of atmosphere. Undoubtedly, the Islamic Republic of Iran will not forget the oppressed Muslims of Tajikistan in these difficult days and will -- as has been stressed repeatedly by the leader of the Revolution, His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i -- support their just aspirations to attain freedom and independence.
