The Ministry of Finance [MOF] said the government will not check the "quality of foreign technology and contents of contracts between importers and exporters of foreign technology" when it reviews reports for introducing foreign technology in Korea. The government has sometimes blocked the influx of foreign technologies because of expensive royalties on foreign technology or their obsolescence. It will also shorten the processing period for accepting foreign technology inducement reports to 10 days, compared with the current 30 days. The Bank of Korea will no longer be an exclusive window for accepting reports from foreign investors in local industries and such banks as the Korea Development Bank and Industrial Bank of Korea will deal in foreign direct investment reporting services from March 1. The MOF said other foreign exchange banks will be authorized to accept reports from foreigners on their investment plans here from July 1. The diversification of banks accepting foreign direct investment reports is designed to help banks compete against each other to attract foreign investors. So far, the BOK has monopolized the business as the government wanted to "control" who invests in domestic industries. Thus from July 1, local banks will be able to accept reports from foreign investors when their equity stakes are less than 50 percent or when they invest less than 3 million dollars in joint ventures in which their stakes exceed more than 50 percent. The MOF said it will revise the enforcement decrees on the Foreign Capital Inducement Act (FCIA) next week for implementation from March 1. The MOF said the revision of the FCIA enforcement decrees is to simplify foreign investment procedures, enhance transparency, ease rules and provide administrative services for foreign investors in Korea. Under the new FCIA enforcement decrees, it will take only five days for foreign investors to get government approval for investing in Korean industries, compared with the current 30 days. Even when the MOF needs consultations with other government ministries for reviewing the applications, it will not take more than 15 days for international investors to get approval from Korea. For projects that do not need government approval, foreigners can immediately initiate business in Korea as soon as they make a notification to Korea. Currently, it takes 20-30 days for foreign investors to make a report on their investment plans to the government. The government will reduce its intervention in business diversification activities of foreign enterprises and joint venture firms following their investment in local industries, it said. For example, foreign enterprises and joint venture firms will diversify into other projects, and easily sell and buy stocks to invest in or divest themselves from their Korean operations after they invested in local industries, the MOF said. Foreigners which hold less than 10 percent equities stakes in local companies will not be subject to various restrictions.
