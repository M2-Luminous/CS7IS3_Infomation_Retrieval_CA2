Someone thinks it very important to drive a wedge between the Army and the population, to make the Army a scapegoat for all evils, and thereby to divert public attention from the sociopolitical problems that really do exist in the Dniester Republic, the statement says. Explaining this statement to the ITAR-TASS correspondent, General Lebed, commander of the 14th Army, pointed to unscrupulous articles in a number of newspapers, in particular PRAVDA, alleging that the Army had been put on combat alert and was preparing an assault on the Dniester Republic government.
