He had his first meeting at the "Tsentralna-Irmine" mine. Then he went to the joint-stock enterprise "Styl" and met electors at the diesel locomotive construction workers' palace of culture. During this meeting he set forth his vision of getting Ukraine out of the crisis, subjected his rivals' programs to criticism and replied to numerous questions. He also introduced the team, which had arrived with him and to which belong, according to him, "lawyers of world renown" and employees of ministries. Oleksandr Moroz stated that to begin with, he would bring order and discipline to the state. Calling on the future electors to cast their votes for ideas, in which they believe, Oleksandr Moroz said: "I am not going to say directly that you should vote for representatives of leftist forces." Regarding the fate of the Black Sea Fleet, the Ukrainian parliament Speaker said that the fleet should be a joint one and should protect the interests of both Russia and Ukraine. Acknowledging the preservation of the sovereignty of former Soviet Union republics, Ukraine's Supreme Council chairman stated that the peoples of these republics should help one another and then they would manage to remove customs-houses and borders in the future. "We will restore accord between the two states and other fraternal peoples, while not conceding sovereignty," he said. Oleksandr Moroz promised to conduct checks on the privatization process in the country. According to him, a special commission would be set up and an analysis of privatization would be carried out. Those, who had privatized enterprises and shops, would be asked where they got the funds from. "If they cannot account for the sources of finance, they will have to part from the privatized facilities and even do time in jail," Ukraine's Supreme Council chairman said. As far as foreign currency is concerned, the Speaker promised to ban the use of both the U.S. dollar and the Deutschmark for settlements in Ukraine the very next day after his election to president. Of all of the candidates for president, whom Oleksandr Moroz described, Volodymyr Lanovyy got the worst of it. He was called "an individual with an unbalanced psyche." A meeting with managers of the oblast's and town's enterprises took place on the same day.
