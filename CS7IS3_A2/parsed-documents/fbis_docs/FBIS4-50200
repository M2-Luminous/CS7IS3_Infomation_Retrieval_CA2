He said: Civil affairs departments must always consider it their objective to protect the masses' vital interests, and safeguard their basic rights and interests. Civil affairs departments must improve grass-roots operations, properly manage various social projects, go deep into grass-roots units, and use various appropriate ways to help local people solve their problems, maintain social order, and expedite the healthy development of socialist ethics and material progress. Vice Premier Zou Jiahua; State Councillor Li Tieying; and leading comrades Chi Haotian, Song Jian, Li Guixian, and Chen Junsheng were present at the meeting, which took place at Zhongnanhai this morning. Li Guixian chaired the meeting. At the meeting, Minister of Civil Affairs Doje Cering gave a briefing on the national conference on civil affairs and actual state of civil affairs in the country. Zhang Ruifeng, vice governor of Shandong; Zhang Yuqin, vice governor of Guizhou; Ma Lin, director of the Heilongjiang Provincial Civil Affairs Department; Zhang Baohuan, director of the Hebei Provincial Civil Affairs Department; and Bai Xianjing, director of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Civil Affairs Department, took the floor at the meeting one after another. In their speeches, they maintained that the conference has factually summed up the state of civil affairs in the past five years; and that the basic ideas, guiding thought, objectives, and principal tasks the conference has put forth are in line with the national needs -- reform, development, and stability -- as well as the general policy set by the Central Committee. They pointed out that civil affairs departments must proceed from practical needs, continue to explore new ways to handle civil affairs when the nation is embarked on building a socialist market economic system, accomplish all assignments which the conference has put forth, and improve the overall quality of civil affairs so that civil affairs departments can give full scope to their functions. In his speech, Li Peng said that the civil affairs conference has discussed major principles for civil affairs, that the meeting was a success, and the results which civil affairs departments have achieved over the years have also been quite fruitful. Li Peng extended the cordial regards of the CPC Central Committee and State Council to the representatives attending the conference as well as comrades who have been working diligently in the nation's civil affairs departments. Li Peng said: China's reform has entered a crucial period since the convocation of the 14th National Party Congress, and especially since the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. When we implement the Central Committee's general policy of "seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider to the outside world, expediting development, and maintaining stability," the most important thing we must do is to properly handle the relationship among reform, development, and stability. Comrade Xiaoping said: "Without a stable social and political environment, reform and construction cannot be successful." This is why the Central Committee has repeatedly stressed the need to expedite reform and construction while ensuring stability, as well as the need to maintain long-term social stability through reform and construction. Maintaining social stability even has strategic significance during the initial period of building our socialist market economic system. This is an invaluable experience China has gained from carrying out reform over the past decade or so. Li Peng pointed out: Both the central and local authorities are grasping social stability because it is an important matter. Proceeding from their respective functions, various departments should create a good social environment for reform and development by solving social contradictions, maintaining social stability, and forming a comprehensive mechanism for social stability in China. Over the past dozens of years, the civil affairs departments have worked very hard and played a great role in maintaining social stability by solving social problems. Civil affairs personnel have constantly visited grass-roots units to convey the party and government's concern for dependents of servicemen and revolutionary martyrs, demobilized soldiers, bereaved old people, disabled children, and impoverished households. They are worthy of being called the "oxen" of the masses because fearless of hardships, they have insisted on bringing comfort to thousands of households. The achievements made in civil affairs work over the past four decades reflects, on the one hand, the superiority of the socialist system in China and, on the other, represents a sound return blow against hostile forces in the West who attack China on the question of human rights. Once we have done our civil affairs work well, we will be able to create a good social environment for economic construction, thereby promoting coordinated social and economic development. Li Peng said: As natural disasters are common in China, every year a large number of people become their victims. Also, there are bereaved old folks, sick and disabled people, low-income people, and others who have social difficulties. The majority of these people whose living conditions are rather poor, live in rural areas. Therefore, governments at all levels should pay special attention to the question of poverty existing in some rural areas. He said: We should change the current method of relying solely on government relief. We should broaden the method by gradually establishing a system by which governments at various levels share responsibility for providing relief. Li Peng pointed out: In the new situation, the civil affairs departments should continue to emancipate their minds, deepen reform, effectively carry out their functions, protect the people's rights and interests, basic living conditions, regulate social relations, alleviate social contradictions, solve social problems, and do a good job in maintaining social stability and promoting the building of a socialist spiritual civilization. In particular, the civil affairs departments should play a greater role in safeguarding society, in promoting national defense, and in building grass-roots political power and basic-level self-governing organizations. Li Peng expressed the hope that party committees and governments, proceeding from the overall purpose of reform, development, and stability, will pay special attention to civil affairs work; make it an important item on their agendas; and effectively strengthen leadership over this work. He expressed the conviction that under the leadership of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, cadres and workers on the civil affairs front will achieve more brilliant results and make greater contributions to promoting economic development and social stability in China if they continue to carry forward the spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly, fear no hardships, overcome difficulties, boldly open up new channels, and work hard in unity. Attending the discussion meeting were Chen Jinhua, minister of the State Planning Commission; Tao Siju, minister of public security; Liu Zhongli, minister of finance; Song Defu, minister of personnel; and responsible persons of the relevant departments under the State Council.
