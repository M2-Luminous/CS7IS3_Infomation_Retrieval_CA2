This choice reflects the government's determination to accommodate its military representation to the structure of the major allied commands, whose current reorganization is scheduled for completion in 1995. Prompted by the end of the Cold War in Europe, this reorganization consists in personnel reductions within military commands with a view to reducing operating costs. To take effect on 1 July, the government has appointed Air Force Brigadier General Woillez as head of the French military mission to the Commander in Chief of Allied Forces for Northwestern Europe (CINCNORTHWEST). This command is based in High Wycombe (Great Britain) and is intended to combine two previously distinct allied commands: The Northern European Command (CINCNORTH), which covers allied forces in Norway and on the Baltic coastline, on the one hand, and CINCUKAIR, the command which includes the United Kingdom's NATO Air Force, on the other hand. The new allied command for northwestern Europe is under the authority of the General Headquarters of Allied Forces in Europe (SACEUR), headed by U.S. General George Joulwan and based in Mons, Belgium. The newly created French military mission with the new Northwestern European Command will fall under the command of Admiral Lanxade, chief of staff of the French Armed Forces, through the French representative to NATO's Military Committee, Air Force Major General Jean-Paul Pelisson. The 51-year-old General Woillez, whose position was created within the scope the reorganization of NATO's commands, was formerly deputy chief of the "Planning, Programming, and Evaluation" Division of the French Armed Forces' staff headquarters. It has already been a year since France appointed Rear Admiral Dominique Raguet as its representative in Naples, where the Allied Command for Southern Europe (CINCSOUTH) is located. The Naples headquarters controls allied (land, naval, and air) forces deployed in southern Europe as well as NATO's intervention force. A number of these units have been enforcing the UN embargo against Serbia and Montenegro since the beginning of the crisis in the former Yugoslavia. This summer, France also plans to appoint Brigadier General Gerard Folio as its military representative with the General Allied Command for Central Europe (CINCENT), located in Brunssum, the Netherlands. Like the new Northwestern European Command, the CINCSOUTH and CINCENT commands come under General Joulwan's direct authority.
