FR940721-1-00075 FR940721-1-00014 Appendix B to Part 3500_Illustration of Requirements of RESPA * * * * * 11. Facts: A, a mortgage lender, is affiliated with B, a title company, and C, an escrow company, and offers consumers a package of mortgage title and escrow services at a discount from the prices at which such services would be sold if purchased separately. Neither A, B, or C, requires consumers to purchase the services of their sister companies, and each company sells such services separately and as part of the package. A also pays its employees (i.e., loan officers, secretaries, etc.) a bonus for each loan, title insurance, or closing that A's employees generate for A, B, or C. A pays such employees bonuses out of its own funds and receives no bonuses or reimbursements for these bonuses from B or C. At or before the time that customers are told by A or its employees about the services offered by B and C and about the package of services that is available, the customers are provided with a controlled business arrangement disclosure form. Comments: Selling a package of settlement services at a discount is not prohibited by RESPA. Also, A may compensate its own employees for business generated for A's company, but A may not directly or indirectly compensate A's employees who are routinely in contact with consumers for business generated for B or C. Nor may B or C directly or indirectly compensate A or A's employees for business referred to B or C by A's employees. Sections 3500.15(b)(3)(i) (A) and (B) set forth the permissible exchanges of funds between controlled business entities. No employee or agent may receive compensation correlated on a one-to-one basis or calculated as a multiple of the number or value of referrals of business to an affiliated entity. Nothing in the RESPA rule prohibits bonuses or other compensation based, in part, on the generation of business by A to B and C being paid to managerial employees who are not routinely in contact with consumers.
