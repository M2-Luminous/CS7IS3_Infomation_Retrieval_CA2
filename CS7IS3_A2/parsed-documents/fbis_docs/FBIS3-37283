Eighteen months of bitter power struggle had brought Russia to the brink of civil war. Yeltsin and Rybkin found themselves on different sides of the barricades. A month ago 46-year-old Ivan Rybkin was elected speaker of the Russian parliament's lower chamber and everyone expected that the seemingly convinced communist, a member of the Agrarian Party group in the State Duma, would immediately begin a campaign of revenge against his political opponent in the Kremlin and take every opportunity to make life difficult for Yeltsin. However, the reverse has happened. Most surprisingly Rybkin has defended President Yeltsin in several critical situations in the course of the first month of the new parliament. When BERLINGSKE TIDENDE spoke to Ivan Rybkin here in Moscow at the weekend it was natural to ask him about his relations with President Yeltsin. "On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the lifting of the siege of Leningrad I stood by President Yeltsin's side in Piskarev Cemetery in St. Petersburg where almost half a million victims of the siege are buried. I saw how the tears ran down the president's cheeks and at that moment I realized that more than anything else Russia needs peace and calm and cooperation," said Rybkin, who is so busy trying to get cooperation with the government and with President Yeltsin to work that he has become unpopular among the ranks of his own party. "The three times I have spoken to President Yeltsin the conversations have been chiefly about the need for unity in society. President Yeltsin and I are agreed that the political forces in society must be consolidated, that the country needs peace and quiet in which it can work. Without peace we cannot continue the reforms," said Rybkin who comes from the southern Russian region of Volgograd, where he trained as an engineer. Rybkin talks so much about peace and quiet and cooperation that many people view him with deep suspicion. "Some people would like to see us coming to blows again, but I have had the scent of civil war in my nostrils and the main point of everything that I am doing now is about preventing a repeat of the civil war which the country experienced in 1918-20." Rybkin recalled a story by Soviet Russian author and Nobel Prize winner Mikhail Shokolov which takes place during the civil war after the revolution in 1917. Without realizing it an elderly Bolshevik kills his own son who is fighting on the side of the White rebel forces, and when he recognizes the birthmark on his son's leg he shoots himself through the forehead. "Russia will not survive such a confrontation again," the speaker said emphatically and a quiver in his voice. Rybkin said of himself that today he is as much a communist as Boris Yeltsin, Mikhail Gorbachev, or Aleksandr Yakovlev. The newly elected parlaimentary speaker described his own platform as social democratic. "Today President Yeltsin is the unifying political figure in Russia. My own party or a similar party in the center of the political spectrum could well become Yeltsin's political platform. It is here that the sympathies of the emerging middle class will lie, and it is obvious that every reformer must win the support of the middle class."
