Zyuganov told a press conference on Thursday that security issues should be in the focus of Russian-U.S. talks. "The system of security in Russia is completely disorganised and the issue should be discussed in detail during the visit before the situation goes out of control completely", he said. Speaking on Duma affairs, Zyuganov said that his party had already blocked with the Agrarian party and the Democratic Russia. "Doors for others remain open", he stressed and added that communists are ready to unite with those factions which share three of their basic principles: peace in the country, well-being in every family and not only in elite families, the understanding that the current situation leads to chaos and upheavals. Communists will focus on three tasks in the Duma and the major one is to change the course of reforms. The other two include the restoration of the state management in the country and moral improvement in society.
