FBIS3-49215 "dreeu004__a94002" FBIS-EEU-94-001-A Document Type:Daily Report 6 January 1994 ANNEX ALBANIA Ministry Protests Border Shootings by Serbians AU0501142794 Tirana ATA in English 0905 GMT 5 Jan 94 AU0501142794 Tirana ATA Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Tirana, January 5 (ATA) -- [words indistinct] On January 3, 1994, at 1030 hrs, in the border sign D14/18, in Zapod of Kukes, the Yugoslav border soldiers killed the Albanian citizen Ramadan Ibrahim Mustafa, 25 years, who was 5.5 meters in the Yugoslav territory. They opened fire against Ramadan at a 15 meter distance causing him five wounds. On the same day, at 1500, in the border zone of Tropoje, Serbian border forces opened fire from the Yugoslav territory wounding seriously in the Albanian zone the Albanian Citizen Hamid Ram Sallaku, 20 years. These grave criminal acts, encouraged by vile anti-Albanian aims of Serbian chauvinists, are made in the course of similar acts in the past. In the incidents occurring in the border of Albania with Serbia and Montenegro, all the wounded and killed have been Albanians, none of them has been Serbian. With the last two victims, the number of those killed since the beginning of 1993 becomes 21. Such criminal acts are part of the strategy of tension and war that Milosevic is following, thus stirring up situations with unprecedented consequences in the region. The Albanian Foreign Ministry forcefully protests against these incidents, which should be put an end immediately.
