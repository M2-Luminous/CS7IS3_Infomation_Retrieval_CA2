Correspondent Elli Triandafillou has the following report: [Triandafillou] Speaking upon his return at the airport, Evert said he promoted the national positions during his contacts. He called on all Greek politicians to follow his example and visit foreign countries to help elevate the country's prestige, which, he claimed, is at a very low level. He also noted that his party's proposal for the signing of an agreement guaranteeing peace and unchanged borders in the Balkans is welcomed abroad. He added that the government should undertake an initiative to implement this because this way Turkey's expansionist plans in our region will be foiled. He also stressed that domestic disputes among political parties should not extend to foreign affairs and underlined that the Greek presidency of the European Union should succeed. Referring to the developments on the Skopje issue, the official opposition leader repeated that the government made a mistake in abandoning the negotiations within the UN framework. Evert said that Deputy Foreign Minister Yeoryios Papandreou's clarification, that the prime minister's statement about ending the dialogue with neighboring Skopje was a "rhetorical statement" is ironic. Responding to a question on remarks by Sotirios Kouvelas [New Democracy prominent deputy and former state minister] in which he criticized New Democracy's opposition policy, Evert said he will listen to all views, but made it clear that the final decisions are up to him. Evert will go to Paris in February to meet with French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur. He also plans to meet German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and British Prime Minister John Major.
