This claim was made by Raul Campos Rabago, representing the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic at Mar del Plata, Argentina, where he is attending the meeting of the Inter-American Committee for Control of Drugs and Drug Abuse [CICAD]. Campos Rabago, commissioner of the National Institute To Combat Drugs [INCD], told delegates from 24 countries serving on the aforementioned committee that, despite his previous remark, "The drug traffic is still not just threatening, but also inflicting daily harm on the health and welfare of societies." Participating as Mexico's representative at the committee's meeting, which is being held in the Argentine province of Mar del Plata, the official stressed, on this occasion, that President Salinas de Gortari's administration is aware of this situation. Hence, since the beginning of his term, he has given the battle against drugs and drug addiction a priority status on the government's agenda. He added that the 1989-94 National Program To Combat Drugs includes action for eradication, interception, repression, and rehabilitation, thus dealing with the phenomenon as a whole. Campos Rabago explained that this has been made possible by the reinforcement of the Mexican institutions responsible for combating crimes against health in all their forms. He also noted that the National Institute To Combat Drugs is the agency charged with coordinating the action taken in this area by the federal and state governments, and by private institutions, serving as a central catalyst for executing the national strategy, through the Planning Center for Drug Control (Cendro). The INCD commissioner stressed that, although considerable progress has been made, "the fact that the criminal associations involved in the drug traffic are increasing their capacity to evade each of our countries' coercive measures more every day impels us to extend the battle not only to curb the supply and the illicit trafficking, but also, primarily, to check the demand. This can be achieved by preventing improper use of drugs and psychotropic substances, and by rehabilitating addicts." Attending this 15th regular session of the CICAD were representatives from the United States, Venezuela, Colombia, Chile, Trinidad and Tobago, Canada, Brazil, Bolivia, and the Central American countries.
