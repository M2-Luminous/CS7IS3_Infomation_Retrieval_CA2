This emerged after talks held by the Transvaal and [Orange] Free State Agricultural Unions and the leader of the Freedom Front, General Constand Viljoen, with the United Nations, the Commonwealth, and international institutions on a feeding strategy for South Africa and the rest of the continent. The president of the Transvaal Agricultural Union, Mr. Dries Bruwer, said talks would be held on the same issue next week with President Nelson Mandela and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki. Mr. Bruwer said South African farmers would give practical help and advice on crop cultivation. The strategy would initially be confined to countries south of the equator, but would later be expanded northwards. Mr. Bruwer said the plan had to be introduced as soon as possible to prevent a flood of people from neighboring states.
