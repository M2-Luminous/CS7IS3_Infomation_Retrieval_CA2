It has become known only now that some Poles last week tried to smuggle the "hot" stuff to Germany in a private car. In Slubice--the Polish part of Frankfurt/Oder--a Vietnamese was apprehended who was trying to take opium hidden in cotton shirts into the Federal Republic. The public prosecutors said on 19 May that he had 600 shirts with him, decorated with a beer mug design. Underneath this, little bags with an amber liquid containing opium were sewn in.
