Visits to Russia -- not agreed upon previously -- by leaders of executive bodies of foreign states will be considered by Russia as private visits." As BELAPAN has been told by the Department of Bilateral Relations within the Foreign Ministry, this is an ordinary document specifying relations between sovereign states. In the opinion of representatives of the Belarusian Foreign Ministry, all contacts between our Republic and Russia should be coordinated by the Belarusian Foreign Ministry. By the way, the Russian side will also observe similar rules.
