"Our state, he said, is going through a complicated period. Its substance is manifested in profound changes in all walks of life: from the national economy down to the individual's mentality. The complexity of tasks we have set ourselves is not determined only by the gigantic size of the country. One other just as important factor is caused by the huge distortions inherited by Russia from the period of totalitarian rule". It is impossible to resolve such tasks quickly and without pain, said the Russian president. "Any tangible results may follow a longer range flexible policy which, apart from the world experience, accounts for Russian history, Russian national specifics and traditions and the psychology of our society", he said. "We are seeking to set conditions for active participation in Russian reforms by all constructive forces and at the same time, tough restrictions on extremists", Yeltsin stressed. "We are well aware that the key to resolving the current problems is in our own hands. No one but we ourselves can build a prospering society -- by dint of our people's toil, talents and energy. And we are confident about a success of our reforms". On relations between Russia and Germany, Yeltsin said the present generation of Germans and Russians made use of the unique chance "that history has given us". "Gone from our relations is the feuding which has for decades worn out the nerves and stamina of both nations", said the president. "Today, we solve all arising issues to mutual benefit in an atmosphere of calm and well-wishing. One proof is the nature and substance of current talks with the federal chancellor". One of the issues of mutual concern, the president went on to say, is bilateral economic relations. In his words, Germany is "Russia's main trading partner". However, he stressed that businessmen from other countries have started to overtake their German counterparts in the Russian market. " I do not think that German entrepreneurs would be willing to concede their leading positions. But for this, more activity is needed", said Yeltsin. The Russian president offered German businessmen to open up direct cooperation with Russian enterprises and promote manufacturing contacts for years ahead without restricting themselves to one-off trading deals. On the situation in Europe and worldwide, Yeltsin stressed it was on the change. "The bloc approach to resolving international issues is going into the past. But eternal peace is yet to come. What I mean, said the president, is not only the local conflicts and wars but also global challenges which can be met by the world community as a whole. That is why there is an increasing urgency for united effort". Both Germany and Russia can play a stabilizing role in complicated global processes, Yeltsin believes. But more importantly, peace and security guarantees must be brought to Europe and adjacent regions. "What is needed is the models of solutions and cooperation that would not infringe on anyone's interests and leave anyone overboard", Yeltsin said. "The new single Europe cannot be a club for a few select", stressed the Russian president. "By the same token, the solution of security problems cannot be the privilege of a few select". "The wholesome political, economic and cultural architecture of our continent should not be allowed to isolate individual countries or a group of countries on the foe-friend principle but should try to integrate them within a single organism. It is not worth trying to divide Europe into high or low security zones", Yeltsin said. In his view, "the military-political institutions of our continent emerging in conditions of the period of the cold war and confrontation are outdated and in need of internal transformation". "But the main thing is cooperation in the readjustment of the system of institutions and mechanisms which could work to the benefit of one democratic Europe", he pointed out. "The main route to this, in our view, lies through establishing the CSCE as an effective regional organization. In this case, united effort by NATO, NACC [North Atlantic Cooperation Council], WEU [Western European Union] and CIS can acquire a new substance under its umbrella". It is precisely this that determines Russia's attitude to the Partnership for Peace program, he said. In his words, "the genuine partnership is an effective guarantee of security and stability in the continent. But this can be made possible only if there is a will on both sides and a movement towards each other." "Such an approach does no ripe easily even within the framework of NATO", he said. "But this in itself is no reason for slackening bilateral effort", said Yeltsin. "Russia's position on this is clear-cut: we have no territorial claims to any state. Our defence doctrine is purely defensive. The Russian armed forces have no tasks other than defences of the country and its CIS allies, participation in peacemaking operations in line with international commitments", said the Russian president. Yeltsin told the audience that "we are on the threshold of an important event in Russian-German relations. The last Russian soldier will soon leave the German soil. This will draw a line under the heavy legacy we inherited almost 50 years ago. Of course, our memories will take us back again and again to the tragic chapters of history. But this should not be allowed to become an obstacle to a final historical reconciliation between the peoples of our countries. The seeds of reconciliations have shot up and started to bring a rich harvest."
