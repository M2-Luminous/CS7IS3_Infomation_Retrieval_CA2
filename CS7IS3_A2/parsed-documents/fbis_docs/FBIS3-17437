The emergence of a movement like Zhirinovskiy's was predictable. It was a normal reaction from those strata who are suffering economically, who have witnessed the disintegration of the Soviet Union, which they thought would be their homeland for centuries, and who are now left with no vision of where their country is going. If, however, a lesson has been learnt -- and it looks as if President Boris Yeltsin is learning it -- it is that Zhirinovskiy is a dark cloud on the horizon but not the horizon itself. There is still a long way to go before we glimpse light. But the road to normalcy is the one Russia is on. Being normal naturally means having a normal foreign policy. This is now emerging; and it is emerging in direct reaction to the recent past, the period immediately after the failed coup of 1991 and the emergence of Russia as an independent state. During that period, Russia was too inclined to say "yes" to our new friends in the West -- even before being asked to. We suffered a temporary loss of our vision and of our ability both to understand, and act in, our own interests. This created a backlash. Under foreign minister Andrey Kozyrev, an attentive listener, Russian foreign policy has since made big adjustments while never changing its basic course towards strategic rapprochement with the west. It is now better formulated and less one-sided. It has achieved a significant success in persuading the Serbs to pull back from Sarajevo. It is focusing much more than before on the Commonwealth of Independent States and on former partners in Europe. And it is active in Asia, too. Russia has learned to express its differences with others as well as to chorus its assent. Differences have centred on former Yugoslavia and on the continuing inaccessibility of Western markets to our goods; in particular, Russia's ruling elites and the increasingly influential military oppose plans to enlarge Nato by admitting east-central European states (but not Russia), believing this threatens Russia with geopolitical isolation. At the heart of the problems and tensions between Russia and the west is, and will remain, the relations Russia strikes with the former Soviet republics. In autumn last year, Russia took decisions which forced most CIS countries out of the rouble zone. The decisions were prompted by exasperation at the lack of reform in these states, especially Ukraine, and by Russia's unwillingness and inability still to subsidise them. In any reintegration of former Soviet states, Russia will play a different role from that in the old Soviet Union (which was a strange combination of political metropolis and economic colonies) or in the first two years of the CIS's existence. During the latter, Russia was uncertain about how to proceed; it knew lt could no longer be donor and boss but it did not know whether to increase separation or try a new form of re-integration. Now, it seems, there is a growing consensus. Most feasible regimes in Moscow (except for a national socialist one, which would try to force political reintegration) would probably attempt a modality under which CIS countries would remain independent politically but be dominated economically. No sane politician in Moscow would choose to take responsibility for managing both the surrounding weak economies and their turbulent societies as that would mean taking responsibilities off the shoulders of local leaderships and free them to blame Russia for all their ills. Russia also cannot afford total separation, nor a policy of benign negligence. In this model, Russia would play the role of first among equals in interstate relations in the CIS rather like the US in Nato, or Germany in the European Union -- but not big brother protecting and feeding his younger kin (though elements of these roles will remain). Russia will also have to continue to be a local peace keeper or peace enforcer. To do this effectively and avoid becoming a militaristic state, Russia needs two conditions fulfilled. First, her role as peace keeper should be legitimate; and second, it should be part of an international effort -- under the control of international organisations and constrained by international law. That would deter Moscow from unlimited use of military power and ultimately dangerous unilateralism. Russia is now beginning to act but neither as the former Communist enfant terrible nor as the terribly nice guy of the late Gorbachev early Yeltsin period. Is the west ready to part with this nice guy, this Mr Yes -- and work with an independent partner and prospective ally? I trust the answer will be in the affirmative -- though, of course, I well understand how nice it was to talk with Mr Yes.
