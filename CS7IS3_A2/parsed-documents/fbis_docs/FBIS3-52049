Alarcon, who is heading a Cuban delegation that began a visit to Belgium on Sunday, met this afternoon with the Foreign Economic Affairs Commission of the European Parliament headed by Belgian Liberal Deputy Willy de Clerq. During the meeting, De Clerq expressed the European Parliament's interest in increasing contacts with Cuba. He noted that he was one of the supporters of a resolution that rejected the U.S. blockade, which was approved at the European Parliament plenary meeting in Strasbourg last September. During an extensive, lengthy debate on various topics, the visitor stressed the need to expand cooperation and trade relations between Cuba and the EU and between Havana and the member-states of that supranational organization. Alarcon also met with Egon Klepsch, chairman of the European Parliament, who expressed interest in the current situation in Cuba, especially the economic reforms now taking place. At both meetings he underscored the importance that any economic measure to be adopted in the current circumstances in Cuba should have the broadest consensus of the people, who have been the basic historic backbone of the Cuban project. Among other activities, the Cuban leader attended a dinner with Belgian businessmen in which the new product line of Cohiba 1492 was presented by the Sutter Co. -- the Havana cigar distributor in the Benelux nations. Ramon Pez Ferro, secretary of the Foreign Relations Standing Committee of the National Assembly of the People's Government, and Rosario Navas, Cuban ambassador to Belgium and the EU, participated in today's meeting. Alarcon will stay in Belgium until 30 January. During his stay, he will meet with representatives of the Belgian Government, the parliament, and European political groups and friendship with Cuba associations.
