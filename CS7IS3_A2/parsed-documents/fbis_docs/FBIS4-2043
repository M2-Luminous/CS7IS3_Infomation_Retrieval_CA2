He pointed out: We should earnestly study and implement the spirit of the national conference of propaganda and ideological work, further unify our spirit, heighten our spirit, seize the whole situation, realistically conduct work, and vigorously create a new situation in propaganda and ideological work so as to create a much better ideological and media environment for the region to conduct reforms, to achieve development, to maintain stability, and to continuously boost its undertakings of reforms, opening up, and modernization. Wu Liji, deputy secretary of the autonomous regional party committee and vice chairman of the autonomous regional people's government, presided over the conference. Attending the conference were Qian Fenyong, Bai Enpei, Wang Zhan, Yang Enbo, Wuyunqimuge, Wang Duo, Liu Zuohui, Lin Yongsan, Zhang Zuocai, Wu En, and Yun Zhaoguang. The speech of Wang Qun is divided into the following three parts: 1) On the importance of doing a good job in conducting the propaganda and ideological work in the new historic period. 2) On several tasks for the current propaganda and ideological work. 3) On the enhancement of the party's leadership over the propaganda and ideological work. Wang Qun said: The fundamental guideline and major tasks put forward at the recent national conference of propaganda and ideological work have the distinctive characteristics of the age and represent a major and important policy decision made by the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core for implementing the principle of "building the two civilizations simultaneously and scoring achievements in both of them," and a strategic arrangement for ensuring victorious progress in building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Successfully implementing the spirit of the national conference by bearing in mind the region's reality has a great, important, and practical significance on implementing the work guideline made by the CPC Central Committee with regard to "seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, expanding opening up, promoting development, and maintaining stability;" on promoting the region's programs of reform, development, and stability; on training from generation to generation new successors with ideals, morality, cultural knowledge, and the sense of abiding by the discipline; on consolidating and developing socialist nationalities' relationship; and on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Wang Qun said: In carrying out the grand cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the propaganda and ideological front occupies an important position and is assuming the important tasks of providing spiritual motive force, ideological guarantee, and intellectual support for the cause. Enhancing the propaganda and ideological work has a specially important significance on the autonomous region. First, the region is located in the border area and its economy and culture are relatively backward. Its ideology is more or less of closed-door style and its tasks for reform and economic development are very heavy. Tasks for the region to emancipate minds and shift its concepts are more arduous than those of other provinces and regions. Second, 1994 will be the year in which China will issue most measures for reforms. Therefore, difficulties encountered by the region will be large and many. In particular, the people in Inner Mongolia that is being restricted by various conditions will become relatively weak in bearing the pressure of reforms and encounter much more ideological problems. Third, Inner Mongolia is a place to exercise the regional national autonomy as well as the key target of the disintegration strategy of today's hostile international forces. Under such a new situation and new task, we must all the more attach importance on propaganda and ideological work. Propaganda and ideological work must be improved and enhanced without any degree of weakening or stagnation. Wang Qun fully affirmed the achievements scored by Inner Mongolia in propaganda and ideological work, and, meanwhile, pointed out the shortcomings of the work. He said: To actually strengthen propaganda and ideological work, we should pay attention to the following three issues in understanding and practice: 1) Firmly embracing the concept of paying attention to both economic construction and political and ideological work; 2) profoundly understanding the idea that the "most serious mistake lies in education," and strengthening the sense of hardship; and 3) conscientiously implementing the measure of "being tough with both economic construction and political and ideological work." Wang Qun pointed out: At present and in the future, the fundamental tasks of the region's propaganda and ideological work are: Closely around the overall situation of "reform, development, unity, and stability," we should arm the masses with the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, spread propaganda among the masses with the party's basic line, principles, and policies, educate the masses with patriotic, collective, and socialist ideas, inspire the masses with the goal of reaching better-off standards of life and achieving common prosperity, seek unity of ideas among the masses, fortify the confidence of the masses, make the masses more united and enthusiastic, mobilize and give full play to the initiative and creativity of the masses and to their spirit of pioneering undertakings through hard work, and provide a good social and public opinion environment as well as a strong and effective ideological and political guarantee for realizing the region's fighting goals at two stages. Wang Qun dwelt on the major tasks for the current propaganda and ideological work from the following four aspects: 1) We should pay attention to theoretical study to make the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics strike root in the hearts of the people. Arming cadres and the masses with the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is the most important task for the current propaganda and ideological work as well as the key to achieve success in propaganda and ideological work. In theoretical study, an extremely important work for Inner Mongolia is to arm the vast numbers of cadres and the masses with the Marxist concept of nationalities and the party's policy towards nationalities. Through the realistic, profound, and extensive education on the theory and policy towards nationalities, we should strive to firmly grasp the basic viewpoints to clarify what is right and what is wrong for some major issues and then to form a common understanding. 2) We should correctly guide public opinions and gear public opinions to the work of deepening reform, accelerating development, and safeguarding stability. Correctly grasping the orientation of public opinions is aimed at mobilizing the people of all nationalities to take an active part in reform and the modernization drive. We should involve all sorts of propaganda means and media and do a realistic and effective work to propagate and implement among the masses the party's theory, line, principles, and policies during the new period, to tell the masses the current situation and tasks, and to clearly explain to the masses the new problems and new contradictions emerging in the process of reform so that we can provide strong and effective ideological and political guarantee for reform and opening up and can create a good public opinion environment for developing the economy, national unity, and social stability. 3) We should pay attention to ideological education and strive to advocate good mental outlook and social conduct. The basic purpose of intensifying ideological education is to train the new people who have lofty ideals and moral characters and who are better educated and self-disciplined. The current priority is to educate the vast number of cadres, the masses, and youths with the spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly as repeatedly advocated by Comrade Mao Zedong, the spirit of "having lofty ideals and moral characters and being better educated and self-disciplined" as repeatedly emphasized by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, and the 64-character pioneering spirit put forward by Comrade Jiang Zemin so that these kinds of spirit will become strong spiritual pillars of the endeavor of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the social conduct of the new period, and so that the erosion of corrupt ideas, such as money worship, pleasure-seeking, and ultra-individualism, can be more effectively resisted. 4) We should pay attention to literary and art creation and provide healthy and rich intellectual products to the people of various nationalities. In implementing the guidelines of the national propaganda and ideological work conference, the literary and art front should particularly do a good job in producing the outstanding literary and art works that advocate the main melody and reflect regional and national characteristics. Meanwhile, it should diversify the works to satisfy the ever growing spiritual and cultural needs of the people of various nationalities in the region. Wang Qun pointed out: Now that the major policies for propaganda and ideological work have been decided on, the key to the next step of work is to make sure that the guidelines of the party Central Committee and the autonomous regional party committee are implemented to the letter at the grass-roots levels. This requires that party committees at all levels further strengthen leadership over propaganda and ideological work, firmly hold the initiative in it, and make it more fruitful through down-to-earth and effective work. First, they should attach great importance to the party's propaganda and ideological work and gain the initiative in leading the work. While giving close attention to and achieving success in reform, opening up, and economic construction, party committees at all levels should conscientiously strengthen and improve leadership over propaganda and ideological work. They should include the work high in their agenda, conduct study of it on a regular basis, define the principles, tasks, and focuses of the work for certain periods, and devote more efforts to helping propaganda departments discuss and carry out major work and improve work level. Second, they should change work styles and pay close attention to implementation of work. Every department, unit, and comrade of the propaganda and ideological fronts should vigorously conduct investigation and study and seek truth from facts in the process of doing specific work. Third, they should strengthen coordination to rally forces to create a vivid situation in which the entire party and all quarters make concerted efforts to attend to propaganda and ideological work. Fourth, they should emancipate the mind, deepen reform, and invigorate the development of propaganda and cultural work. To strengthen party leadership over propaganda and ideological work, they should adhere to the principle of reform and, with reform as motivation, promote the entire propaganda and ideological work to a new level and new stage. Fifth, they should conscientiously step up efforts to improve the leading bodies and the personnel of propaganda and ideological departments. All the leading bodies and cadres of propaganda and ideological work departments should maintain political unity with the party Central Committee. The key to improving the personnel lies in improving the leading bodies of the propaganda and ideological fronts and turning them into leadership nucleuses that are unified in thinking, pure in party spirit, high-spirited, united, and truth-seeking. Party committees and governments at all levels should show concern for the comrades on the propaganda and ideological fronts in their political activities, thinking, work, and life and enable them to better develop their talents and continuously make new contributions. In conclusion, Wang Qun pointed out: Establishment of the socialist market economy system and the new situation and new tasks in attaining the two-stage targets defined by the autonomous regional party committee have set new and still higher demands on propaganda and ideological work and have also provided a broad room for the development of propaganda and ideological work. All leading cadres of the party and all comrades on the propaganda and ideological fronts should bravely shoulder the heavy responsibility entrusted them by this era, uplift spirit, enhance confidence, willingly work in a down-to-earth manner, have the courage in innovation, and strive to create a new situation in Inner Mongolia's propaganda and ideological work. Present at the conference were deputy secretaries of league and city party committees who were in charge of propaganda and ideological work; directors of the propaganda departments of league, city, banner, and county party committees; responsible comrades of league and city newspapers; directors of the propaganda departments of large industrial and mining enterprises and schools of higher learning; responsible comrades of the departments directly under the region; and relevant responsible comrades of the Liberation Army and people's armed police forces. Also present were the comrades attending the meeting on overseas propaganda, cultural, radio and television, and publication work; comrades attending the meeting on the education of party members; and comrades attending the advanced study class of the autonomous regional party school for leading cadres of leagues, cities, departments, and bureaus. At a preparatory meeting held on the evening of 1 March, Wang Zhan, deputy secretary of the autonomous regional party committee, gave a speech on the tasks, content, procedures, and requirements of the conference. Comrade Wuyunqimuge chaired the preparatory meeting.
