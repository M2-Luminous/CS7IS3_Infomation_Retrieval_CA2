In 1994 China will continue to strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control, and funds for the sugar wholesale market will be limited. China will strengthen price controls, and increases in retail prices will slow. China will strengthen management over the foreign exchange market, and the exchange rate between the renminbi and foreign currency will stabilize. These factors will be beneficial to stabilize the sugar market. 2. Sugar output will decline. In 1993 the sown area in major sugar-producing regions declined. It is estimated that during the 1993-1994 pressing season gross output will be 6.8 million tons, a decrease of 900,000 tons from the previous period. 3. Exports will decline. Because China's sugar prices are higher than the average international price, exports are unprofitable. In addition, domestic supplies are tight, therefore sugar exports will decline by about 700,000 tons. 4. Imports will remain at the same level as 1993. In 1994 international sugar prices will rise, and it will be difficult for China to increase import funds. 5. In 1994 demand will increase by 400,000 to 450,000 tons. However, because sugar prices will rise in 1994, demand is likely to decrease. Based on the above, in 1994 China's sugar supply will not meet demand, there will be a shortage of about 600,000 tons.
