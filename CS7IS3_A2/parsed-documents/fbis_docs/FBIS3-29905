Well-informed Washington sources confirmed on 22 February that the working-level contact between the United States and North Korea was held in New York, but did not give details of the negotiations. Today's contact was held upon the request of North Korea. Tom Hubbard, deputy assistant secretary of the U.S. State Department, and Ho Chong, deputy chief of North Korean Permanent Mission to the United Nations were present. It has been learned that in today's contact North Korea delivered a letter from Kang Sok-chu, vice minister of the North Korean Foreign Ministry, in reply to a letter from Assistant Secretary Robert Gallucci, and asked for a clear and early expression of the U.S. stance on follow-up steps, including the suspension of the Team Spirit exercise and the schedule for the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks. The U.S. side expressed grave concern over the delay in issuing visas for the IAEA inspection team and reiterated its stance that the United States would set a date and begin full-scale preparations for the third round of the talks once the inspection begins and North-South dialogue resumes.
