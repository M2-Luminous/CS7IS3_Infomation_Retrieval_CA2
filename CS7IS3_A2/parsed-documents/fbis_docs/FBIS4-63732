"Of course, Ukraine's Supreme Council has demonstrated its striving to proceed, as soon as possible, to considering topical problems in the life of our society in order to open up a wide road for economic reforms." This is the general assessment of the beginning of the work of the session given by Ivan Plyushch. "However, no matter how much we would want to separate politics from the economy and the economy from politics, it is impossible because it is meaningless to expect that economic reforms will be implemented before political reforms are completed." Nor can we bypass organizational questions. One of them, in the opinion of Ivan Plyushch, is the approval of powers of the deputies by the credentials committee, as is stipulated by the Constitution. It is only after the mandates of the deputies are approved that decrees and laws adopted by the parliament may be considered valid. I. Plyushch stressed that the provisional credentials committee acted in conformity with the current legislation and in conformity with the constitution. It made a proposal, but the discussion and voting did not proceed quite consistently. As Ivan Stepanovych [Plyushch] pointed out, it was not quite ethical either. It would have been correct if, after recognizing the powers of the 331 deputies, the parliament had resolved to adopt the decree as a foundation and put its every item to the vote. The deviations from the procedure and procedural violations led to an ethical failure. The voting results could be the same, but the procedures would be observed. However, it so happened that the results were not achieved in the best possible way, and the parliament could be accused of excessive politicization, settlement of accounts, and unconstitutional character. However, on the last day of the past working week, the parliament adopted the right decision, having authorized the provisional credentials committee to continue clarifying the reasons why elections in electoral districts Nos. 367 and 300 were considered to be valid or invalid and then adopt an ultimate decision. As regards those clauses in the Ukrainian presidential message to the parliament where the inexpediency of holding elections of local power bodies and presidential elections is argued, Ivan Plyushch, in his talk with the journalists, chronologically accounted for the course of arriving at the decision on holding parliamentary, local council, and presidential elections. He recalled, in particular, L. Kravchuk's statement on the need for such elections. L. Kravchuk said the following: My opinion is that, taking into account the difficult situation and the fact that all branches of power do not have sufficient authority and, one can even say, that they have a very low prestige, it is necessary to hold elections at all levels. It is normal. That is why, to resolve this question, we must adopt, in this audience, a decree on early elections to all branches of power, including the president. Let us not waste time and not make allusions as to who is to blame and who is not to blame. People themselves will make a choice: If they elect left-wingers, the left wing will come to power; if they elect right-wingers, the right wing will come to power; if they elect centrists, then centrists will come to power and will govern Ukraine. The main thing is to have a state. There were also the following words by the Ukrainian president: "Before my voters and before the whole nation, I declare from the Supreme Council's podium that, on the day when the new parliament convenes for its first session, I will turn to it with a request to organize Ukrainian presidential elections." Now, stressed I. Plyushch, read Leonid Makarovych [Kravchuk]'s appeal to the parliament and you will see whether he seeks to organize or rather disorganize elections, something that he has been doing for the last three months. In January, when the Supreme Council discussed the question on holding a referendum on the main constitutional principles of organizing the state power and Leonid Makarovych was already at the Supreme Council's podium, a deputy asked him a question: "Will you agree to being re-elected as president in June?" L. Kravchuk: "The Supreme Council has adopted a decree." Voices from the audience: "Will there be presidential elections?" L. Kravchuk: "This is not up to me to decide, this question has already been resolved. The Supreme Council adopted a decree. Why are you asking me? The question has been resolved." I remind you that that was on 25 January. Now, I will tell you that in his recent interview, Leonid Makarovych pointed out that, over one or one and one-half years he had been hearing demands at the Supreme Council that powers be divided among the president and the head of government. So, I did everything in order to have a single head of executive power. If there had been 300 votes in favor of making the prime minister head of executive power, something that I hoped would happen by 12 April, I wouldn't have cared about presidential elections at all. However, after 12 April, I became firmly convinced that this would not be approved by 300 votes. That is why presidential elections will take place. Taking into account those contestants who were on the list, I believed that I also had reasons to be an alternative to them. Asked whether he thought about a future state model, Ivan Plyushch pointed out that he considered the question inappropriate and referred the journalists to materials of the session of the 11th convocation that was held in February 1990; they are included in the book "Who Are We and Where Are We Going?" That far back, Ivan Plyushch was in favor of further democratization and glasnost in our life; he insisted upon putting an end to violation of objective economic laws, adopting state acts on land and on property, investing our sovereignty with real content, and building relations within a free union of states. "We are not Germany, not France, not the United States, and not Canada. We are Ukraine with its own specific characteristics, mentality, people, and consciousness," continued Plyushch. "However, if we say that success lies in federalization, this will be incorrect as also incorrect is the statement that success lies in a unitary state. L. Kravchuk said that the Union was a federation, and look what it led to. I do not share his opinion, since had the Union been a federation, as was stipulated in the 1922 agreement, it would, perhaps, never disintegrate. In accordance with that agreement, Ukraine had the right to have its own armed forces, not to mention other things. However, are we, today, ready for a federation? We are not ready. The development of productive forces and the structure of production are such that they will not make it possible to have a federation in its classical form. However, this does not mean that we should never strive to achieve normal development of productive forces in regions or should not cultivate attitudes of masters and citizens among the population. All of our misfortunes are due to the fact that, instead of the Moscow center, we have created a Kiev one and that we are trying to copy everything. Why are we afraid of regional initiative or of delegating powers? It is necessary to grant such powers at a legislative level within oblasts with the help of which it would be possible to resolve an overwhelming majority of local problems and not to go to Kiev for that. I worked as head of an oblast executive committee for six years. At that time, the oblast annually transferred millions [monetary unit not specified] to the republican budget, and then, over a year, we received less than 10 percent of that money. It took me a lot of time to beg the authorities for those funds." I. Plyushch expressed a conviction that [presidential] elections will be held: "Four or five persons have been nominated as candidates for council chairmen at various levels. There are five persons for every deputy seat. That is why there is no logic in postponing the elections. Besides, presidential representatives are ready to run for council chairmen. Therefore, it is already impossible to disrupt elections, also presidential ones. I have proposed my candidacy, so that my conscience before Ukraine would be clear, since there are citizens who share my opinions, and I cannot betray them. I do not undertake to forecast the outcome of the elections. No matter whom I will have to contend, I will fight to the very end." During the meeting, Ivan Plyushch also detailed his thoughts on other problems of the state -- economic, political, and ecological.
