FR940826-1-00040 FR940826-1-00008 Typically, a patient undergoes dialysis three times a week. A facility may furnish a substantial number of treatments to patients who dialyze less frequently than three times a week. As a result, the facility typically has higher per treatment cost because the treatments involve increased labor or supplies. When this occurs, a facility may apply for an exception to the composite rate. Organ Acquisition Costs Under §412.113, Medicare pays for heart, kidney, and liver acquisition costs incurred by transplant centers on a reasonable cost basis. Currently, Medicare-certified transplant centers compute Medicare acquisition costs for hearts and livers on Supplemental Worksheet D&hyph;6 of the Hospital Cost Report (Form HCFA&hyph;2552). The average acquisition costs of hearts and livers transplanted in patients other than Medicare beneficiaries are deducted from the total acquisition costs for all hearts and livers. Medicare reimburses the remaining balance as program costs for these organs. Based on recent cost analyses, we are concerned about the very high Medicare costs associated with acquiring a small number of hearts and livers. As a result, we propose to change the method of computing heart and liver acquisition costs to more accurately determine the costs of acquiring organs transplanted in Medicare recipients. The method we propose for computing acquisition costs for hearts and livers conforms to the method used for kidneys because the kidney formula more fairly accounts for Medicare's portion of such costs, including organ wastage. The kidney formula is specified in §413.202. II. Proposed Revisions End Stage Renal Disease Payment Exception Requests On several occasions, we have denied exception requests based on application of the criteria contained in our PRM, and the facilities have appealed the denials; subsequently some denials have been overturned by the Provider Reimbursement Review Board (PRRB) because the PRRB is not bound by the guidelines in the PRM. Therefore, we are proposing to place in regulations the specific requirements for determining exceptions. We are proposing the conditions contained in the PRM, with explanations in this preamble, that a facility must meet to qualify for a payment exception and the criteria that we use to evaluate whether the facility meets the conditions. We propose to revise 42 CFR Part 413, Subpart H, Payment for ESRD Services. Currently, all our rules for payment for covered outpatient maintenance dialysis treatments are in §413.170. We propose to reorganize the content of Subpart H and divide existing §413.170 into several smaller sections so that readers can more easily locate specific topics. Following is a list of the new sections: ␣ 1New section 1Old section 413.170␣Scope 413.170(a) 413.172␣Principles of Prospective Payment 413.170(b) 413.174␣Prospective rates for hospital based and independent ESRD facilities 413.170(c) 413.176␣Amount of payments 413.170(d) 413.178␣Bad debts 413.170(e) 413.180␣Procedures for requesting exceptions to payment rates 413.170(f) 413.182␣Criteria for approval of exception requests 413.170(g) 413.184␣Payment exception: Atypical service intensity (patient mix) 413.170(g)(1) 413.186␣Payment exception: Isolated essential facility 413.170(g)(2) 413.188␣Payment exception: Extraordinarycircumstances 413.170(g)(4) 413.190␣Payment exception: Self-dialysistraining costs 413.170(g)(5) 413.192␣Payment exception: Frequency of dialysis 413.170(g)(6) 413.194␣Appeals 413.170(h) 413.196␣Notification of changes in rate-setting methodologies and payment rates 413.170(i) 413.198␣Recordkeeping and cost reporting requirements for outpatient maintenance dialysis 413.174 413.200␣Payment of independent organ procurement organizations and histocompatibility laboratories 413.178 413.202␣Organ procurement organizations' (OPOs') or transplant centers' costs for kidneys sent to foreign countries or transplanted in patients other than Medicare beneficiaries 413.179 Below we discuss the proposed content of Subpart H.
