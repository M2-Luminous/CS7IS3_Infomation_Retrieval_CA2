Their voluble talk about "outflow of money" is totally unfounded fabrication. It is a product of their persistent intrigues against the DPRK and Chongnyon. Their allegation that colossal funds amounting to several hundred billion yen flow to the DPRK from Japan annually is based on false materials provided by the modern Korea institute, an anti-DPRK, anti-Chongnyon plot-breeding organization. This is, indeed, a preposterous, trash which could be invented by two-bit shysters accustomed to telling a lie. They, above all, give am extravagant overestimation of the number of Japan-resident Koreans visiting the homeland and are misleading the public opinion with the talk that they have been donating a large amount of money to the homeland. This is the height of folly. It is unimaginable for the DPRK, a powerful socialist country, to receive money from Chongnyon, its overseas Koreans' organization, and the whole world knows that the DPRK Government has sent a large amount of educational aid fund and stipends to Chongnyon for the children of Koreans in Japan. As far as the joint-venture factories run by Korean traders and manufacturers in Japan in the homeland are concerned, it is a matter of their legitimate rights as businessmen. This notwithstanding, the Japanese reactionaries are misleading the public opinion in a bid to create the impression that the DPRK is getting along with the "funds" leaking from Japan. This is an intolerable insult to the DPRK. The DPRK has owed nothing to Japan up until now. It has lived and can live without Japan's help, and is able to live by its own efforts. Under the revolutionary banner of self-reliance we have built a powerful socialist country of independence, self-sustenance and self-reliance in national defence, not affected by any fluctuation of the situation, and are proudly exalting its grand might. The Japanese reactionaries' anti-DPRK intrigue is an outcome of the consciousness of crisis of those who are dazed at the might and indestructibility of the anthropocentric Korean-style socialist system. In fabricating the preposterous "outflow of money" fiction reversing the stark reality they seek an aim to tarnish the international image of the DPRK, a highly dignified country, and find an excuse for suppressing Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan. It is not a happenstance that they launched into a frenzied anti-DPRK false propaganda at a time when the United States and seditious forces were unhesitatingly driving the situation on the Korean peninsula to an extremely dangerous, catastrophic crisis on the pretext of the fictitious "nuclear problem" of the DPRK. Exasperating, indeed, is the despicable talk about fictitious "outflow of money" of the Japanese reactionaries who still do not intend at all to make an apology and adequate compensation for their disgraceful past in which they had inflicted immeasurable misfortunes and hardships upon the Korean people, including the "comfort women for the army" issue. Their talk about "checking" the "outflow of money", a mere fiction, is a ridiculous hokum of those seized with schizophrenia. They must act with discretion, clearly mindful that if they persist in intrigues against the DPRK, working in collusion with the United States, no good results would await them.
