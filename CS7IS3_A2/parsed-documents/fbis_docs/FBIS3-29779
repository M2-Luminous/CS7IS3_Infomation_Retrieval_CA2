[Mori] There was no option left to the LDP. We had our backs to the wall. Two cabinets have collapsed under LDP rule for failing to achieve political reform. Consequently, the LDP also failed to maintain its lower house majority. For all that, could we still continue to put off settlement of this issue? No, we could not do that. This was the time to end the political reform impasse. The move for a compromise between the ruling coalition and the LDP began when lower house Speaker Takako Doi proposed a mediation plan. However, the whole thing started when the upper house rejected the reform bills. All was the disposition of God. [Oikawa] The new electoral system is a combination of single-seat constituencies and proportional representation. What is the merit of introducing such a system? [Mori] An electoral system should exist for the sake of the public, and not for the benefit of politicians. If we want to keep the new system for a while as a transitional system, the partial introduction of proportional representation seats is unavoidable. This time, the less powerful upper house played a significant role, by rejecting the unconvincing political reform package presented by the coalition government. This fact is very important, because it proves the significance of the existence of a two-chamber system. [Oikawa] How soon will the political reform bills be revised and enacted by the regular Diet session? [Mori] It is better to strike while the iron is hot. The amendments should be passed as soon as possible, before the Diet starts deliberations on the budget bill for fiscal 1994. [Oikawa] Is there no problem inside the party? [Mori] The LDP is a mature party. All the party members will follow once the decision is made. What we want is to initiate a proper system as soon as possible. Once the fiscal 1994 budget bill is placed on the agenda, we will be able to give details on the partial revision of the political reform bills. [Oikawa] Will the LDP take any punitive action against its reform-shy members who disobeyed the leadership? [Mori] I am not sure whether they really wanted to oppose the reform package, because they just abstained from voting by not attending the plenary session. We may say that it was a discreet act on their part: they took care not to make the situation worse, while expressing their will in some way. There is no need to call them to account. [Oikawa] Is there a possibility of a party split? [Mori] I cannot say whether there is such a possibility or not. When the LDP was in a delicate situation because of the sharp divisions between pro-reform and reform-shy camps, both of them said that united action was indispensable. So, President Yohei Kono and I once thought that there would be no other way but to let the bills die. We were able of avoid a party split, and that was really a disposition of providence. [Oikawa] LDP lawmakers elected from urban districts are expected to have a tough time in the next election under the new system. Do you not think that these members might leave the party? [Mori] We have to find a way so that 80 to 90 percent of incumbent LDP lawmakers can be reelected, because those who may withdraw from the party are mostly concerned about reelection. To cope with the new electoral system, we will soon discuss how to prepare for the next election by reorganizing the party and creating a new structure. [Oikawa] Some people say that President Kono is planning to support the government from outside the cabinet or to form a grand alliance with the ruling coalition. Is this true? [Mori] The collaboration between the ruling coalition and the opposition LDP brought about the settlement of the much-awaited issue. The public should feel relieved to see both forces arriving at a compromise after a long quarrel. I cannot definitely say that the LDP is planning to support the government from outside the cabinet. I can only say that President Kono has made many suggestive remarks.
