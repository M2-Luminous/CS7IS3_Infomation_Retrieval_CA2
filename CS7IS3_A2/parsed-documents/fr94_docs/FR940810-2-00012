FR940810-2-00012 FR940810-2-00009 [C&hyph;307&hyph;810] Final Negative Countervailing Duty Determination: Phthalic Anhydride From Venezuela AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 10, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kristin M. Heim, Office of Countervailing Investigations, Import Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Room B099, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 10130; telephone (202) 482&hyph;3798. Final Determination Case History Since the publication of the preliminary negative determination in the Federal Register (59 FR 3842, January 27, 1994) the following events have occurred. On March 4, 1994, we published a notice aligning this investigation with the companion antidumping duty investigation in the Federal Register (59 FR 10372). We conducted verification from March 22 through 25, 1994. A case brief was filed by petitioners on June 1, 1994, and a rebuttal brief was filed by Oxidor on June 10, 1994. A public hearing was not requested. Scope of Investigation For purposes of this investigation, phthalic anhydride (``PA'') is an aromatic synthetic organic chemical usually produced from a primary petrochemical called orthoxylene, although sometimes it is produced from naphthalene. PA is predominately used in the production of plasticizers, unsaturated polyester resins, and alkyd resins, which in turn are generally used to produced plastics and paints. The subject PA is produced in two physical forms, molten and flaked. The PA subject to this investigation is currently classified under subheading 2917.35.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). The HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes. Our written description of the scope of this investigation is dispositive. Injury Test On August 31, 1990, Venezuela became a contracting party to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Since a country cannot qualify as a ``country under the Agreement'' under section 701(b)(3) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (``the Act'') if it is a contracting party to the GATT, Venezuela is no longer eligible for treatment as a ``country under the Agreement'' within the meaning of section 701(b)(3) of the Act. However, because Venezuela is a GATT contracting party and the merchandise under investigation is non-dutiable, the ITC is required to determine whether, pursuant to section 303(a)(2) of the Act, imports of the merchandise from Venezuela materially injure, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry. On December 1, 1993, the ITC preliminary determined that there is a reasonable indication that an industry in the United States is threatened with material injury by reason of imports of PA from Venezuela.
