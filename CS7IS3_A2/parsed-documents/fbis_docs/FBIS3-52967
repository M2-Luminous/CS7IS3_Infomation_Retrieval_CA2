['Ashrawi] It is not a matter of individuals. We have a leadership that has not lived in its own country, with its own people, with a system of accountability, of control, and critical commentary for a long time. It has to change from being a liberation movement to a governmental system. The working methods and thinking patterns of the past are no longer valid. An internal reform is necessary. This transition will be very painful, and a number of mistakes have already been made. During the next phase we must ensure that the new government respects citizens' rights and is truly democratic, that we do not follow the example of many Third World countries wherein a monolithic authority puts itself, not the people, at the center. [Segenreich] Is 'Arafat accumulating too many offices, too much power? ['Ashrawi] Of course, the PLO leadership should be more open and more democratic. It should decentralize and enable co-determination on the basis of talents and capacities. The old decisionmaking process is no longer valid. We need efficiency, openness, and control. Whether the PLO is capable of effecting this change remains to be seen. The real test will come after the introduction of self-rule. [Segenreich] A group of Palestinian businessmen and a delegation led by Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi recently presented suggestions for reforms in Tunis. Do you support this pressure on 'Arafat? ['Ashrawi] I support the principle. Some time ago, a group of Palestinians from the occupied territories -- mainly delegates to the negotiations -- went to Tunis and worked out suggestions and structures there, such as criteria for appointing people to public offices. These suggestions were presented to 'Arafat; he agreed to them -- but, unfortunately they have not been put into practice. [Segenreich] Should the key positions be given to people from among the PLO leadership in Tunis, or to local leaders? ['Ashrawi] There should be a good mix. The people who have permanently lived in a coherent Palestinian society should get an effective say. They are entitled to this because they have worked here under the most difficult circumstances and have gained the people's confidence. No group should exert power at the cost of another. [Segenreich] Is it right that just before Palestinian autonomy should come into effect there have been little preparations, and there is almost a state of chaos? ['Ashrawi] This is an exaggeration. There is no chaos, but we are not all that well-prepared, either. Some administrative authorities and economic institutions are already in existence, but they are not prepared to such an extent that we could take over business tomorrow. It will be a difficult process, we will have to grow into the job. We will have to make use of the technical knowledge of those who worked in the Israeli military administration, we will also have to use the enormous human resources of Palestinians all over the world and use their talents in establishing our nation, without any nepotism. [Segenreich] What do you think the schedule will be for introducing autonomy? Some people say that the necessary time should be spent over this, since a good agreement is more important than a good schedule. ['Ashrawi] A flexible schedule would be very dangerous. The withdrawal of Israeli troops should be concluded by 13 April, even if it is begun with a delay. And the elections have to be held before 13 July. This is the test of both sides' credibility and of the real democratic nature of the new regime.
