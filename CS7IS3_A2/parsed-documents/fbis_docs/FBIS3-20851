This year, additional applications, which are routinely processed by the Slovak Ministry of Interior, are being received. Those that come from the Czech Republic get preferential treatment. According to the ministry, two or three applications on the average arrive daily, and their processing takes approximately one month. Slovak authorities demand that applicants furnish their birth and marriage certificates, an extract from the crime register, and a certificate verifying their permanent residence in the Slovak Republic. Bratislava has so far not made available any statistics on the number of Slovaks who have, up to now, requested that their Slovak citizenship be supplanted by Czech citizenship.
