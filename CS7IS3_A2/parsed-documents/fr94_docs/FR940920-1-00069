FR940920-1-00069 FR940920-1-00008 The Act requires the promulgation of performance standards under section 111 for categories of new and existing stationary sources that may contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. Section 129 of the Act specifies that NSPS and emission guidelines must be developed for MWC's in accordance with the requirements of sections 111 and 129. Section 129(a)(2) provides that emission guidelines for existing MWC's reflect the maximum degree of reduction in emissions of designated air pollutants, taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emission reduction, and any non-air-quality health and environmental impacts and energy requirements that Administrator determines is achievable for a particular category of sources (this standard is commonly referred to as ``maximum achievable control technology, or ``MACT''). Additionally, section 129 provides that the emissions limitations in the guidelines for existing MWC's may not be less stringent than the average emissions limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of units in the category. This is referred to as the ``MACT floor.'' According to sections 111(d) and 129(b), States must submit to the Administrator, within 1 year of the EPA's promulgation of the guidelines, a plan that accomplishes the following: (1) Establishes for existing sources emission standards for designated pollutants; and (2) provides for implementation and enforcement of the emission standards. Section 129(b) provides that a State plan for existing MWC's be at least as protective as the emission guidelines. As specified in section 129 of the Act, States are required to submit to the Administrator a plan implementing the emission guidelines within 1 year after the promulgation of the guidelines. This proposal further requires that a State plan shall provide that each unit subject to the guidelines shall be in compliance with all requirements of the State plan within 3 years following issuance of a revised construction or operation permit, if a permit modification is required, or within 3 years following approval of the State plan, if a permit modification is not required. Section 60.24(e)(1) of subpart B of part 60 requires that any compliance schedule extending more than 1 year from adoption of a State plan shall include legally enforceable increments of progress to achieve compliance for each designated facility. The proposed emission guidelines include this requirement. This proposed compliance schedule is more comprehensive than the compliance schedule and timetable specified in the subpart Ca emission guidelines promulgated on February 11, 1991 (56 FR 5514). The Act specifies that the procedure for State submission of a plan shall be similar to the procedure for submission of State implementation plans under section 110. Section 129 specifies that the EPA, in reviewing State plans for any variation from the emission guidelines, must ensure that State plans and their resulting MWC control requirements are at least as protective as the EPA guidelines, including incorporation of the compliance scheduling requirements established by the guidelines. The Act also provides that the EPA shall prescribe a plan according to procedures similar to those in section 110(c) if a State fails to submit a ``satisfactory plan.'' Moreover, States that believe additional control is desirable may require more extensive controls, which might have the effect of closing otherwise marginal facilities or banning a particular category of sources outright.
