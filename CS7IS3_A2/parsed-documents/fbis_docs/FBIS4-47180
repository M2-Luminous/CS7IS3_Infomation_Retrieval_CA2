FBIS4-47180 "jpusr067___94027" FBIS-USR-94-067 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 19 May 1994 BALTIC STATES LITHUANIA State Press Enterprise Privatized State Press Enterprise Privatized 944K1376C Vilnius TIESA in Lithuanian 19 May 94 p 2 944K1376C Vilnius TIESA Lithuanian CSO ["A Declaration by the Lithuanian Periodical Press Publishers Association (LSA)"] [Text] The state enterprise for press distribution "Lithuania's Press" (not included in the list of specific state enterprises), which as a monopoly set prices unjustified by economic considerations for its services in connection with the selling of the press, increased its joint stock through excess profits, and on 24 March 1994 registered with the Vilnius city government as a joint stock company. A privately owned company has become an organization controlling a critically important service, the retail trade in newspapers and magazines. "Lithuania's Press," which has been dictating unfavorable terms to the periodical press (a faulty system of settling accounts, in which the sellers are compensated for only 12000060100f the loss from unsold periodicals, limits placed an the distribution of new periodicals, etc.), is now escaping government control. Since there is no alternative system of distributing the press -- to create it requires large capital investments -- the privatization of this enterprise changes in an essential way the situation of the press in our country. Not only hundreds of press kiosks in the best locations in Lithuanian cities and small towns became the shareholders' property, paid for from residual profits, but also one of the largest buildings in Lithuania -- the multistory house on Laisves Prospectas in Vilnius -- another large piece of state property. A group of people now has the right to decide which periodicals to disseminate and which ones not to. Newspapers and magazines are left unprotected against arbitrary actions by the distributors, dividing periodicals into "good" and "bad," creating a precondition for censorship of the press; the press may lose the common equality under which it operates in the marketplace. There is no guarantee that one fine day we won't be left without newspapers -- it is the intent of the stockholders to change the profile of the enterprise's activities (the heads of "Lithuania's Press" have explained more than once that it is more profitable to sell beer and cigarettes than periodicals). The newspaper and magazine publishers are uneasy about the fact that a monopoly service is given over to private hands. The distribution of the press in our country is becoming unpredictable. A threat has appeared to the economic and political freedoms of the press, to the entire free press, the guarantee of democracy and stability of the country.
