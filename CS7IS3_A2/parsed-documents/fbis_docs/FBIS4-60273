As has been the custom to date, all diplomatic and political meetings with official Palestinian figures will continue being arranged through the responsible Orient House figures. This arrangement is not an organizational procedure but rather a measure designed to emphasize Jerusalem's place in the Palestinians' political doctrine and to reiterate the need to discuss the status of Jerusalem in due time. Remarks in this spirit were made yesterday by Faysal al-Husayni at a special meeting with Jerusalem-based foreign consuls held at Orient House. Al-Husayni told the consuls who attended the meeting that according to the Palestinian procedures, all of their activities or those of official envoys from their countries will be arranged through the Palestinian center in East Jerusalem. Formal contacts will be always held in Jerusalem. Visits to the self-rule territory will be coordinated through and with the Jerusalem office. DAVAR has been informed by al-Husayni's office that the consuls voiced their approval of the arrangement.
