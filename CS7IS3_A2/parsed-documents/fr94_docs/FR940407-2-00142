FR940407-2-00142 FR940407-2-00075 In support of its petition FBC attached a letter from UCC, dated January 17, 1994. The UCC letter describes the results of tests it performed on samples of the subject brake fluid: Specifically with regard to the DOT ``Fluidity and Appearance at Low Temperature'' test (FMVSS 116, Section 5.1.7), Union Carbide Corporation, using the DOT FMVSS 116 procedure, performed the test at ^40 C ○ for 6 days [144 hours] and ^50 ○C for 6 hours. Following completion of the tests: _At ^40 ○C for 6 days, the sample passed all requirements. The sample met the requirements for appearance at low temperature, bubble travel time and room temperature appearance-fluidity properties. _At ^50 ○C for 6 hours, the sample passed the requirements of bubble travel time and room temperature appearance-fluidity properties. Upon completion of the 6 hours at ^50 ○C, some crystallization was noted in the sample. _Attempts were made to isolate the crystallized material. It was soft, non-abrasive gel that was difficult to isolate as it flowed with the brake fluid. Union Carbide Corporation also conducted the test of FMVSS 116, §5.1.7 on the sample with rigorous temperature control at ^49 ○C # 2 ○C to more closely realize the ^48 ○C limit of the test's specified temperature range §5.1.7 test parameter: ^50 ○C # 2 ○C). The sample was clear, showed no crystals, had a bubble travel time of approximately 5 seconds and regained its appearance and fluidity at room temperature. These results were confirmed by a second run at the same conditions. The Pour Point of the sample was measured according to the method of ASTM D97. [The] lowest temperature at which movement in the liquid could be observed was determined to be ^62 ○C. From the results obtained and observations made, we are confident that this brake fluid will perform and provide braking under the low temperature conditions of the FMVSS 116 standard, §5.1.7 and offer the following reasons in support of this: _The fluid passed the ^40 ○C/6 day fluidity and appearance test. _The fluid showed appropriate viscosity at low temperature (^40 ○C). _The fluid showed appropriate viscosity at ^50 ○C (bubble travel time of [approximately 5 seconds against a requirement of 35 seconds [maximum]). _Any crystallization observed was a soft, non-abrasive gel that flowed with the brake fluid. Further, the phenomenon is fully reversible. _The Pour Point of the sample was measured as ^62 ○C. Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments on the petition of FBC, described above. Comments should refer to the docket number and be submitted to: Docket Section, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Room 5109, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC, 20590. It is requested but not required that six copies be submitted. All comments received before the close of business on the closing date indicated below will be considered. The application and supporting materials, and all comments received after the closing date will also be filed and will be considered to the extent possible. When the petition is granted or denied, the notice will be published in the Federal Register pursuant to the authority indicated below. Comment closing date: May 9, 1994. Authority: 15 U.S.C. 1417; delegations of authority at 49 CFR 1.50 and 49 CFR 501.8. Issued on: April 1, 1994. Barry Felrice, Associate Administrator for Rulemaking.
