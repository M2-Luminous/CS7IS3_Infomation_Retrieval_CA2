FBIS3-47333 "dreas008__a94021" FBIS-EAS-94-008-A Document Type:Daily Report 12 January 1994 ANNEX Japan Pump-Priming Package To Include Housing Loans OW1001143294 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 9 Jan 94 Morning Edition p 1 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1001143294 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] As part of the new pump-priming package which will be announced in mid-January, the government will provide additional housing loans to 50,000 to 70,000 households. To raise funds for the program, expenditures for public investments will be added by over 1 trillion yen in the supplementary budget for fiscal 1993. In line with the tax cut plans for those who repair or change their houses, the government intends to offer the housing loan program as a centerpiece of the pump-priming package. Since the Japanese economy is still "fluctuating," (as noted by the Economic Planning Agency), the government wants to maintain high levels of housing investments. In the initial 1993 budget, the Housing Loan Corporation [HLC] provided a loans for 550,000 households. After that, the government hammered out pump-primming packages twice in April and September 1993, and expanded the quota by 50,000 and 100,000, respectively. As a result, the HLC loans became available for 700,000 households this fiscal year, and this was an unprecedented level. Yet, applicants are eagerly filling the expanded quota because of low interest rates. Under such circumstances, the government has decided to further promote housing policy by drastically expanding the loan quota. This is because promotion of housing policies is in accord with "consumer-oriented" political posture of the Hosokawa administration. The government is planning to offer housing loans to 50,000 to 70,000 more households in the supplementary 1993 budget. When the Construction Ministry made the fiscal 1994 budget request last August, the quota for the housing loans in 1994 was set at 560,000 households. However, Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi recently said that he intends to expand the quota to "over 600,000." In this regard, the size of the 1993 supplementary budget is expected to be finalized in view of the 1994 HLC program.
