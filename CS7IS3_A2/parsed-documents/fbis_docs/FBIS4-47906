Yesterday evening three UNAMIR [UN Aid Mission in Rwanda] soldiers were injured during shelling of the airport, and seven Rwandans were also injured as the UN attempted to evacuate them from a hotel in the town center. [passage omitted] In neighboring Tanzania, since yesterday the UN special representative has been stepping up his informal talks with the warring sides. Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh was due to go to Kampala this morning to meet the Ugandan president and then return to Arusha. The Rwandan Patriotic Front, RPF, for its part has already described any possible intervention by foreign troops in Rwanda as too late and pointless, because, the RPF says, the genocide has already been committed. This is a view which is not shared by the planning minister of the interim government. Speaking on a stopover in Dakar, he called for rapid intervention by a foreign force. Augustin Ngirabatware was speaking to Nicolas Balique: [Begin Ngirabatware recording] I am issuing an appeal to the international community to help the people. We also expect the international community to use its powers of persuasion with the RPF to make it understand that only a peaceful solution will allow Rwandans to live together. Third, this international force -- which should be neutral but very effective -- should be deployed in Rwanda as rapidly as possible -- this is extremely urgent -- in order to help the government and the RPF to maintain the cease-fire, and to permit the negotiations to begin again; and speaking about a neutral, effective international force, the Rwandan Government does not rule out any country, but we believe that in any case, as far as any direct or indirect involvement is concerned, the official armed forces of Uganda should not participate in it, and the Burundi Army should not participate in it. As far as the Belgian Army is concerned, I believe that Belgium has already decided not to take part in this kind of force in Rwanda. [end recording] [passage omitted]
