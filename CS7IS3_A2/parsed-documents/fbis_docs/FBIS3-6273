The variety of crops cultivated and applied in agriculture has increased three times over the past thirty years since the publication of the socialist rural theses (February 1964). Methods of farming suitable for different areas and soil have been completed on the principle of the right crop in the right time and the right crop on the right soil. Noteworthy is the completion of the method of farming on the northern highlands 1,000 to 1,400 metres above sea level and of the two-crop farming method in South Hwanghae and Kangwon Provinces and other areas with a relatively mild weather. Along with this, scientific and technological problems have been satisfactorily solved in the irrigation, comprehensive mechanization and extensive application of chemicals in agriculture. The study and development of various kinds of chemical fertilizers and herbicides suited to conditions for the growth of crops raised their qualitative composition. A large number of modern farm machines have been invented and introduced and nearly all farm work is done with the help of machines. The great leader President Kim Il-song, always paying deep attention to the development of the nation's agriculture, saw to it that chuche-based agro-science research institutions were set up. More than 180 branches and experimental farms have been built in all provinces since the agro-science research centre was built in December 1948. Training centres for agro-scientists and technicians were built up. Hundreds of thousands of agro-scientists and experts are active in the agricultural sector. The development of agro-science brought about a rapid growth of agricultural production. Over the past thirty years after the publication of the rural theses the production of grain increased 1.9 times, of which rice 1.8 times and maize 2.2 times. The number of tractors and lorries engaged in the agricultural domain increased six and five times respectively. The amount of chemical fertilizers per hectare rose to more than two tons from 300 kilograms.
