Just as we announced, the Justice and Peace Commission prepared a preliminary statement in which it stated its position regarding the president's actions on Thursday, 14 April. This position was a preliminary one in compliance with the regulations of the permanent consultative body. The permanent consultative body, created under the auspices of the electoral ethical agreement, is made up of the representatives of the political parties that signed the agreement under the presidency of the Justice and Peace Commission. We brought this position, this preliminary statement, before the consultative body with the intention of reaching a collective position. After the meeting, where I must recognize that the efforts were to enrich the document, I must also point out that the statement we are making now is an exclusive statement by the Justice and Peace Commission, because a collective statement was not reached among all the members of the permanent consultative body according to the regulation. I am going to read the statement and once I finish, I will make some observations. Statement by the Justice and Peace Commission: As for the appearance of the president of the Republic in a national network on 14 April, the Justice and Peace Commission states its position given the commitment it has made for the promotion of a participatory and respectful election process that is free of violence. No one can disregard the past, which must be completely analyzed. Reflections of the past must serve to illuminate the present, create possibilities for the future, and contribute to the governing of the country; therefore: 1. The pictures that were shown reminded us of a painful part of our history, aggravated by the offensive actions of some of the participants. History cannot be forgotten and only through a true reconciliation based on the strict application of justice and repentance can we be in peace with it. 2. The unnecessary expectation created by the words and the actions of the president presented as a genuine concern for democracy and the normal development of the state can also be interpreted as an effort to change the preferences in the present electoral process, which could contradict his call not to, and I quote, use his authority and influence to serve the interests of the participants in the election process, unquote. 3. A few days before the elections are held, we reiterate a call to debate the different platforms and evaluate candidates based on their values, capabilities, and past achievements. 4. Panama is our common house. After the elections, we have the great task of reaching agreements on the great challenges that lie ahead. That is why the Justice and Peace Commission makes a call to the president and to all participants in the election process to -- inspired in the multiple initiatives made since the ethical electoral agreement and the women's forum on political parties, including the electoral agreement of the Executive Branch -- conclude this process with tolerance, respect, and responsibility. I want to publicly ask the various media that may pick up this statement to please reproduce it in its entirety, and we hope they refrain from editing out parts that may detract from the primary intention that led us to make this statement. Thank you very much.
