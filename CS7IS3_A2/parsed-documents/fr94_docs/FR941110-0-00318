FR941110-0-00318 FR941110-0-00019 Environmental Review A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations at 24 CFR Part 50, which implement Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. This finding is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of the General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Room 10276, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410. Regulatory Planning and Review This rule has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review.

Impact on Small Entities The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this rule before publication and by approving it certifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The rule creates homeownership opportunities for low-income residents of public and Indian housing with, at most, an incidental effect on small businesses. Executive Order 12606, the Family The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, the Family, has determined that this rule would not have potential significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being and therefore is not subject to review under the order. The rule would have an indirect, though positive, impact on families to the extent that it would provide opportunities for families residing in public and Indian housing to own their own homes. Executive Order 12612, Federalism The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined that this rule would not have substantial, direct effects on States, on their political subdivisions, or on their relationship with the Federal government, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between them and other levels of government. The rule's major effects would be on individuals; any involvement of States or their political subdivisions is limited to their cooperative efforts in promoting homeownership among public and Indian housing residents. This rule was listed as Item No. 1695 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on April 25, 1994, (59 FR 20424, 20472) pursuant to Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
