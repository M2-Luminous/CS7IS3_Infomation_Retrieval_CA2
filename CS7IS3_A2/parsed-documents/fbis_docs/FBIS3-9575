The replies acquired do not yet reflect the situation that arose after the 27th meeting of the National Council of the Slovak Republic with its consequences [passage of the vote of no-confidence in Vladimir Meciar's government and the appointment of a new government]. Compared with the poll carried out in early February, there was a visible increase in trust in President Michal Kovac and a reduction in the proportion of citizens who do not trust any politician. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Trust in Representatives of Political Lifein Slovakia as Expressed by Citi-| |zens(in percent) | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Jan |Feb |Mar | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Vladimir Meciar |23 |22 |25 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Michal Kovac |23 |20 |25 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Peter Weiss |12 |15 |16 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ivan Gasparovic |9 |8 |7 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Jan Carnogursky |5 |5 |6 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Jozef Moravcik |5 |5 |5 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Do not trust any |41 |43 |31 | |politician | | | | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
