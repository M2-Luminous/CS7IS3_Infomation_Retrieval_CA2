Secrecy will still be the strategy of the first round, following the methods of UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye. Meanwhile, it has been agreed that political, and not military issues, will dominate the agenda of the talks. On the occasion of the resumption of talks yesterday afternoon, Radio France International, RFI, interviewed Dr. Jorge Alicerces Valentim, who began by commenting on issues to be negotiated. [Begin recording] [Valentim] The first point is the police, but a modern and democratic police, not a police with a paramilitary and military organization, but a civil police force, such as in civilized and highly democratic countries. We will discuss the police and we can say now that we will not agree with the so called belligerent and military police, such as the antiriot police. We want structures which may guarantee total security for the population and democratic freedom in the country, not a police force created to oppress the opposition parties. Our second point will be the big, multifaceted theme, national reconciliation, with issues regarding the government, the status of our President Dr. Savimbi, and the political and administrative decentralization which is extremely necessary to create acceptable structures which may unite the Angolan people, which has been traumatized and divided following the so called October 1992 Luanda events. Then we shall also discuss freedom of association, politically, and economically. This means that we will be dealing with extremely sensible issues, including the second round of elections, how democratic elections should be organized to guarantee a free expression. [Unidentified reporter] [Words indistinct] government [word indistinct] key ministerial posts? [Valentim] [Words indistinct] ministerial key posts. We would like to have one post in the Defense or Interior Ministry, one post in the Foreign Affairs or Information Ministry and one post in the Territorial Administration or Economy. We would like to participate in government in an effective way, not like in the 1992 [word indistinct] when they gave us the ministry [words indistinct] not in the context of France, but in Angola's context, for us to take care of drums; that is not what we want. We want a participation which is a sign that Angola is truly heading toward national reconciliation. We also want UNITA's participation in the management of some economic enterprises, such as the National Angolan Fuel Company, the railroad company and others. We are still living in a society of the past, a monolithic society, in which all workers belong to the party, in which other parties do not participate in the economic and political activities, because we did not have time to prepare the country for an open democracy.
