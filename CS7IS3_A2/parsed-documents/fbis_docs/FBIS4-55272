FBIS4-55272 "dreeu092_c_94005" FBIS-EEU-94-092 Daily Report 10 May 1994 CZECH REPUBLIC Supply of Russian Nuclear Fuel Jeopardized Supply of Russian Nuclear Fuel Jeopardized AU1105182494 Prague HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Czech 10 May 94 pp 1-2 AU1105182494 Prague HOSPODARSKE NOVINY Czech BFN [Article by Marcela Doleckova: "Russian Partner Makes Delivery of Nuclear Fuel for Dukovany Conditional on Repayment of Debt"] [Text] Skodaexport, which was buying Russian nuclear fuel for the Dukovany nuclear power station until last year, owes the Russian supplier $5.7 million for the 1992 deliveries. Albert Panushkin, chief engineer of the Mashinostroyitelniy zavod company, told HOSPODARSKE NOVINY that, following the bad experience with Skodaexport, the Russian fuel producer intends only to sign contracts directly with the Czech consumer--that is, CEZ [Czech Power Generating Works] company. However, no contract will be signed until the debt is settled. In spite of the glut on the world uranium market, Mashinostroyitelniy zavod is the only company in the world that produces nuclear fuel for reactors of the Russian type that are installed in Dukovany. Even though CEZ invited tenders for the supply of alternative fuel for Dukovany, responses to which have come not only from the present Russian supplier but also from a West European consortium and the U.S. Westinghouse company, the mere development of the production technology for fuel for the Dukovany Russian-type reactors would take two to three years. Any supplier but the Russian one is thus essentially out of the question until then. The new contract between CEZ and the Russian supplier concerns this year and the subsequent two years. Although it should have been signed in March, it has only been initialed thus far. According to Jaroslav Mil, CEZ's specialist for nuclear fuel issues, the Dukovany power station has enough fuel in stock to last one year. However, it has already starting tapping those reserves. Vladimir Lima, Skodaexport's director of finance, admitted to HOSPODARSKE NOVINY that "there is some truth" to the Russian accusation. He admits, above all, that CEZ had actually paid Skodaexport for the purchase in Russia a long time ago. Vladimir Cima stresses, however, that Skodaexport is "in complex credit relations with Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka [Czechoslovak Foreign Trade Bank, CSOB]" and suffers from a shortage of funds. Asked directly whether Skodaexport uses CEZ money to cover its other commitments, the director of finance replied in the affirmative. He stressed, nonetheless, that ways of settling the Russian claim are being sought intensively. In this context, both Cima and Jiri Brudnak, who heads the relevant trade division of Skodaexport, use the words "gradually, by means of deliveries of goods as well as bank transfers." Cima even uses the term "to mutually offset claims and liabilities," by which he means not only Skodaexport's claims and liabilities toward Mashinostroyitelniy zavod (or, respectively, Tekhsnabeksport, a trading company with a license to export nuclear fuel), but also toward other Russian companies. Overall, Skodaexport's claims in Russia exceed its liabilities. Albert Panushkin told us in this contact that Mashinostroyitelniy zavod is 51 percent private (these shares are owned by its employees) and does not care about the liabilities of other Russian companies toward Skodaexport. Neither Panushkin nor Brudnak deny the existence of certain partial interests on the Russian side. It seems that the management of Mashinostroyitelniy zavod is interested in obtaining the company's remaining shares and that the management would be more accommodating if the Czech side tried to influence Moscow in this direction. The remaining shares of this sole supplier of fuel for the Dukovany nuclear power station, on which the Czech Republic depends for about 25 percent of its electricity production, are still owned by the Russian state.
