About two months ago he took over the Ministry of Interior Relations in Carmelitas. He wants to free Venezuelan politics of that "old-fashioned attitude which many governments have had" of hardening their positions on their own mistakes and of not wanting to tell the truth. He said: "How am I going to say that a thing is, when it is not?" Therefore, he set up his office in the building inaugurated by General Eleazar Lopez Contreras in 1936, not only ordering the worn, red rugs to be cleaned but also having his office "swept" to detect electronic listening devices. From that office he stated unambiguously that the country has no money, that succeeding governments have not given priority to personal security, and that Venezuela has no clear idea of what its position is on the narcotics traffic. Furthermore, he intends to redefine the powers of the Ministry of Interior Relations which, until now, has been the center for bad relations and repression. He wants the ministry to regain its powers as a government department from high level politics. He said: "I am trying to ensure that democratic institutions function properly." The personal security of the ordinary citizen is the fundamental objective of his official policy of state security. He stated: "The security of all citizens and the right to life are not adequately guaranteed in Venezuela. I must say that, despite the fact that there are some people who say that I am talking like the attorney general. No, I am speaking as a government minister and I have to tell the truth. No government should have any problem in recognizing that." He stated that the subject of personal security is "very complex," because several factors are involved which do not depend on the government. However, the government must clearly play its role. He said: "The first point which comes to mind is that priority has not been given to personal security. We have always tried to excuse this omission by saying that elsewhere in the world, in New York, Lima, or Bogota, more people are killed than here. And I always say that this is like the person who says that someone drowned in water two meters deep, while another person drowned in water four meters deep. In any case they drowned, and it makes no difference." He argues that there are countries which successfully fight against crime by bringing society as a whole and the ordinary citizen into the struggle, because, "governments and police forces cannot do the job by themselves. Society must learn to defend itself. Clearly, there is a negative factor here, the absence of police in the streets. However, the first thing which the present government did was to bring the police out into the streets. If this is not possible, then there is the National Guard. That is quite clear. It is also clear that the police by themselves are not enough. They have many shortcomings. It is also true that there are police who are involved in the rackets. This problem is being dealt with, however. Some women friends of mine even telephone me at home at night to complain of things that are going on. Then I call the Metropolitan Police, even though it may be nearly midnight. They are used to my calling them at such a time to ask about some things. That is what we are doing." [Pimentel] What would you do if insecurity continues? Do we have to take repressive action to deal with the problem because we have not been able to develop a crime prevention policy? [Escovar] It is true that there has not been a policy of preventing crime. Repression is inevitable if there is no program for preventing crime. The fact that the police are in the streets does not automatically mean that we are following a policy of repression. The presence of the police is a sign of authority, as in any other part of the world. However, that does not mean that human rights are being violated. I do not support breaches of the law. [Pimentel] How will you combine the necessary amount of repression with your own training which once led you, as a prosecutor, to say that there is no government of laws in Venezuela? [Escovar] I am trying to make sure that the criticisms which I expressed as a prosecutor, and now take into consideration as a minister, might correct a considerable number of mistakes. One of my criticisms is that you have to educate the police. I have sent instructions to state and city governments to that effect. The instructions given to the police in the past have always been repressive, aggressive, and authoritarian in tone. Why not give them democratic instructions? Let them exercise their authority. I am not pretending that the police are weaklings. They have to exercise their authority, particularly in such a violent city as Caracas, where they are exposed to being blown away with the wind. They have to be a solid instrument of order, but they do not necessarily have to harm the personal security of the ordinary citizen. [Pimentel] Is that the approach which you plan to use with the MRI [Ministry of Interior Relations]? [Escovar] That is the approach which I am using, and I would like to emphasize other weapons which the Ministry of Interior Relations has which do not exclusively deal with security, although, of course, that is the most important element. I am not going to criticize my predecessors in this position because I am not going to become involved in that kind of discussion. What I want to do is to redefine and reformulate the role of the Ministry of Interior Relations as a ministry of government and of politics. There are many public opinion groups which should feel that they are being heard and respected. It is very probable that later on I will present a plan for the reorganization of the ministry for consideration by the government. We should remember, however, that state and municipal governments have their own responsibilities. If a gun goes off in a city square, this does not mean that the minister of interior relations ordered it. You can establish order without firing guns into the air. There are other means of repression, such as antiriot teams. You cannot expect Caracas to be a goody-goody city, and the government does not expect that it will be, either. The government has to exercise its democratic authority in a vigorous and firm way. Doors Which Open and Close Escovar Salom does not believe that we face great difficulties. He recalls the great political tensions which he dealt with when he was the young director of the Faculty of Law at the UCV [Central University of Venezuela] after the fall of the Perez Jimenez government. The door which connected the Faculty of Law and the Faculty of Humanities had been sealed. He called a doorman and ordered him to open it. He explained that this was quite a revolution and an enormous change in the concept of university space. He said: "For example, there are many doors which open and others which close. There are still others which are unjustifiably open." [Pimentel] In terms of state security the Ministry of Interior Relations has two organizations within it which have always been attacked because of their practices: the DIEX [Directorate of Identification and Alien Affairs] and the DISIP [Directorate of Intelligence and Prevention Services]. What are you going to do with them? [Escovar] I have always spoken in very critical terms against the DIEX. I have been told that nothing can be done about it. There is general pessimism on this subject. The first thing that you have to do is to identify the sources of corruption, because not all officials in the DIEX are corrupt. I once asked the members of the ministry trade union, who came to me and offered their cooperation, to help me in cleaning up the DIEX. I wanted to bring the members of the trade union into this job and give them a motive for doing so. Of course, the sources of corruption in DIEX do not like this, nor do they like computers, because office automation, using computers, is an enemy of corruption. It prevents officials from acting secretly. DIEX needs cleaning up, organization, and automation. How are we dealing with the automation of DIEX during this period of difficulties? I am studying the possibility of private contributions and turning the DIEX into an independent agency which could finance itself with its own resources. However, I have not yet made a decision because I am still analyzing whether this course of action is viable and what legal difficulties there may be. At the moment I have asked neighborhood associations to help me to investigate DIEX. I am going to install two telephones in the ministry to receive complaints from the public. The telephone numbers will be made public soon. The person answering the telephone in the ministry will have to give his name so that the complainant will know whom to contact or to call again if his complaint is not dealt with. That service is being organized, and an announcement concerning it will be made shortly. In DIEX we have to carry out a psychological revolution to treat the public properly. I am going to send some experts to tell people in DIEX that they should learn to say, "Good morning," "with pleasure," and "please." [Pimentel] Do you think that, beyond the matter of behavior which you hope to change, the problem is also structural, involving bureaucratic practices such as collecting money for services rendered, gift giving in exchange for services, and bribery? [Escovar] It is true that in Venezuela the administration is an obstacle course. And not only in the DIEX. This is a country where it takes an effort to do anything. In the DIEX we have to find out how many employees are not needed. We have to make a personnel audit and find out which employees are involved in corruption. This is something which is now being done. The other task is to protect the decent and honest people who work there, because at times those scoundrels represent the honest people, silence them, and prevent them from doing their job. In this area we are going to face the collective will of the ministry. I am inclined to do that. We are going to see what the results will be. [Pimentel] Do you think that in this way you will be able to control illegal and undocumented immigration which you have criticized so much? [Escovar] The DIEX is a fundamental instrument of national sovereignty. Those activities are a crime of treason to the fatherland. The official involved in that kind of activity can be brought to trial. I have a clear position regarding the matter of undocumented aliens. They cannot live in Venezuela. In some cases there will have to be deportations, and I am ready for that. Now, there are people who are illegal because they have not been provided with the necessary documents, but they are working. Cattle raisers in certain border areas have raised that matter with me. However, the problem is in the illegal and criminal element in the population. Venezuela has to have a border policy but also a policy of selective immigration. In this connection population policy has been confused with the open door policy. Although there are no reliable statistics, I believe that in Caracas there may be about two million undocumented aliens. This is one of the open doors which must be closed. [Pimentel] And what about the DISIP? [Escovar] We are doing the same thing with the DISIP. We are reorganizing it. Gen. Rivas Ostos (the director) is doing a quiet but efficient job. The DISIP is a state security police service, but it does not have to be the Gestapo, nor does it have to be violent or aggressive. This is a police force which does not work for a political party or even the government, but rather the Venezuelan state. That is the first thing that we have to make clear. In Venezuela many people do not know that the notion of a state is a permanent aspect of the national community, while governments are transitory phenomena. In the DISIP I am trying to apply the principle of identifying a government official with the state. Previously, this relationship was expressed in personal terms. The individual official served interests which were not those of the Venezuelan state. And I will not go on with this because a great deal is already known about it and I do not need to repeat it. [Pimentel] Regarding secret appropriations, when you were attorney general, you said that these should be regulated. Do you still think the same way? [Escovar] The existing standards are the same. I contacted the Office of the Controller General and asked it to suggest what possible regulations might be applied. The important thing to remember is that in the law establishing the Office of the Controller General certain powers are given to the controller general and eventually to the attorney general to exercise supervision of the secret appropriations. Secret appropriations cannot be a well from which funds can be drawn for all purposes. Historically, it has been a means of providing welfare benefits in exchange for certain favors. The appropriations for welfare purposes do not have to be secret. They should be publicly known. There could be further regulations on this matter. Standing Still on a Pile of Rubble Escovar Salom answered at least three telephone calls on his internal office phone in less than one hour. These were government matters which he had to deal with from his office. He said that he works 11 hours a day and, "as was the case in the Office of the Attorney General," he takes no time off for lunch. From time to time he adds to the volume of his recording of the musical, "Gypsy," by playing his violin. [Pimentel] The narcotics traffic is another problem affecting state security. How are you going to deal with it? [Escovar] The narcotics traffic is a new element on the scene, and you have to know how to deal with it. (He wanted to clear up some misunderstandings on the subject.) It is not a matter of making concessions. Rather, this is a very serious matter which has to be considered. The geopolitics of drugs presupposes international activities. States as such do not have the means of dealing with a crime which is essentially international in scope. Of course, there is a policy of prevention and of education in dealing with drugs. However, the basic problem is how to act from the executive point of view against the narcotics traffic and related money laundering. It seems to me that so far Venezuela has not had a clear idea of its position on this matter. More or less sporadic efforts have been made. There are some cases in the courts, but nothing coherent or coordinated has been done about the matter. Perhaps, later on, it might become necessary to establish a special state agency, a specialized and autonomous body, such as the DEA [Drug Enforcement Administration] in the United States. One very important aspect is the laundering of narcotics profits, but here we have begun with the error of believing that this is not going on. That kind of business has been growing almost in public view, but no one realized it. There are even people who are offended when you mention it. Why should we deny this fact if it is a reality? In passing Escovar presented some views which he had previously expressed at the SECONASEDE conference [National Development Conference]. He said that "some alleged patriots and persons of ill will" quoted him as saying that Venezuela could not take action on this matter. He said: "What I said -- and I said so as minister of foreign affairs in about 1976 -- was that Venezuela should keep clearly in mind that it is a small country and should understand that this is what it is. It is better for Venezuela to keep clearly in mind that it is an efficient and productive country with political skills -- because political skill is also one of our assets -- and that it has the literature and the rhetorical skills of a large country. It is very expensive to be a large country. Venezuela is not big enough to be that." He received a telephone call from someone very close to him who apparently congratulated him on his appointment. The minister purred into his phone, "That's a two-edged compliment that you are paying me." [Pimentel] Are you afraid of "burning out" in the Ministry of Interior Relations? [Escovar] When I entered the Office of the Attorney General, they said something like that. None of the people who called me to pass on their greetings did so to congratulate me but rather to express their condolences and to wish me luck. Neither did public opinion expect much. I crossed the border between skepticism and a certain amount of hope in November 1989, when I began to visit hospitals. This was something different. However, clearly enough, there are always jealous people and pessimists. They are not always the same people, but they exist. They used to say that visiting hospitals was not the job of the attorney general. They said the same thing when I began by winning certain cases, not only the Carlos Andres Perez case on 11 March but also other, previous cases. I knew at the time that Carlos Andres Perez had called a very important businessman in Caracas and told him that what I had presented in court was nonsense and that the basis of my case was merely press clippings. He said: "That is very difficult." A friend told me on 18 April 1993: "Anyhow, I wish you success in that job, but this country is not yet ready for that." Almost one month later, on 20 May, the CSJ [Supreme Court of Justice] made a favorable finding on the previous judgment against Carlos Andres Perez, who was then president. [Pimentel] Are we a country of pessimists? [Escovar] I am used to that kind of pessimism. However, in the ministry I am going to do the same thing and I have no doubt that I will be successful. I am going to have many difficulties, which already have begun, like the skepticism of the people. Friends tell me: "Why did you leave your job as a lawyer handling cases before the UN, with a salary of $14,000 a month and with so many privileges, to come back and get involved in this mess? You should have gone away and waited for a future opportunity." But standing aside and waiting for the right opportunity is like a man with new shoes who does not put them on so that the soles will not wear out. If I speak up, I speak up, as I did in the Office of the Attorney General. Everything is very difficult now in Venezuela because we are still standing on a mountain of rubble. That is what we have inherited, and we have to work on that. There is nothing else to do." Biographic Details Escovar Salom's biography states that he was the youngest parliamentarian in Latin America in 1948 (when he was 21). He was the youngest senator in 1958 (when he was 31) and the youngest cabinet minister in 1964 (when he was 38). Since then he began work in the executive branch of the government as minister of justice. He was secretary general of the Office of the President of the Republic (1974-75) and minister of foreign affairs (1975-77) during the first term of President Carlos Andres Perez. Then he was Venezuelan ambassador to France (1986-89). Until February 1994 he was attorney general. Now, as minister of interior relations, he is a member of the cabinet of President Rafael Caldera. His experience as one of the drafters of the national constitution (of 1961) now in effect and as titular professor of constitutional law seems to him to be a good reason for expressing the view that constitutional reform should be the result of a broad and also harmonious consensus, because the constitution of 1961 "got away from us." He said: "Because we wanted to draft a good constitution in the sense of stability we moved too far toward rigidity." He suggests that reform should be oriented more toward the way in which the national government functions, toward the organic part of the constitution, and toward seeking alternatives to political crises which end up in coups d'etat. He firmly believes that the idea of holding a referendum to recall a president is not a bad one. Everything depends on the electorate's being clearly prepared to deal with the situations which come up. He is not opposed to a dissolution of Congress. He said: "In democratic countries this is a power which the serving prime minister does not make use of every day. Except in very serious situations, I consider that the electorate should be consulted."
