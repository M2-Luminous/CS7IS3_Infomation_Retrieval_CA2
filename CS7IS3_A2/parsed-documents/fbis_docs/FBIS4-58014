They noted that the move was prompted by the threat of intervention hanging over Haiti. Mrs. (Gerard Dessain), the VSN's new leader, explains that the Tontons Macoutes have offered to help the Haitian Army fight foreign troops in case of invasion. (Dessain) asserts that the big Duvalierist lords or the big Tontons Macoutes lords are behind this movement: [Begin (Dessain) recording, in Creole] All VSN delegates from the nine departments that were sent here today say: No! No! They will not accept an intervention. There will be an intervention only over our dead bodies. We will be in front and the Army will be behind. We offer our services to the Army because we are not ungrateful. The Army trained us. We only know how to use weapons because the Army taught us how to fight. The Army taught us how to protect ourselves. We cannot betray the Army. They think that the Army is alone today, but this is not true. Some people have a conscience. Some people love their country and side with the Army. We, the VSN, say we are present. We make it a point of saying that we are on the field. We stand beside the Army in defending our country no matter when, no matter which day they wish to intervene. We know they can kill us, but we will not die on our knees. We will not die sitting down. We will not be disabled. We will die standing up. [applause] [end recording] [Francois] (Dessain), who was addressing correspondents at the downtown headquarters of the neo-Duvalierist party known as the Assembly of Democrats for the Republic, rose up against military intervention in Haiti. (Dessain) also tried to make it clear that Port-au-Prince slums would be destroyed by the foreign forces in case of intervention. (Dessain) noted that 30,051 Tontons Macoutes have already been recruited in the metropolitan area alone. She asked President-in-Exile Jean-Bertrand Aristide to take an official stand against military intervention in Haiti to solve the crisis. (Dessain), who leads the VSN, also asserted that the Tontons Macoutes and the VSN will be donning their blue uniforms nationwide very soon.
