Speaking at the local government conference at the World Trade Centre outside Johannesburg, Mr de Klerk said the end of township rent and services boycotts would help pay the R[rand]1.8 billion township services debt. It would also impact enormously on the cash flow of local authorities. "But it is a matter of debate whether that will be enough to redress the legacy of the past. I do not think so." It was accepted that the financing and implementation of upgrading local services would require regional and national support. Something more would be needed, however, and many local authorities would be in a position to make substantial contributions. "For the sake of peace and stability I believe they should do so."
