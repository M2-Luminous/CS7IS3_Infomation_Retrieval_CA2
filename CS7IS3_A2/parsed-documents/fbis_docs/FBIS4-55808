FBIS4-55808 "dreeu099_i_94006" FBIS-EEU-94-099 Daily Report 23 May 1994 BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA Serbs: Cease-Fire Observed Serbs: Cease-Fire Observed LD2305105694 Belgrade TANJUG in English 1026 GMT 23 May 94 LD2305105694 Belgrade TANJUG English BFN ["Pool" item] [Text] Belgrade, May 23 (TANJUG) -- BBC radio on Monday quoted U.N. sources as saying that the Bosnian Serbs are fully respecting the ceasefire agreement for Gorazde, Muslim enclave in southeast Bosnia, which the Muslims refused to sign. The representatives of the Bosnian Serbs and the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) on Saturday signed an annex to the agreement on a ceasefire and the cessetion of hostilities in the region of Gorazde. But the Muslims refused to sign it, as confirmed by the UNPROFOR Command for Bosnia. In a program monitored in Belgrade, BBC radio cited an unnamed senior U.N. official in Sarajevo that the respect of the ceasefire in Gorazde `enables the deployment of the U.N. troops in areas from where the Serbs have withdrawn.' The only potential problem is the attempt of the local Muslims to use the withdrawl of the Serb forces and sieze the regions they previously controlled, which is not allowed under the relevant U.N. resolutions, the radio said. It quoted UNPROFOR as saying that armed Bosnian Serb police has pulled out of the northern part of Gorazde to 3 km from the exclusion zone, while the remainder of the Serbs in the eastern parts should withdraw within the next 24 hours. The Bosnian Serbs in late April pulled out their heavy weapons to 20 km and the infantry to 3 km away from the centre of Gorazde with the aim of reaching a peaceful solution to the crisis caused by the Muslims who launched a major offensive from this `U.N.-designated safe area' in March. Only the Bosnian Serb police remained in the Serb villages near Gorazde to allow the local inhabitants to safely return to their homes. Some 15,000 Muslims from Gorazde, which should have been demilitarized last May, in late March launched an offensive on Serb territories. In the face of a total defeat from a Serb counterattack, NATO on April 10-11 bombed Serb positions close to this town.
