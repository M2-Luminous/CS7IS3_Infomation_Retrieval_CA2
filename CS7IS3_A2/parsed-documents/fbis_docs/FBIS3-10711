FBIS3-10711 "drlat048_m_94007" FBIS-LAT-94-048 Document Type:Daily Report 11 Mar 1994 Brazil Link Between Illegal Lottery, Drug Trafficking Reported PY1103013094 PY1103013094 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Rio de Janeiro O GLOBO in Portuguese publishes in its 6 March edition, on page 16, four articles by Octavio Guedes and Renato Garcia about alleged links between the Comando Vermelho drug trafficking gang and the illegal animal lottery bankers. The first 400-word article states that police have realized that the Comando Vermelho chiefs imprisoned in Bangu I penitentiary do not have the wealth that all their criminal actions should have given them. Police and judges believe the real chiefs of these organizations are not in the slums, where there is no infrastructure to launder dollars, import drugs, or purchase imported weapons. According to the testimony of some gang members, all the money collected in the drug markets, nearly $2.5 million per month, was administered by an illegal animal lottery banker known as Carlos Alberto Goncalves dos Santos, aka Carlinhos Barbudo, who is currently at large. A 200-word article states that the first time the full extent of the criminal gang was discovered was in the gang case in Borel Hill, where close links between community leaders and drug traffickers were demonstrated, as well as the existence of a "court" to judge those who oppose the laws of the drug traffickers, who organize parties to attract drug buyers and youths for prostitution. Police found out that about 140 people were involved in this illegal scheme in some way. Another 200-word article reports on the activities of Carlinhos Barbudo, who was named as the "owner" of the illegal animal lottery's gambling sites. According to a gang leader's wife, he was the treasurer for the drug markets, and other gang members testified that he personally paid drug suppliers. The last 200-word article quotes Rio de Janeiro Civil Police Chief Nilo Batista as saying: "Nobody can tell who is the Comando Vermelho gang's chief." He says he believes that a good portion of the drug trafficking money moved in Rio de Janeiro is spent on the drug markets' structure and the purchase of weapons and drugs. The remaining money is used to pay bribes to police and informers. Nilo Batista maintains that the organizational level of the Comando Vermelho gang is very low. The best-organized gang, he says, is that headed by drug trafficker Orlando da Conceicao, which exploits drug markets in eight slums in northern Rio de Janeiro. Police say there is no evidence to link the illegal animal lottery bankers with drug trafficking, and the Brazilian drug traffickers arrested so far are not rich like the Bolivian coca "barons."
