The Italian contingent in the airport consists of 133 men, with a further 29 standing by in nearby Nairobi. One Italian plane and two Belgian ones are on the apron in the airport. The Italian troops, from the crack Col Moschin battalion, have carried out three operations outside the airport precinct to bring Italian nationals resident in Rwanda to safety. With the help of the Belgian military, the number of Italians now evacuated from Rwanda stands at 138, with a further seven having reached neighbouring Burundi under their own steam, and eight more airlifted from an outlying village by a United Nations helicopter. Italy has just under 200 of its nationals in the country, most of them nuns and priests. According to the defence ministry, which is keeping a close watch on developments in the African country wracked by tribal clashes, the situation there is "difficult and dramatic."
