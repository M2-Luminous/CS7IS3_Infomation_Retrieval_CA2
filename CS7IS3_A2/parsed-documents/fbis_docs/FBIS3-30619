Here is the entire text of this statement: I was shocked and indignant at the news of this new irresponsible attack against the city of Sarajevo, which claimed a great number of victims among the civilian population who lack the protection of the city. We deplore the loss of human lives and want to express our profound condolences to the mourning families. We very firmly condemn this new barbarian act of terrorism and express the hope that those who have committed it will be identified and receive the punishment they deserve. The attack in Sarajevo does nothing but emphasize, in a dramatic way, the fact that resorting to force of arms prolongs human suffering, without solving problems, and it emphasizes the urgency for the necessity of a peace settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- an objective to which all diplomatic efforts should now be devoted, the statement by Romania's president concludes.
