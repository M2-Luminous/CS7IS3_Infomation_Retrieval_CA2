The China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) says its overseas operations are advancing as scheduled. In the meantime, it says, conditions are suitable for opening new areas for petroleum exploration and development. In an interview with Business Weekly, Zhang Yongyi, CNPC's vice-president, cited the example of old oil wells in Peru that have been upgraded by Chinese technicians and are now producing more oil. CNPC signed a contract with Petrol Peru last year for further development of a 182-square-kilometre block in an old oilfield. Production at the oilfield, which was discovered in 1874, has declined after more than 100 years of exploitation. CNPC, which produces some 140 million tons of crude oil a year, has mature technology and enough equipment for enhancing oil recovery, Zhang said. In a couple of North and Latin American nations, CNPC is conducting seismic work, Zhang revealed. In Thailand, CNPC has made progress in developing oil. Another CNPC official said Chinese are doing preparatory work for constructing an oilfield. In Papua New Guinea, CNPC will explore for oil in one block code- named 160 and another named Kamusi. CNPC is teaming up with companies from Japan and Hong Kong in the exploration. After leading a business group to the Central Asian nations of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan last month, Zhang said new fields for cooperation will be opened there. Zhang was travelling with a Chinese Government delegation headed by Premier Li Peng. Zhang believes prospects for Chinese co-operation with the four republics are good since the needs of all five countries are complementary. Two letters of intent for closer ties were signed by CNPC and the petroleum sectors of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. More co-operation is expected in the exploration, development and trade of crude oil and natural gas. According to the letters of intent, technical exchanges and visits to oilfields will be more frequent than before. CNPC and Turkmenistan reaffirmed their desires to work together, along with the Japanese industrial conglomerate Mitsubishi, to develop natural gas. Construction of a pipeline is being considered to carry natural gas from Turkmenistan to Japan by way of China. Gas resources in Turkmenistan are estimated at 20,000 billion cubic metres. Zhang cited several advantages for CNPC in improving petroleum cooperation with Central Asia: -- Proximity, which ensures convenience in co-operative exploration, development and trade; -- Chinese technology, engineering and experience, which suit the needs of the four nations; -- Similar economic and social conditions, which enhance mutual understanding as the five countries make the transition from rigid central planning to market economies.
