FBIS3-51317 "drlat011_t_94004" FBIS-LAT-94-011 Document Type:Daily Report 18 Jan 1994 Venezuela Banco Latino Placed Under Government Control PA1701174494 Caracas Venezolana de Television Network in Spanish 1550 GMT 17 Jan 94 PA1701174494 Caracas Venezolana de Television Network Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [Report by Ligia Moreno from "The News" newscast; monitored in progress] [Text] ...he indicated that Banco Latino had been excluded from the clearinghouse system by the Central Bank of Venezuela on 13 January after Banco Latino was unable to pay off the debt balance of more than 4 billion bolivares by the clearinghouse's close of business on Wednesday, 12 January, due to insufficient funds in the deposit account at the bank of issue. That is why this institution resorted to the Simon Bolivar Center, whose representative is Engineer Cesar Rodriguez, governor of Caracas. [Begin Rodriguez recording] Banco Latino and its board of directors know of the efforts made by the Simon Bolivar Center to pay off nearly 14 billion bolivares, including interest, a debt that is over 15 years old. I received the authorization from the Council of Ministers to make the payment at 1030 on Thursday, 13 January. I left Simon Bolivar Center at 1500, and it is possible that I may have arrived there a few minutes after 1600 to sign the document and turn in the bonds, which the Central Bank knew had been delivered by the Finance Ministry a few hours before, meaning late in the afternoon on Wednesday, 12 January. The situation is not, as some reports indicate, an operation in which the Simon Bolivar Center and I had the bonds for a long time. The Finance Ministry issued the bonds and sent them to the Central Bank only 20 hours earlier. The finance minister, a member of the assembly at the Simon Bolivar Center, wanted this operation to be approved by the president in a Council of Ministers meeting. As you can see, the operation was carried out after the bonds were received. It was an operation that lasted less than 24 hours. All efforts that could be made were made. I was really surprised to see that an institution as strong as this, one of the largest banks in the country -- the second largest in the country in deposits -- was about to collapse just because the president of the Simon Bolivar Center got there a minute early or a minute late. [end recording] The Superintendency of Banks, however, took over bank duties with all the powers of administration, management, control, and surveillance, including all powers granted by the law in these cases, after the government's announcement to shut the doors of Banco Latino was made. [Begin recording] [Presidency Secretary Ramon Espinoza] We want to find the means to protect the public's savings accounts and finally guarantee that savings account holders can have access to their money as soon as possible. [Superintendent of Banks Roger Urbina] The government-apppointed administrator will have a 90-day term to conduct the audits that will allow them to determine the precise financial status of Banco Latino. Based on this report, all the neccessary measures will be taken to sell the bank to private national or foreign investors in an effort to keep the institution working. According to the financial mechanisms established in the bank laws, Fogade [Deposit Guarantee Fund -- Fondo de Garantia de Depositos] will contribute resources to Banco Latino so its clients can begin withdrawing from their savings accounts as soon as possible according to the procedures determined by the government-appointed administrator, which will be announced at the proper time. In this program, priority will be given to small savings account holders. At any rate, it is important to note that Fogade guarantees deposits up to 1 million bolivares according to Article 127 of the Bank Law. The Superintendency of Banks is also studying preventive measures for the remainder of the financial institutions that make up the Latino Group. [end recording] Despite the announcement, Banco Latino issued a communique to the public because its president, Giacomo Leon, refused to speak to the media. In the communique, Banco Latino assures the nation of its willingness to respect the government's decision and to cooperate as much as possible in protecting the interests of those who have trusted in them for the last 43 years. The institution thanks its personnel for their cooperation and hopes to overcome the problems faced by the banking institution caused by a criminal campaign of rumors that led to an excessive withdrawal of funds, which led to the subsequent closure of Banco Latino.
