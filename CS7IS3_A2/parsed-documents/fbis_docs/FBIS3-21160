At that time, devices like the optical computer were mere dreams. Even the idea of an optical interconnection that can transmit a large quantity of signals via an array of surface emission lasers had not been thought of. Actually, Professor Iga's proposal was motivated by a simple thought--trying to find a laser that could be mass produced better. Sandwich the Activated Layer Professor Iga began research on semiconductor lasers for optical communication in a group led by his advisor, Dr. Yasuharu Suematsu (formerly president of Tokyo Institute of Technology). Although his research proceeded smoothly, and he was able to make prototype elements that actually worked, Professor Iga also felt dissatisfaction. At that time, the mainstream method for manufacturing semiconductor lasers was to split a crystal to form a smooth surface called a cleavage plane, and then make that into a reflective mirror for a resonator. With that method it was difficult to mass produce elements of uniform quality. Some researchers proposed making elements without cleavage planes, such as in distribution feedback lasers that incorporate a diffraction grating, but Professor Iga says, ``Because it was not my own idea, it just didn't feel right to me.'' After a lot of thought, what Professor Iga came up with was the structure of a perpendicular resonating laser in which the activated layer (emitting part) is sandwiched between reflective films above and below, and the laser light is generated perpendicular to the substrate. With this structure, a number of elements could be formed on a single substrate, and the lasers could be mass produced merely by cutting them off one by one. Preceding Professor Iga's idea, researchers at Xerox in the U.S. announced the creation of a surface emission laser in 1975. It had diffraction gratings piled on top of the activated layer, and basically the structure was pretty much the same as previous lasers. Then in 1987 researchers at MIT proposed the reflective mirror type of surface emission laser. This device had a crystal with a cleavage plane cut at a 45� angle set in the path of light emitted horizontally and used this crystal to change the direction of the light, but the method for generating the light was no different than before. Compared with these methods, Professor Iga's idea is truly innovative. Scholars Originally Skeptical Yet, a long time passed before the value of his idea was recognized. In 1979 Professor Iga made prototype elements with activated layers of indium-gallium-arsenic-phosphorus and cooled with them liquid nitrogen to generate pulsed oscillations. Professor Iga says, ``If a large current was applied they would light up for an instant before they fell apart.'' At academic conferences these experimental results got a very cold reception, and most scholars thought the elements could never be put to practical use. In addition to Dr. Suematsu, however, a small number of researchers from the U.S. and former Soviet Union encouraged Iga by saying his results were interesting and worth pursuing. Then unexpected advantages appeared. Researchers realized that surface emission lasers will be most suitable for hookups to optical fibers because they emit a narrower beam than previous types of lasers, etc. It was discovered that short wavelength prototype lasers made by replacing the original material with gallium-arsenic elements also required less current for oscillation than older surface emission lasers. Research on surface emission lasers was selected by MOE for its Specially Promoted Distinguished Research funding in the latter half of the 1980s, and this provided a budget for Professor Iga to make his own state-of-the-art device for manufacturing semiconductor thin films. In the fall of 1988 about ten years after he first proposed the idea, working with Assistant Professor Fumio Koyama, Professor Iga created a surface emission laser that could produce continuous short wavelength emissions at room temperature. This triggered research throughout the world because the advantages of surface emission lasers made them promising candidates for the main components of optical computers and next-generation optical communications systems. Professor Iga's group went on to achieve continuous oscillation at room temperature in the 1.3� wavelength band suitable for optical communications, so at last Professor Iga's dream was becoming reality. Beyond Expectations Now all major electronics manufacturers are doing research on surface emission lasers. Their main focus is the development of surface emission lasers that will form the optical interconnections in MITI's Real World Computing (Four Dimensional Computer) Project which will last for the next ten years, and ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency) Projects in the U.S. Professor Iga created the surface emission laser because it would be easy to mass produce, but now it has grown into an element far beyond his original concept. Several faculty members who worked with Professor Iga on research have moved on to other universities, and former students in his lab now work for domestic and foreign semiconductor manufacturers. All continue their cutting-edge research. We can expect research on elements for practical application to accelerate rapidly in the future. Professor Iga intends to remain at the forefront saying, ``Signal hookups for parallel computers, etc., should be realized in the near future.''
