A resolution made today instructs the government to carry out the exchange of ratification letters to the treaty. The stipulations related to guarantees of Ukraine's territorial integrity, inviolability of borders and protection from aggression by nuclear states as well as compensations for Ukrainian nuclear warheads withdrawn from the republic. At present, the stipulations are lifted since the deputies believe that Kiev's conditions have been met. The resolution was passed by a majority of 260 votes, with 3 votes against. Five deputies abstained and 21 failed to take part in the voting. The parliament also decided to join the Lisbon protocol to the START-I treaty, including article 5. According to the article, Ukraine will join the nonproliferation treaty as a non-nuclear state in the near future. However, the parliament rejected the proposal to immediately join the treaty. A total of 193 deputies voted for joining the treaty, 27 against. Eleven deputies abstained and 58 failed to take part in the voting. Speaking before the session, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk said that the republic will necessarily receive the compensation for the nuclear weapons destroyed. He said Ukrainian, Russian and American experts will start work on determining the size of the compensation in February. "If only one of the sides fails to fulfil its obligations, Ukraine will suspend the activities on its part," Kravchuk said, meaning the withdrawal of warheads of strategic nuclear missiles.
