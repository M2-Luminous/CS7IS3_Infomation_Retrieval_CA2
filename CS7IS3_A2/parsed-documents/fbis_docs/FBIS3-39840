The economics minister, Jean-Pascal Delamuraz, said the electorate had acted like an ayatollah issuing a diktat. In an interview with the TAGES ANZEIGER newspaper, Mr. Delamuraz, a French speaker, attacked the Swiss Germans who voted overwhelmingly in favor of the Alpine initiative. He said the French-speaking population was fed up with being dictated to by a majority which did not appreciate that Switzerland's future lay in Europe. The European Commission has said it will study the implications of the vote for Switzerland's future relations with the European Union. Under the initiative, all lorries making international journeys across the Alps will be forced onto the railways by the year 2004.
