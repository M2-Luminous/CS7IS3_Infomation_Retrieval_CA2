The statement runs as follows: "The Russian Federation together with Commonwealth member-states is taking political steps to stabilize the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border and throughout Tajikistan, including the assistance to the inter-Tajik dialogue held under the U.N. aegis. "At the same time, some forces are not interested in peaceful settlement of Tajik problems. Heads of several irreconcilable opposition groups from the Tajik Islamic Revival Movement are getting ready to launch the so-called spring-summer `offensive' to begin with armed provocations on the Tajik-Afghan border in the immediate future. "Bearing this in mind, the Russian Foreign Ministry considers it necessary to state that the planned armed provocations are described by the Russian leadership as a threat to security of both Tajikistan and Russia, as well as all member-states of the Commonwealth. "The Russian Foreign Ministry warns the Afghan authorities and leaders of Tajik opposition groups against armed provocations from Afghan territory that threaten security of Tajikistan and collective security of Commonwealth member-states. "The Russian Foreign Ministry states that the Russian Federation together with other Commonwealth member-states will do their best to prevent further aggravation of the Tajik-Afghan border situation and take adequate measures in case of armed provocations."
