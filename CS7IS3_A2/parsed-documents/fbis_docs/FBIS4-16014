FBIS4-16014 "drsov071_e_94001" FBIS-SOV-94-071 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 UKRAINE International Affairs Fleet Council Calls for Release of Arrested Officers Fleet Council Calls for Release of Arrested Officers LD1204162494 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1042 GMT 12 Apr 94 LD1204162494 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] The military council of the Black Sea Fleet asked on 12 April the presidents of Ukraine and Russia to help bring about the immediate release of the arrested officers and "put an end to the practice of the use of force by the Ukrainian Defense Ministry, since they lead nowhere and can cause nothing but adequate counter measures on the part of the Black Sea Fleet personnel." The Black Sea Fleet cannot be intimidated. It has always been loyal to the peoples of Russia and Ukraine, to the military duty and the oath of allegiance sworn only once. A group of the Odessa special forces attempted to arrest in the port of Odessa on 9 April, the Black Sea Naval vessel "Cheleken" and prevent its planned movement to Sebastopol. A group of Black Sea Fleet reserve ships were blocked last weekend. Three Black Sea Fleet officers were arrested In the early hours of 11 April in Odessa. Unofficial reports say that two of them are still under arrest. This vicious practice is a link in a chain of well-planned actions aimed at re-subordination of part of Black Sea Fleet facilities to the Ukrainian Defense Ministry. It is an out-of-bounds attempt to torpedo the Massandra agreements, says the appeal. Moreover, the senseless policies by definite circles in the Ukrainian Defense Ministry and its naval force may cause unpredictable consequences up to armed clashes and casualties, says the document.
