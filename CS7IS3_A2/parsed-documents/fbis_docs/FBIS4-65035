As the chancellor explained after the cabinet meeting yesterday, Austria is already practicing this partnership in numerous areas. Bilateral cooperation agreements in the military sphere concerning the training of peacekeeping and humanitarian measures have been concluded with Eastern European states. In addition, Austria participates in various NATO committees. Thus, Austria is more advanced in this development than Sweden and Finland, which have now signed a partnership agreement with NATO, Vranitzky stated. At present, Austria wants to concentrate primarily on the referendum and Austrian measures linked to membership of the European Union [EU]. "In a later phase" Austria will again deal specifically with this partnership. The decisions by Sweden and Finland do not force Austria to change its planned procedure, particularly because both states explicitly stressed that they are not joining the Alliance, Vranitzky emphasized. A definite answer cannot yet be given concerning Austria's participation in a European security system. The outcome of the 1996 EU intergovernmental conference, during which basic decision on the structures of a future security system will be made, must be awaited. Of course, Austria is basically interested in such a system. In addition to passing laws, Vranitzky wants to discuss the adaptation measures for EU membership that are required in Austria with those that will be affected by them. Thus, next Monday [16 May] Vranitzky will meet with trade union representatives of those areas where structural problems are expected to occur. This will particularly affect the food sector, the mills, and the sugar industry. Not only financial support but the safeguarding of jobs will be discussed.
