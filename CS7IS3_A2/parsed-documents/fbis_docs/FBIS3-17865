R. Ozolas' diplomatic and legal discovery is that the agreement on the status of Kaliningrad Oblast was reached immediately after the war by the participants in the Potsdam conference, one of which has "died." The philosopher has in mind the USSR. Thus, he concludes, the CSCE still has to decide whether to allow the USSR's heir, Russia, to continue to control this oblast. This politician's statement could be dismissed and ignored: What does it matter what someone says in the heat of polemics. But two considerations prevent this. First, it would be interesting to know how the independent states which have appeared on the map of the former USSR would react if Russia were to allow itself to address to them a small proportion of such statements connected with the disputed nature of particular territories. I do not mention the fact that Russia's immediate neighbors often choose brief segments of history which suit them and lustfully state their right to a particular region, playing conjuring tricks with all kinds of international documents. Second, Lithuania's official figures in contrast to R. Ozolas (actually, let us not forget he is a member of parliament) do not allow themselves such speeches and nonetheless the subject of Kaliningrad Oblast is increasingly present in their statements "against" Russia. Before, Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys said that the numerical strength of the servicemen in the oblast is far smaller than some mass media claim. But in his January letter to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher he was already voicing great concern at the Russian Army concentration in Kaliningrad Oblast and drew attention to the need to demilitarize the region. It is not hard to notice that the change in his position is in the mainstream of the opinions of opposition forces and right-wing movements. Back when he was chairman of the Lithuanian Supreme Soviet, Vytautas Landsbergis frequently expressed himself in the same spirit on the subject of Kaliningrad Oblast. Members of right-wing movements, even if they are not speaking directly of the need to transfer this region to Lithuania, are hinting it. And on this plane R. Ozolas' arguments are no great surprise. The right-wing newspaper LETUVOS AYDAS states that Karaljaucius (that is what it calls Kaliningrad) should be demilitarized and its fate should be decided by an agreement between Russia, Lithuania, and Germany. "At Potsdam Lesser Lithuania was handed over to the control of the USSR proceeding from extensive scientific material which argued that this territory is ancient Lithuanian land," the newspaper asserts. "The Kremlin leaders initially planned to hand it over to Lithuania but later had second thoughts and by an edict of 7 April 1946 Lesser Lithuania was joined to the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic and called Kaliningrad Oblast." This oversimplified assessment of a very complex historical moment issued in many thousands of copies can indeed give rise to quite specific feelings among some Lithuanian citizens. What about the fact that at that time Koenigsberg had been German for 700 years? That the Prussian tribe subjugated by the Teutons in the 13th century was a Baltic tribe -- related to the Lithuanians but not Lithuanian? In my view the numerous indications that elements of Lithuanian culture are present in the region are also unproductive. So what? What if the Slavs were to search for traces of their own culture in other regions of the former USSR and not on Russian territory?
