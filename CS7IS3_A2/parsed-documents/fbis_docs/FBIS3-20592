Subsequent to the introduction of the State Council's "Provision on Managing the Peasants' Share of Expenses and Services," the abolition of 37 fund gathering, foundation, and fee collection programs was announced on 20 June. It was an important new measure, but in its actual implementation, are the localities doing what they please? Deceiving Those Above and Below -- Jacking Up the Per Capita Net Income When a county in the western part of the central Shaanxi plains reported its per capita net income last year, the county statistics bureau compiled the figures submitted by the towns and townships and let the leader in charge of the bureau review the numbers before submitting them to the city. When the manager saw that the per capita net income was only 570 yuan, he thought it was far too low and immediately met with several deputy county heads to reach a consensus: "We have worked hard for the last year, and we have so little to show for. It won't do." In fact these people only had their own promotions in mind. The county chief who was in charge of agriculture summoned the head of the statistics bureau to the county government office and eventually changed the per capita net income to 590 yuan, and the number was then sent to the city. The city statistics bureau noticed that the per capita income of the people in a village in the mountains in a certain town was only 176 yuan. They worried that it might drag down the whole city's per capita income, and so the manager immediately called up the county statistics bureau which got in touch with the town statistician who said that the number had been reported by the town. The county statistics bureau later took it upon itself to change the per capita income to 340 yuan. The whole county's per capita net income was raised by 20 yuan, and based on the rule that the peasant's burden may not exceed 5 percent of the per capita income of the previous year, the county was taking away 1 yuan from every peasant. The county claimed that the peasant's share was only a little more than 4 percent, but in fact it was 9 percent. Relevant data show that counties tempering with the per capita net income figures is a nationwide practice; it is only a matter of how far each would go. Rural Electricity Prices Turn Somersaults Walk around any village and mention electricity price and you will see how angry the peasant can get. They are very unhappy with the "electric tiger." Study shows that electricity prices differ among the 21 towns and townships and 250 villages in one county, and none is complying the current state-set price. Some charge more than three times the state-set rate; their receipts come in all shapes, colors, and forms. From data provided by the electricity department, one learns that electricity rate for lighting is a three-tier system: low, normal, and peak rates which translate to 0.129 yuan per degree, 0.257 yuan per degree, and 0.386 yuan per degree respectively. Motive electricity generally cost 0.207 yuan per degree. When I checked the receipts of the 312 electricity customers I visited in the county, I found most were standard invoices used in the cities and a few were town- and village-level invoices; some were blank slips. The Chen family in Group 3 of Miganqiao Village in a certain township owns an electric oven (with two-phase motor.) When the electrician collects the bill, he adds the amount of electricity consumed by the oven to the bill. That household's monthly electric bill comes to an average of 50 yuan. The Sunjiabao Village in a certain township makes its own electric bills and charges as much as 0.70 yuan per degree, which shocks most people. Two villages in another town issues blank slips and charges 0.30 all the way up to 0.60 yuan per degree. Some peasant families have to make do with oil lamps. Some village group cadres pay little or nothing for electricity. This has become a common practice. This is because village-level cadres can hire and fire electricians at will. Those who obey the village cadres, who do special favors for the cadres' families, and who do not charge the cadres will get the jobs, and so the electricians collaborate and add the cadres' household electric bills onto the other villagers' bills and even raise the charges as they please to let the cadres reap a profit. Improper Apportionment Still Runs Rampant Today, when the leading cadres go out, they want to show off. They want fancy cars, the best-selling cars. They get money by hook or by crook so that they can buy cars. They use bank loans to buy cars; they spend official administrative funds on cars. Despite specific regulations handed down by the State Council regarding the grades of cars they can buy, everybody, regardless of rank, is buying a Santana. A certain township has a new "Beijing" jeep. In June of this year [as published], it appropriated 20,000 from each township-affiliated enterprise, and without getting permission from the purchase-control office, bought a Santana. A few days later, the county financial bureau sent someone down to investigate. The township leader wined and dined him and paid a fine. An illegal car was thus legalized. The year's jeep is to be used by the county leaders when they go to the villages, and the new Santana is for use when they go to town. Today, the township party committee secretary reportedly is rewarded for the clever apportionment and is put to work in high places by the county leadership. Appropriating money from township enterprises in fact is adding to the peasants' burdens. Some Thoughts on Easing the Burden Since the 1980's, the Party Central Committee and the State Council have paid special attention to the issue of the peasants' burden. They have always made protecting the peasants' interests the most important starting point of their rural work. They have promulgated a series of policies and measures which have played a definite role in easing the peasants' burden. But why is the cancer of heavy burden still here? The problem lies in the fact that some localities and departments are half-hearted in carrying out the policies; they move and then stop, and they distort the policies, or they just go through the motion of carrying out the policies. One of the keys to reducing the peasants' burden lies in the hands of the leading departments at all levels, because many projects that add to the peasants' burden originate from these departments. If they do not have a sound and clear understanding of the problem of the peasants' heavy burden, if they do not begin to take effective measures, it will be difficult to solve the problem. To reduce the peasants' burden, there must be a set of laws and regulations which would severely punish those who impose heavy burdens on the peasants, so that the party's rural policy can be implemented smoothly and without obstacle. To ease the peasants' burden, all sides must work together and lend their support. Speeding up rural economic development and increasing the peasants' income are also necessary conditions for easing the peasants' burden.
