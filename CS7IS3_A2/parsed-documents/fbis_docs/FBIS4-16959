Under the agreement, Iran was supposed to annually deliver 10 to 12 Bn cubic meters of gas and 5 Mn tonnes of oil. However, according to the Ukrainian embassy in Tehran, the agreement actually did not come into force because the question of building a gas pipeline from Iran to Ukraine remained open. The Ukrainian side is unable to supply the pipes and other building materials. Besides, the pipeline was to cross Russian territory and no agreement was reached on the project with Russia. At talks in Tehran on Monday the Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko and the Iranian Oil and Gas Minister Gholam Reza Agazadeh reached preliminary agreement on increasing Iranian gas supplies along the existing gas pipeline to Azerbaijan by 3 Bn cubic meters. Turkmenistan should accordingly reduce gas supplies to Azerbaijan and increase deliveries to Ukraine. According to the Ukrainian Embassy, the pattern of gas deliveries has been discussed with Azerbaijan. Meanwhile, talks with Turkmenistan on the matter have not been held. Last February Turkmenistan stopped direct gas deliveries to Ukraine when the Ukrainian debt rose to $700 Mn. The talks in Tehran reportedly focused on the possibility of Iranian oil supplies in exchange for Ukrainian farm goods. As the Ukrainian facilities technologically are unable to refine Iranian oil, deliveries will evidently follow the same pattern as in the case of gas -- using a third country. The patterns of delivery will be finalized during sessions of a mixed commission for trade and economic cooperation. An agreement between the two countries might be signed during the visit to Ukraine by the Iranian President Hashemi-Rafsanjani planned for this year.
