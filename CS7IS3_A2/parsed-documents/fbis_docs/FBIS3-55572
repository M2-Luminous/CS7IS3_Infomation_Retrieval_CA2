You will agree that against a background abounding with examples of the failure to oblige or to display assiduity, including on questions of state importance, this appears encouraging. I will remind you that it was planned to form the Russian Armed Forces in three stages, over six or maybe even eight years. In particular, at the first stage (during 1992) it was proposed: -- to create the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense; -- to create the legal basis of the building and functioning of the Armed Forces; -- to elaborate the structure, combat composition, and groupings of the Armed Forces; -- to withdraw to Russia's territory the troops under its jurisdiction; -- to complete the formation of administrative agencies of the Armed Forces. The creation of the Defense Ministry was the priority area in all this work in 1992. As is known, the Russian Federation president approved the statute on it 27 July. By that time (the end of July) the elaboration of the structures of the Armed Forces for the next few years and the longer term was practically complete, the complexion of the ministry itself had been decided, and the basis of the concept of the organizational development of the Armed Forces had been drawn up. In addition, a thorough and objective stocktaking of existing arms and hardware was carried out in 1992. The status of the Russian troops stationed outside the country was decided at an interstate level. In addition to their withdrawal to Russian territory, there was a planned reduction in the numbers of personnel, arms, and military hardware. The fundamentals of the legal basis of the organizational development and functioning of the Armed Forces were also drawn up. In August 1992 the Ural Military District was reinstated, the reforming of a number of other districts was begun.... Thus, by the end of the first stage of the formation of the Russian Armed Forces we already had quite a clear idea of their structure and, most importantly, we had bodies capable of administering them. At the same time the Defense Ministry's new structure is fundamentally different from the previous one. Above all, in terms of a clearer demarcation of functions within the central apparatus, which by November 1992 had been reduced by more than 30 percent (approximately 6,000 people). Some 140 generals' posts, 41 directorates, and 140 departments and sectors had been abolished. Directorates of the high commands of troops of sectors, of the Turkestan Military District, of two armies of the Transcaucasus Military District, and of several divisions and military schools had also ceased to exist. By the end of the year the strength of the Armed Forces as a whole had fallen by more than 200,000 men. As we have already told our readers, the tasks at the second stage (1993-1994) of the formation of the Russian Armed Forces are: -- to complete, in the main, the withdrawal of Russian troops from other territories; -- to reduce and reform the troops (forces) and to create a military infrastructure on Russian territory; -- to create and enshrine in legislation a system of social guarantees for servicemen, members of their families, and persons discharged from military service into the reserve or into retirement (including ahead of schedule); -- to go over to a mixed system of manning the Army and Navy with personnel; -- to introduce alternative service. KRASNAYA ZVEZDA's readers have been informed about the way these tasks were resolved in 1993. With the withdrawal of troops from East European countries, as is known, the first strategic defense echelon of the former Soviet Union ceased to exist. Troops of the second echelon have pulled back to Ukraine and Belarus, and their withdrawal from the Baltic region is continuing. As a result, military districts which had been internal -- Moscow, Leningrad, and North Caucasus -- have become border districts. The Ural and Volga Military Districts are becoming a base for the preparation of mobilization resources and a basis for creating a new operational-strategic formation. The withdrawal of Russian troops from other territories will continue this year. In particular, it is planned to withdraw 250,000 servicemen and approximately 120,000 units of diverse hardware from the Western and Northwestern Groups of Forces, the Transcaucasus, and the Baltic countries. It is proposed that this process can be completed before 1 September. In connection with the aforementioned changes in the military-strategic situation and the troop withdrawal the work on creating troop groupings and a military infrastructure on Russian territory, on improving their organization and establishment, and on equipping them with modern hardware and armament will naturally be continued. Consequently, groupings of conventional armed forces will essentially be created anew on Russian territory before 1995. At the same time there is to be a sharp reduction in the overall number of large strategic formations and combined units. In the opinion of experts, the groupings which are being created will be capable of repulsing aggression in local and regional wars and military conflicts. In the event of a large-scale war being unleashed, they will be capable of ensuring the strategic deployment of the Armed Forces. The existing structures of the Armed Forces (Strategic Missile Forces, Ground Forces, Air Defense Forces, Air Force, Navy) and the way the Russian Federation's territory is divided up from military-administrative perspective will be preserved for the time being. The priority tasks for 1994 include the creation of mobile forces capable of quickly being transferred, being deployed, and conducting mobile combat operations in any direction and in any region where a threat to Russia's military security arises. It cannot be ruled out that that the arrnagements for and planning of the organizational development of the Armed Forces will be determined more precisely, taking account of the state system of planning that is taking shape and economic and other realities. The switch to the mixed method of manning the Army and Navy began in 1993. According to General Staff data, contract servicemen already hold one post in every seven among those manned by privates, sergeants, and petty officers. This year they are to make up 30 percent of the Armed Forces' total personnel strength. Posts which determine the combat effectiveness of units and ships and also troops fulfilling peacemaking functions will primarily be manned by specialists volunteering for military service under contract. Naturally, the quality of this contingent will largely depend on those who recruit volunteers and, in particular, on their ability to prevent persons whose moral and professional qualities are poor from finding their way into the military. At the same time the continuation of the policy of professionalizing the Army will require the allocation of new targeted budget appropriations, the drawing up of new normative acts, etc. In general, in terms of the organizational development of the Armed Forces, 1994 will be remarkable for the fact that we already have a practically full "military package" of laws, right down to the general military regulations. The "Main Provisions of the Russian Federation's Military Doctrine," adopted at the end of last year, make the work of shaping the Armed Forces still more focused not only in the political and strictly military respects, but also as regards military-technical and economic aspects. All this certainly does not mean, however, that the new parliament no longer has anything to do in the sphere of military legislation. Rather, on the contrary, life is posing more and more new tasks here. These include, incidentally, the introduction of alternative service planned for the second stage of shaping the Armed Forces.
