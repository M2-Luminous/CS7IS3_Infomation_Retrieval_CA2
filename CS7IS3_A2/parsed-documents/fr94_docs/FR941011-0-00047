FR941011-0-00047 FR941011-0-00012 (3) Any change in visibility since the last such report; (4) Additional measures, including the need for SIP revisions, that may be necessary to assure reasonable progress toward the national visibility goal; (5) The progress achieved in implementing BART and meeting other schedules set forth in the long-term strategy; (6) The impact of any exemption granted under section 303; (7) The need for BART to remedy existing visibility impairment of any integral vista listed in the plan since the last such report. EPA's regulations call for the State to make progress in remedying existing visibility impairment in mandatory Class I Federal areas and to report on measures that may be necessary to assure reasonable progress toward the national visibility goal. The State should move expeditiously to assess the visibility impairment at the Mount Zirkel Wilderness Area. Further, the State should prioritize its assessment by examining the potential sources of visibility impairment identified in the USFS's certification. The State's assessment should be designed to provide results that can be addressed in the next long-term strategy report, due by September 1, 1995. See the July 29, 1994 letter from John Seitz, EPA Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, in response to a letter from the commenter to Mary Nichols, EPA Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. In its letter to Mary Nichols, which was incorporated in its comments on this action, the commenter expressed concerns about the State's response to the USFS certification. EPA expects the State to address the U.S. Forest Service's certification of impairment at the Mt. Zirkel Wilderness Area in its next long-term strategy review and report, due by September 1, 1995. In order for EPA to assess the progress the State achieves in remedying the existing visibility impairment at the Mt. Zirkel Wilderness Area, that report should include the results to date of the State's reasonable attribution study, results of any other relevant analyses, and a decision on whether or not there is adequate information to determine if the visibility impairment at Mt. Zirkel Wilderness Area is reasonably attributable to any specific stationary source/sources. If the State concludes that it has adequate information, it follows that the State should determine whether or not the impairment is attributable to specific sources. If the State concludes that it has insufficient information, the State should indicate the steps that are being taken to collect the necessary information and by what date such information will be available. EPA will carefully review the State's next long-term strategy to ensure that it meets applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. In the interim, EPA will provide guidance to help achieve these ends. Finally, should EPA determine that the State's visibility protection plan is substantially inadequate to ensure that the applicable statutory and regulatory requirements are met, EPA has discretion to call for a revision to the plan to correct the inadequacies. See Clean Air Act section 110(k)(5). III. This Action Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565&hyph;13566). In a letter dated November 18, 1992, the Governor of Colorado submitted to EPA revisions to the State's long-term strategy of the Class I Visibility Protection SIP. As described in EPA's proposed action (59 FR 25002&hyph;25004, May 13, 1994), these revisions were made to address the Federal and Colorado requirements to review and, if necessary, revise the long-term strategy at least every three years. This submittal updates the State's visibility long-term strategy. Pursuant to section 110(k)(1) of the Act, EPA found the submittal to be complete and so notified the Governor in a letter dated January 15, 1993.
