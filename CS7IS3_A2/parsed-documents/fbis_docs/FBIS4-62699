Of course, the press was not so much interested in the list of goods that the Crimea is going to trade with Moscow, as in the very fact of Meshkov's meeting with one of the most prominent Russian politicians who was recently named among plausible successors to either Boris Yeltsin or Viktor Chernomyrdin. The content of the negotiations between Meshkov and Luzhkov has remained a secret for journalists as also the content of the huge bag that Meshkov presented to the Moscow mayor (Luzhkov presented the Crimean president with a vase decorated with the Russian coat of arms). At the news conference given after the signing of the agreement on economic cooperation, the Moscow mayor recalled that Moscow already has similar agreements with both former Soviet republics and subjects of the Russian state. However, the agreement with the Crimea is, after all, special: The mayor considers the political processes on the peninsula to be incomplete and calls upon Russians to assist the Crimea. Luzhkov characterized going to the Crimea on vacations as a patriotic duty of every Russian citizen. The head of the autonomy was less fastidious in his statements. He expressed confidence that the fact of both sides' being apart was temporary, as "the economy will unite all of us," proposed that the problem of the Black Sea Fleet be resolved in the course of bilateral negotiations between Russia... and the Crimea (!), and bitterly complained at the conduct of [Ukraine's defense minister] General Radetskyy, who had imprudently reminded Meshkov of the actual meaning of his "autonomous post." While characterizing "Ukraine's economic collapse," Meshkov reminded the audience that every nationalism has two paths: One toward economic dislocation and the second -- toward a civil war. "For the time being, Ukraine has opted for the former, but it is at a dangerous brink," stressed Meshkov, who tried, in all of his other statements, to adhere to the role of a well-wishing director of a holiday home and guaranteed the Russians every security, if they finally succumbed to the joint persuasions by the mayor and president and go to the Crimea. In Yuriy Meshkov's opinion, it is only now that the holiday-making in the Crimea is so cheap, since the Crimean leader sees his peninsula precisely in the ruble zone, perhaps, next to Tajikistan involved in conflicts.... Therefore, everybody must be in a hurry.
