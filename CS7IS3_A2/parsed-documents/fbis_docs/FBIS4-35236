FBIS4-35236 "drnes104_m_94002" FBIS-NES-94-104 Daily Report 30 May 1994 JORDAN UN Envoy for Iraqi Disarmament Visits Amman UN Envoy for Iraqi Disarmament Visits Amman Meets With Iraqi Officials JN3005124694 Amman AL-DUSTUR in Arabic 30 May 94 pp 32, 24 JN3005124694 Amman AL-DUSTUR Arabic BFN [Report by Hamdan al-Hajj] [Text] Amman--Rolf Ekeus, head of the UN Special Commission entrusted with disarming Iraq, has said that he will submit a detailed report on Iraq's positive positions toward the Commission's efforts. At the same time, Ekeus asserted that the UN Security Council will discuss the situation in Iraq on 2 July. He, however, ruled out a final decision on the economic blockade imposed on Iraq. He said there will be detailed discussions on easing these sanctions. In an exclusive statement to AL-DUSTUR, Ekeus described Iraq's response to the Commission's efforts as constructive, noting that they supported the Commission's tasks. This is despite the fact that Iraq's response to Security Council Resolution No. 715 was delayed for at least three years, which postponed discussions and monitoring of the arms possessed by Iraq. Consequently, this has perpetuated the Iraqi people's suffering due to the failure of their leadership to respond to the international resolutions. Ekeus said he expected there to be a possibility for reducing the suffering the Iraqis are facing if precise monitoring and follow-up systems for Iraqi arms are worked out. He pointed out that if the Security Council member states, particularly those with the right to veto, are convinced, matters will become easier later. However, matters will not stop at this because Iraq will later be asked to recognize the new Kuwaiti border, solve some humanitarian issues, and confirm its real intention toward regional stability and peace in general. Ekeus noted that the Commission's task is not confined to removing and destroying Iraqi arms but also includes verifying that Iraq will not acquire these arms again whether by manufacturing them, importing them, or both. He asserted that Iraq will not be simply left alone after it fully implements and totally responds to the Security Council resolutions. There will be continuous and long-term monitoring of Iraqi arms lasting seven or more years to prevent Iraq from manufacturing arms or approaching such things again. He indicated that Iraq is one of the richest countries in the world. Who knows what Iraq will do after lifting the embargo and ending the suffering it is passing through? Iraq may need a few months to recover, so monitoring must continue, he said. Ekeus stressed that Iraq should resort to peace, stability, and building of its state on bases far from armament in order to remove the fears and doubts of its neighbors in the entire region. Before departing Amman yesterday evening, Ekeus said the Iraqi Government has actually begun to comply with the Security Council resolutions pertaining to the economic sanctions on Iraq, and that he is optimistic about ending the blockade imposed on Iraq in the near future. In a statement to AL-DUSTUR, he added that his talks with 'Amir Rashid, head of the Iraqi Military Industrialization Organization, were fruitful and that he sensed Iraq's real desire for commitment and for ending the sanctions imposed on it. Ekeus also met with [Iraq's UN representative] Nizar Hamdun. They discussed Iraqi arms, inspection issues, and the extent of their conformity with the Security Council resolutions. Ekeus said that this is the first time he has met with Iraqi officials in Amman.
