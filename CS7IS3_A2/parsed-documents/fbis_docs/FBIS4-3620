At a meeting this afternoon, the leaders endorsed a policy platform for a new cabinet and named Hata as the coalition's joint candidate for the prime ministerial election in both houses of the Diet (parliament) that is expected to meet next Monday, coalition officials said. Hata, 58, concurrently the deputy prime minister in the Hosokawa cabinet, is expected to win the premiership election because of the coalition's majority status in the Diet. Soon after the election, Hata, who is the leader of Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) which is the coalition's core party, is expected to launch his new administration, the officials said. The endorsement of Hata came after secretaries general of the ruling parties struck a deal early today on two key issues -- tax system reform and Japan's response to the suspected nuclear development program on the Korean peninsula. The agreement put an end to two weeks of feud, first over the procedures for picking Hosokawa's successor and then over the above- mentioned two issues, which are crucial to keeping the nine-month-old alliance intact.
