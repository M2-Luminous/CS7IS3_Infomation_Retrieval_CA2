FR941213-0-00034 FR941213-0-00008 On November 19, 1993, the MBHES issued a Board order approving the Missoula PM 10 and CO contingency measures and revisions to the Missoula City-County regulations. These regulations and the November 19, 1993 Board order were submitted to EPA as a modification to the Montana SIP. The Missoula City-County rules are in effect now. The State of Montana has a program that will ensure that the contingency measures contained in the Missoula SIP are adequately enforced. EPA believes that the State's and Missoula's existing air enforcement program will be adequate. The TSD for this action contains further information on enforceability requirements, responsibilities, and a discussion of the personnel and funding intended to support effective implementation of the control measures. III. Final Action EPA is approving Montana's SIP revisions, submitted by the Governor with a letter dated March 2, 1994, for the Missoula, Montana nonattainment area. This submittal addressed PM 10 and CO contingency measure plans that were due on November 15, 1993. These plans involve the incorporation of a new Subchapter 3 (Contingency Measure Selection Process) in Chapter IX of the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program and revisions to Chapter IX, Subchapter 14, Rule 1401 (regarding the contingency measure to expand the area of regulated road sanding materials) and Rule 1428 (regarding the contingency measure to void certain solid fuel burning device permits). The March 2, 1994 submittal also revised several Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program regulations, as committed to be completed by the Governor of Montana to EPA in a letter dated November 30, 1992. Due to the satisfaction of those commitments, EPA can now approve the following portions of Chapter IX of the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program, as submitted on August 20, 1991, with revisions submitted June 4, 1992, and March 2, 1994: (1) Subchapter 4, Emergency Procedures; (2) all portions of Subchapter 11, Permit, Construction, and Operation of Contaminant Sources_except Rules 1102(3), 1105(2), and 1111(2) (the portions of Subchapter 11 that EPA is approving relate to construction permits); (3) Subchapter 13, Open Burning; and (4) Subchapter 14, Rule 1407, Wood-Waste Burners. Although EPA is approving Missoula's construction permit regulations of Subchapter 11 as part of the SIP, EPA's approval does not include Missoula's minor source operating permit regulations. EPA is declining to take action on Missoula's minor source operating permit regulations, which are found in Chapter IX: Subchapter 11, Rules 1102(3), 1105(2), and 1111(2), because they do not meet the criteria of the June 28, 1989 Federal Register document. These criteria must be met in order for the minor source operating permits to be considered federally enforceable (see 54 FR 27282). EPA also approves minor revisions to previously approved Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program Chapter VII and Chapter VIII, as included in the March 2, 1994 submittal. Finally, EPA is disapproving Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program, Chapter X, Variances, as adopted by the MBHES on June 28, 1991, and submitted by the Governor of Montana in a letter dated August 20, 1991. This chapter is not consistent with section 110(i) of the Clean Air Act, which prohibits any State or EPA from granting a variance from any requirement of an applicable implementation plan with respect to a stationary source. EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in this Federal Register publication, EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be filed. Under the procedures established in the May 10, 1994 Federal Register (59 FR 24054), this action will be effective February 13, 1995 unless, by January 12, 1995, adverse or critical comments are received. If such comments are received, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a subsequent final rule based on this action serving as a proposed rule. EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no such comments are received, the public is advised that this action will be effective on February 13, 1995. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to a SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600, et seq. , EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. Approvals of SIP submittals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the Clean Air Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Clean Air Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. Union Electric Co. v. U.S. E.P.A., 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2). EPA's disapproval_of the portion of the submittal containing Missoula's variance rule_under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act does not affect any existing requirements applicable to small entities. Any pre-existing Federal requirements remain in place after this disapproval. Federal disapproval of the state submittal does not affect its state-enforceability. Moreover, EPA's disapproval of the submittal does not impose any new Federal requirements. Therefore, EPA certifies that this disapproval action does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because it does not remove existing requirements nor does it impose any new Federal requirements. Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by February 13, 1995. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review must be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements (see section 307(b)(2)). The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has exempted this regulatory action from E.O. 12866 review.
