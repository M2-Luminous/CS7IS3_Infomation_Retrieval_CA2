He told TASS on Thursday that "a basis had been laid for future goal-oriented work". According to the admiral, during the ten-day break in the talks experts from both sides will specify the list of ships of the fleet, will study all its bases and assess the cost of the navy and shore facilities. It has been agreed in principle that Ukraine will get 18 per cent of the fleet, according to Gromov. He said that both the Russian and Ukrainian delegations came to the Moscow talks with their own plans of solving the dispute. However, a common variant was drafted on the first day and became the subject of all discussions. The second round of talks is to be held in Kiev.
