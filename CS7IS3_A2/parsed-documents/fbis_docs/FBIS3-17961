It is losing value not by the day but by the hour. To cover up this patent devaluation the National Bank of Azerbaijan periodically sets a new manat rate against the currencies of the former Union republics. The initial rate was confusing -- one manat to 10 Russian rubles [R]. Why not 20? Commercial bank specialists have reason to call a "ceiling" -- this arbitrarily established rate has not been borne out by any exchange trading. So what prompted the new rate of one to 14? As a rule, attempts to discern the economic laws on which the exchange rate is based prove pointless. On the currency black market -- the famous "Molokanka" (from the name of a pleasant little square in downtown Baku) -- people are trading at a rate of R1,000 to 275 manats, paying no attention to the bankers' sluggishness. The people on the square do not rule out the possibility that in a month or so a ruble could be worth the same as a manat. Hyperinflation has long been part and parcel of the Azerbaijani economy, forcing the manat into the most improbable contortions. This was to be expected: Deformations in the economy seem to happen on their own, and the manat has been left to its own devices, as if orphaned. Despite the fact that state property has not been privatized and the mechanism of market relations has not been fully realized, the new manat has been allowed to float. No currency can function normally without a weight of goods to back it -- and home-produced goods at that. Having failed to make deliveries of output and goods outside the republic under the clearing system, enterprises have been deprived of reciprocal shipments worth 6 billion manats. Half of last year's cotton and grape crops were not harvested. Meanwhile 80 percent of foodstuffs are bought on the side for foreign currency -- weak petrodollars. And these are getting fewer and further between, since oil extraction in the republic has fallen by 800,000 tonnes. There is no harm in admitting that home-grown businessmen are making a good living from the people's baleful position. The state owes 22 billion manats in wages and pensions, while ministries, departments, enterprises, and commercial structures are keeping R27 billion that they owe to others in Russian bank accounts, earning fabulous rates of interest. President Heydar Aliyev has demanded that the leaders of debtor organizations repatriate forthwith their exported capital or the products that have been bought with it. Meanwhile specialists believe that the hidden billions are unlikely to save the Azerbaijani economy. The following weighty argument is also quoted: Transactions with Russian banks are not effective [ne deystvuyut], and the Central Bank of Russia is hardly likely to agree to such operations, recalling Azerbaijan's large debts. Has not the time come to print larger-denomination manats? Those in circulation cannot keep up with galloping prices. The consignment of manats expected to arrive from France will be enough to pay the wage and pension backlog. And the manat continues to float.
