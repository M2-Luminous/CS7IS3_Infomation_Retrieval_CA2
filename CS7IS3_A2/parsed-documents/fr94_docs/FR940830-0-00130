The maintenance fee requirements and waivers from the maintenance fee are described in §§3833.0&hyph;3(f), 3833.1&hyph;5, 3833.1&hyph;6, and 3833.1&hyph;7 of this title. 37.

Alternatively, this notice may be given by publication in the newspaper published nearest the claim for at least once a week for 90 days. If, upon the expiration of 90 days, after such notice in writing, or upon the expiration of 180 days after the first newspaper publication of notice, the delinquent co-owner shall have failed to contribute the proportionate share of such expenditures or improvements, such interest in the claim by law passes to the co-owners who have made the expenditures or improvements. (b) A claimant alleging ownership of a forfeited interest under paragraph (a) of this section who requests the authorized officer to change the ownership records of the affected mining claims or sites shall present the following: (1) Statement of the publisher of the newspaper as to the facts of publication, giving the beginning and ending dates of publication, a printed copy of the notice published, and a statement by the claimant that the delinquent co-owner failed to contribute the proper proportion within the period fixed by the statute, or (2) Evidence of personal notice of delinquency upon the delinquent party. If notice is effected by mail, the minimum sufficient evidence shall consist of a copy of the notice and a copy of the return receipt of the U.S. Postal Service evidencing receipt by the delinquent party of a registered or certified envelope containing the notice.
