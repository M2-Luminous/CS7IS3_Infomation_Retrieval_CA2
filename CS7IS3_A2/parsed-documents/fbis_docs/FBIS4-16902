The ITAR-TASS correspondent learned this at the Black Sea Fleet's press center. Russia is known to oppose the idea of a joint base for Black Sea Fleet vessels and the Ukrainian Navy. In the view of Russian experts, Sevastopol should remain the main base for the Black Sea Fleet. The Black Sea Fleet's press center said that many hopes of settling the problems of the Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol are placed on the three-day visit to the main base of the Black Sea Fleet by Russian Defense Minister Army General Pavel Grachev, which begins today. Immediately after his arrival this evening, Pavel Grachev is expected to meet with the Fleet Command and the city's administration. Talks with a Ukrainian military delegation are to begin Thursday at 1000. The signing of Russian-Ukrainian documents is expected Friday.
