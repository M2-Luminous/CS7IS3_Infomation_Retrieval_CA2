According to the decision of the top CPC leadership, the meeting will mainly consider and arrange the work of the mass media, including newspapers and journals, cultural work, broadcast and television affairs, publishing affairs, and overseas propaganda, through further emancipating the minds in the course of establishing the socialist market economy. According to sources, this will be the second propaganda work conference that has been undertaken on such a grand scale and at such a high level since the founding of the PRC. The previous national propaganda work conference was held in 1957. CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin will give a speech at the meeting. During the national propaganda work conference, the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, journalist and publishing institutions, radio and television system, institutions in charge of cultural affairs, and the overseas propaganda department will also separately hold their own meetings at the same time. The central leadership fully affirmed the orientation of opinion in the recent period and said that it was necessary to continue to carry out the principle of unity, stability, and encouragement, to maintain continuity in propaganda work, and to stress the key points in various periods under the new situation of building the socialist market economy. This so-called continuity refers to the point that the propaganda work as a whole should be conducted around the main theme of Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. At the same time, an emphasis should be placed on specific key points in various periods.
