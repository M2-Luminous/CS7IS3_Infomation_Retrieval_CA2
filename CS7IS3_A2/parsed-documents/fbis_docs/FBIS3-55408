This is the first meeting the head of the Russian cabinet has had with such a representative group of journalists since he became prime minister a year ago. The meeting may untie the complex knot of problems which has risen since the government's 25 November decision to reassess the basic assets of national economy enterprises. Media chiefs believe that the increase in the value of the basic assets of printing enterprises will lead to a six-fold increase in the cost of typographical services. The critical situation which has emerged has thus far all but led, like all journalists' protests, to a suspension of the publication of a number of publications from 10 January. Opening the meeting, Viktor Chernomyrdin stressed that the Russian Government is looking closely at the journalists' problems, but he expressed the opinion that the journalists, who from the outset have favored market reform, have today become fully integrated into market conditions.
