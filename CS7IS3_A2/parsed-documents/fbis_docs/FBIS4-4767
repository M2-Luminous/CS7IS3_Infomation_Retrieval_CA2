Its antecedents are, of course, the venerable CPP [Communist Party of the Philippines] and the revisionist Forte factions, better known as the reaffirmists and the rejectionists, respectively. The long faces at Siglaya's birth announcement could be the result of pondering the shaky future that the Philippine Left faces. The orthodox CPP leadership is in exile in Europe, its chairman-guru forever lecturing on the relevance of Maoism to the "Urgent Tasks" to his coterie of supporters who have seen the practicality of pitching camp in the Netherlands. The second block, headed by Felimon Lagman (who uses Carlos Forte as a nom de guerre), may have seceded from CPP and recruited two or three regional party groups and individual party members to its "Urban Insurrection" cause. Yet no sparks have been flying from Forte's camp except for an ABB [Alex Boncayao Brigade] operation that resulted in the gunning down of same small-time miscreants. Siglaya's leaders made it clear that they do not subscribe to armed struggle in pursuing their vision of "human liberation." Since it acknowledges that it's still in its infantile stages, Siglaya has yet to spell out its charter. Is it influenced by Marxism, by social democracy, by environmentalism? The leading lights of the movement were only recently members of CPP. Hence, they are familiar with "democratic centralism," "proletarian dictatorship" and other practices which governed the lives of Marxist revolutionaries. These theories were great when the party was united and growing in strength against an enemy that didn't hesitate to use fascist methods -- such as the Marcos dictatorship. Never had iron discipline been a great welder of party unity. Of the three currents in the Philippine Left, Siglaya appears to be the moderate option. It steers clear of revolutionary rhetoric and speaks of the "hopes and dreams of our people," and being open to "changing realities and new ideas," and a manner that is "empowering and democratic." In a word, it is fed up with tyranny, double-talk, rural-mindedness, impetuosity, infantile disorder and coercion. Although a proletarian party is expected to uproot these poisonous weeds, in practice the reverse is more likely to happen. When Lagman allowed himself to be interviewed by a TV reporter, he mouthed hackneyed phrases taken from the works of Marx, Lenin and Mao. He had nothing new to say, except that his Manila-Rizal group was seceding from the CPP of Joma [Jose Maria] Sison due to differences in "line and ideology." Some differences. In a dramatic bid to dust up its image, his Alex Boncayao Brigade (ABB) swore to dispense revolutionary justice by executing corrupt officials and heinous criminals. The ABB could only score minor hits but none of the big fish it promised. Meanwhile the Manila-Rizal group is languishing in inactivity. Its ideological leader is none other than Lagman who cannot talk without quoting from the revered names of the revolution. Lagman's group has no prospect but extinction. It is in a muddled mess, neither having an agenda nor a steady source of financial support. As the latter crumbles, the group acquires two options: One is to apply for amnesty and start off on a different foot as peaceful reformists, and the other is to resort to "economic struggles," that is, robbing banks and extorting from businesses and rich people. Should the second option be preferable, the urban insurrectionists will be seen as the new lumpen proletariats of a new age. The CCP [as published], in contrast to Lagman's group, has had a charmed life. Even if the party organization and NPA [New People's Army] units loyal to it gradually shrivels up, the leadership remains intact in Europe. It is possible that Sison, in 1987, foresaw the decline and ebb tide of the revolution. Touring Europe at the time and proffered sage advice by Louie Jalandoni, he concluded that Europe offered him more space and security to inspire, direct and orchestrate the revolution than if he were to return to the Philippines. Besides, the Europeans would be a perfect audience for the CPP founder whose "original" views made him a candidate (along with Abimael Guzman) for the "Revolution's Fourth Sword." In view of Guzman's capture and conciliatory statements attributed to him, Sison, according to his Filipino and European followers, has won the moral right to be crowned the "Fourth Sword." The three other swords are Marx, Lenin and Mao. It is not known how Guzman will take these developments. Although the Peruvian has a whole continent of revolutionaries to ratchet him up, Sison has the militant Utrecht community and a portion of Belgium backstopping him in this epochal showdown.
