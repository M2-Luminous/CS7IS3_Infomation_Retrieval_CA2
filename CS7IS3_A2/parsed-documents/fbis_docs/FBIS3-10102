Workers analyzed the problems of a lack of equipment and spare parts and the immediate possibilities for expanding achievements the industry has made. Sugar Industry Minister Nelson Torres reiterated the need to find immediate solutions in a spirit of cooperation so as to overcome resource shortages. Eugenio Maynegra, head of the Department of Science and Technology of the Central Committee [of the Communist Party of Cuba], said the goal is to improve in the energy area. To that end, work is already being done to install vacuum pumps and to cool turbogenerators and evaporators. The exhibit highlighted the difficulties and problems being faced by this sector in agriculture, transportation, the sugar industry, the by-products industry, construction and assembly, and self-sufficiency, for example. A new period of great challenges is beginning for Minaz workers, from the base-level worker to the highest administrator, in each of its organizations.
