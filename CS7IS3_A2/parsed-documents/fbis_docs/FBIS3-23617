A number of the functions of educational structures are being transferred to other agencies and services. For example, law enforcement and the strengthening of discipline will now be headed by... The Directorate of Routine and Service of the General Staff. The military mass media are also being reformed. The fairly rare ranks of military journals (there are only 14 with a single, combined edition of around 200,000 copies) is being reduced by half. Even publications popular not only with the military but also the civilian readership, such as ARMIYA, the central organ of Russia's Ministry of Defense, AVIATSIYA I KOSMONAVTIKA, TEKHNIKA I VOORUZHENIYE and the weekly SYN OTECHESTVA are going "under the knife." Even at a time of massive loss of readership, these publications have kept their subscribers. ARMIYA has even increased its portion. The magazines VOYENNYY VESTNIK and VOYENNO-EKONOMICHESKIY ZHURNAL with their great popularity and rich history are also undergoing reform. As is usually the case in the military structure, this is being done without taking into account the opinion of those assigned the functions of founders and without the agreement of the journalist teams. The official version of the reform is that the Ministry of Defense wants to establish a more optimal structure of the military mass media. It is also prompted, as it were, by the informational processes occurring in the society and by the reform of the armed forces themselves. The main factor, however, is the fact that the funds for publishing the journals are lacking, and they have to economize. At first glance it all seems convincing. Especially for one who has no concept of what is taking place in the military's top echelons today and believes sacredly that the taxpayers' money to support the armed forces is being spent prudently and thriftily. The journalists themselves believe that there are other reasons for the reform of military publications, however. They are revealed in part by an article published in the 2 February issue of KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA. The author, military journalist A. Petrov, writes of the danger of eliminating the weekly SYN OTECHESTVA. The weekly (like a number of military magazines--N.G.) was not included in the catalog for the first half of this year, which actually means that it no longer exists. SYN OTECHESTVA is well known in the nation. It has been published since 1812. The weekly provides an interesting and vital account of the armed forces. Like the military magazines, it performs an important role in the information flow. It firmly holds to a course of military patriotic indoctrination of the army and navy youth and contributes to the shaping of the best qualities of defenders of the homeland in the servicemen. The weekly may now suffer the sad fate of its companion journals. The author of a KOMSOMOLKA article bitterly laments the fact that the number of military newspapers and magazines is being cut, but not the army of press officials. That army actually exists. Judge for yourself. During the communist era the mass media were run by a press section of the well-known GlavPUR [Main Political Directorate of the Revolutionary Military Council], fewer than a dozen members (four officers, two Soviet Army employees, headed by a major general). The military press is run today by an entire directorate of information and the press of the Russian Federation's Ministry of Defense. Major-General Vladimir Kosarev, its chief, naturally has a higher position rating (lieutenant-general). Like any self-respecting directorate this one has several sections and groups headed by colonels. Each section has two or three officers, of course. Nor could we fail to mention the press centers of the branches of forces, troop arms, districts, groups of forces and fleets, which also contain not just a single dozen press officials. And so, the military press is being "optimized" through a reduction of its small staff. But even this is not the whole truth, as they say. Many reformers like to refer to Western models--when it is to their advantage, of course. Let me make reference to some foreign examples. The Pentagon publishes around 400 magazines and 1,000 newspapers with a total circulation of 12.5 million copies. In Germany there are around 100 military publications; in Great Britain, more than 110. We have only 102. To the same extent we accede to the leading countries of the world in the concentration of the mass media on the armed forces in the information arena. And is it not strange that we are presently artificially cutting these means, actually constricting the sphere of influence upon military personnel? The army is rightly considered to be one of the guarantors of the state's stability. This accounts for the desire of far-sighted leaders to strengthen not only its structure but also its spirit, to see to the moral and spiritual state of the servicemen. The military press is also expected to perform this mission. Will it be capable of doing this effectively, however, after it is reformed? In an interview with the magazine ARMIYA, Major-General V. Kosarev commented that the military press is living through far from the best of times. According to him, this is primarily due to lack of financing. But our directorate has been given hope, they say, in seeking a way out, a way to get the money, in close contact with the Main Directorate of the Budget and Financing.... And they have found it. They are cutting the popular publications which do not require significant outlays, while retaining the unprofitable ones with small circulations. Where is the logic? If, as V. Kosarev asserts, the solution to the problem lies in funds, then how does one explain the fact that for almost a year now the magazine CHEST IMEYU (the present name of SOVETSKIY VOIN) has not been published while continuing to exist in good standing? And its staff has more than 100 members, 55 of them officers. This is truly a "golden magazine." But inaccessible to the reader, and not just due to the high subscription price. The main cause of the "inaccessibility" is otherwise. Last year the subscribers received only 6 of 12 issues. Incidentally, without any kind of explanation or compensation. Furthermore a subsidy of 40 million rubles was required to publish these six issues. It would be difficult to say how much will be needed this year. Obviously, no less than required to publish the reduced list of military journals. Nonetheless, the matter of reorganizing and particularly of eliminating the former SOVETSKIY VOIN is not at issue. Furthermore, plans are in the air at the "upper levels" for publishing this journal jointly with a Finnish printing enterprise. Can this really cost the Ministry of Defense less in the present situation? If "money determines all," do the reformers of the military press know how to count it? Their most potent argument is that two publications will replace the seven being eliminated. They will take on the functions of the former publications. The number of slots in the military journalists' shop will indeed be reduced somewhat. Along with this, however, outlays for publishing the new journals will undoubtedly substantially increase various registration costs, subscription fees and so forth. Most important is the fact that these publications will turn out to be impotent and ineffective, therefore unprofitable. In general the reform contains a number of paradoxes. Take just the journal ARMIYA. Its editorial board includes Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, chief of General Staff Mikhail Kolesnikov, advisers to the President of the Russian Federation, and the current chairman of the Defense Committee of the State Duma, Sergey Yushenkov. One has to ask whether the elimination of ARMIYA does not mean that the editorial board has "led the magazine astray"? If that is the case, however, then where is the guilt of the editorial board whose fate is presently in question? All of this raises the question: What is the objective of the reform of the military press? Common sense suggests that no reform is justifiable if it is detrimental to the interests of the people and the cause. A reorganization of the military press is inevitable, of course. It is politically justified, scientifically substantiated and economically expedient. But do the higher military officials understand this? And all the time someone continues with enviable persistence to destroy the military press and the informational arena in the armed forces. It would be difficult to predict the effects of this destruction. I shall risk one suggestion, however. If you agree that a good half of the military members were backers of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy during the parliamentary elections of December 1993, how many of them might there be by the time of the presidential elections?
