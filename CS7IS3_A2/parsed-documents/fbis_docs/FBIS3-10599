Approximately 1.5 million quintals of tubers and vegetables will be picked this month in Havana Province, including a significant quantity of potatoes, while in April some 2 million quintals of agricultural products are expected to be harvested. These measures were adopted to prevent these agricultural products from reaching other destinations. These measures include the control of the fleet of trucks that will participate in the Agro-94 campaign, preventing them from taking other than assigned routes. These measures will not be limited to the outskirts of Havana, but will be extended to all of the capital's distribution and collection areas up to (La Placita). During the meeting, Palmero Hernandez said that black market proliferation must be stopped. He added that certain elements are dedicated to profiting at the expense of the people.
