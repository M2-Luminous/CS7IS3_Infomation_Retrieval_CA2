However, this is not only a consequence of market reforms, but also a condition for success of these reforms. After all, scientific-technical potential is practically the only strategic resource that Russia can rely on to extricate herself from economic crisis. We decided to turn the podium over to specialists who have long and persistently tried to call the attention of the authorities and the public to this issue. OBSHCHAYA GAZETA was visited by Yuriy Naydo, director of the Center of Structural Studies and Industrial Policy of IMEPI RAN, and Stanislav Simanovskiy, director of the sector of innovative policy of the same institute. Yuriy Naydo: Unfortunately, failure of the state to take action is leading to Russia's de facto loss of ``technological sovereignty'': scientific-technical potential is rapidly being destroyed, erosion of key personnel is glaringly evident, the material-technical and informational base of science is deteriorating, and scientific-technical projects lie dormant. A situation where science is being transformed to nothing but expense is one of the terrible signs of loss of technological security of the nation. This is inevitably followed by a widening lag behind the world community and lopsided technological dependence on developed Western nations that will be very difficult to overcome. As a result, our nation will be unable to make a claim to participation in the international division of labor as a partner on equal footing, and will be condemned to continually pumping a considerable fraction of its national income over to the use of states on a higher stage of scientific-technical development. Stanislav Simanovskiy: As we change over to the market, to an open economy, there is a sharp increase in the role of international cooperation. Without it, Russian science will be hard put to survive, since there is almost no internal demand on the transitional stage for domestic scientific and engineering advances. And this means that without international cooperation we cannot avoid the collapse of the scientific-technical potential of Russia. But this is only one obvious aspect of the problem. Another aspect is not so obvious at first glance. The fact is that international cooperation, allowed to find its own level, objectively carries the threat of a decline in national technological security. This is confirmed if only by the example of today's assistance given by the world community to Russian science. Today the volume of such assistance (both actually provided and pledged) is about $600 million. More than ten different funds have been established in the West to support science in Russia. Among others, there are the well known Soros Fund that allocates 100 million dollars to CIS nations for 1993-1994, the U.S. National Science Fund ($25 million), the Mitterrand Fund, General European Fund (4 million) and so on. In my opinion, Russia ought to accept such help with gratitude. But in doing so, she is obliged to take care that this assistance does nothing to harm the technological security of the nation. For instance just take the system of gathering information about research and development, scientific institutions and key researchers when submitting requests for grants and other aid. It gives the West an exhaustive picture of Russian scientific- technical potential. And it does this in detail that at times is not accessible to Russian governmental agencies responsible for the development of science and engineering. The most promising research and the most productive scientists can be freely used in the interests of Western science, engineering, and economy as a whole. In particular, by offering stipends to the most capable students, contracts for internship and work abroad to the most promising young scientists and specialists. By financing individual scientists and teams, providing research equipment, the West is actually setting up in Russia its own kind of industry to serve its own economy. In truth, whoever pays can call the tune. There is also the potential possibility of saving individual areas of Russian science and engineering, and even shutting them off from considerations of the competitive struggle. In their attempts to earn some cash, our scientists are ready to take next to nothing for transfer abroad of research results, many of which surpass the world level and are the genuine national property of Russia. And in essence, all of this is nothing more than flow to the West of Russian national wealth without equivalent reimbursement. Naydo: Under conditions of a totalitarian regime, autarkic economy (i.e. closed, self-sufficient), technological security was looked at primarily in the context of military-political rivalry, the arms race. With the transition to an open market economy, its content shifts toward the economic sphere. Today, technological security should primarily ensure success of the nation in the hard competitive struggle for the world market. And there is feedback between technological security and competition: the stronger the competitive positions of a nation on the world market, the stronger will be its technological security. Simanovskiy: Active political and diplomatic measures will be needed to stop the discriminatory practice of the West that was introduced during the years of the Cold War and that makes it difficult for our nation to have access to world advances in science and engineering. Now it looks like the process is slowly moving in the reverse direction. Nevertheless, there are still no guarantees that limitations of this kind will be reinstated in full measure if political development in Russia should be interpreted as unfavorable for the West. Naydo: An effective solution to the problem is not to return to yesterday's autarky, but rather the reverse, to reinforce and develop the closest and strongest contacts with the world community. Most optimum are cooperative ties distinguished by forming equal technological interdependence of partners. This safeguards uniform technological dependence of participants in international cooperation. It means equality of economic conditions of international exchange, precluding redistribution of the national income of the less developed partner to the advantage of the more developed partner. It also means equality of potential loss in the case of breaking of technological ties. The tasks of retaining the scientific-technical potential of Russia and preventing lopsided technological dependence on the West are intimately intertwined. However, they need to be handled by different approaches. Financial support of science is needed to retain our scientific-technical potential. In addition to that, prevention of lopsided technological dependence requires that the state and the private sector keep a watch on utilization of our stock of inventions, developments and technologies. A watch that on the one hand encourages international competition, and on the other hand sets up a barrier to squandering of national scientific-technical achievements of strategic significance. Such supervision, based mainly on economic methods, should be an integral part of a unified state scientific-technical policy. Simanovskiy: Problems of technological security should be permanently on the agenda, and the topic of at least a yearly report by the President and the government. Such an approach would force the leadership of the nation to look at the literally perishing scientific-technical potential, academic, industrial and institutional science, the enormous defense conversion sector of the economy, and the military-industrial complex, at coming up with a scientifically sound governmental scientific-technical policy. Legislative support is needed as well: a codex of laws about the scientific-technical policy of the state, the academic scientific establishment, the status of the scientist, protection of intellectual property, transfer of technologies from defense to civilian sectors, governmental classified and confidential items, and also a block of laws and normatives regulating the process of the brain drain both out of Russia to other nations, and out of nations of the former USSR into Russia. Naydo: Federal agencies of authority ought to have a clear idea about what the nation still has at its disposal in the technological sense. This would be aided by an inventory of scientific and engineering attainments of the nation, an assessment of the prospects for commercial sales on foreign markets, ascertainment of areas where we lead and lag with respect to the world level, and accordingly determination of priority areas of technological export and import. Simanovskiy: Apparently, we also need an agency on acquiring and utilizing international material and technological assistance for Russian science. Such assistance requires coordination on a multilateral level; among other things, setting up an information system, a unified financial fund or bank, an insurance company, and the like. The main thing is maximum simplification of access to outside sources of funding for all deserving claimants. The problem of technological security of the nation will not be solved in one day. It is going to take constant and persistent attention. But the steps that we have proposed are only a part of what is needing to be handled without delay. Tomorrow it will be too late. For now there is still a chance of rectifying the situation.
