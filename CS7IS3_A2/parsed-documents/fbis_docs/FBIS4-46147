He said that some terrorists have confessed to the higher state security prosecution that the lawyer was the direct contact link to Tal'at Yasin Hammam, the amir of the organization. The latter died on 25 April 1994 in a clash with the police. In statements to the Cairo-based AL-AKHBAR newspaper today, al-Alfi said that 'Abd-al-Harith was moving funds between the leaders of the organization inside the prison and those outside it. He was also responsible for funding the activities of the organization by distributing the support funds from abroad. In his statements, the interior minister said the dead terrorist lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani never entered the state investigations' building. Right after he was arrested, upon orders from the prosecution, he was taken to the hospital where he died from a severe asthmatic attack. The interior minister affirmed that the prosecution had autopsied the body and the coroner's report has been presented to the public prosecutor. [see previous Terrorism Report for items on Madani's arrest, death] Al-Alfi noted that the events at the Lawyer's Union, which were orchestrated by some lawyers who belong to the disbanded Muslim Brotherhood group, are seen as another ring in the chain of confrontation between terrorism and security. He pointed out that these lawyers tried to cause tension among the Egyptian people. [passage omitted praising police]
