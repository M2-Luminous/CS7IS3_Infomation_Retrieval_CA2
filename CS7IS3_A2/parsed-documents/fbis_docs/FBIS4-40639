Yeltsin Has Made Suggestions To His Subordinates Concerning Results of His Trip to the Amur District, Tuva, and Novosibirsk"] [Text] President B. Yeltsin's return from a three-day tour of the country -- he visited Blagoveshchensk, Tuva, and Novosibirsk -- has not been covered by television and the newspapers. But it was at this concluding stage of the program that the impressions which the president took away from his trip seem to have emerged. At an improvised conference at the airport lounge (O. Soskovets, A. Shokhin, A. Zaveryukha, P. Grachev, A. Kozyrev, V. Yerin, S. Filatov, and other high-ranking officials were present) the president imparted his impressions and, most important, demanded an investigation of many problems which have become obvious to him. In Blagoveshchensk he agreed with the oblast leadership's suggestion to leave up to 20 percent of the gold that is mined in the local budget. But with regard to the privatization of gold mines he said: "We still have to look at the matter...." Obviously he was informed of the unhealthy situation in the oblast connected with the auctioning off of the Pokrovskoye deposit. According to local journalists it was sold for 12 billion rubles [R] while its real cost is something like 2-3 trillion. And for some reason the auction was organized in such a way that the opportunities for bidding were limited and as a result the titbit went to the "Tokur zoloto" company. In this connection even the local prosecutor's office has protested. The president demanded that his subordinates investigate the privatization of large industrial establishments and mineral deposits around which fighting between the "money-bags" has broken out. In the Amur district there was also a discussion of the project to construct a cosmodrome on the basis of a strategic missile division. The president did not make a decision there but promised to think it all over. In Moscow he demanded that the military department and other officials work on this scenario and submit their ideas to him very soon. At the airport there was also talk of the situation in Tuva. In Kyzyl after a conference with the local leadership B. Yeltsin, at a meeting with workers of Tuva's power structures, promised to give money for the construction of a sheepskin factory. "We will give as much money as you can assimilate," he said, which gave rise to applause from the workers of the president's apparatus and the Supreme Hural. He also promised help for the development of their water transport. According to some calculations at least R40 billion will be required for this just for a start. Then an unexpected phrase was heard which shocked many people, primarily A. Shokhin. "I forbid all government officials and all presidential structures from demanding that the republic earn money for itself and not be subsidized. That is impossible. The necessary economic infrastructure does not exist in the republic. It must be created gradually. The Amur district is another matter. Everything necessary exists there and I criticized the local leadership for its lack of initiative." At "Vnukovo-2" he said more or less the following: Not all republics can be treated the same. From this demand of the president's it may be concluded that today he prefers to pay off Kyzyl with money rather than have political problems. As we know the republic has adopted a Constitution which opens up an opportunity for it to leave Russia. Local nationalists are exploiting this subject, although they have no real support among the people.
