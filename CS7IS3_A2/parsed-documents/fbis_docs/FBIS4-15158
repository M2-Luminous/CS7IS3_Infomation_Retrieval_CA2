It Is Cloudy in Ukraine"] [Text] [Shapoval] First of all, let me congratulate you for your victory. What was your first thought, when you learned the results of voting? [Khmara] I always believed in victory. I did not have any doubts about it, and I was simply interested in numbers. I would like to thank all the people, particularly, my voters, who trusted, supported, and helped me during the electoral campaign. Although we did not have money for the campaign, we proved that it is possible to win without it. It once again came to me that our people are able to achieve a lot. Without the help of the people, I would not have had the chance of dealing with politics. Despite all the efforts undertaken by our enemies, and despite the incompetence of authorities, the voters made their choice. [Shapoval] What was the reason behind your success? [Khmara] I would not like to boil everything down to politics. What led me to politics and always determines my behavior is the desire to leave a humane trace on this sinful earth. I want to do good for our Ukraine and my people. The truth has won. It is said in the Bible: You will find the truth and the truth will set you free. People link Khmara to decency, honesty, and diligence. Khmara and the voters have become a whole. A deputy must always remember that a legislative seat is not his property, but the voters'. [Shapoval] You are often accused of populism. How would you respond to these accusations? [Khmara] What does populism mean? If populism means to be with the people and defend their interests, I will always endorse it. After all, only the support of the people allows me to be accomplished in politics. [Shapoval] In the elections, you confirmed your renown and achieved success. Viktor Pynzenyk and Ihor Yukhnovskyy also won. Is it possible for you to cooperate? [Khmara] When Viktor Pynzenyk was in the government, I always tried to cooperate and help him. Unfortunately, this did not yield any results. I am skeptical toward him. This man fulfills the will of people who are behind the scenes. Ihor Rafayilovych [Yukhnovskyy] is a master of dodging. Once, 12 people's deputies had a bitter conversation with him. We seriously warned him against destructive activities. This relates to [Ukrainian President] Leonid Kravchuk's decree on commodity bonds totalling $10 billion. Ihor Rafayilovych zealously defended the decree. He consciously fulfills someone else's will. [Shapoval] How do you assess the results of the first round of the elections? [Khmara] When it comes to Halychyna, I am very pleased: There are already five, perhaps six, people in Khmara's team in Lvov, Ternopil, and Ivano-Frankivsk Oblasts. This is a serious force. The second round is still ahead, however, in which our people will stand pretty good chances, not only in Halychyna, but also in other regions. [Shapoval] Do you want to form your own group in the parliament? [Khmara] Yes, I want to form a group of hardworking, decent, and dedicated people who would resist any temptations. A group of 20-30 single-minded people can significantly influence the political atmosphere. Now, it can be said that such a group will exist. Our expectations have partially come true. One cannot think of a party or faction majority -- which is often voiced by [Rukh leader] Vyacheslav Chornovil -- without irony, because those people are so polarized, and their principles are not defined. Vyacheslav himself has not always been consistent either. He has rather played the role of a destructive politician in both Lvov and Kiev. Rukh can only blab. Who are these people? What are they able to do? Of course, the situation in Odessa and Donbass elicits certain concern. A powerful industrial Mafia, which has been enjoying the most favored status granted by President Leonid Kravchuk, still remains there. How could he [Kravchuk] allow for these polls? Our president is completely unable to perform constructive state- building work. The elections of the Crimean president were absolutely illegal. Instead of annulling the decree on elections and pronouncing them illegal, President Leonid Kravchuk solemnly received the illegal president. For this alone, Leonid Kravchuk should be removed from power and brought to account. [Former Prime Minister] Leonid Kuchma, who also was elected deputy, is another person very dangerous for Ukraine. He could be easily neutralized, and I have recently offered my services with this regard to [Supreme Council Chairman] Ivan Plyushch. I heard Kuchma saying that Lobov is a man he trusts. Leonid Kuchma offered to Lobov the office of Cabinet of Ministers minister which is one of the key offices. Currently, Lobov lives in France. He stole what he could and left the country. I demanded that a criminal case be opened against him, to recover at least a part of the money he stole. People should know of this, since Leonid Kuchma is running for the presidential seat. Generally, I would like to see as many decent people with common sense in the new parliament as possible. [Shapoval] The second round of the elections is approaching. What would you like to say to the voters? [Khmara] Let them follow the people about whose decency they are completely sure. If they trust Khmara, let them vote for I. Kalynets, D. Chobit, O. Hudyma, and V. Dzera. I have political experience, knowledge, and analytical skills, which have been confirmed in practice. I, therefore, want the voters to do precisely that. It is not necessary for Khmara; it is necessary for Ukraine.
