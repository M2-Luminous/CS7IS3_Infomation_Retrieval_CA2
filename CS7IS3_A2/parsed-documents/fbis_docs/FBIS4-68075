The four terrorists surrendered to security forces near Bingol last week. Yesterday, they attended a meeting in the sports center in Solhan. One of them, whose alias is "Hayri", revealed that a former PKK member killed Vedat Aydin, a former head of the People's Toil Party organization, in Diyarbakir Province on 10 July 1992. He said: "The PKK blamed the counter guerrilla organization in order to provoke the people. I witnessed Semdin Sakik, head of the PKK organization in the region, instruct his men to kill 200 militants. I surrendered to the forces of the state after witnessing the merciless massacres by the PKK." One of the other terrorists revealed he was an electronics expert. He said several militants took him to the mountains to work for the PKK in the electronics field. But he said he escaped at the first opportunity. He claimed that Semdin Sakik abandoned his men, leaving them in a miserable condition on the mountains, and went to France. The terrorist also revealed that a woman militant who joined the PKK in Istanbul wishes to leave the organization but is not allowed to do so. The repentant terrorist said: "I fled after witnessing the developments in that organization." Kemal Iskender, director of police in Bingol; Staff Major Erguder Toptas; leading officials of several establishments; and a large group of people were at the sports center to hear the terrorists' revelations.
