Our correspondent Eva Hulkova reports about their meeting at Hradecek [Havel's private cottage] that ended a short time ago. [Hulkova] The aim of my visit was to learn about the feelings of our neighbors, Andrey Kozyrev said during his visit today to Hradecek, where he arrived by helicopter. According to Vaclav Havel, their very intensive talks had one subject: the future security setup in Europe and, in this context, the role of NATO and the CSCE. Havel and Kozyrev briefed each other about the political visions of their countries and about the social reality in their countries that influences these political visions. Havel explained to the Russian foreign minister the causes of alarm whenever there are views voiced in Russia containing the hidden intention of including the Czech Republic in the Russian sphere of influence. Kozyrev showed understanding for this explanation and told journalists that, if the words "sphere of interest" evoked the past, he was fully prepared not to use that expression. Kozyrev appreciated the opportunity to meet Havel, besides other things, because the Czech President is actively building democracy and a new system in Europe. Regarding the [NATO] ultimatum [to the Bosnian Serbs], Havel understands it, but, at the same time, he understands why Russia was dissatisfied with the fact that it was consulted about this. The two officials agreed that talks like the ones they held make sense and should continue.
