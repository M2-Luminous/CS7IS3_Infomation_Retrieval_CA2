The CRC Research Institute received this order after it participated in a recent general competitive tender for the introduction of a computer system for Kyoto University's Nuclear Energy Research Institute. This company introduced the first supercomputer "Cray-1" into Japan, in 1980, and it has had additional experience marketing Cray computers since 1992. The Nuclear Research Institute plans to use this supercomputer system to carry out large-scale and high-volume scientific and technological computations and for experimental research. Scientific and technological computations are to be carried out across a wide spectrum of research fields, starting with areas connected to nuclear power, such as nuclear reactor safety, nuclear power plant operation safety and reliability, and nuclear fusion reactor simulation, as well as new quantum energy engineering research and man-machine system research topics, including the high-precision analysis of boiling heat transmission and mixture flow, Beam Engineering simulations, and oscillating mechanisms for free-electron lasers. In the area of experimental research, this system will be used to perform functions such as analyzing and evaluating adaptive interface devices which integrate and process various biological information, an outer space-type interface which utilizes virtual reality, and the design of man-machine systems. The system to be provided is an epoch-making one, which brings the functions of a Cray supercomputer to the desk-side. In a cabinet 60 cm wide, 66 cm deep, and 104 cm tall, a maximum of two processors, each of which has a theoretical maximum capacity of 133 MFLOPS, can be installed.
