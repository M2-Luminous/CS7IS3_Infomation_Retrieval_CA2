Alsufyev, chairman of the Central Electoral Commission of the Republic of Crimea, by N. Gavrileva, under the rubric "Let Us Be Specific": "Proceeding Toward the Elections. Why Was the Edict Not Accepted for Execution?"] [Text] Yesterday KRYMSKIYE IZVESTIYA published the Decree of the Central Electoral Commission "On the Edict of the President of the Republic of Crimea `On Holding a Poll of Republic of Crimea Citizens.'" We asked V. Alsufyev, chairman of the commission, to comment on the situation. [Gavrileva] Viktor Vladimirovich, in its decree the Central Electoral Commission actually refused to execute this edict of the president. Please explain to us the reason for the appearance of the decree; after all, this is direct disobedience of the authority of the president! [Alsufyev] This has to do with the fact that the edict of the president faced the Central Electoral Commission with a choice between accepting the demand to violate the law and incurring the displeasure of the president's team. Despite the fact that a great variety of political forces are represented on our commission, the decision was made unanimously--to stick to the position of the law. Please note Point 4 of the edict in which the president obligated the Central Electoral Commission to conduct the poll simultaneously with the elections. However, the point is that the Central Electoral Commission is not by any means subordinated to the executive authorities in some way, and a demand, even by the president, does not and cannot entail legal consequences in the form of its execution. Since in keeping with the law the commission is the supreme institution for organizing and holding elections of deputies of the Supreme Soviet of the Crimea, the commission reports solely to the Supreme Soviet of the Crimea, and only on the basis of its decision does the commission have the legal authority to take measures that do not fall within its jurisdiction. Furthermore, the edict provides for appointing "representatives of the president" to electoral commissions. This amounts to a direct violation of the Constitution of the Republic of Crimea and electoral legislation. Had this happened, it would have been grounds to consider the election of deputies invalid. Therefore, it is not some kind of disobedience to the supreme official that is at issue but rather the need to take measures to uphold the law. Believe me, the commission has no dearth of problems other than becoming involved in a conflict with the presidential authority. The Crimea is now holding elections which are without parallel in history in terms of complexity. While it is the Central Electoral Commission with regard to 66 single-seat electoral districts, our commission at the same time exercises the powers of a district commission in the multiple-seat electoral district in which the Crimea elects deputies under the proportional system from four political parties and one electoral bloc. At the same time, our commission must operate in the mode of five district electoral commissions for national electoral districts. The lot of district commissions is even more difficult: They also are commissions for elections to the Supreme Council of Ukraine at the same time. [Gavrileva] Pardon me, but a document such as this edict could not have appeared without prior coordination with the Central Electoral Commission. Where were you before? [Alsufyev] The edict came as a complete surprise to us. We saw the text as late as 11 March in the newspapers. I think that a realistic scenario for solving the emergent problem which would comply with legal norms would have been quite possible. The Central Electoral Commission always provides the necessary consultative assistance benevolently. We use professional lawyers from the Ministry of Justice of the Crimea and the state law department of the Supreme Soviet for such efforts. If necessary, we verify our decisions with the prosecutor's office and the Supreme Court of the Crimea, that is to say, we do everything possible to strictly uphold the law. However, in this case, a consultation with us was apparently not needed. [Gavrileva] Incidentally, on the day the edict was published, readers called our editorial office requesting that the meaning of some of provisions be clarified. Perhaps the period of 16 days is too short, after all: It turns out that the voter (that is, the citizen taking part in the poll) is being deliberately faced with a situation in which he is simply deprived of an opportunity to grasp the essence of the questions and to make a determination concerning his choice.... [Alsufyev] You are right. I would like to not assess the edict from the standpoint of the content of the questions. However, the time factor is very significant indeed. You will agree that it is necessary to be in possession of a certain volume of legal information in order to respond to each question intelligently. Time is needed to this end, and a lot of it. At present, space in newspapers and air time are the main point: The mass media are overburdened with articles related to elections to the Supreme Soviet of the Crimea and the Supreme Council of Ukraine to begin with. We have received a great many complaints from candidates for deputy about the absence of an opportunity to use the mass media because of the superimposition of the two election campaigns. And what if we also include the poll, with its complex questions? You will agree that there is indeed no real opportunity to ensure a deliberate choice and a free expression of the will of citizens within this period of time. [Gavrileva] Indeed, technically it is very difficult to do this on 27 March. What is to be done next? [Alsufyev] There is only one way out: The president should correlate his intentions with the requirements of the law.
