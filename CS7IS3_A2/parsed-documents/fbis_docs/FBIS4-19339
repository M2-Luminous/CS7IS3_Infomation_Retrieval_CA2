[Kinkel] It is very important and decisive now for the Russian side to exert massive and urgently needed pressure on the Serbs, so that the Serbs give up the stranglehold of Gorazde. [Gerhard] What should the Russians tell the Serbs? [Kinkel] They must tell them that we have achieved major progress in the political sphere -- Sarajevo, access to Tuzla, the agreement between the Croats and the Muslims, and Mostar. It must be possible to extinguish the other fires in a mosaic-like manner, which also includes -- in a symbolic manner -- Gorazde. [Gerhard] What about the German contribution? Are we only observers or can we participate actively in the peace process? [Kinkel] We cannot send German soldiers to the former Yugoslavia because of our constitution. We are very committed in the humanitarian area. The political process will be continued tomorrow by the 12 foreign ministers in Luxembourg. I am in constant contact with my U.S. counterpart and my colleagues and friends in the European Union. We are participating strongly and are trying to help.
