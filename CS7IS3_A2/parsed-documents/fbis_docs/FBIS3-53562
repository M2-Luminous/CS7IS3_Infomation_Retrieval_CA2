Buwayz said that President al-Asad's use of the term "the peace of the brave" is a clear indication of the existence of an understanding, at least along broad lines. He added: Whoever thought that this summit would be an adventure was wrong. Former Prime Minister Dr. Salim al-Huss maintained that the Syrian-U.S. summit has given an important push to the peace process in the area. He said: President al-Asad, as usual, stuck to his guns regarding the correlation of the Syrian, Lebanese, and Jordanian tracks, and he emphasized the need to abide by UN Resolution 425, which concerns Lebanon. In doing so, he was speaking as an Arab president who is aware of his pan-Arab responsibilities. He was great in clearly expressing commitment to a just and comprehensive peace to safeguard the Arabs' interests and rights.
