In so doing, they accomplished an urgently-needed research mission on China's current social ills. They divided China's existing social problems into 11 categories, the foremost of which is the corruption and dereliction of duty by government employees, as when they abuse their office to further personal interests, take bribes, squander away public funds, wine and dine, and send gifts. The second problem is organized crime, which has been on the rise since the 1970's and now directly threatens the people's daily lives and law and order. The third problem is economic crime, the fastest-growing crime. Next is the manufacturing of bogus, counterfeit, or shoddy products, a pitfall on the road toward creating a socialist market economy in China. The fifth social disease is drug-related crime, which has been skyrocketing. The sixth disease is prostitution, which goes hand in hand with the seventh -- sexually transmitted diseases -- and eighth--the proliferation of pornographic materials. The ninth disease is the outright buying and selling of women and children, a gross violation of their legitimate rights and interests and a cause of the tenth disease, namely illegal marriage, which essentially means early marriage, arranged marriage, bigamy, concubinage, marriage between close relatives, and prohibited marriage. The eleventh social disease involves feudal and superstitious activities, which at one point were subsiding and diminishing only to reappear openly and extensively in a variety of forms in recent times. Zhang Ping, the researcher, said that social problems and social contradictions exist in any kind of society and that it is precisely through the resolution of endless social problems that a society matures. From the perspective of social control research, the various diseases in China today--widespread impermissible behavior, transgressions, and criminal conduct--essentially belong at the first level of loss of social control, that is, the break-down of methods or means, not bad enough to endanger the existence and development of society. However, if the break-down of methods is not checked effectively and allowed to continue, it will escalate to the next level, namely erosion of trust in and declining compliance with all social norms, which will undermine the public's sense of sacredness about such norms. If the break-down of methods is allowed to reach the third level, the "disintegration of basic goals," then "absolute lawlessness" will ensue and things will get utterly out of control, leading to the collapse of the entire body of social institutions.
