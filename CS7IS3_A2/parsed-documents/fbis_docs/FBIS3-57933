Florakis did not specify which political groups will be approached by the KKE, but stressed the need for any alliance to reach "agreement on a minimum program." New Coalition Chairman N. Konstandopoulos was elected the new chairman of the Coalition of the Left for Progress at a 19 December meeting, an article in the 20 December ELEVTHEROTIPIA reports. This marks the first time the Coalition leader was elected by a party congress rather than by the central political committee. According to the report, Konstandopulos, who was born in 1942, was a member of the Democratic Defense organization during the junta period and was arrested by the junta in 1969. He was released in 1973. Konstandopulos was a member of PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] until 1973, when he was expelled because of his disagreement with PASOK policies. He ran in the June 1989 election as a Coalition candidate and served as minister of interior in the Tzannetaki multiparty government. He has been a Coalition at-large deputy since April 1990.
