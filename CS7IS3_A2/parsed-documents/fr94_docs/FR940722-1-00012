FR940722-1-00012 FR940722-1-00005 The Commission contemplates that an ethics training provider would be able to document that a registrant had undertaken various steps required for the provider to verify completion. The provider would be required under revised paragraph (b)(4) of Rule 3.34 to keep documentation to support its determination that ethics training has been properly completed by a registrant and to support its issuance of a certificate of attendance. 25 25 The Commission is also proposing under revised paragraph (b)(4) of Rule 3.34 that records of trainer evaluations be maintained. D. Recordkeeping Rule 3.34(b)(4) governs recordkeeping by an ethics training provider. The Commission is proposing to add a provision to the current recordkeeping requirements that would require providers of ethics training to furnish records of attendees at such training to a registered futures association in such format as the registered futures association may request. When the Commission adopted Rule 3.34, it required that providers of ethics training maintain records of attendees at such training in accordance with Commission Rule 1.31, i.e. , for a five-year period. 26 The Commission also stated that it would monitor the effectiveness of the requirement for maintaining a record of ethics training attendance and may reconsider the issue at a later date if appropriate. 27 The Commission understands that NFA is willing to compile information on ethics training attendance for inclusion in the registration database and believes that ethics training providers should cooperate with NFA requests for the information which providers are already required to maintain. This will allow for a central repository of such information which should benefit all registrants and facilitate oversight of compliance with the ethics training requirement. To facilitate NFA's incorporation of this data in the registration database, ethics training providers should include appropriate identifiers of registrants, such as NFA ID number, and follow other format conventions requested by NFA. 26 17 CFR 1.31 (1993). 27 58 FR 19575, 19587. III. Related Matters A. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;611 (1988), requires that agencies, in proposing rules, consider the impact of those rules on small businesses. The proposed rule amendments discussed herein will affect ethics training providers, which include SROs, entities accredited to conduct continuing education programs by a state professional licensing authority in the fields of law, finance, accounting or economics, and any other person who complies with the requirements to be included on a list of ethics training providers. The SROs offering ethics training to their members are the contract markets and the Commission has previously determined that contract markets are not small entities under the RFA. 28 As to the impact of these proposals on other providers of ethics training or persons seeking to become providers of ethics training, the Commission believes that such impact will be minimal. The procedure for becoming an ethics training provider would be simplified. The permissible representations by ethics training providers which the Commission is proposing to codify are consistent with the statements set forth in Commission letters issued to date to ethics training providers. Finally, since ethics training providers are already required to maintain records of attendees, furnishing such information to NFA upon request should not cause an undue burden. 28 47 FR 18618&hyph;18619 (April 30, 1982). Therefore, the Acting Chairman, on behalf of the Commission, hereby certifies, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), that the rules proposed herein will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The Commission nonetheless invites comments from any person or entity which believes that these proposed rule amendments would have a significant impact on its operations. B. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (PRA), 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., imposes certain requirements on federal agencies (including the Commission) in connection with their conducting or sponsoring any collection of information as defined by the PRA. In compliance with the PRA, the Commission has submitted this proposed rule and its associated information collection requirements to the Office of Management and Budget. While the amendments proposed herein have no burden, Rule 3.34 is a part of a group of rules which has the following burden: ␣ 1␣ 1␣ Rules 3.16, 3.32 and 3.34 (3038&hyph;0023, approved June 2, 1993): Average Burden Hours Per Response 1.13 Number of Respondents 60,980 Frequency of Response On occasion and triennially. Persons wishing to comment on the information which would be required by these rules as amended should contact Gary Waxman, Office of Management and Budget, room 3228, NEOB, Washington, D.C. 20503, (202) 395&hyph;7340. Copies of the information collection submission to OMB are available from Joe F. Mink, CFTC Clearance Officer, 2033 K St. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20581, (202) 254&hyph;9735.
