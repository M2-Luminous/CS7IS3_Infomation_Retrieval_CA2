Technology has been used in other Latin American countries, but only with peasant owners of small farms. In Cuba, with an integral production system, it will be easier to evaluate production and to make it more efficient from the economic point of the companies, of the Basic Cooperative Production Units, and of credits and services. The French Government will finance the project and already has assigned more than $250,000, which will be invested in equipment, fuel, transport, and other material resources.
