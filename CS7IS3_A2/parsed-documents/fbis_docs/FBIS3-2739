"Wang was arrested early this morning for no apparent reason," spokesman and fellow dissident Yang Zhou said by telephone. Yang is a founder of the Peace Charter movement which was started in November last year. Wang, 39, a private businessman who has long been involved in promoting human rights, spent three years in prison from 1979 for "counter-revolutionary" activities during the Democracy Wall movement in 1978-79. Chinese authorities' crackdown on dissidents has coincided with the opening of the annual National People's Congress (NPC) on Thursday and a visit to China by US Secretary of State Warren Christopher scheduled to begin later Friday. Several dissidents have been arrested in recent days and three of them were sent to prison. Wang Dan, a leader of the 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations which culminated in the Tiananmen Square massacre in the capital, was forced to leave Beijing on Friday along with two other dissidents. Dissident Wei Jingsheng has also left for the countryside by order of the authorities.
