FBIS4-52341 "dreas090__a94016" FBIS-EAS-94-090-A Daily Report 1 May 1994 ANNEX Japan NTT Builds Prototype Amplifier IC NTT Builds Prototype Amplifier IC 942A0163A Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 1 May 94 p 3--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0163A Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Text] Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) has fabricated a prototype amplifier IC [integrated circuit] for use in converting optically transmitted data into electrical signals. It is capable of processing signals in the 60 gigahertz (one gigahertz is equal to 1 billion hertz) frequency range. The new IC substantially exceeds the capacity of old IC's which were limited to processing signals with a maximum speed of 40 gigahertz. The new IC will enable the manufacture of repeaters for basic circuits and can be used in future transmission of multimedia data. The newly developed IC will restore, prior to reproduction and reprocessing, signals weakened through optical transmission to a level where they can be used in microprocessors (MPU). It incorporates indium phosphorous high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) structures and is capable of handling broadband signals. The new IC also incorporates a dedicated circuit for accurate restoration of low frequency signals. In so doing, it possesses the capability to restore signals of a broad band up to 60 hertz to electrical signals with a high degree of efficiency from direct current. Further, when the newly developed IC is used to fabricate an amplifier, the wavelengths are shortened as the frequencies rise and resonate inside the amplifier and accelerate the emission of static. NTT coped with that problem by conducting a three-dimensional electromagnetic simulation based on a finite allocation formula to arrive at the optimum configuration for the amplifier. The result of this procedure was a prototype which measures 20 mm in length, 25 mm in width, and 14 mm in height. High-volume transmission of data over optical communication systems requires either an increase in the number of optical fibers or expansion of the signal band width. The new IC falls in the latter category and can be used in the future for transmission of high data volume for purposes such as multimedia. In the future NTT hopes to develop systems which can handle signals in the tera (one tera equals 1 trillion) bits range by fabricating prototype amplifiers of a higher capacity with two of the new IC's linked in tandem.
