The identity of those responsible for the attack is not yet known. The state president has, however, given the assurance that the South African Police will use all their resources to track down the perpetrators and to bring them to justice. The state president has emphasised that there can be no justification whatsoever for this barbaric deed. The representatives of the vast majority of South Africans have reached agreements that will soon lead to our first inclusive national elections and to the establishment of a truly representative government of national unity. The attack last night is evidently an attempt to destabilise this process. The state president has called on all South Africans to resist any attempt to force them to deviate from this course and has urged them to stand united in their condemnation of violence. He has conveyed his condolences to the family and friends of those who lost their lives in this shocking attack. Issued by the government spokesman Pretoria, 31 December 1993
