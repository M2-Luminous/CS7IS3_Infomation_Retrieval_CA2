The most recent poll by the InterView research bureau shows that the Christian Democrats' attractiveness under Mr. Brinkman is declining. If parliamentary elections were to be held now, the CDA would obtain only 38 seats, a loss of 16. Various polls since mid-December have suddenly pointed to a significant loss for the largest government party. The poll results, which were announced on television yesterday evening, also show that the PvdA [Labor Party] is still facing heavy losses: 27 seats, compared with 49 in the 1989 elections. The VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] and D66 [Democrats 66] opposition parties would both win 7 and 20 seats respectively, taking them to 29 and 32 places in Parliament. The last day of the poll was the day before Christmas. In addition, one-third of those asked said that they did not yet know which party they would vote for on 3 May.
