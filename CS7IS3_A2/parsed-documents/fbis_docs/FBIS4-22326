The product manufactured last year constituted 83.8 percent of that of the year before, including 86 percent at conversion enterprises. At the same time the extent of the basic defense order at plants and factories of the military-industrial complex is declining: The share of the "profile" product in their total output declined from 52 percent in 1990 to 31 percent last year. Similar proportions may be observed also in respect to the persons employed in the production of peaceful commodities and those destined for the army: One-third of the employees of enterprises of defense industry were employed last year in the manufacture of "profile" products, although 48 percent of personnel had been working on "peaceful products" in 1990 even. But the situation in the military-industrial complex was more complicated than in other sectors: The level of pay was approximately one-third below that of industry as a whole, and numbers of the personnel in the year declined 12 percent, which was 10 percent more than in mechanical engineering and double that of industry as a whole. Some 165,000 persons were released from conversion enterprises last year, and the debt for purchased products constituted R1.2 trillion, and debts to suppliers past due, R854 billion. The directors of the defense works are attempting to emerge from the current situation independently: Thus in the funding structure the proportion of resources allocated from the federal budget for enterprises due for conversion constituted in 1993 some 21 percent compared with 24 percent in 1992. But the proportion of borrowed funds in the funding of conversion increased from 41 percent to 44 percent, on the other hand--this being mainly bank credit--but only 0.3 percent of all borrowed money came from foreign investors. Eighteen percent of the products manufactured by the conversion enterprises was shipped outside of Russia in 1993, and military equipment and arms constituted one-third of export supplies.
