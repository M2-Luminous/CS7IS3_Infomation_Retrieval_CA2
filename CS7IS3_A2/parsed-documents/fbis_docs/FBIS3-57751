"I believe that some statesmen and journalists in the West should deal more with facts and figures, and be more sober and more pragmatic," he said. "The budget has not been announced, nor has the government's program, even the composition of the government has not been finalized, and on the whole it contains the same people. There have been assurances from the president and there have been assurances from the prime minister. What else do you need?" Ryurikov believes that the main foreign aid to Russia would be the opening of markets to Russian goods. The effectiveness of such a measure was evident last year. If this tendency continues that will be the best aid. As to assistance from international financial bodies, it should be directed at support for specific projects, preferably unconnected with government structures, and, preferably, in the regions. Russia had and has its place in the world economy, said the president's adviser said. I think that now it must make this place more advantageous, and, by changing itself, change its stand in the world. Precisely this will be the subject at all the talks related to Russia's participation in the Naples G-7 meeting. Dmitriy Ryurikov considers that the discussions at the Davos forum, in which heads of states, leaders of world business and eminent scientists are participating, are useful. According to him, the forum is useful, it allows to detect the mood of business people and foreign government circles in respect to Russia, permits to find out what interests them in our country. And, in turn, it gives us the opportunity to voice our questions, to talk about our concerns.
