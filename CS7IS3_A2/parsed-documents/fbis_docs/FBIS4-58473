Hajj pilgrimage means being liberated from oneself and joining good. Stepping over whims and desires, climbing the summit, the knowledge, and cleansing the soul from all pollution and adorning it with all kinds of beauties [passage omitted] Alongside religious and worship proportions, hajj rituals also seek to explore and examine the problems and difficulties of the Islamic community in various political and social areas and to talk out plans to counter the enemies of Islam. Those involved in the administration of the Islamic communities, along with religious scholars and leaders, come together with all parts of the world in hajj rituals. While renewing their pledge of Islamic brotherhood, they embark upon deliberation and discussion to find appropriate and comprehensive solutions to the problems of the Islamic community, thus boosting international Islamic relations and levelling the ground for ever greater unity and solidarity in the world of Islam. Meanwhile, the important point is the gathering of the world Muslims in the ceremonies of deliverance from infidels, which enjoys special status and importance in hajj rituals. Deliverance from infidels is a divine tradition, whose performance is rated as one of the important obligations of hajj pilgrims. During these ceremonies, the Muslims come together and publicly voice their detestation towards the polytheists and the oppressors throughout the world. The fear of the anti-Islamic statesmen encountering this Islamic tradition lies in the fact that this act is considered as the political spirit of hajj rituals; and it is indeed so. The world hegemonist powers always seek to encourage the Muslims to center their attention merely on the religious and individual aspects of the religion of Islam and constantly attempt to reject the political dimension of Islam as null and void. However, as it is inferred and understood from the Islamic knowledge and also from the history of advent of Islam, the religion of Islam is intertwined with politics, and those Muslims who fail to take into consideration various aspects and dimensions of their faith are not proper Muslims from the Islamic point of view. Hence, the real and concrete hajj is the hajj all of whose rituals, including declaration of deliverance from infidels, are fulfilled properly.
