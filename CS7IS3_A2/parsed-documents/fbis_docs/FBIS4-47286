More than 99.8% pure cerium dioxide and tantalum oxide powders were mixed to form compositions in which the proportion of tantalum oxide was 0.5, 2.3, or 5%. The powders were then briquetted, fired at 1870ï¿½C for 5 h to synthesize a solid solution, and re- pulverized to obtain fractions from 0.65 to less than 0.05 mm. Bar-shaped specimens 7 x 7 x 70 mm were compacted at 100 N/sq mm from tri-fraction mixtures of the powders and fired at 1820 K for 6 h. The fired specimens had an apparent porosity of 18-20% and a total porosity of 20-22%. Electrical conductivity was measured with four PR-30 platinum-rhodium probes utilizing direct current. In the first series of tests, the specimens were exposed to atmospheric air, and in the next series of tests, to an atmosphere of combustion products created by igniting propane in oxygen at air-fuel ratios of 0.7, 0.9, and 1.2. It was found that alloying cerium dioxide with tantalum oxide greatly increases the material's conductivity in air (to the solid solution saturation point). Unalloyed cerium dioxide ceramics exposed to combustion products have a much higher electrical conductivity than those exposed to atmospheric air. Moreover, the lower the air-fuel ratio, the higher the conductivity. Alloying cerium dioxide lowers the sensitivity of the conductivity of this material to the composition of the gaseous atmosphere of combustion products, especially for saturated solutions of tantalum oxide in cerium oxide.
