When the secretary level talks on Kashmir started in Islamabad at the start of the new year, no one expected a breakthrough but it was generally hopes that the meeting will at least lead to a marked decrease in human rights violations and repression of the Indian armed forces against the Kashmir people living under Indian occupation. Instead, the Indian army has intensified atrocities and the ferocity and the frequency of "sieze, search and destroy" operations in the predominantly Muslim areas has increased manifold. When a delegation of the Amnesty International was in New Delhi last week, it was denied permission to visit these areas which continue to be under perpetual siege by the Indian army who do not allow even essential supplies into these areas as a collective punishment for the entire population. The method adopted by the Indian army in occupied Kashmir is more brutal and inhuman then even in Bosnia where at least there are some safe heavens. [as published] In occupied Kashmir there are no safe heavens even for women, children and the aged. The Indian army has divided the whole [word indistinct] of population in the valley into fully guarded prisoner camps and totally isolated them from the outside world. This is what the Indian leaders call "the Punjab way" of solving the Kashmir problem. This only confirms Pakistan's suspicion that India's readiness to discuss Kashmir was nothing but a diversionary move to gain time and befool the world public opinion. If any fresh proof was needed to confirm these suspicions, the Indian foreign secretary provided it when he handed out six non-papers to Pakistan High Commissioner in New Delhi the other day. Foreign Secretary Shaharyar was trying to be polite when he described these non-papers as "disappointing." From what has become known about these non-papers, it is clear that India has made a deliberate effort to miss the point by dodging and ducking the real issue. First, India dragged its feet as usual and delayed delivering on the promise of providing informal position papers within a fortnight. After Pakistan expressed its indignation over the delay, the Indians handed over the "non-papers" which mostly focus on non-issues or simply repeat India's previous position on technical matters involved. In some matters like Siachen, Sir Creek, Wuller Barrage, etc, the Indian non-papers do not pick up the thread from where it was left in the latest talks early this month. Instead, the position stated goes back to what was known even before the last secretary level talks. The non-papers do not reflect whatever little progress was possible in the last round. That can only mean that the Indians either do not want the next round of talks to start sooner or want to introduce as many non-issues as possible and stretch the talks to provide, their armed forces with enough time to choke and strangulate the whole population which continues under their brutal siege. On its part, Pakistan provided India with two non-papers it had promised and suggested specific steps to improve the situation in occupied Kashmir, Pakistan had also made it clear that the next round of talks should focus on discussing the modalities for holding a plebiscite in Kashmir. The Indians, in their non-papers not only have avoided the substantive issue of Kashmir but have also made a mockery of the whole exercise by raising a wholly non-existent issue, i.e. "no first strike" using nuclear weapons. While India may have nuclear warheads, as many believe it has, Pakistan has no such weapons and hence no question of first strike capability of Pakistan can be relevent. This only shows the utter nonseriousness of the Indian leaders in solving a problem which continues to be a flashpoint in this sensitive region. As for our US friends, who have been trying to facilitate a dialogue with India on Kashmir, we would only say that the most important ingredient of a peaceful solution continues to be missing and that is political commitment of the Indian government to resolve the dispute. Should we continue to hope that the Americans will ultimately notice this glaring absence and try to convince their Indian friends that it is time to abandon pretensions and attend to solving the core issue in earnest.
