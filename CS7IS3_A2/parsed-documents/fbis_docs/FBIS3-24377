The Norilsk industrial region is situated on the territory of the Taymyr (Dolgano-Nenets) Autonomous Okrug. The average annual temperature is -9.8 degrees; in January and February the temperature can dip to -54 to -57 degrees. Air oxygen content is 20 percent less than in the country's middle latitudes. The region is an environmental distress zone, as emissions of sulfurous gas alone into the atmosphere amounted to almost 2 million tonnes in 1993. On some days, the concentration of gas in residential areas exceeds the maximum allowable level by 30 to 50 times. As a result, 50 to 70 percent of the employees of subdivisions of the Norilsk Combine suffer from various chronic illnesses. Transportation and Costs. Goods are delivered primarily by water (via the Northern Sea Route and the Yenisei during the navigation season), as well as by motor vehicle. Several-day delays in aircraft flights owing to adverse weather conditions result in the Norilsk industrial region's complete isolation. A two- to three-fold increase in charges by the Murmansk Shipping Line in 1994 made delivery charges comparable to or even greater than the value of the cargo itself. The cost of an airplane ticket to Moscow has risen from 15 to 45 percent of the average Norilsk resident's pay. When a family of four goes on vacation, there is not enough vacation to buy tickets for everyone. As a result of the unchecked increases in transportation costs, food prices are rising rapidly. Up to 60 percent of all Norilsk residents are forced to spend almost the entire family income on food. Geography and Politics. The region is administratively subordinate to Krasnoyarsk Kray, but it is not economically linked with Krasnoyarsk. This artificial administrative association represents a historical anachronism dating from the breakup of the GULAG system in 1953. The kray allocated 15 percent of all local taxes to Norilsk in 1992 and 28 percent in 1993. As a result, the Norilsk Combine is forced to maintain the local infrastructure and housing at its own expense. It would be useful to make the Norilsk industrial region subordinate to federal authorities or to transfer it to the Taymyr Autonomous Okrug, with taxes to be left at the okrug's disposal. Industry. The industrial region's main enterprise is the Norilsk Mining and Metallurgical Combine, which includes mining, enrichment, and metallurgical production facilities. In addition to the main production facilities, there are also enterprises producing construction materials and structural elements, a high-capacity construction association, an autonomous power system, research and design organizations, and trade, public catering, and food-industry enterprises. The combine includes the Dudinka sea and river port, which handles up to 6 million tonnes of cargo annually, a well-developed network of warehouses and storage facilities, a railroad, and motor vehicle transport and passenger services. The combine's housing and municipal-services balance sheet contains more than 5 million square meters of housing, more than 100 preschool facilities, 53 schools, hospitals, and other social-structure facilities in the cities of Norilsk, Talny, Kayerkan, Oganer, and Dudinka. The combine employs a total of almost 137,000 people, more than 127,000 of them in the Norilsk industrial region. The region's total population is about 260,000. The combine produces the bulk of Russia's nonferrous metals, including 80 to 90 percent of its nickel, 30 percent of its copper, 80 percent of its cobalt, and almost 100 percent of its platinum and platinoids (almost 50 percent of world production). In 1993 it exported for state needs alone 40,000 tonnes of nickel, 50,000 tonnes of copper, with budget revenues exceeding $156 million. A drop in or halt to production at the Norilsk Combine would have catastrophic consequences for the economy of the Norilsk industrial region and Russia as a whole.
