Unless we hear otherwise from the British and European commissions on competition, Thomson-CSF is going to buy out its rival, Hughes Rediffusion Simulation, before the end of the year. This is the result of the agreement signed last week between the French electronics combine and Hughes Aircraft. The agreement also involves two other subsidiaries: Hughes AMI, which manufactures simulated instrument panel instruments, and Hughes Rediffusion Simulation, Inc., which ensures marketing and after-sales service in the United States. On the other hand, the British training subsidiary, British Caledonian Flight Training, and Rediffusion's air control simulator operations are excluded from the agreement. Based in Crawley near Gatwick, England, Rediffusion has never recovered from its heavy investments in the late eighties to launch a new series of civil aircraft simulators, "Concept 90." This warhorse had been completely rethought in order to optimize its maintenance and operation. But its designer, who relied on his position as the second largest manufacturer of civil simulators in the world and his 70 percent share of the visual display unit market, could not see the air transport crisis coming. The Canadian CAE, which is number one in the industry, could not see it either since it was enlarging its plant in Montreal at the same time to double its production capacity. This was followed by a price war that caused prices to plunge 25 percent and in the course of which CAE was struggling with modernized means of production while Rediffusion had to bear the burden of paying off its R & D investments. In 1990 Rediffusion staggered under the blow initially and laid off a third of its 3,000 employees. At the end of last year a new restructuring plan resulted in the departure of 600 more employees. And a third plan is probably at present being prepared. All of these efforts have not enabled them to avoid the way out of a takeover by Thomson-CSF. A Thomson-CSF that has a solid base established on the basis of the Airbus simulators and that benefits from that aircraft manufacturer's breakthrough. Thomson-CSF acquired a third position in the civil aircraft market in 1990 by buying out Link-Miles in England, one of the divisions of the Singer-Link empire, which was at the time dismantled by the raider, Bilzerian. Thomson-CSF knew how to profit from the joint ventures with its new subsidiary, which was operating in the Boeing markets. We can no longer say as much for this new buyout. Because, in the meantime, Thomson-CSF and Link-Miles have developed a new visual display unit, "Space," for civil and military simulators and taken on the emergent market for FTD (flight training devices), instruction systems that are inserted between the computer-assisted learning unit and the flight simulator; two gaps in the market that the Rediffusion series addresses. Louis Le Porte, who has been constantly insisting that there is an overcapacity of civil aircraft simulators since he took over control of the Thomson-CSF Training Systems and Simulation Division two years ago, is now directly confronted with the problem. Because the world market has been reduced to a small figure of about 20 units while CAE's capacity and Thomson-CSF's in its new field of operations is 45 simulators a year! With this conglomeration of companies, Thomson-CSF has doubled its share of the civil flight simulator market, estimated at Fr3 billion. With 40 percent of all sales, it is behind CAE, which has captured 50 percent of the market. As for the military market, it essentially continues to be segmented by country. But in retaining Link-Miles and Rediffusion, Thomson-CSF becomes the biggest manufacturer of military simulators in England with nearly three-fourths of the market.
