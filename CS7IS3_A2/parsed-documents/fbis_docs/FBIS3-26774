The Army commander-in-chief made the above remark in an interview with media during his inspection of the training and maintenance of AH-1W attack helicopters and OH-58D combat search helicopters at the Lungtan Base, which were purchased by the Army last year. According to him, the M60-A3 tanks eliminated by the U.S. forces in South Korea are equipped not only with the shooting capabilities for night combat and march but also communications equipment and parts and components; and the U.S. asking price of NT$15 million per tank is rather economical. He added: M60-A3 tanks are compatible with Yonghu M-48H tanks, the main force of tanks currently used by our country, in their systems; and there will be no problem of maintenance. Moreover, after being transported to our country, the tanks can be immediately placed in war preparedness condition and will be very helpful for filling the gaps in the Armored Force's combat capability. As for some legislators' "misgivings" about purchasing "used" tanks, the commander-in-chief said the Army would continue to explain to and communicate with the Legislative Yuan in a hope to gain its support for the budget. Major Chia, director of the Army's Logistics Department, also revealed that upon learning the U.S. forces' plan to streamline troops and equipment of U.S. forces in South Korea last August, the Armored Force dispatched experts to South Korea to conduct an on-the-spot examination of the M60-A3 tanks to be eliminated. According to the major, after assessment by the experts, the Army has decided to purchase 160 such tanks to upgrade the M48-A3 tanks currently used by one of the two motorized divisions while letting the other division continue to use the old-type M48-A3 tanks. It is understood that after learning about the plan to streamline U.S. forces in South Korea, Egypt, which already possesses 750 M60-A3 tanks, has also expressed its eagerness to purchase the tanks from the U.S. forces. The Army plans to take this rare opportunity to first purchase 160 such tanks and, after reviewing the actual situation, assess the possibility of buying more for upgrading the other motorized division.
