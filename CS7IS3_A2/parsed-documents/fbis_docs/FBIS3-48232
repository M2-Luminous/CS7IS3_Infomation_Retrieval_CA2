Some contracts with foreign investors signed with the previous administration are likely to be canceled amid charges that the government is motivated by political revenge. Senior government officials are embarking on a sound policy to eliminate the remnants of Cambodia's previously-centralized economy, analysts say, after a new leadership trained in the West has taken control of virtually all key financial and economic portfolios in recent weeks. The new government, announced earlier this month, turned over most of the financial and economic policy portfolios to the Royalist FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] party. Many of the new ministers and economic policy advisors recently returned from exile in France, and have vowed to begin an aggressive campaign to restructure Cambodia's tax, investment, banking, and currency laws. World Bank, IMF, and ADB officials are currently in Phnom Penh advising the new government as it rewrites existing laws. Economy and Finance Minister Sam Rangsi, a French-trained economist, told THE POST there would be a new banking act, foreign exchange act, and investment law promulgated by January, 1994. He vowed "the first real budget in 20 years" would be submitted by January and that by 1995 a "stringent" budget, in line with IMF and World Bank austerity programs, would be in effect. "We will have institutional reform in order to make the government structure match the market economy," Rangsi said on Nov. 15. But he warned that some contracts signed by the previous government would be abrogated or "revised". "Most of the contracts are acceptable. Some may need amendments to reflect the new situation," Rangsi said. He also said a "handful" of contracts will have to be canceled. "But the majority of investors do not have to fear." The first victim is widely expected to be the Thai giant Chinawat which signed a 99-year agreement to broadcast IBC [International Boradcasting Corporation] television with the Cambodian People's Party which lost the elections. The station went on the air prior to elections and was fined by UNTAC [United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia] for violating election laws. "They gave full support and propaganda to one political faction before the election and were allowed to operate for 99 years without one Baht -- one dollar -- for Cambodia. We should bring things to a normal standard," Rangsi said. He accused some investors of "giving so much money under the table to corrupt officials" in previous months with no benefit to Cambodia. The government signed an agreement with Singapore International Airlines (SIA) last week to create a new national carrier. The deal, which gives 40 percent to SIA, 30 percent to the government and 30 percent to local private investors, effectively abrogates several other contracts signed between the previous government and private investors. Rangsi attacked the level of official corruption and called for centralized economic policy-making and "transparent political power" to root out corruption. "There should be incompatibility between the status of minister and that of shareholder of a private company," he said. "Either ministers defend private interests or the national interest." He accused government official of receiving "free shares when some private companies were created by very questionable interests". "They should resign from government," he said. "This is the kind of transparency we want to implement." The government has also begun an attempt to strengthen the Riel. "We want to rely on sound macro-economic policy to restore confidence in our currency by strengthening its value both domestically and internationally," said Chulong Somura, vice president of the Central Bank. Cambodia has seen four straight months of negative inflation for the first time in several years. It reintroduced the 50 Riel note earlier this month which had been dropped as worthless last year in the wake of triple digit inflation. The aim, according to Chulong, is to "decrease the dollarization, the use of foreign currency". She said the government would "drop two zero's" from the new currency to be issued next year. The Riel strengthened 20 percent against the dollar last week in the wake of the formation of the new government, but Rangsi said they will attempt to stabilize the Riel between 2,400 and 2,600 to the dollar. "There is a squeeze in liquidity because we have not printed money in more than one year, but we will not increase the money supply," he said. Rangsi said the investment and economic restructuring programs are linked to the political developments in the country. "Security and Khmer Rouge issues are both key investment issues... eventually the best weapon against the Khmer Rouge is economic development and rural development. "We don't want to make war again against the Khmer Rouge. If we can reduce the imbalance between the rich and poor, the urban and farmers, reduce corruption, reduce social injustice, this is the basis of our new policy, we believe then the Khmer Rouge will disappear," he said. Rangsi said the new banking legislation will be aimed at weeding out dubious banks that have opened in Cambodia since private banks were first allowed to operate here in 1991. He acknowledged the authorities were aware of Cambodia emerging as a significant heroin trans-shipment route. "We are aware of this. There are banks operating with zero capital, no customers, and run by people with no qualifications, people who have nothing to do with the banking industry and are laundering money and covering up other illicit activities. We have to react quickly," he said. Cambodia currently only requires five million dollars in capital to open a bank "but even that is only theoretical," said the Finance Minister.
