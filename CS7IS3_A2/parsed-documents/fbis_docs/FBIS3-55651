In an interview with Interfax today, he pointed out that he listed the reasons for the decree in the descending order. Shakhray declined to comment on individual provisions of the document, though pointing out that "this seems to be a fourth reshuffle of the government." He supposed that if they left more than one vice prime minister in the government, there will be more of them in future (according to a presidential decree, the prime minister shall have four vice prime ministers, two of them being first vice prime ministers - Interfax note.) Shakhray said he had not received a proposal to chair the ministry for federation affairs and regional policies designed to replace the State Committee for Federation and Nationalities Affairs he chairs now.
