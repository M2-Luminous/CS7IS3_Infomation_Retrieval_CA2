Recently, we have learned why "Konza" protected itself from excessive public scrutiny. After its inception, "Konza" created a territorial innovation center called "Agrotekhnopark" in Brody, Lvov Oblast. This center was established at a former missile base with an area of 320 hectares. The base is located in a fenced-in patch of forest and includes a three-story former command post, a two-story former headquarters building, two-story hotel, seven military barracks, privates' and officers' canteens, a medical center, enormous depots, a sauna, garages, and other facilities which can ensure maintenance of this huge military center. [passage omitted] A document was signed to hand over this former military base to "Konza" and the site is currently protected by some 40 guards. In the opinion of People's Deputy Chobit, Ukrainian President Kravchuk should initiate an official investigation into this case because, at the beginning, it was presumed that the base would be turned over to the National Guard of Ukraine. So, why has "Konza" become the proprietor of this facility? Why has the former military base not been sold at auction? Why has "Konza" completed this deal so hastily?
