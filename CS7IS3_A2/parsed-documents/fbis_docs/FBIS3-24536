Liposome stability was studied with liposomes consisting of an equimolar mixture of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerine in phospholipase hydrolysis in the presence of cytochrome c, cytochrome b[.sup]5[/], cytochrome P[.sub]450[/], polylysine, and the histone H[.sup]1[/]. Twenty minutes after the beginning of the reaction in the sphingomyelin-containing liposomes, some 65 percent of the phosphatidylglycerine remained. The amount of phosphatidylinosite left was 62 percent; phosphatidylethanolamine, 55 percent; phosphatidylcholine, 50 percent. When phosphatidylglycerine was incorporated into the liposomes, phosphatidylcholine content after processing with phospholipase A[.sup]2[/] was 15-20 percent higher than in control. The researchers found that the presence of the proteins had a strong stabilizing effect on the components of binary liposomes (with phosphatidylglycerine and phosphatidylcholine), but virtually no effect on single-component liposomes. Binary liposomes incorporating negatively charged phosphatidylglycerine were found to be the most resistant to phospholipase A[.sup]2[/]. That was attributed to the asymmetric distribution of the phospholipids between the outer and inner layers of the phospholipid vesicles. That the liposome surfaces were screened by the proteins was viewed as possible, as was the electrostatic interaction of positively charged proteins present in the surrounding medium and the negatively charged lipid component, which would partially protect the liposome from lipolytic enzymes.
