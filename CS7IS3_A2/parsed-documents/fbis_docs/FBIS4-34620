A Technical Planning Secretariat document states that Paraguay's external debt increased 1.3 percent between January and May, rising to $1.2328 billion compared with the $1.2067 billion at the end of December 1993. The central government is the largest debtor with liabilities amounting to $538.3 million, followed by government-owned enterprises whose financial obligations add up to $472.8 million, and financial institutions, whose debts total $221.7 million. Half of Paraguay's debt has been contracted with international organizations, $615.7 million; 47.8 percent with the Paris Club, $589.6 million; and 2.2 percent with Latin American banks, $27.5 million. The slight increase in the external debt is basically due to the disbursement of credits granted by international organizations like the Inter-American Development Bank and the World Bank.

Farmers had a poor harvest caused by bad weather, fungus, and the boll weevil. In volume, cotton exports plummeted 51.2 percent to 21,368,249 kg compared with 44,051,354 kg last year. In value, exports declined 34.6 percent from $49,849,094 in 1993 to $31,919,800 this year. (Asuncion ULTIMA HORA in Spanish 13 Jun 94 p 8) According to the General Customs Directorate, there was a surge in the trade deficit in 1994 through May. Exports totaled $341.294 million while imports were $1.087 billion, a deficit of $746.247 million--a 218.65 percent increase compared with the same period last year. This sharp increase in the trade deficit reportedly is due to the fact that in the past a considerable amount of goods entered the country illegally whereas now there is an ongoing campaign to stem smuggling and imports now are paying customs duties. It is estimated that total imports amount to $3 billion annually, of which only $1 billion was registered in the past. This made the government lose more than $200 million in revenue per year.
