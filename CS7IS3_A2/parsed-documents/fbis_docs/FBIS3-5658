Vietnam, he reckoned, could become a tiger cub in 10 to 15 years although, at its current stage of growth, he put it at 30 to 40 years behind Singapore. In that growth curve Vietnam has to traverse, there will be opportunities aplenty for builders, manufacturers, consultants and lawyers, suppliers of consumer goods and services. What is being asked of our businessmen in going to Vietnam is that they be trail-blazers. After a long period of French occupation which left little that was serviceable, and another 20 years fighting the Americans, Vietnam is in a rage to build a polity from ground up. It takes nerve and acumen for a Singaporean businessman to survey the ruins and say: "I smell money here." Are our risk takers up to it? By comparison, India is the easier to penetrate although its immediate profit potential may look less appealing. Its legal framework, financial system, property and repatriation rights are fairly well encoded. China, having a lead time of a dozen years over India in economic liberalisation, has advanced to the stage where maintaining a stable currency and keeping growth from over-heating now form the basis for orderly development. Vietnam is different, but this is no reason for Singaporean businessmen to hesitate. If its bureaucrats trained in the communist tradition have little understanding of the forces that shape a market economy, they are prepared to adapt. As a sign of resolve, common folk and civil servants are studying English with a vengeance to gain access to the commercial highway. If its legal framework is wobbly and the banking system basic, it should spell opportunity, not a hindrance, for brain-service suppliers such as Singapore. Mr. Goh has in fact signposted the areas -- apart from property investments where Singaporean money is prominent -- in which the private and state sectors should pay close attention to. These include banking, telecommunications and land transport. Then there is infrastructural work -- port development, public housing, industrial estates -- where, it should be conceded, participation may be better handled by government-linked companies. No less a Vietnamese personage than Mr. Do Muoi, the party chief, has asked Singapore to help his country industrialise. Such invitations do not come often. Singaporeans have committed US$390 million in 52 projects in Vietnam since the investment ban was lifted in November 1991. But so have 500 companies world-wide signed on for US$7.5 billion worth of investments during that period, and a flood can now be expected as the last of the Americans' trade restrictions on Vietnam have been lifted. It was left to Trade and Industry Minister Yeo Cheow Tong, who was in Mr. Goh's party, to give the reluctant the most telling prod. In persuading companies to expand in the region or be left behind, he spoke of competition growing more intense a few years from now and how opportunities would be harder to find. The Government will smooth the path with appropriate incentives and concessions. The need for an external economy has been accepted by investors and workers alike. [passage omitted]
