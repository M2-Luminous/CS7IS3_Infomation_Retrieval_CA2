FBIS4-47832 "drafr086_c_94022" FBIS-AFR-94-086 Daily Report 4 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA IFP's Buthelezi Comments IFP's Buthelezi Comments MB0405132094 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1213 GMT 4 May 94 MB0405132094 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] Ulundi May 4 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi on Wednesday [4 May] said it was extraordinary that claims of electoral fraud were being levelled against his party in KwaZulu/Natal when provisional results showed the IFP was "whipping" the African National Congress and National Party [NP] in the province. Speaking to the press during a break in a caucus meeting of the KwaZulu legislative assembly in Ulundi, Mr Buthelezi warned a Pandora's box could be opened if the allegations against the IFP were accepted. The IFP leader said: "Our election has been straight-forward." He said the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] had assured him on Wednesday morning that counting of votes in Durban would continue after a hitch in the process because of disputes. Mr Buthelezi questioned why irregularities, which were widespread, had been singled out in KwaZulu/Natal. He said this was unusual since National Party leader F W de Klerk, Independent Electoral Commission Chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler and ANC leader Nelson Mandela had "huddled together" and declared the elections free and fair. According to provisional results the IFP was "whipping" the ANC and NP in the region, Mr Buthelezi said, adding this proved he was the undisputed leader in the province. Having entered the election race at such a late stage and with very little campaigning, the IFP's success was inspiring, he said. "That kind of confidence in me and my party inspires me...and braces me for the very hard road I know lies ahead," Mr Buthelezi said. He said he would be prepared to re-run elections in the region "tomorrow" if it could be proved the process would be foolproof. Mr Buthelezi said the row over claims against his party by the ANC was typical of what he was used to. "When the ANC sneezes everyone catches cold; when I say something it's ignored," Mr Buthelezi said.
