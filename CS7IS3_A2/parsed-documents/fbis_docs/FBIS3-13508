The two freelances were only slightly hurt in the explosion Sunday caused by a bomb packed with TNT attached to their car. No group claimed responsibility for the attack, but the Kurdish driver of the car was arrested. Recent attacks on foreigners have been blamed on the Iraqi government, opposed to foreign aid for the Kurds in the area, set up following the 1991 Gulf war.
