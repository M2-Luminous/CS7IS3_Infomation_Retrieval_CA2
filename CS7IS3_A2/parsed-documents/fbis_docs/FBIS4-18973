Cetin was speaking to reporters at a joint press conference with his Israeli counterpart Shim'on Peres, at the conclusion of Turkey-Israel official talks. He said during the talks both countries have agreed on Turkey's more active participation to the Middle East peace process. Cetin also said that visa applications will not be required for Turkish citizens who want to visit Israel, adding that Israel will not ask for a visa from Turkish businessmen or from those visiting the country for cultural reasons. Stressing the existence of a great cooperation potential between the two countries, Cetin said agreements on incitement and protection of investments, prevention of double-taxation and technological cooperation will be concluded at the soonest. Peres said that Turkey is a country that can play an important role in many ways for the future of the Middle East, adding his country gives great importance to its relations and ties with Ankara. He said that the fact that Turkey is a secular and democratic Moslem country at the same time having very good relations with Israel gives it the possibility of being a "bridge" between different cultures. Peres also underlined the possibility for cooperation with Turkey and the United States for investments in the Central Asian republics. He said that Turkey is the only country with enough water for its needs in a region where water has become as important as oil, adding countries such as his own which are in need of water could buy from Turkey and he has discussed this topic with Cetin. On the Israeli pullout from Jericho and the West Bank according to an agreement signed earlier between the PLO and Israel, Peres said this would only be completed by the end of the month. Answering a reporter's question on the use of Turkish waters for meeting the needs of the Middle East region, Cetin said there exists a number of possibilities. The first posibility is the use of the Manavgat river in the Mediterranean Province of Antalya which flows into the sea, by collecting its waters for transport to needy Middle Eastern countries. The second choice is the transfer of the waters of the Euphrates and the Tigris in the southeast, via pipeline to the Middle East region. Cetin said Turkey considers its waters as "peace waters" and not "conflict waters."
