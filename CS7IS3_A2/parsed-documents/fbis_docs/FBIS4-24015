Mineral and Energy Affairs Minister Pik Botha has announced that the government has requested a fuel task force to make proposals by August for a new way to determine the fuel price. Mr. Botha today said in a media information session that the extent to which the government should get involved in the fuel industry must also be looked at. The task force will make proposals on the degree to which the fund should buy and sell, and will also look at the tariff protection of SASOL [South African Coal, Oil and Gas Corporation] and Mossgas [Mossel Bay Gas Project]. Mr. Botha said the government wanted to depoliticize the fuel issue and find an answer that will best benefit the consumer. Meanwhile, the director general of Pick 'n Pay, Mr. Gareth Ackerman, announced that from Monday the chain store group will sell its gas at the recommended price. He said in a message to branch managers that he had held discussions with Mr. Botha, and progress had been made in efforts to deregulate the fuel price.
