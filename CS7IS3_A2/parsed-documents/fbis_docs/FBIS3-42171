ZDF, one of the biggest European broadcasting stations, had concluded a cooperation agreement with the Iranian state television, IRIB, in 1991. Now the people in Mainz had to learn from French judicial circles that their partners are said to be involved in the state terrorism of the mullahs. "We are shocked," said Petra Zilken from the ZDF department for international affairs, "we have to think thoroughly about further cooperation." The serious accusation is made in a charge that was filed by the Chief Public Prosecutor's Office in Paris and has been secret so far. The file sent to the Elysee Palace deals with the murder of former Iranian Prime Minister Shapur Bakhtiar. Three men killed the politician, who had escaped to French exile, by numerous knife thrusts on 6 August 1991. Before the end of this year, the presumable perpetrators are to be brought to trial in Paris. After several dozen assassination attempts in Europe, among them the assassination of exiled Iranians in the Berlin "Mykonos" restaurant, it has now become known for the first time: Iran regularly used its television correspondents to provide the logistics for the killers. According to the French investigators, in this way they organized papers, apartments, and cars. Their advantage: Because of their cooperation with big European television stations, they enjoy hospitality in many places and can move unhindered everywhere. In the case of Bakhtiar's murder, the wirepuller was in the Rue de Liege 27: Massoud Hendi [spelling as published], 45, Paris bureau chief of the Persian television station, IRIB, and nephew of Ayatollah Khomeyni. Hendi procured the visas for the two Iranian agents who have to stand trial for Bakhtiar's murder. Hendi himself is also detained. A document of the French prosecutors shows that the Iranian Ministry for Telecommunications, partner of ZDF and other television stations, is doing the preliminary work for the assassination commands. The Swiss television station, SRG, which only concluded an agreement with the Iranians in November 1993, reacted immediately. "Until the accusations are clarified, our agreement will be suspended," said Oswald Sigg, spokesman of the SRG executive board. Tehran's answer came promptly. Last Thursday, Rudolf Weiersmueller, Swiss ambassador to Iran, was called to the Foreign Ministry. He had to receive a sharp protest note from the mullahs -- a further leg in the controversy between Switzerland and Iran, which has been smoldering for some time. The Alpine republic has an international arrest warrant for Mohsen Sharif Esfahani, 39, and Ahmad Taheri [spelling as published], 32. Together with others, they are said to have executed former UN diplomat Kazem Radjavi [spelling as published] in his Geneva exile in April 1990. The wanted persons were imprisoned in France. In the event of their extradition, which had been demanded by Switzerland, Tehran threatened a "firework of bombs" toward French mediator Jean Charles Marchiani. With success: The presumable terrorists were permitted to leave unmolested for Iran. The German Federal Government was also well out of it because, before their trip to France, the presumable murderers had travelled from Frankfurt to Aachen -- watched by German security authorities. On 17 November 1992, the Swiss police briefed the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation: "Ahmed Taheri and Sharif Esfahani, who were arrested in Paris, are suspects in the RADJAVI [preceding word capitalized] murder case." The French received the decisive tipoff for the arrest from their German colleagues.
