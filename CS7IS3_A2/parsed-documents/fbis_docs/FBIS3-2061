In a speech given at a Spring Festival gathering in Beijing in January, Bishop Ding Guangxun, President of the China Christian Council (CCC), said that there were cadres who were biased towards religion and used administrative methods to control and attack law-abiding churchgoers. "The situation is serious," he said in a speech revealed yesterday by Amity Foundation, a Hong Kong based Christian group. China regulates church activities through the Chinese Three-Self Patriotic Movement and the CCC. In addition to the estimated seven million Protestant Christians recognised by the Government, a greater number fall outside the official record, and with whom the CCC have no contact. Bishop Ding called for their protection saying that they were patriotic and upheld socialism. Bishop Ding said unity and communication between the Christians recognised by the Government and those not recognised had been hampered by cadres who considered the latter law-breakers. He added that cadres had attacked and destroyed many meeting points, forcing them to go underground. In certain places, the bishop said, churches were increasingly run by cadres instead of church members. "They do not understand religion, they do not appreciate believers' thinking and feelings," he said. "To a greater or lesser extent, they despise religion, and they also have a duty to propagate atheism," he said. "What they are doing is making religion fit their own interests," he said.
