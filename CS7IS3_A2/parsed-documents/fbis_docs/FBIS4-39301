Standing in for him at talks on peace for Bosnia on Monday will be ranking Foreign Ministry official Aleksey Nikiforov. Nikiforov is Russia's representative to the international `contact group' for Bosnia, which comprises also the United States and the European Union. The `contact group' insists that Bosnia's warring Moslems, Serbs and Croats end hostilities and seek solutions to their dispute through talks, which should pave the way for dividing Bosnia by giving 51 per cent of the territory to the Moslems and Croats for their federation and 49 per cent to the Serbs. The `contact group' was due to meet with representatives of Bosnia's belligerents last weekend, but the meeting was not held. Churkin was originally scheduled to brief the press at the Foreign Ministry in Moscow on Monday, but the briefing has been cancelled. It is not certain when Churkin may meet the press because of a busy schedule, TANJUG learns at the Russian Foreign Ministry.
