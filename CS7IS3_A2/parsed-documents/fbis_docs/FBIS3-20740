However, that is not my intention. I would just like to ask you to recall, together with the Croatian public, what the situation was like four years ago, at the first convention. In those days, we could still expect to be imprisoned if we sang Lijepa Nasa [Croatian anthem]. Taking into account everything we have experienced over the past four decades and everything that the HDZ has achieved, everything that the Croatian people have accomplished in their centuries-long efforts to establish a sovereign and independent Croatian state, we should occasionally think about this seriously to be aware of some moments in history and our responsibility -- the responsibility of the entire nation -- and the situation in which we live. I said we would not speak about this, but I want to briefly remind you of the most current issues facing us and facing Croatia, which also preoccupy the international public in Europe and the world. Above all, we are interested in solving the issue of Croatian areas under UN protection, but in reality still under Serb occupation. However, this issue is linked to the overall problem of the breakup of Yugoslavia, that is, above all to the solution of the military-political crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. I recently spoke in detail about these issues to the HDZ club of deputies. I believe that you have read about this, and therefore, I will not repeat myself. I will inform you about our current position. All relevant international players -- from Europe to the United States -- have today for the first time reached a conclusion that the survival of Bosnia-Herzegovina as it is, is impossible and recommended to us and, in their own way, they consider it necessary -- both because of us and because of the world -- for us to accept a solution according to which the Croat nation in Bosnia-Herzegovina stays in a union with the Muslims. Even when I spoke on that occasion, I presented the reasons for that. You have probably read about it. At the time, they still had not spoken in such concrete terms and as publicly as they have in the period since I gave the speech. They are of the opinion that it is important, as U.S. Secretary of State Christopher said yesterday or the day before, that at least two nations in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- Muslims and Croats -- establish cooperation and friendship. Therefore, we are witnessing some kind of new geopolitical balance of powers, and as a result of this, a demarcation in Bosnia- Herzegovina. The demarcation in this area has been going on since the breakup of the Roman Empire via Yalta to current efforts to solve the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is the first time that we witness main European states -- France, England, Germany -- reaching a consensus with the United States, which has again assumed the main role in resolving the crisis in Yugoslavia and Bosnia- Herzegovina. I say again because the United States already had that role in the beginning, only to let Europe and the United Nations handle this hot potato alternately. As this did not lead to a solution, the United States has now assumed the leading role and established a consensus. Of course, certain differences still exist, and Russia has made a separate appearance with tacit understanding. As I told you before, Russia remains a Eurasian power that will have a role to play, whatever happens. Therefore, they have recommended to us, insisted and persisted, that we reach an agreement with the Muslims. They are demanding the same thing from the Muslims. The Muslim leaders, some of them, have accepted that suggestion coming from the United States and Europe and have spoken out in favor not only of the need for cooperation between the Croat and Muslim nations in Bosnia, but also in favor of the confederation between whatever will remain of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. Politically, an agreement in principle has been reached on this in separate talks. That was also discussed in the presence of those U.S., German, French, and English representatives whom I have mentioned. We also reached nominal agreement at the meeting in Frankfurt. I received the U.S. President's special envoy, I had phone conversations with the most responsible people, and currently, our foreign minister, deputy prime minister, and vice-chairman of the HDZ [Mate Granic] is not here because he is visiting major European cities to discuss that issue. Roughly put, this would mean that some kind of federation between Croats and Muslims would be set up in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and a confederation would be set up between that Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. In that respect, everything seems fine and acceptable for us. Acceptable for us inasmuch as that would be in the interest of the Croat people. This would be done primarily to halt hostilities. An agreement was signed by General Roso, who is the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] commander in Herceg-Bosna, and Muslim General Delic along the same lines. The agreement is a big step forward toward ending the war. If the war continues, Croatia will find itself in a very unfavorable position. Therefore, we are interested in an end to the war. The war in Bosnia-Herzegovina would under such conditions [not further specified] be very unfavorable for Croatia. We are also interested because a solution to the Bosnia- Herzegovina crisis is a precondition for resolving the issue of the UN protected areas in Croatia. We are interested because we, the Croatian nation as a whole, as well as Europe and the world, see this alliance with the Muslims, these mutual relations in Bosnia- Herzegovina and relations with Croatia as something that protects the interests of the Western world in relation to this new division, that is, this separation line between the major world powers. And, we are interested because the Muslims, whom this friendship should steer toward the European, Western civilization, ought to develop so as to weed out those elements in Bosnia that wish to create a fundamentalist Islamic state. This is perhaps the most important reason for our acceptance, and this is the main reason why the major European states and the United States suggested we should accept such a solution. From that standpoint, this serves our interests, the interests of the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the interests of the Croatian state in general. The problem now is to implement this idea in practice. The signing of yesterday's cease-fire was an agreement in principle, and this was a giant step in the right direction. What lies ahead is an arduous task, negotiations, because the prevalent standpoint in the Muslim leadership is that the common Bosnia- Herzegovina, the Muslim and Croat Bosnia-Herzegovina should be organized as a single state with civil rights and not on a federal basis. and so forth. We, Croats, have a long historical experience and, unfortunately, a bitter experience from associations: in the Hapsburg monarchy, in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, where a personal [as heard] union became a factual union; then there are the experiences from the former Yugoslavia, especially from the socialist period, during which we had a constitutional and legal...[pauses] not only federal but also confederal elements of communal life for the peoples of former Yugoslavia, where Tito -- both as a Croat and a communist internationalist -- sincerely tried to resolve relations between peoples and nationalities, as they were called in former Yugoslavia, on a footing of absolute equality. In the last Constitution of 1974, he really provided the groundworks for full equality, not only proportionality but also parity in resolving... [pauses] for a consensus, to granting all rights to the minorities, the Albanians in Kosovo, the Hungarians, and so forth. Despite these constitutional and legal tendencies and in spite of the fact that the Communist Party and the then League of Communists stood behind such constitutional and legal solutions on the equality of nations, there was no equality. Not even Croatia could govern itself here in Zagreb, to say nothing of the Croats in Bosnia- Herzegovina. Therefore, the Croats have enough experience not to accept such ideas suggested to us by unitarists, idealists, integralists, and communists, who said they would resolve the problem of democracy, socialist internationalism, and so on. The Croats in Bosnia- Herzegovina cannot be happy with such an idea -- the idea to have this community of Muslims and Croats proclaim itself a democratic state, a centralized state guaranteeing civil and ethnic rights, and so on. So our task is to ensure the survival of the Croat nation on the basis of our overall experience, our historical experience, and on the basis of what happened during the disintegration of Yugoslavia and the disintegration of Bosnia-Herzegovina... [pauses] in a territorial sense... [pauses] because this is not only a matter of importance to the Croats there but also to the Croatian state and the strategic interests of the Croatian state. When I hold talks and when I speak to my friends, I always say that if we do not secure our interests, we could lose Bosnia for the Croatian nation in a few decades, because the proportion of Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina has fallen from 24 percent to 17 percent or even less today. Therefore, we could lose Bosnia not only for Croatia, but also for the West in the sense in which they want Bosnia-Herzegovina to be saved from the division with the eastern world, from the need to ensure that extremist and fundamentalist elements do not prevail there. We are ready to negotiate, we have presented our proposals which point out that, if the Serb part of Bosnia-Herzegovina is allowed to leave, this means that the rest of the world accepts the fact that Bosnia-Herzegovina cannot survive as a union of three republics. Then, naturally, if this is understood, the problem of division should be viewed in a different light, and not in the sense in which it is being done and has been defined so far in the framework of the Geneva negotiations. This is what things are about now. This is yet another historic turning point in the life of the Croatian people and in the drawing of those everlasting lines, in the process of demarcation between different worlds and civilizations in this area. I can tell you that those who advocate such a solution -- the need for a federal, confederate [as heard] relationship between Croats and Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina and a confederation between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia -- at the same time guarantee us that they will help us solve as soon as possible the problem of Croatia's areas under the protection of the peace forces, that they will give us everything they have offered us so far, while trying to move us in a direction other than that of our independent policy; therefore, that they will open up to Croatia all those international institutions, that they will grant us aid for the reconstruction of Croatia, that the problems of our membership in the Council of Europe and of partnership in NATO will be solved, and so on. In a word, they not only consider Croatia an important factor for solving the crisis in this area, but they will also lend it full assistance in various forms to become one of the more prosperous countries attractive to others. Therefore, there are reasons, strategic reasons, for us, Europe, the United States, and the world to reach such a solution and, on our part, we will do everything to achieve this. As I said, Granic is away. He had a meeting in Bonn with Klaus Kinkel, vice chancellor and foreign minister. In Rome he held talks with Italian Foreign Minister Andreatta, and he visited the Vatican. Today he is in Geneva, and then he will visit Paris and London, which does not mean that we (?only want) to inform others about our standpoints. We know that the United States has a crucial role. I again called the U.S. representative who will either come to Zagreb again soon, or the talks will continue in a different way. We should be aware of the delicacy of the issue, of the solution that is being requested from us. It is delicate because we should override -- among the Muslim leaders, those who accept the initiative, who favor an alliance with Croatia -- the liberal-civic concept of state according to which territorially it is not necessary to make any divisions and it is not necessary to have any national attributes in the solving of the issue of Bosnia- Herzegovina borders. Bearing in mind that it is being recommended both to us and to them that [word indistinct] I hope that we shall reach a favorable solution. On the normalization of Serb-Croat relations: Apart from reaching a solution with the Muslims, of which I have spoken, it remains our objective to normalize Croat-Serb relations, in order to resolve the issue of the UN Protected Areas in the easiest possible way and include them into our constitutional system, and also because it is clear to everyone -- including foreign countries -- that without this normalization there are no chances for a new international order in this part of southeastern Europe and the Balkans. As I have said, this remains our policy, but at the same time we are faced with the fact that the Serb side still has an insuffiently defined approach to this, that they have in recent days -- using the fact that all attention was focused on Sarajevo -- engaged in provocation, and, after a long time, have shelled the Maslenica bridge and taken the Gradiska bridge. Of course, these provocations were launched by those elements on the Serb side who do not want relations to be normalized, who want war at any cost. We must be consisitent, for our part, in the implementation of the peaceful solution policy. In the last six months we have achieved almost amazing results in stabilizing the economy, in bringing inflation down. What our government has achieved, headed by [Prime Minister Nikica] Valentic and his first deputy Skegro, Bank Governor Jurkovic, and others too, but first of all these people who work day and night, in this respect amazes the world, and speaks again about the abilities of our people and about the fact that we had a program, which I announced as a program of economic renaissance, and people who knew how to implement it. The success in bringing down inflation, which we have been doing for six months now, should continue. We must continue running the state economy with seriousness. We must adopt a realistic state budget and stick to the budget that the government is to propose and the parliament to adopt -- with an extreme degree of responsibility on the part of each minister, each ministry, each body, each regional governor, each region, each municipality. Clearly there are some concrete tasks here. Nikica Valentic and the others will speak about that later on, so I will not focus on that, but I am saying that, apart from resolving our foreign policy issues -- Croatia's position in the contemporary world -- economic development and stabilization are the main tasks on the home scene. I wish to say something that I have been repeating since the first convention four years ago when I brought people from the Croatian diaspora to Zagreb and when I invited them to return to Croatia. I have been saying this at all meetings but there is still resistance to the integration of these people into Croatia's state and economic life. There is still a lack of understanding for this problem. These Croats who had gone abroad and earned larger or smaller amounts of money, some of whom made several hundred thousand marks or dollars -- not to say millions... [pauses] This, to us, is bigtime capital, and if these people wish to return with such sums, if they also wish to contribute their experiences and their knowledge and bring their children back to the motherland and join in the development of Croatia instead of staying abroad, then we should give them privileges in all areas, not obstacles. This is still going on --this is being done by the privatization fund, by some ministries, and by all lesser institutions. [applause] If we are making special efforts to attract the richest Croat in the world, who is said to be among the hundred richest people in today's world -- a certain Mr. Luksic from Chile who is said to be in possession of $7 billion or $10 billion --- if we bring someone like that to Croatia and ask him to invest here and he agrees and even brings over his children who were born over there, what happens? The papers start writing that a Chilean is taking over Croatia's breweries or whatnot, instead of writing that the richest Croat, one of the richest people in the world, wishes to invest in Croatia. This is a form of resistance. Look, there are people whom I know -- I do not know if Marjan Petrovic or someone else, Rogic or someone is here -- who helped in the establishment of democracy, who helped us in the patriotic war, these people are facing such horrendous everyday difficulties here that they finally say Mr. President, if it were not for this Croatia, these obligations of ours, we would have left Croatia. Gentlemen, please, I am calling on all of you to stop this because this is a way to prevent these people from returning and a way for this old managerial class from the communist regime to survive and stay in control of Croatia's economy. As you know, I have never advocated, nor am I advocating now, that the people who managed companies and were leaders of Croatia should be removed at any cost, or even removed at all, provided they are able. On the contrary, we need their knowledge and experience. We must not act stupidly, and we have not done so, unlike some other former socialist countries. But at the same time we must be consistent in the implementation of our HDZ program, the program of Croatia's economic renaissance, to create conditions for the return of our people, for the injection of capital and knowledge, and for a different kind of behavior from that which our people were used to during the 50 years of socialism. Hardly a week goes by without my reacting to something, why something is not being done...[pauses] I have ordered in recent days that personnel changes be made in some bodies, in the fund, and in some other bodies [applause] where problems have been observed. Gentlemen, as we are overcoming the crisis and resolving the problems I have mentioned -- Bosnia-Herzegovina, UN Protected Areas -- new, better conditions will be created for us. We must be ready for it, to remove in advance all obstacles to the inflow of fresh capital. We shall not sell Croatia, but we need the capital for our development. We must also make sure now that we do not squander the loans we shall get. We must ensure that production increases, that the employment level is increased in order to resolve vital questions of Croatian society, Croatian people, the Croatian state -- the return of refugees, the restoration of destroyed towns and villages -- all of this with clear ideas of the need for economic, cultural, and scientific progress in Croatia. We necessarily had to neglect the fields of culture and science in the two war years. But we must be aware that in these very areas we must make a turn, even with the resources available to us now, and particularly later in new, more favorable conditions. In this connection I would just briefly like to speak about what I told the HDZ club of deputies at the Croatian Assembly. We need better cooperation between the assembly and the government. I told the club of deputies that our government is an HDZ government. It has been implementing the HDZ program. Therefore, in this way we should approach its proposals and cooperate to improve the proposals, if necessary. Our party should not approach this government's proposals, particularly in extraordinary circumstances, by creating even bigger obstacles than is done by opposition parties. One more thing: Ladies and gentlemen, our deputies have to be at their work place, in the assembly, they should not be absent when decisions are being made. [applause] Within the presidency we shall particularly tackle the new law and the problem of who should remain in the assembly and who should discharge other duties. But those who remain in the assembly must attend its sessions. Furthermore, it is a practice in serious parliamentary democracies that all deputies do not deal with all problems. Deputies should decide to take up certain areas and become experts in their field, be it economy, health, or defense. Everyone keeps chattering about everything, no one about.... [applause; Tudjman pauses] and on foreign policy and so on. Therefore, in this respect we should be responsible, because how things are going to be resolved depends on the quality of our work. We must not get involved in excessive politicizing, nor allow it. In this connection, please be informed, particularly the gentlemen from the assembly where some foreign, not only opposition figures, but also some foreign factors, who wanted to turn our policy into different directions...[sentence incomplete as heard]. Do not think that there will not be ideas in the future about returning to some old and new communities which would not be....[pauses] Therefore, all these digressions which have been called distractions and so on, all these stand in the way of the implementation of the HDZ policy and the implementation of state policy. Therefore, I am asking you for full responsibility. We can have different views when it comes to the resolution of internal state problems, but there can be no different views on the implementation of the HDZ program, and the implementation of state policy. Even though we have so far tolerated such circumstances, we cannot forever allow obstacles to be made for us in this way. I appeal to all of you present here to influence the public in that respect. People abroad are amazed [words indistinct]. We have spoken about this at the second (?HDZ) convention and at a presidency session. Everything that has happened proves how correct our policy is but we must know that this also creates obstacles for us. We have to try to successfully resolve the problems we are facing. I therefore ask the central committee, the (?legal) committee, and all individuals to be consistent in the implementation of the HDZ program. I appeal to every individual to show reponsibility. Let us recall that we did not have a united program at the first convention, four years ago -- that we did not have the majority in the parliament. Without the support of the majority of the people we would not have achieved everything we did achieve and we would not have got into the situation where Croatia and its leader are considered the key factors in the creation of the new international order in the area. We can be proud of all this, but it all also places on us the burden of obligation to show great seriousness and responsibility. Thank you. [applause] [words indistinct]
