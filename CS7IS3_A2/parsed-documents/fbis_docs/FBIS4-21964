FBIS4-21964 "jptot016__l94021" JPRS-TOT-94-016-L JPRS Terrorism FOUO 18 April 1994 LATIN AMERICA PERU Peace Agreement With Shining Path Peace Agreement With Shining Path `Confusion,' Suspicion PY1804204894 Madrid EFE in Spanish 1819 GMT 18 Apr 94 PY1804204894 Madrid EFE Spanish BFN [Text] Lima, 18 Apr (EFE) -- The peace proposal made by the Shining Path [SL] on 16 April over a Lima television channel has created some confusion and lead to some speculation regarding President Alberto Fujimori's relationship with the SL leadership, which may end in amnesty for all terrorists. The proposal made by one of the hooded terrorists who appears on the video sent to several television channels points out the need for a peace agreement, under the condition that the terrorists suspend their attacks and the government its antiterrorist struggle. During the political program "En Directo" [Straightforwardly], broadcast on 17 April in the evening, journalist Fernando Rospigliosi disclosed that President Fujimori on 15 April visited the Yanamayo prison where several terrorists, among them Osman Morote, who is the second or third highest SL leader, are held under arrest. According to Rospigliosi, Morote, with a smile on his face, delivered a gift to the president, but as he could not get it through the bars the cell door was opened and Fujimori entered it, where he exchanged brief comments with Morote. This year Fujimori also shook hands with SL leader Edmundo Cox in the prison where he is being held, and it is said that Fujimori sent [Abimael] Guzman a letter on his birthday in December, although that information was denied at the time. According to Rospigliosi, these facts "are worrisome" and may end up with Fujimori, if he runs for reelection in 1995 and wins, pardoning the terrorists. However, recently Fujimori asserted that no sentence against terrorists, whether they belong to the SL or the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA), will be reviewed. The fact is that the SL leaders under arrest, since Abimael Guzman sent his first two letters to Fujimori in September and October 1993 proposing peace, smile and treat the chief of state respectfully. There are also versions stating that the terrorists' attitude is merely a SL maneuver because in truth they continue their attacks, headed by Oscar Ramirez (aka Feliciano) and a group of women that have not paid heed to Guzman's order to halt acts of violence. In the opinion of terrorism expert Carlos Chipoco, the SL wants peace because "it is very weak and virtually defeated from the military viewpoint." According to the monthly PERU-PAZ, since Guzman was arrested on 12 September 1992, the SL "has been incapable of recovering its guerrilla action power" it had before the leader was arrested. The latest data reveals that during the first quarter of 1994, 111 people died as a result of political violence compared to 573 for the same period in 1993.
