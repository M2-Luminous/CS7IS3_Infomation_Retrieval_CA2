Two instances have occurred over the past few days that testify to such intentions. What the press service has in mind is the fact that places, prepared by unknown persons for planting an explosive, and a wire laid down to blow it up, were discovered near the above command post. Quite probably, says the report, this could have been done by an unknown person detained here, who turned out to be a reserve Black Sea Fleet officer. A large amount of the explosive has been confiscated from him. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry press service reports that competent bodies launched an investigation into the above instances. The name of the detained person has not been disclosed so far in the interests of the investigation.
