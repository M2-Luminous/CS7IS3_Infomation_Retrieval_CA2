China will admit overseas investors to such sectors as real estate, commercial retail sales, finance, insurance, and cargo and transportation agency services and consultancies. But such moves must be made on the basis of mutual benefit, said Jiao Sufen, director of the foreign investment division under the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co operation (Moftec). Jiao said that foreign-funded projects must be in tone with China's economic development. They may be guided into such sectors as machinery, electronics, heavy chemicals, new materials, automobiles and automation equipment. She called for keen efforts to buoy export-oriented foreign- funded firms, transform aged enterprises, upgrade technology and equipment, and further improve quality to boost the competitiveness of China's products on the world market. Jiao signalled a halt to overseas investment in ordinary labour- intensive, simple processing and assembly projects as well as those involving products that are difficult to export. Instead, Jiao encouraged overseas investors to develop the energy, transport, raw materials and agricultural sectors. The official vowed to further improve China's investment climate and provide better services to foreign investors. China encourages trans-national companies to finance the country's infrastructure and high-tech industries, Jiao said, adding that they could either invest in a specific project or get involved by transferring and purchasing State assets, stocks and securities. Optimistic about the future of overseas investment, Jiao said China now enjoys political and social stability, a fast-growing economy, and a long-term blueprint for economic development. Since the country opened to the outside world in the late l970s, China has approved more than 174,000 foreign-funded ventures with contractual investment totalling $221.3 billion and real investment hitting $60 billion. Last year alone, the Chinese Government ratified more than 83,200 foreign-funded enterprises involving $110.5 billion in contractual volume and $25.8 billion in real overseas investment.
