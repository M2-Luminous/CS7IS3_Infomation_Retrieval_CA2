He also discusses President Ahtisaari's travel schedule. Yesterday our colleague, HELSINGIN SANOMAT (HS), discussed the risks and problems that may be associated with President Martti Ahtisaari's view of the presidential role (see press excerpt above). HS is right in questioning the very basis for this view; that the fact that the president is now elected directly by the people fundamentally alters his role and his exercise of power. Under the new election method a president must receive over half the votes in the second round of voting. However, Ahtisaari received only a quarter of the votes in the first "open" round, which can be compared with the fact that Mauno Koivisto's electoral candidates received 43 percent in 1982 and that Koivisto won almost 50 percent of the direct votes in 1988! Nor can Ahtisaari's "popular" mandate be regarded as stronger than that of Urho Kekkonen in 1968, for example, when his election alliance gathered two-thirds of the votes -- not to mention 1978, when they got over 80 percent! On the other hand, there is nothing intrinsically wrong in President Ahtisaari getting out among the people once a month through visits to various parts of the country, even if the arrangement smacks of a "royal tour" and of allowing the people to "petition the highest authority," which belongs historically to the time of the monarchy. But there is an inherent risk in this system that the citizens will get the mistaken idea that the president will set things right as long as he becomes acquainted with everyday problems out among the people. Another risk, that exaggerated populism may damage the president's authority, is being discussed in the United States, where President Bill Clinton has gone in for similar "town meetings" with voters around the country. However, HS confuses the ideas somewhat when the paper appears to argue that domestic trips as such lead the president to take more stands and answer questions. Of course the president can take such stands and provide answers no matter where he is -- for example, at regular news conferences, which are an inherent part of an open democracy. On the other hand, HS is right in saying that it will be difficult in the long run if the president intervenes too much in controversial domestic policy issues. If he does there is a clear risk that he will no longer be able to stand above the parties and daily politics in the way the presidential role requires. Therefore a certain restraint can be recommended, simply to enable the president to safeguard the confidence capital he may need in times of real national crisis. However, we should not emulate HS and rule out the possibility that, for example, the national aid package for the European Union (EU) agreement may develop into an issue where the president could play a certain role in creating a national consensus. But HS is right in saying that the president could be more careful about selecting the forums in which he appears. HS is obviously thinking of the MTV program where Ahtisaari was confronted with some totally disrespectful questions. However, that concerned fulfilling a somewhat spontaneous promise from the election campaign. Here another parallel could be drawn with President Clinton who had to answer a question about what kind of underpants he wears on a TV program. The presidency implies a certain authority that the officeholder should safeguard. Furthermore, foreign policy is and will remain the president's most important domain. At present there is nothing to criticize, aside from the initially somewhat varied explanations of the notorious bandage incident [reference to minor injury sustained] in Stockholm. It was natural that the first state visit would be to Sweden. Two neighboring countries are still awaiting their turn; Russia and Estonia. The fact that Ahtisaari visited Iceland, the other Republic in the Nordic group, before the remaining monarchies has its natural explanation in the celebration of the 50th anniversary of Iceland's independence. That the remaining neighbor, Norway, will have to wait until October, after Denmark in September, is undoubtedly more than "made up for" by the fact that Ahtisaari has relatives in Norway. The upcoming trip to South Africa for the inauguration of its new president, Nelson Mandela, is also quite justified. Finland has every reason to highlight its presence at the historic event when South Africa's international isolation is definitively ended. Moreover, the trip certainly fits the picture of a president with an international, in fact global, orientation. Ahtisaari has every reason to maintain the personal relations with a state that could play a leading role on the African continent that he formed during the time he was in Namibia. And even though in general the prime minister should represent us at EU summit meetings in the future if we become a member, it is quite fitting that the president should also attend the summit on Corfu at which our EU agreement will be signed this summer.
