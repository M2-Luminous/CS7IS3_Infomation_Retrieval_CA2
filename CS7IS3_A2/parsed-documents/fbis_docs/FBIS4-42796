He added: We believe that such a development is absolutely unjustified following the content of the UN secretary general's significant report. In a statement to CyBC [Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation] this morning, Mr. Mikhailidhis noted that continuing the discussion of the CBM's cannot lead anywhere, it detracts from the report, and it can only cause damage. Mr. Mikhailidhis also said that some people believe that there is still room for the CBM's and reiterated categorically that we would consider it a fatal blow to the entire process if we continued something which is already obsolete. Concerning a letter that Rauf Denktas conveyed to the United Nations, Mr. Mikhailidhis said that Denktas is starting with a premise that ise absolutely unacceptable to us and are in complete opposition to the UN resolutions. He stressed: Neither our side nor the United Nations, through its resolutions, have ever accepted the fact that Cyprus can be anything but a unitary sovereignty, a unitary citizenship. Mr. Mikhailidhis also pointed that Denktas reiterated in his letter his well-known demands for partnership, equal participation, and separate rights.
