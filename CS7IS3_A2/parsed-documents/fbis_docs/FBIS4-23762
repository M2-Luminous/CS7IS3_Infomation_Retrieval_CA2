FBIS4-23762 "drafr115_c_94015" FBIS-AFR-94-115 Daily Report 15 Jun 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 14 Jun South African Press Review for 14 Jun MB1406122494 MB1406122494 BFN [Editorial Report] THE STAR Prison `Mayhem' -- The Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 14 June in a page-16 editorial criticizes the South African Prisoners Organization for Human Rights, SAPOHR, for its role in the recent prison riots. It is "worrying" that SAPOHR "launches campaigns and then washes its hands of the consequences. Mass action may have been justified during the apartheid years, but SAPOHR's mobilisation tactics now border on the irresponsible. It should rather focus on prison conditions alone. Calling for a general improvement there is a legitimate pursuit; promoting lawlessness and intimidation is not." Turning to the government, the editorial then states that "both the Transitional Executive Council, before the election, and now the Government have vacillated in dealing with the causes of this year's prison protests. Instead of establishing a moral, ethical and legal basis for dealing with the franchise and amnesty issues, the authorities appear to have made concessions because of a lack of resolve. This kind of expediency sets a dangerous precedent. It is something the country may yet come to rue." CITY PRESS Government Urged To Resist SAPOHR -- The Johannesburg CITY PRESS in English on 12 June in a page-14 editorial states that SAPOHR's Golden Miles Bhudu "must be told that he is playing dangerous games by inciting prisoners to embark on so-called rolling mass action to force the new government to grant amnesty to the prisoners. The government must stand firm against any attempts by SAPOHR to blackmail it. Any wholesale release of prisoners would seriously undermine respect for the law." SOWETAN RSA Aid to Rest of Africa -- "Perceptions in the rest of the continent, rightly or wrongly, are that South Africa is a honey pot," begins the Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 14 June in a page-6 editorial. "It is therefore inevitable, now that the country has `opened up,' that people from more depressed circumstances elsewhere will head for our borders." The SOWETAN states that the government's approach to "economic refugees" should be "threefold": first, treat refugees with "compassion and humanity," second, get involved in resolving political disputes "without becoming the `policeman' of Africa," and third, "guard against using its economic strength to exploit countries on the sub-continent." "Balanced economic growth ensuring job opportunities and development for all in the region is the most potent counter to the refugee problem." THE CITIZEN Government's "Race Classification" Criticized -- "Strange, isn't it? The previous Nationalist government got rid of race classification three years ago. The new ANC-dominated government intends to bring it back," states the Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 13 June in a page-6 editorial. The government "is going to introduce race monitors -- defined as `affirmative action monitoring mechanisms' -- to ensure that affirmative action is carried out in the government and private sectors. In some cases, according to the ANC, firms may be required to keep records of the race of employees and even of consumers." "Since race is no longer required to be stated in identity books, one wonders how race will be established under the ANC rules." Banks, businesses, and the civil service will be brought under analysis. The editorial supports its contention by quoting passages from the Reconstruction and Development Program. "We hope the ANC will realise that any form of race monitoring or classification is a throwback to a system that could not be tolerated when it was enforced previously -- and cannot be tolerated if it is imposed now. Not, unless the ANC wants to destroy its nonracist image and plunge the country into a new racial morass."
