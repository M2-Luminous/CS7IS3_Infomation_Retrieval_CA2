Defense alliance is the most acceptable of all the possible forms of cooperation in the military sphere, in the view of the secretary of the CIS Defense Ministers' Council. The aims of that alliance would be not only to prevent and repel potential aggression against alliance states but also to resolve the problem of establishing mutual trust. The Collective Security Treaty does not prevent the creation of a defense alliance. What are the priority tasks to be resolved when forming the defense alliance? First of all, Mr. Ivashov believes, it is necessary to create a system of legal guarantees for the agreements reached by the allies and a mechanism to monitor violations of them. It is then necessary to develop mobilizational plans and plans for the stockpiling of resources. The creation of armed groupings and their deployment on the borders of the CIS will also become an urgent need if an alliance is formed. For the effective functioning of the collective security system it is proposed to extend the provisions of the Tashkent Treaty and divide the system into regional subsystems. Each subsystem must have a political and military leadership and military groupings. Their titles are hypothetical at the moment. The East European Subsystem (Belarus, Kaliningrad Oblast, and the western oblasts of the Russian Federation). The center would be in Minsk, the commander in chief -- the president of the Republic of Belarus. The Transcaucasus Subsystem (Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and the North Caucasus region of Russia). The center would be in Rostov-na-Donu, the commander in chief would be the leader [rukovoditel] of the Russian forces. The Central Asian Subsystem (Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan). The tentative center would be Tashkent. The Russia-Kazakhstan Subsystem (Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation Urals Military District). The center would be in Alma-Ata [Almaty], the commander in chief -- the president of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The secretary of the Defense Ministers' Council explained that the subsystems are necessary for the following reasons: To deter the Afghan opposition (the Central Asian Subsystem), to create a military grouping to counteract China's Xinjiang Group of Forces (the Russia-Kazakhstan Subsystem), to establish lasting peace in the Caucasus (the Transcaucasus Subsystem), and to form forces analogous to the troop structures of the NATO countries in Europe, first and foremost the Bundeswehr (the East European Subsystem). There is no unity yet within either the military leadership or the diplomatic leadership of Russia on the question of creating the bloc-based collective security system necessary in the Russian Federation. The Russian Foreign Ministry leadership objects particularly to this concept. Meanwhile, Leonid Ivashov stressed, the most powerful military grouping -- the NATO bloc -- still exists and Russia's affiliation to it is, at the moment, highly problematic. The adoption by the CIS member countries of political decisions aimed at creating an effective collective security system will serve as a guarantee of political stability in all the CIS countries.
