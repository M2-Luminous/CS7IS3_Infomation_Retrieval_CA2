Last year saw Fujian's gross social product quadruple, fulfilling its goal set for the end of this century seven years ahead of schedule, and its industrial output value rise by 48 percent over the previous year. According to Yang Mingyi, director of the provincial Environmental Protection Bureau, the province removed, closed down or merged 83 industrial enterprises discharging heavy pollution last year. In addition, it spent more than 50 million yuan on transforming 265 projects. The bureau approved the building of more than 100 projects, which will install pollution-control facilities and release little pollution upon completion. To help rural industrial enterprises solve pollution problems, the Environmental Protection Bureau has set up the "Dabao Industrial Pollution Control Center" in Shishi, a boom town in southeast Fujian. The director noted that Fujian will focus on pollution treatment at 89 key state enterprises and nine units discharging serious pollution this year, while urging overseas-funded and rural industrial enterprises to exert more efforts to clean up pollution.
