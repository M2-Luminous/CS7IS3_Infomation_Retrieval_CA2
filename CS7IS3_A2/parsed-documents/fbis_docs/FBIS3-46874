The official said that he expected the contact to be held as early as next week. When an IAEA inspection team enters North Korea, Pyongyang and Washington will probably announce a date for the third round of high-level talks, South and North Korea will have a working-level contact on exchanging special envoys, and Seoul will declare the suspension of its "Team Spirit" joint military exercise with the United States. "North Korea and the IAEA are expected to begin consultations soon on the method and schedule for the IAEA inspection of North Korea's seven declared nuclear installations. After the consultation is over, North Korea and the United States will finally fix their agenda and schedule for the third round of talks," the official said. "If Pyongyang and Washington agree on details in additional contacts in New York and smoothly push ahead with preparations, then the third round of talks will be held. They will have full-fledged discussion on resolution of the North Korean nuclear problem." Consultation between North Korea and the IAEA is not directly leading to solution of the North Korean nuclear problem, but it is preparation for a third round of talks to solve the problem, he added. North Korea's willingness to consult with the IAEA is progress, he said.
