At 59 years of age, Marcelino Oreja is undertaking a new task in his already rich diplomatic career. The new Spanish representative to the Community's executive body will have the same areas of responsibility as Abel Matutes -- i.e., energy and transport -- until the end of the European Commission's current term at the end of this year. The reshuffle for the new group of commissioners will be up to Jacques Delors' successor, although a number of Community sources consulted agreed in saying that -- given Marcelino Oreja's profile and diplomatic career -- the most reasonable assumption is that the new Spanish commissioner should have responsibilities in the area of European foreign relations. This raises the possibility of a stormy initial period in his relations with Commissioner Manuel Marin, who is currently responsible for humanitarian aid and EU policy toward developing countries. Marin's fate, and to a certain extent that of Oreja's future responsibilities, depends on how the upcoming European elections turn out for the Spanish Socialists and on [Spanish Prime Minister] Felipe Gonzalez' final decision whether or not to run for the Brussels job if the Twelve fail to reach a consensus at the June summit on any of the candidates competing to succeed Delors. Gonzalez's arrival in Brussels would, of course, displace the Spanish Socialist commissioner. Marcelino Oreja has also let it be known that he will maintain the good climate of relations with the Spanish Government that prevailed during the Matutes years.
