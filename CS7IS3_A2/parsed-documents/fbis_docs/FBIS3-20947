ID: How do you see the special place of the Fraunhofer Society within the German research community? Warnecke: We are actually a service operation for society and the economy. The special mission of the Fraunhofer Society is to bridge the great gap between knowledge-oriented and result-oriented research. Consequently, our researchers ought not be viewed simply as scientists but as salesmen and entrepreneurs as well. ID: That sounds like an excerpt from your book The Fractal Factory. What do you intend to change in the Fraunhofer Society? Warnecke: A new man at the top always does things differently because he brings in a different mentality. But not just for that reason alone. Conditions have changed for the Fraunhofer Society. I shall therefore strengthen the promising decentralized structure and management of the Society. The 50 institutes that we have, including those in the new federal states, operate as independent profit centers in their own specialty. They have to market accordingly and constantly monitor their own efficiency. ID: The knowledge-oriented and result-oriented research dichotomy you refer to has been much discussed. How do you view the relationship between basic and applied research? Warnecke: Basic research, as always, is very important. We need basic research knowledge upon which to build, without, however, being under the constant pressure of seeking applications and uses. The question really is just how much basic research and how much applications research we should undertake. It is my opinion that applications research should, owing to current innovative weaknesses and the great need for quick innovations, receive the greater emphasis. ID: Do you welcome this development. Warnecke: There is no other choice for me. I don't want to start an allocations war. That would be ridiculous. We must--in view of limited resources--set priorities sensibly within a cooperative dialogue with the political, scientific, and economic sectors. ID: In your book, you ridicule the slavish copying of Japanese production models. What do you propose instead? Warnecke: We have to develop our own concepts as how to organize, structure, and manage conpanies in Germany. The question today is to survive in a climate of increasingly more intensive global competition and under increasingly turbulent conditions. We cannot do that if we must first wait for some new message of salvation from Japan before getting up off our duffs. ID: Perhaps, the reason for this is that we do not have a salvation plan of our own. What, then, specifically has to be changed in the German business world? Warnecke: It must constantly be in a position to react swiftly to new surprises emanating from the customer and from the competition; innovations must become routine. A single production process is no longer decisive for maintaining competitiveness in such a changed situation. Rather, communications and information exchange between the various specialists must be perfected. In this way the logistics--in the broadest sense--will be made available for the successfully breaking bottlenecks. This is why German industry has suddenly found itself is such difficulties. ID: You therefore propose "fractals," that is, relatively independent operational entities, as the solution. How would that function in practice? Warnecke: In the following way. I view a particular company undertaking and proceed to engage a number of subcontracters to carry it out. I find them in our own business. Each associated group can be viewed as an independent subcontracter to whom I assign a specific target goal. In the ideal case, each individual associate knows his own target goal. Besides the targeting system, a navigational system is also needed. Each associate has to know precisely where he stands with respect, for example, to processing times, defect rate, and costs. These are the data that determine the difference between the specified planned state and the actual state of affairs. We hope--and various projects have given us reason to hope--that a motivational thrust will ensue from the difference between the specified and actual states so that the process continually improves itself. ID: Isn't there a danger of the subcontractors becoming too independent? Warnecke: I don't think so. The overall organization ought not become chaotic. We shall--as before--have a top management team, but with the flatest possible hierarchy. ID: Is management ready for this? Warnecke: Of course there will be a learning process. It is simply not going to be the case that the individual fractals, the business entities, or cells--it doesn't matter what you call them--will only be established and structured from top management once, and then left to be. Further improvements will be made whenever deficiencies or problems are detected. The system will have its own dynamic. We are bringing the customer-supplier relationships together in an internal competition. ID: Please give an example. Warnecke: Take, for example, the present maintenance field. As a supplier to the production field, it had to be understood as a subcontractor. In future, it will no longer have a fixed budget with a fixed number of workers. Instead, it might be decided that you will only be budgeted on the basis of half the number of your staff workers. The other half you will have to earn by performing services and jobs for which the production groups or fractals contract you. ID: In developing such model factories, do you have any specific examples in mind? Warnecke: There have been and continue to be companies that already practice this. Science is lagging behind. One example that comes to mind is the Mettler-Toledo Company in Albstadt. It was brought to my attention by someone who had read my book and said that he had seen my "fractal factory" in operation there. ID: Have you found any emulators? Warnecke: Yes, in the meantime there have been small to medium-size companies that are attempting to do the same. But any one who attempts to do this must be fully aware that you simply cannot buy an organizational structure. You have to find your own specific solution. ID: After the collapse of entire industries, the East German enterprises are in particular need of structural solutions. Does your concept offer any hope in resolving these immense difficulties? Warnecke: It would be presumptuous of me to claim that those very special problems could be eliminated in this way. But there is a certain harsh advantage in starting from point zero. In some ways, it is simpler than attempting to introduce changes in a matured West German organizational structure. Out of necessity, that is now being attempted with brute force. There are some opportunities for it in the eastern states. ID: Are they being taken advantage of? Warnecke: Opel has introduced a policy change in its Eisenach plant. A manager also wanted to show me a factory in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, a branch of the Pfanni Company in Munich, that was operating on my principles. The manager told me that he had actually structured his plant contrary to instructions from Munich, with the strong support of the workers. Professor Warnecke has headed the Fraunhofer Institute for Production Technology and Automation; he is a member of the management boards of various institutes and companies; and he teaches at Stuttgart University. By virtue of his books and 400 professional publications, he is considered the pope of factory planners.
