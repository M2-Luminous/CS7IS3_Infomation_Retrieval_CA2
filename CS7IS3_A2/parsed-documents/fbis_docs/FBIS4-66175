It is threatening horse breeding and can be a serious threat to spring plowing. The animal husbandry and veterinary departments of the Ministry of Agriculture have issued an urgent circular notice a few days ago, urging all localities to give serious attention to preventative action against horse influenza. Statistics on the epidemic show that during the period from May 1993 to January 1994, horse influenza has been rampant in 249 counties of 11 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions throughout China, namely in Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Jilin, Ningxia, Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, Hebei, Beijing, and Henan, with 1.37 million horses sick, 19,000 horses dead, and a total direct economic loss of 170 million yuan. Although some preventive measures have been adopted in every province, it has not yet been possible to control the epidemic. Since February of this year, horse influenza has reappeared in Shanxi, Beijing, Ningxia, and Gansu, and has also spread to the breeding areas of Qinghai and Sichuan. Within only one month, 170,000 animals have fallen sick and almost 10,000 have died; it is an extremely serious situation. Since the founding of the PRC, horse influenza has been epidemic in China four times, but the present epidemic is the most serious outbreak since the founding of the PRC, specially characterized by its widespread occurrence, long duration, high death rate, and frequent recurrences. To control and wipe out the present widespread epidemic of horse influenza as quickly as possible, the Ministry of Agriculture has especially issued an urgent circular notice, ordering the agriculture and animal husbandry departments of all ranks to vigorously pursue and effectively take in hand all relevant preventative work and to immediately make comprehensive epidemic prevention dispositions. The agriculture and animal husbandry departments shall pay particular attention to any occurrence of the disease and its developmental trend, and regardless of time and place shall make an immediate report to the next higher animal epidemic prevention organ. They shall also promptly inform the neighboring animal epidemic prevention organs to assist in any preventive measures. The notice orders all localities to earnestly and effectively store up epidemic prevention material, to render active support in supplying basic curative and disinfecting pharmaceutical materials and instruments, so as to ensure that regular action be taken in preventative work and that epidemic situations be expediently dealt with. Districts in which the epidemic has already broken out must be closed off and isolated as quickly as possible. Entry and exit of all equidae to and from such districts shall be forbidden, markets for all equidae shall be closed, and buying and selling of such animals forbidden.
