Addressing the meeting, Yi So-yong, vice-chairman of the Korean Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee, said that the signing of an accord of the Palestine self-rule in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank's Jericho area between Palestine and Israel on May 4 was a fruition of the patient efforts of the Palestinian people to retake the lost territory and restore their national rights. He wished it would be a basis of building an independent state of Palestine and the first step for a fair and comprehensive solution to the Middle East issue. Noting that if a durable peace in the Middle East is to be preserved, Israel should withdraw from all the occupied Arab land and the aggression and intervention of the imperialists in this area should be ended, he said: We are convinced that the day is sure to come when the Palestinian people will live a happy life in their motherland after finally settling the Palestinian issue, closely rallied around the PLO. Palestinian ambassador to Korea Shahir Mohammed spoke next. He said that the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il set an outstanding example in international support to the just struggle of the Palestinian people and they remain true to internationalism. The U.S. imperialists are hatching up falsehood and slanders about Korea's development of nuclear weapons, but this is nothing but a demagogy to cover their disgusting purpose and scheme against Korea, he said, and pointed out: The Palestinian people and the Arab people fully support the 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation advanced by the great leader for the reunification of Korea, considering it a most just and comprehensive one. He supported the DPRK's position to solve the nuclear problem. Saying that the Palestinian people will always remain faithful friends of the Korean people, he stressed that the revolution of the two countries and friendship between the peoples fostered by President Yasir 'Arafat and the great leader President Kim Il-song will continue to develop in conformity with mutual interests in the future, too. A letter to the Palestinian president was adopted at the meeting.
