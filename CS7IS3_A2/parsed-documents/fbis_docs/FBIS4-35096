The 15 former Nicaraguan "contras" occupying the CIAV-OAS are led by Leonardo Zeledon, a paraplegic known by the alias of "Comandante Chispero," a spokesperson for the Government Ministry announced today. The CIAV-OAS headquarters, which was occupied by the former "contras," is near the Government Ministry building. The CIAV personnel, whose number was not disclosed, continue to be held there this afternoon. CIAV Coordinator Sergio Caramagna, who entered the building to speak to the occupiers, is inside the building. For their part, another group of seven former "contras" peacefully entered the Colombian Embassy in this capital to request political asylum because they fear for their lives. The group that sought refuge in the Colombian Embassy is led by Luis Arguello Montiel, alias "002," the Government Ministry source stated. Neither the group that occupied the CIAV headquarters nor the group that sought refuge in the Colombian Embassy have explained their demands or why they fear for their lives. "Comandante Chispero," at the insistence of newsmen, said that it will not be until tomorrow, Wednesday, that they will publicly state their demands to the Chamorro government. Managua Archbishop Miguel Obando y Bravo told the media that if the conflicting sides accept he would be willing to serve as mediator to resolve the crisis. At the beginning of June, a group of 23 disarmed former Sandinist soldiers occupied for several hours the Venezuelan Embassy in this capital, to demand from the Violeta Chamorro government an indemnity payment for years of service to the Government Ministry. Practically simultaneously, another group of retired Sandinist military on 7 June occupied the Managua Cathedral for the third time since the church was dedicated in September to reinforce their struggle for indemnity payments. Both episodes of violence in Nicaragua concluded after Vilma Nunez, director of the Nicaraguan Human Rights Center and Monsignor Eddy Montenegro, Vicar general of the Managua Archdiocese, served as mediators. Several weeks ago former Sandinist soldiers occupied the Italian Embassy in Managua and the OAS building, to draw the government's attention to their claims.
