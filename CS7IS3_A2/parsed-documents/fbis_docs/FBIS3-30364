Croatian mortars shelled Serb villages in the Novigrad hinterland, the R.S.K. army said in a statement and added that small arms fire had been reported in the areas of Vrlika and Drnis in the south of the R.S.K., and in the regions of Lika and western Slavonia. Late last year, the R.S.K. and Croatia had agreed to observe a ceasefire during Christmas. The agreement was first extended on January 13, and again on Sunday. The latest extension was mediated by U.N. peace-keepers. The R.S.K. was proclaimed by Serbs in late 1991 within their ethnic and historic boundaries in parts of the former Yugoslav Republic of Croatia, in response to Croatia's violent secession from the former Yugoslav Federation and attempt to downgrade the Serbs to an ethnic minority. The R.S.K. was placed under U.N. protection in March of 1992, but this has not prevented Croatia from attacking it three times since in an attempt to impose its rule there by force.
