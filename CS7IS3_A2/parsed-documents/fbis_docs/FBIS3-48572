Macaspac] [Text] President Ramos launched yesterday a program that would provide some two million jobs to the rural people in the next three years, with allocation of some P23 billion [Philippine pesos]. Dubbed "Kabuhayan 2000," [Livelihood 2000] the project was simultaneously began in various parts of the country. The president presided over the launching ceremonies in Balayan, Batangas, together with Speaker Jose de Venecia and former Vice President Salvador Laurel. The president designated Interior and Local Government Secretary Rafael Alunan III as chairman of the inter-agency committee that will implement the program. In his speech at Balayan, the president said his government is pursuing the project as part of the national effort to improve the economy by providing better and high paying jobs to the rural folk. He said Kabuhayan 2000 is a vital cog in his Pilipinas [Philippines] 2000 economic development program for the Philippines. Mr. Ramos stressed that the ultimate objective of the program is the eradication of poverty and consequently improving the quality of life of the people. The employment plan, Mr. Ramos said, is also part of a three-pronged undertaken by the Presidential Council for Countryside Development, the Commission to Fight Poverty, and the Philippine Council for Sustainable Development. [sentence as published] These agencies have been tasked with coming out with programs that would stimulate employment, accelerate production and generate capital. But the new employment program has the local government units at its forefront. The governors and mayors, through their respective organizations, have already accepted the president's challenge and agreed to work for the program's success. The project will also have six components that each will be handled by one department. Job opportunities will be created through reforestation, agribusiness development, rural enterprises, rural infrastructure, and job placement. Thus, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources will be tasked with implementing the reforestation phase; the Department of Agriculture and Food on agribusiness development; the Department of Trade and Industry on rural enterprise development; the Department of Public Works and Highways on infrastructure projects; the Department of Labor and Employment on job placements; and, the Department of Interior and Local Government on capability building. Mr. Ramos said funding for the project will come from various financial institutions, including those based in foreign countries. He said P17.5 billion has already been obtained and the balance will be appropriated by next month. The chief executive is confident that the program will succeed. The six main categories of the project are the so-called "multiplier enterprises" where one project or one job creates additional opportunities in the neighborhood for similar complimentary or supportive projects. In Balayan, the president presided over the signing of an agreement among political opponents in the province. Among those who signed the covenant were former Vice President Salvador Laurel of the Nacionalista [Nationalist] Party; Batangas Gov. Vicente Mayo of the Nationalist People's Coalition; Rep. Hernani Perez, House minority leader, of the opposition Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino [Struggle of Filipino Democrats]; and Reps. Eduardo Ermita and Ralph Recto, both belonging to the House "Rainbow Coalition." Mr. Ramos urged officials in the other provinces to emulate the lead taken by the Batangas officials who have decided to cross party lines and form a multiparty covenant seeking the success of the presidential employment program. Mr. Ramos said politicians must now set aside their political interests so that they can effectively contribute to the general effort toward transforming the Philippines into a newly-industrialized country before the turn of the century. Answering criticisms that his provincial sorties are mere junkets and do not contribute to the development of the rural areas, the president said his administration is now bringing the government to the people through innovative projects that directly benefit the citizenry.
