FBIS4-51794 "dreas085_d_94037" FBIS-EAS-94-085 Daily Report 21 Apr 1994 South Korea Companies Fight Argentine Claim Companies Fight Argentine Claim SK2104121394 Seoul YONHAP in English 0740 GMT 21 Apr 94 SK2104121394 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Buenos Aires, April 20 (YONHAP) -- South Korean fishing companies have been on their toes ever since four Korean vessels were seized recently by Argentine naval authorities. The fishing business here for South Korean companies, which goes back to the late 1970s when Hansong Enterprise Co. first took to the water, witnessed its worst group seizure ever. All four vessels are operated by locally incorporated South Korean companies -- two by Tae Ung Deep Sea Fisheries Co., one by Tongwon Industries Co. And the last by Chewon Co. These locally incorporated firms own a total of 34 vessels, all flying Argentinian flags and obligated to follow local regulations, prompting South Korean officials to question why they were seized by Argentine authorities. The captured boats were operating about 300 miles north of the Falkland Islands. The fishermen say they were taken illegally, insisting they were outside Argentina's territorial waters. Local authorities, however, say the boats were inside the 200-mile territorial limit, fishing 195 to 197 miles off the coast. Bickering over whether a vessel is operating inside or outside the boundary is common: Most boats fishing illegally inside Argentine territorial waters speed beyond the boundary when chased by maritime authorities and claim they were fishing at the point of capture. But officials here say this time, the maritime police started from outside the boundary and gradually worked to the inside, discrediting the South Koreans' claims. Argentina's federal courts will have to decide who is right, and most observers say South Korea is aboard a sinking ship. History shows that virtually no vessels accused of illegal fishing were set free without paying at least a minimal fine. The federal courts usually take at least three months to investigate before setting a fine. Depending on whether the courts see the violation as premeditated or unplanned, the fine could range from 490,000 U.S. dollars to as high as 1 million dollars. Because four boats were caught at once, the courts are most likely to view it as a planned violation, the officials say. Over 500 boats operate in the teeming waters off Argentina in March and April including 50 Russian and 150 South Korean vessels, as well as Japanese and Taiwanese boats and those locally incorporated. The officials say Argentina's fierce reaction to boundary violations is understandable given that so many foreign vessels cross the line to net squid and shrimp whenever the authorities' watchful eye is averted.
