He was killed last Sunday [19 June] by a gang of attackers in Oworonshoki area of Lagos. The late Vice Adm. Elegbede entered the Nigeria Defense Academy in 1962, after which he attended military and civil training institutions both at home and abroad. He held various command appointments in the Nigerian Navy. At the time of his retirement last December, Adm. Elegbede was chief of administration at the Defense Headquarters. The late naval chief is survived by three wives and eight children. His death at the hands of the gang of attackers is being investigated by the police. Reports say that the gang had trailed Adm. Elegbede to a point where his vehicle was forced to stop, and the attackers then opened fire on him. About three weeks ago Adm. Elegbede was conferred with a chieftaincy title by the Oba of Lagos.
