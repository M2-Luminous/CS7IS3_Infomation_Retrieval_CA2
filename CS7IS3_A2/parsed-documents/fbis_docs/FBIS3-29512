This topic is covered extensively by the vernacular press with CHOSON ILBO, TONG-A ILBO, HANGUK ILBO, KYONGHYANG SINMUN, SEOUL SINMUN, and HANGYORE SINMUN all carrying editorials and articles analyzing future development prospects. REACTION The moderate CHOSON ILBO, TONG-A ILBO, and HANGUK ILBO newspapers carry 800-word editorials on page 3 welcoming North Korea's acceptance of the IAEA nuclear inspections but caution that although the emergency atmosphere has dissipated on the Korean peninsula due to North Korea's acceptance of nuclear inspection, it is too early in the negotiation process to expect too much from North Korea. Pointing out that "the nuclear issue began with the IAEA's demand for special inspections [tukpyol sachal]," the CHOSON ILBO editorial entitled "No More Nuclear Games," says that "ad hoc and ordinary inspections [imsi mit tongsang sachal] on seven declared facilities are meaningless" and that "the developments in the nuclear issue will only be possible following special inspections." The editorial warns that if North Korea accepted the inspections to avoid UN Security Council's sanctions, it will only add to its image of being "an impossible country to deal with" and urges North Korea to keep in mind the "economic benefits" that are to be gained from the resolution of the nuclear issue. The editorial concludes by telling readers to wait until North Korea accepts special and mutual inspections [sangho sachal] between the North and the South. The moderate TONG-A ILBO editorial entitled "Still a Long Way To Go To Resolve North Korea's Nuclear Issue" chimes in with CHOSON ILBO by saying that "real negotiations begin when the issues of special inspection on two undeclared facilities and mutual inspections [sangho sachal] between the North and the South are discussed at the third round of the U.S.-North Korea talks," but adds that developments prove that North Korea only takes action when faced with "resolute measures [tanohan taecho]." The moderate HANGUK ILBO editorial entitled "While Catastrophe Has Been Avoided on the North Korean Nuclear Issue" says that "although North Korea's avoidance of catastrophe and economic sanctions is to be praised, ...this does not mean a complete resolution of the nuclear issue." The editorial urges the government to be fully prepared for North Korea's tricks as the sudden change is part of a "meticulous, premeditated plan." HANGUK ILBO's 800-word article by Paris correspondent Han Ki-pong on page 2, in analyzing the implications of the long drawn-out negotiations process, says that "no progress has been made from the starting point of negotiations a year ago," but that the resolution of conflict between North Korea and the international community is important in and of itself. HANGUK ILBO carries an 800-word article by Choe Kyu-sik on page 4 on the ROK Government's view on North Korea's acceptance of nuclear inspections. While finding North Korea's decision "fortunate and welcoming," the government expressed its position that it is too early to be optimistic. The article says that the government hopes to have meaningful development in working-level contacts concerning the exchange of special envoys and to lead North Korea to completely return to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] system following a successful third round of U.S.-North Korea talks regarding the special inspections [tukpyol sachal] of the two undeclared facilities. While the government does not interpret North Korea's acceptance of inspections to mean complete abandonment of nuclear development, it is not being interpreted as "a temporary step" to get out of the recent emergency situation, but as one official put it, "a meaningful breakthrough." This official is said to have noted that "it is a considerable development that North Korea accepted ad hoc inspections [imsi sachal] on two facilities when it had only allowed replacement of batteries and films." On page 5, HANGUK ILBO carries a 700-word article by Yu Sung-u noting the two interpretations among relevant government officials on North Korea's acceptance of inspections: One, that it is part of a long-term negotiation strategy, and two, that there has been a sudden change in power structure within North Korea. Supporters of the former theory feel that North Korea's concession was planned to prevent the resumption of Team Spirit and that "it may be short-sighted to analyze that North Korea changed its attitude because it felt pressured by the 21 February deadline." Those who support the latter view note that while the declaration to withdraw from the NPT and the proclamation of a semi-war state in North Korea were done in Kim Chong-il's name, measures to settle the situation have been done in Kim Il-song's name. The article speculates that Kim Il-song may have chosen to involve himself in the settlement process after judging Kim Chong-il's management of diplomatic and economic affairs to have failed and concludes by saying that the issue of succession of power remains uncertain. The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN in Korean publishes on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "The Problem of Inspections on North Korea's Nuclear Facilities Starts Now." The editorial welcomes North Korea's acceptance of IAEA nuclear inspections as evidence that North Korea wants to avoid serious confrontation with international society due to the nuclear issue. The editorial reports, however, that "the problem is how sincerely North Korea will accept IAEA inspections in the future," noting that there have been differences of opinion between the IAEA and North Korea regarding procedural matters on inspections, including its form and scope. Noting that North Korea's acceptance of IAEA nuclear inspections is "nothing but a beginning" and "it is no more than returning to the situation one year ago when North Korea declared its withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, NPT," the editorial stresses that "in a sense, North Korea's acceptance has no new, special meaning other than just the start of discussions on the North Korean nuclear issue." The editorial urges North Korea to allow the IAEA to inspect all nuclear facilities, including undeclared sites in Yongbyon and, at the same time, stresses the need for the United States and the IAEA to continue negotiations with Pyongyang "with a consistent principle." The editorial concludes that "the government should realize that if it continues its policy toward North Korea and its nuclear policy with an irresolute and inconsistent attitude, the people's unrest will intensify." The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN in Korean publishes on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled: "North-South Dialogue Should Also Be Resumed." While defining North Korea's acceptance of nuclear inspections this time and the IAEA's announcement to send its inspection team to Pyongyang soon as "a dramatic solution," the editorial notes that North Korea failed to mention if the two undeclared sites in Yongbyon -- which are under suspicion of storing liquid and solid nuclear fuel -- will be inspected this time. The editorial analyzes that North Korea's acceptance does not mean a solution to the North Korean nuclear issue, but means a start to its solution, stressing that success of the issue depends entirely on North Korea's attitude. The editorial notes that "now that North Korea has agreed to IAEA full-scope inspection, the only remaining problem is to resume a meaningful dialogue between North and South Korea to discuss mutual inspections between the North and the South to confirm denuclearization of the Korean peninsula." The editorial concludes that North Korea, which has thus far adhered to dialogue with the United States, should correctly understand the need for North-South dialogue, adding that "North Korea should be aware that the improvement of its relations with the United States cannot be achieved without South Korea's consent." The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN in Korean publishes on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled: "The North Korean Nuclear Issue Has Passed the Crisis Stage." The editorial notes that North Korea's decision on 16 February to accept the IAEA demand for nuclear inspections is a "blitzkrieg" decision and that "with this the North Korean nuclear issue, which was heading toward a crisis stage, was defused for a while." Enumerating the ominous moves of the recent months in connection with the North Korean nuclear issue -- such as tense North Korean-IAEA relations, the dispatch of a U.S. national intelligence team to South Korea, the announcement of U.S. plans to deploy Patriot missiles and Apache helicopters to South Korea, the plan to resume the Team Spirit exercise, the preparations for referring the North Korean nuclear issue to the UN Security Council, and North Korea's reactions to these moves -- the editorial notes that "these were indeed shocking moves for those directly related to the nuclear issue and who live in the southern part of the peninsula." The editorial then appraises our government's efforts to prevent a crisis of war on the peninsula, indicating Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu's recent meetings with U.S. Government officials. The editorial expresses the hope for a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue. HANGYORE SINMUN publishes on page 2 a 900-word article by Kim Tae-ho analyzing the prospects for the North Korean nuclear issue in the wake of North Korea's acceptance of IAEA inspections. Quoting an official concerned at the National Unification Board, NUB, as commenting that "now the first button has been fastened," the article reports that the NUB official's comment has two implications: One is that negotiations for the nuclear issue as a whole will be smoother in the future and the other is that North Korea's acceptance is just a new start. The article stresses that the resumption of North-South dialogue depends on whether the Team Spirit exercise is suspended. The article also analyzes that North Korea will probably demand not only the suspension of the exercise, but also the renouncement of the international cooperative system against North Korea in connection with the nuclear issue in return for the realization of exchanges of North-South special envoys. The article stresses the need not to persistently adhere to a solution of the nuclear issue as we see it today, but to first promote economic and personnel exchanges between the North and the South. PROSPECTS The moderate HANGUK ILBO in Korean carries on page 4 a 1,000-word article by Yi Sung-u on prospects for North-South relations following North Korea's acceptance of nuclear inspections. Noting that the ROK Government is busy preparing necessary actions for resumption of North-South contacts, the article reports the government is optimistic that contacts will be resumed and yet assumes a prudent attitude that no significant progress will be made soon. The article notes that as North Korea employed a foot-dragging tactic, the government assumed a flexible attitude in accordance with North Korea's reactions. Recalling that unification-related ministers met on 25 January and confirmed the government position that the nuclear impasse will be broken only when the North fully returns to the NPT, accepts substantial inspections by the IAEA, and basically agrees on South-North mutual nuclear inspections, the article predicts "chances are high that the government will flexibly readjust its stance in accordance with how IAEA inspections and North Korean-U.S. contacts will proceed." The moderate HANGUK ILBO in Korean on page 3 carries a 1,000-word article by Washington-based correspondent Chong Chin-sok on prospects for North Korean-U.S. relations. The article reports "North Korea's acceptance of nuclear inspections does not mean that nuclear transparency has been guaranteed. However, the North Korean nuclear issue has entered a new stage in which chances for a crisis on the Korean peninsula have been diminished to some extent and the safety-valve of the nuclear issue has been sealed." The article reports that there are numerous diplomatic, political, and legal obstacles that should be overcome for the promotion of North Korean-U.S. relations. The article predicts that even if high-level U.S.-North Korean dialogue is resumed, there is a great possibility that relatively slow progress will be made in the issues of suspending the Team Spirit exercise and promoting ties because the nuclear issue has not been cleared from the agenda. The moderate CHOSON ILBO carries on page 3 a 1,200-word article by Pak Tu-sik entitled "How Things Will Turn Out After North Korea's Acceptance of Nuclear Inspections." Noting that North Korea has defused the crisis over the nuclear issue by accepting IAEA inspections, the article predicts that North Korean-U.S. negotiations or North Korean-Japanese negotiations will start in the first half of this year if progress is made at the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks. The article questions if inter-Korean contacts for the exchange of special envoys can take place smoothly. The article points out that the "two sides should lower the level of their demands." The moderate TONG-A ILBO in Korean carries on page 2 an 1,200-word article by Nam Chan-chong entitled: "How the Third U.S.-DPRK Talks Will Evolve." Noting the future obstacles of U.S.-DPRK talks, the article reports that "to remove these obstacles, North Korea must allow the IAEA inspection team to inspect thoroughly its seven reported nuclear facilities and the exchange of special envoys between the North and South must be carried out." The article reports that "the ROK and the United States will announce the suspension of the Team Spirit exercise this weekend when the IAEA inspection team arrives in Pyongyang," noting an agreement reached between North Korea and the United States at their 18th working-level contact held in New York on 29 December 1993. Referring to the U.S. deployment of Patriot missiles to South Korea as a new agenda item in the negotiations between North Korea and the United States, the article reports: "Although the United States says that it will deploy Patriot missiles to South Korea for defensive purposes, Pyongyang will make it a issue at the meeting with the U.S. side." Noting the possibility of the U.S. cancellation of its plan to deploy the Patriots, the article reports that "Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu has said that the ROK and the United States decided to discuss it after 21 February." TONG-A ILBO carries on page 3 an 1,000-word article by Pak Che-kyun entitled: "The Situation After North Korea's Acceptance of Nuclear Inspection." Referring to the ROK role in North Korean-U.S. talks and in North Korean-IAEA contacts, the article reports: "The resumption of North-South dialogue is getting closer as the IAEA inspection team is allowed to travel to North Korea this weekend." Referring to the need to settle the simultaneous North-South inspection issue by the North and South themselves after IAEA special inspections are conducted, the article urges the government to actively strengthen cooperation with the United States to make North Korea aware of the importance of the improvement of North-South relations in order to improve U.S.-North Korean relations. The article continues that "some government officials say that the government must show its new negotiating card, such as the North-South economic cooperation card, to realize North-South dialogue." TONG-A ILBO carries on page 3 a 900-word article by Kim Cha-su entitled: "The Background and Prospects of North Korea's Acceptance of Nuclear Inspections." The article reports: "It is very successful to confirm North Korea's attitude to resolve the nuclear issue through dialogue," referring to the government's preparations to respond to North Korea's acceptance of nuclear inspections. Noting the background of North Korea's acceptance of the nuclear inspections, the article reports that "North Korea accepted the inspections a day before Kim Chong-il's birthday, and that this is intended to attract international recognition of the Kim Chong-il power system by creating an atmosphere in which North Korea gives a gift to the international community." TONG-A ILBO carries on page 4 a 400-word article by Yi Chin-yong entitled: "The Prospects for IAEA Nuclear Inspection of North Korea." Referring to the need to inspect the two undeclared nuclear facilities in Yongbyon to clearly dispel the suspicion of North Korea's nuclear weapon development, the article reports that "this issue is likely to be discussed at the upcoming U.S.-DPRK high-level talks." Noting the background of North Korea's refusal to accept IAEA inspections and its decision to withdraw from the NPT, the article concludes that "it will take a long time to even confirm the result of the inspections. Therefore, it is too early to be optimistic over the North Korean nuclear issue." The leftist-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN in Korean carries on page 3 an 1,000-word article by Pak Chong-mun entitled: "North Korea, South Korea, and the United States Stopped at the Edge of a Precipice." Referring to Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong's remarks that "North Korea's acceptance of the IAEA nuclear inspection is only the beginning to the resolution of the nuclear issue," the article points out several complicated problems in the settlement of the North Korean nuclear issue. Referring to the IAEA upcoming inspections as an opportunity for maintaining the continuity of nuclear safeguards and for guaranteeing the transparency of future nuclear inspection activities, the article predicts that "North Korea will cooperate with the IAEA inspection team in order to improve relations with the United States in the future."
