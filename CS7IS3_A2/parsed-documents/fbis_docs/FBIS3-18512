Unless at least another infantry battalion group is committed from Britain, the Army is acutely concerned first, that an important peace-keeping opportunity under the supervision of a British general may founder; and, second, that the British troops spread so precariously across Bosnia will be alarmingly exposed if more shooting breaks out, unless they are better balanced and supported. The Government, conversely, is chronically wary of an increased military commitment that would be far easier to make than to withdraw from; and ministers fear that neither the Conservative Party nor the country feels much enthusiasm for sending more troops into the Balkan quagmire. In consequence, the Government and some of the most senior members of the armed forces are more sharply divided on an operational issue than at any time for many years. Bosnia is unusual in that it has united many of the old Thatcherites with a wide sweep of liberal opinion -- and especially media opinion -- in urging British military intervention. We have always found it bizarre that some people in this country are so eager for Britain to assume a wholly disproportionate share of the moral and military responsibility for resolving a Balkan imbroglio when all our European partners save France contribute so little. We opposed major Western military intervention unless the Americans took part. We were dubious even about the dispatch of the British force now deployed, precisely because the current embarrassments seemed so likely. Once British troops were on the ground, once we had a substantial stake in Bosnia, the pressures to increase that stake were inevitable and inexorable. More than that, when we were asked to send a British general to command the UN forces in Bosnia, we did not offer a time-server to make a gesture: in Lt-Gen Sir Michael Rose we dispatched one of the most activist officers in the Army. Now Gen Rose argues that he cannot do the job he was sent to perform without more troops -- and not just any troops, but high-quality British or French troops. Many of the UN contingents on the ground are almost useless for practical purposes. Without more men, Gen Rose cannot effectively implement and extend the fragile ceasefire that exists; and if the tired British soldiers dispersed in company pockets from Sarajevo to the coast come under threat, they are highly vulnerable. Gen Rose's views and wishes have the support of most of the defence chiefs in Britain. The brutal questions are, they believe: will we support our own man on the spot? And are we serious about wanting him to do the job to which he was committed? It is evident that the Americans are not going to get the Government off the hook by committing their own forces. Washington demands forcefully whether the United States is expected to believe that, in the post-Cold War environment, 10,000 soldiers on the ground in Bosnia is really the best that Europe can do. The French have agreed to send an additional infantry battalion. With deep reluctance, we believe the Government should accept the Army's view that an additional battalion should be sent, for a strictly limited term of three months. Britain cannot and should not accept responsibility for solving the problems of Bosnia. But, given the commitments we have already made, and the fragile chance of peace that has opened up, Gen Rose deserves the support he seeks. If the Government believed that it would prove too hot in the kitchen, it should never have set foot there. This newspaper would have supported such a decision. But now that we are there, whether we like it or not, pusillanimity will do Mr Major's government no credit in the face of the clearest professional military advice.
