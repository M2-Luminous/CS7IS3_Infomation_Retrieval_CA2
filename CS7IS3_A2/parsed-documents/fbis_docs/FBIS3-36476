Earlier, the files, kept in the former KGB headquarters in Vilnius, were under the charge of a special KGB people group, subordinate to the Russian Embassy in Vilnius. The Baltic News Service reports that a conflict broke out while taking over the documents, as the women in charge of the dossiers refused to give them to Lithuanian officials. The authorized Russian official was not present during the handover of the documents, and the Russian Embassy in Vilnius refused to comment on the incident. The files of the KGB pensioners will now be kept in the Lithuanian archives and will be accessible to both Lithuanian and Russian officials.
