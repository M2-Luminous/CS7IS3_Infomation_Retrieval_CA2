FR940804-2-00141 FR940804-2-00079 The Commission appreciates the concerns raised by the CBOE; however, the Commission believes that the Phlx has adequate rules and procedures to ensure that Exchange ROTs and specialists can obtain market-maker treatment for options trades executed on other exchanges only where they perform a real market-making function for such options on the Phlx floor. First, under Section 11(b) of the Act, 17 Rule 11b&hyph;1 thereunder 18 and Phlx Rule 1014, specialists and ROTs are required to engage in a course of dealings in a manner reasonably calculated to contribute to the maintenance of a fair and orderly market. This ensures that trades by such persons are for the purposes of fulfilling market-making obligations under the Act. Secondly, Exchange Advice B&hyph;3 minimizes the opportunity for ROTs to obtain good faith margin for a significant number of trades executed on other exchanges. By requiring that the greater of 1,000 contracts or 50% of their contract volume be executed on the Exchange in each quarter 19 and that at least 50% of their contract volume be in assigned classes in each quarter. Advice B&hyph;3 effectively ensures that market-makers will not be able to use the Phlx floor simply to send orders to other markets but instead will have substantive obligations that ensure they are acting as a bona fide market-maker. 20 17 15 U.S.C. 78k(b) (1988). 18 17 CFR 240.11b&hyph;1 (1981). 19 See supra note 14. 20 CBOE Rule 8.7, Interpretation and Policy .03, is quite similar to Phlx Advice B&hyph;3. This CBOE rule requires that (1) ``at least 75 percent of a Market-Maker's total contract volume must be in option classes to which he has been appointed pursuant to [CBOE] Rule 8.3;'' and (2) ``a Market-Maker must execute in person, and not through the use of orders, at least 25 percent of his total transactions.'' In summary, the Commission notes that only market makers who are conducting bona fide market making activity on the Phlx floor are entitled to good faith margin treatment for their options transactions. As a result of the above, the Commission does not believe that the current proposal would result in disparate, competitive treatment by the options exchange, as envisioned by the CBOE. 21 21 Indeed, the Commission believes that approval of the proposed rule change makes the situation envisioned by the CBOE less likely by removing the ambiguity that currently exists in the Phlx's rules and clarifying that off-floor orders, whether executed on the Phlx floor or at another exchange, are not entitled to good faith margin treatment. It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 22 that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;PHlx&hyph;92&hyph;12) is hereby approved. 22 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988). For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 23 23 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1993). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
