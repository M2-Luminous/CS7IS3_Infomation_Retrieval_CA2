The HRC said the Midlands area had witnessed the most deaths with 64 killings. There were four major attacks in the area. At Richmond 12 people were killed in a single attack and at Creighton 15 African National Congress supporters were killed. In the greater Durban area there were 54 deaths; in northern Natal five; 44 on the north coast; and 13 on the south coast.
