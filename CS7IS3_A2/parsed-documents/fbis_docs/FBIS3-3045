The China Torch Hi-tech Industry Investment Fund is expected to attract about $120 million as a result of co-operation between the SSTC and the foreign firms, said Wang Ruiming, head of the commission's Torch Programme Office. The four are Tien Lee (International) Corporation and Wadley Corporate Finance of Hong Kong, BBN James Capel of Canada and the Arthur Anderson Accountant Corporation of the U.S. The funds are to be poured directly into State projects aided by the Torch Programme which was set up in 1988 to market and develop hi-tech in China. Torch and the foreign firms are now examining about 30 projects which have applied for the funds. SSTC has approved more than 1,500 Torch projects in the past five years and local authorities have launched another 3.600. Figures from about 1,300 State projects show a total output of 14.29 billion yuan ($1.64 billion) last year, more than double the figure in 1992. Most Torch projects have been set up in the 52 State hi-tech industrial development zones around the country. Output of these zones leaped 145.3 percent last year to 45.83 billion yuan ($5.27 billion) and their export volume doubled to $730 million.
