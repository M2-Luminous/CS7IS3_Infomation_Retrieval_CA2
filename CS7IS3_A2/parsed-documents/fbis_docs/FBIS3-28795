The decision came in the government's budget formation policy endorsed at a morning cabinet meeting. Bond issuance will total 13.64 trillion yen, constituting the deficit bonds and 10.50 trillion yen in construction bonds for financing public works. Also to be issued are 2.75 trillion yen worth of government- guaranteed bonds by public corporations. Meanwhile, the government also decided to return funds to general accounts from the debt consolidation fund in fiscal 1994 to cover a shortfall in revenue. As for general budget policy, the government, stressing the tough budget situation, called for effective allocation to lift the economy. "Tax revenues dropped for the second straight year in fiscal 1994, resulting in budget shortfall of some 1.5 trillion yen, and the tax revenue trend since then is expected to remain extremely tough," the policy statement said. But Japan's economy remains "broadly sluggish" and the government must take economic management that "ensures a full-fledged recovery as early as possible in fiscal 1994 and a stable growth in and after fiscal 1995," it said. Against this backdrop, the government is to put the emphasis "as much as possible on the economy" in the fiscal 1994 budget, fiscal investment and loans program and third fiscal 1993 extra budget. Funds must be distributed "intensively and effectively under limited financial resources," but a "thorough review" of expenditures must be taken to limit issuance of deficit-covering bonds. Given the government policy, the Finance Ministry is to compile and announce its draft for the fiscal 1994 budget, the fiscal program and the third extra budget in the evening.
