In the fax, we wrote that this was not what we had expected from the experts' talks," we learned from the spokesman of the National Section of the Independent Self-Governing Trade Union [NSZZ] "S." On the previous day, a fax was sent to the prime minister by the All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement [OPZZ]. Ewa Spychalska wants to know whether the experts of the government and "S," who have been holding talks since Tuesday [23 March], are to present the Council of Ministers with drafts of new legal solutions that would satisfy the union's demands. The OPZZ does not agree to such a procedure. During a demonstration in Krakow yesterday, "S" Chairman Marian Krzaklewski stated that he had not received any "good information" on the experts' talks: "The first agreements are already being violated." The decision to set up a team of experts was made by Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak and "S" Chairman Marian Krzaklewski at a meeting on 18 March. Doubts arose almost immediately after this first meeting. Pawlak and Krzaklewski did not leave the conference room together to meet with journalists. At a press conference, the "S" leader stated that the team of government and trade union experts is supposed to translate the union's demands into the language of legal solutions. The Council of Ministers is supposed to make a political decision: either approve or reject these solutions. In a statement to journalists, the prime minister stressed that problems concerning all employees should be resolved in a "multilateral agreement, representing all milieus and unions." He believes that the experts of the government and "S" should work out a "mechanism for forwarding problems to the Trilateral Committee and to multilateral teams so that they can be further discussed." The OPZZ felt alarmed at this "information noise," said Ewa Spychalska on Tuesday. She sent a fax to the prime minister; she wants the prime minister to explain what the team of experts should address. If the results of its work, in the form of drafts of new legal solutions, should be forwarded to the Council of Ministers for acceptance, the OPZZ will protest. "S" also expected something else from the talks of the experts, and it, too, sent a fax to the prime minister requesting explanations. "We do not want a substantive discussion with government experts; we do not want them to teach us lessons about the reasons of the government. We merely want them to help our experts change the demands into concrete legal solutions. Then the Council of Ministers will make a political decision whether it accepts or rejects the proposed changes," explained National Committee Spokesman Piotr Zak. Referring to the statement by Ewa Spychalska about the necessity of multilateral negotiations, he added that "S" is not interested in talks in which one party, the Democratic Left Alliance, divides into two parties: the government and the OPZZ, and then it jointly makes decisions on behalf of the people. The Government Press Office has avoided any comments on the "fax war" and the tasks of the experts' team. Its employees merely quote a sentence from the joint communique issued after the Pawlak- Krzaklewski talks. "The results of the talks between the chairman of the NSZZ `S' and other trade unions, not unlike the results of the work of the experts, will be presented and discussed at a session of the Council of Ministers." However, no one is willing to try to interpret this provision. Yesterday, there were strikes at enterprises in the Warmia-Mazurian Region; for example, the Municipal Heat Energy Enterprise cut off the supply of heat to the buildings of self-governmental and state administration for four hours. The "S" of the Malopolska Region staged demonstrations. A few hundred people took part in these protests. "S" will make decisions on further forms of the protest after Easter.
