Just after his arrival, van den Broek had talks with President Kiro Gligorov. According to the announcement released by the president's cabinet, they exchanged opinions about the present questions in Macedonian-Greek relations and the latest events after the trade embargo embarked on by the Republic of Greece against the Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. President Gligorov gave the European commissioner a written message for Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, in which he reiterated the goodwill and preparedness of the Republic of Macedonia to resume talks in the framework of the United Nations, with the assistance of the European Union. The economic damages caused by the Greek embargo and the danger of new tensions in the region were particular subjects of discussion. EU Commissioner van den Broek made a short statement after the discussions he had with Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov regarding the situation created after the Greek embargo and the possible consequences and implications for Macedonia, but also for security and stability in the region. "We had over two hours of intensive, fruitful discussions and exchanges of opinions with President Gligorov," Mr. van den Broek stated to the numerous journalists. "You know about our mission here -- we are here, first of all, to help resume the dialogue between Skopje and Athens on a number of very dangerous and sensitive subjects. We are certainly convinced that the process of normalization in relations between Skopje and Athens is irreplaceable for stability and peace in this part of the region. And I think that both sides are very much aware of that. "You live here, in a very dangerous part of the world, and it would be very careless if the relations between Skopje and Athens were to escalate the situation in the region," van den Broek said. "I shall take the message of President Gligorov to Papandreou, whom I expect to meet tomorrow afternoon after my talks with Foreign Minister Papulias this evening, and tomorrow we are leaving for Brussels," said van den Broek.
