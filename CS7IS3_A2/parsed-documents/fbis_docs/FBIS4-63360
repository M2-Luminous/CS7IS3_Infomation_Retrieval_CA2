Speaking of the Georgian-Abkhazian confrontation, Grachev said that the conflict has a trend for expanding, which affects Russia's security as well as its vitally important interests in the region. The defence minister stressed that Russia has been constantly playing a mediator's role aimed at settling the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict politically but, regrettably, it does this mission single-handed. Neither international peace-making organisation nor members of the Commonwealth of Independent States take an active part in its settlement. Grachev also said that 2,500-3,000 blue helmets will be dispatched to the region in compliance with the agreement on ceasefire and disengagement of forces in Abkhazia, signed in Moscow on May 14. They will be stationed along the Inguri River on the Abkhazian side as well as in the Galskiy district and the Kodorskoye Gorge. As for the Armenian-Azeri conflict, Grachev informed Juppe of the drafted plan for a Karabakh settlement which was signed by Russia, Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh in Moscow on May 17. Azeri Defence Minister Mamedrafi Mammadov was recalled to Baku on the same day all of a sudden. According to Grachev, this was evidently prompted by the aggravation of the situation at the republican parliament. At the same time, he did not preclude a chance that this was done for political purposes in order to win time and to invite the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe to participate in a peace mission and to settle the Karabakh conflict under its aegis. If the plan for settling the conflict was signed, Grachev noted, Russia would dispatch a peace-keeping force to the region on May 24. According to the minister, the Azeri defence minister is already in Moscow for the second day. In Grachev's opinion, the essence of his arrival is to sign the plan for ceasefire and disengagement of the sides in the zone of the Armenian-Azeri confrontation by June 1 after some allegedly domestic issues are settled by President Geydar Aliyev. Grachev stressed that Russia would not step back on the plan in any way. "The plan is very good. It can really bring peace," the minister noted.
