The multi-billion ringgit contract for 16 single-seater and two twin-seater MIG-29, ground support equipment and spare parts marked a significant breakthrough for Russian defence manufacturers into the Southeast Asian region. The Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) would be the first air force in the region to operate the Russian frontline jet-fighters which would be delivered within 14 months. The contract was signed between the government of Malaysia and the Moscow Aircraft Production Organisation (MAPO) and the state corporation for export and import of armaments and military equipment Rosvoorouzhenie Russia. Finance Ministry secretary-general Tan Sri Mohamed Sheriff Kassim signed for the Malaysian Government while the Russian defence manufacturers were represented by MAPO director-general V. Kousmine and Rosvoorouzhenie director-general V. Samoilov. Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, Defence Minister Najib Tun Razak and visiting Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets, witnessed the ceremony held at the treasury. Together with the contract signing, Malaysia and the Russian defence manufacturers also signed two memoranda of understanding [MOU] -- one, for industrial participation, and two related agreements. Under the MOU for industrial participation, general areas for industrial cooperation with local defence industries would be identified while the second MOU was for the setting up of a technical services centre by a tripartite joint venture to provide technical support for the aircraft. The two related agreements signed were for counter-purchase of US$95 million worth of Malaysian palm oil by Russia over a five-year period and the offset programme. Under the offset agreement both sides should identify areas for transfer of technology to be implemented over a period of 10 years. Airod Sdn. Bhd. [Company Limited], the country's privatised aircraft inspection, repair and overhaul depot, and local telecommunications firm, Sapura Holdings, have been identified as recipients of the project.
