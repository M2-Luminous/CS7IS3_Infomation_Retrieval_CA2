The paper says: Although what Rabin has said was not anything new, it was, however, clear confirmation of Israel's aggressiveness, arrogance, lack of interest in peace, and lack of commitment to peace and the resolutions of international legitimacy. AL-THAWRAH notes that Israel's aggressions, ugly massacres, and violations of international charters in the occupied Arab territories and against Lebanon and its steadfast south exceed, in quantity and results, all it has done against the Arabs in the past four and half decades. The paper says: Israel simply wants peace in exchange for peace. It also wants to suppress the Arabs, usurp their rights and lands, and confiscate their freedom and free will in the name of peace and the logic of violence and occupation. The paper stresses: The kind of peace that we understand and seek to achieve must be comprehensive and just, under which there will be no signs of aggression and injustice, and under which rights and lands are returned in full to their rightful Arab owners. Otherwise, there will be no peace. Concluding its editorial, the paper says: Since it sees and feels the Israeli threat to peace, the United States, as the proponent of the land-for-peace initiative and the peace process sponsor, should abandon its role as a spectator and exert greater effort. It should stress the credibility of its political role to entrench the role of the world community, its principles, and laws, and champion, even for one time, the causes of right and justice in this region.
