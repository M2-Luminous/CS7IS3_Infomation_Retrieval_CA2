FBIS TRENDS-02JUN94-DPRK-UN-IAEA Pyongyang Rejects UN Statement on Nuclear Reactor Refueling Pyongyang Rejects UN Statement on Nuclear Reactor Refueling SUMMARY Pyongyang has rejected a UN Security Council presidential statement calling for North Korean compliance with International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) requests concerning the refueling of one of its nuclear reactors in Yongbyon. At the same time, the North Koreans are continuing to maintain that they are taking measures to preserve the possibility of verifying the nondiversion of nuclear fuel. In rejecting the UN statement, Pyongyang also conspicuously failed to call for talks with the United States and coupled its rejection of the statement with a renewed warning of dire consequences if UN sanctions are imposed on North Korea. END SUMMARY Pyongyang used the authoritative vehicle of a Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement to reject as "entirely unjust" a 30 May UN Security Council presidential statement calling for the acceptance of IAEA requests to segregate selected spent fuel rods for future measurement (Pyongyang radio, 1 June). The statement contained no hints that North Korea would stop or even slow down the current refueling activities at Yongbyon. Moreover, appearing to underscore Pyongyang's realization of the seriousness of the situation, the statement did not even mention the possibility for future DPRK-U.S. talks, as its most recent pronouncements have done. Pyongyang seems to be combining its rejection of the UN statement with a renewed threat to withdraw decisively from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). Suggesting that this is the case, the statement darkly warned that the DPRK will "free itself from the restrictions of an unreasonable framework" (l) if the IAEA declares that the technical feasibility of ascertaining past nondiversion of nuclear material is lost or (2) if the Security Council even "threatens" to impose sanctions. The statement went further to intimate that if either of these contingencies were to materialize, Pyongyang would resume "peaceful nuclear activities"--presumably by starting to reprocess discharged fuel. At the same time, the Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement claimed that Pyongyang is working to maintain nuclear transparency and tried to blame "some officials of the IAEA secretariat" and "some [UN] member states" for bringing about the current crisis. -- Past nondiversion. Reiterating Pyongyang's past claim that it cannot accept IAEA requests for segregating selected fuel rods for future measurement, the statement again insisted that North Korea's method of storing discharged fuel rods makes their future measurement technically feasible. The statement claimed that IAEA representatives had agreed earlier to "seriously study" the efficacy of the North Korean method and to "continue discussions," but that the IAEA reneged on that agreement by referring the matter to the Security Council. The statement justified the "rather fast speed" of the fuel withdrawal operation as "necessary" to "test the maximum efficiency" of the refueling machine. -- Current nondiversion. The statement claimed that the IAEA had confirmed that none of the current batch of fuel rods "had been diverted to another purpose" and that the current refueling is being conducted under IAEA surveillance, either in the presence of agency inspectors or under IAEA-installed cameras. Implications The latest Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement reflects Pyongyang's apparent calculation that the IAEA and Washington would be reluctant to forego the possibility of ensuring future nondiversion of nuclear material--which the imposition of economic sanctions could lead to--for the sake of determining whether North Korea has diverted nuclear materials in the past.
