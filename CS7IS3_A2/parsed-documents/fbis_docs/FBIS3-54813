My guest is Vasiliy Grigoriyevich Samokhvalov, a prominent lawyer and one of the authors of the Law on Television and Radio Broadcasting, which has not yet been adopted.... [Samokhvalov, interrupting] Unfortunately. [Lomakin] Yes, it is only on paper so far. We will talk about some of the president's latest edicts concerning television and radio broadcasting. So, a Russian Federal Service for Television and Radio Broadcasting has been established. Has a Gosteleradio [State Committee for Television and Radio Broadcasting] been revived? [Samokhvalov] I would not say so. After all, the Ministry of Information and the Press has been reorganized. Two services have been established on its base which, depending on how they organize their work, will either justify their existence or be reorganized once again. But according to the plan and the text of these edicts, very important functions have been vested in these services. This includes support for state and nonstate television, registration of television companies and mass media, and so forth. [Lomakin] You know, Vasiliy Grigoriyevich, I think that the viewers are absolutely uninterested in all these behind-the-scenes affairs of ours, even in our journalistic and editorial affairs. I mean, such things as the furniture we use and the equipment we work with. Only one thing about this edict concerns them: Will television be better? Will their favorite programs disappear or remain? Will they move to other channels or broadcast times, and so forth? [Samokhvalov] We must understand one thing, that a great deal depends on the normative or legislative basis of television. It is much the same with health laws, for instance. Sooner or later they will have an influence on our health. Will we get free medical treatment or we will get good or bad medical treatment? This also goes for television. These edicts create a certain legal space which gives domestic television an opportunity to work better. I think that if the new Federal Assembly adopts the Law on Television and Radio Broadcasting which reflects the necessary articles, then television will be able to work better, and consequently this will be borne out in its programs and television will be directed more toward the interests of our esteemed television viewers. [Lomakin] Now take a look, Vasiliy Grigoriyevich, at what an interesting thing we get -- a certain idea lies behind the framework of the edict that one television channel will remain a state channel, and the second channel will be privatized, auctioned off, and will carry independent television company programming. Yet we are already running into contradictions with our television viewers. We are trying to put a lot of advertising into our programming, and this irritates the television viewers. They do not like this, yet we survive from advertising. How will the state channel differ from the nonstate channel? [Samokhvalov] There are some existing norms. For instance, the Law on Mass Media determines that advertising must not total more than 25 percent of the broadcast time of television programming. A separate draft law is being prepared on advertisements in the mass media. I think that this is precisely where problems of placing advertisements in feature films and other television programs will be dealt with in greater detail. In other words, this requires normative and legislative regulation. [Lomakin] Vasiliy Grigoriyevich, let us switch from television to the very, very latest problems. The fact of the matter is that as far as we know, the Russian Press House is supposedly being transferred for use by the Federal Assembly. In other words, the journalists will be kicked out of it and the newspapers will be kicked out. So, do journalists have any rights, in general, or not? I am curious. [Samokhvalov] Journalists? I feel very sorry for you because you are the anchorman of one of the more interesting programs and you should know your rights. Of course, you also have responsibilities, according to Article 47, to find and request information, visit various organizations, take notes, and so forth. All of these rights exist, and they are in effect. There are journalists' responsibilities, and I think that the Law on Television will permit a more specific determination of the rights of television journalists, for instance, or radio journalists. [Lomakin] What about the Russian Press House? That is the issue I was leading up to. Let us look at that issue. Who will get the Russian Press House? If the Federal Assembly gets it -- and I understand that this could be justified -- where will the newspapers and the journalists go? [Samokhvalov] Where will they go? I think that there must be an administrative building available in Moscow. Just take a look. Only recently the Ministry of Security was eliminated. This means a complex of buildings on Dzerzhinskiy Square. [Lomakin] But you know that the time between the publication of the edict on the elimination of the ministry and the vacating of the buildings may amount to several years. I think that this is what will happen. [Samokhvalov] The Ministry of Information and the Press has also been eliminated. It occupied a building in the very center where the editorial offices of the newspapers NOVOYE VREMYA, MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI, NOVYY MIR, and so forth traditionally have been located. I think that the journalists could very easily move into the premises of the eliminated departments. I think that this problem is a little far-fetched. [Lomakin] Vasiliy Grigoriyevich, thank you. We do not have much time left, so I must say that I am satisfied only by one thing, and that is the fact that television journalists will probably not have to vacate this building next year. [Samokhvalov] I hope not. I would also like to express my hope that you will more actively defend the rights of television viewers on the basis of a knowledge of your own rights as journalists. I hope that next year this building will not come under fire, either from weapons or public opinion. I count on the formation of public councils at state television and radio companies which will ensure mutual links between state television and television viewers. I wish you every success. [Lomakin] Thank you, Vasiliy Grigoriyevich. I hope that we will work together with you because journalists need professional lawyers like never before. Our guest was Vasiliy Grigoriyevich Samokhvalov, head of one of the independent information agencies known as ROSSIYSKOYE PRAVO [Russian Law]. Thank you. [Samokhvalov] All the best.
