In a news conference held in the premises of the government-controlled Sudanese News Agency in Khartoum yesterday, al-Turabi said: "You know I am not a liar. I swear that the NIF, which is called a national front, does not exist as an organization in the regime at present, either secretly or publicly." Answering a question put by AL-HAYAH, he revealed that a reconciliation is being conducted between "the ruling authority and the popular groups." He said that leaders of the Sudanese parties are excluded from this reconciliation, pointing out that "the government always has opened its doors to anyone who joined the salvation efforts to rescue the country from its past predicament." Al-Turabi also revealed that he is making contacts with several quarters before traveling to Afghanistan in a bid to achieve reconciliation among the parties to the conflict in Kabul. He pointed out that among these quarters are the Islamic Salvation Front in Algeria and several European states, including France. Commenting on the expulsion of British Ambassador Peter Streams from Sudan, he said: "A number of Western ambassadors to Khartoum told me that Ambassador Streams used to vehemently attack Sudan in their meetings. And perhaps the government was very patient with him. But it is completely unacceptable for him to insult it to the point of forcing Sudan's guest (Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey) to enter the country by the back door." He went on: "Britain has realized the mistake of its ambassador and that of the archbishop of Canterbury."
