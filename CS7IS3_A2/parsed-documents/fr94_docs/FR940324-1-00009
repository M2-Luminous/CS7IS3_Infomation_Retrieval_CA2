FR940324-1-00009 FR940324-1-00004 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE Bureau of Export Administration 15 CFR Part 777 [Docket No. 930653&hyph;3153] RIN 0694&hyph;AA70 Exports of Certain California Crude Oil AGENCY: Bureau of Export Administration, Commerce. ACTION: Proposed rule with a request for comments. SUMMARY: The Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) is proposing to amend the short supply provisions of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) by revising the restrictions on exports to initially allow the export of up to 25,000 barrels per day of California heavy crude oil having a gravity of 20 degrees API or lower. The changes proposed by this rule are based on the President's October 22, 1992, memorandum to the Secretary of Commerce to modify existing restrictions on the export of certain California heavy crude oil. This notice delineates the actions the Department is taking to implement the President's decision. It also proposes specific regulatory changes implementing those actions and solicits public comments. DATES: Comments must be received by April 25, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments (six copies) should be sent to Bernard Kritzer, Senior Industry Analyst, Office of Foreign Availability, room 1087, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20230. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Bernard Kritzer, Office of Foreign Availability (OFA), Bureau of Export Administration, Telephone: (202) 482&hyph;0074. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Section 777.6(d)(1) of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) restricts exports of crude petroleum, including reconstituted crude petroleum, tar sands and crude shale oil. This rule proposes to amend ยง777.6(d)(1) to permit exports of certain California crude oil pursuant to a Presidential Memorandum of October 22, 1992, 1 in which the President determined that exports of California heavy crude oil having a gravity of 20 degrees API or lower were in the national interest. Before the President authorized this export of crude oil, he made findings and determinations under three statutes: Section 103 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6212(b)); section 28(u) of the Mineral Leasing Act, as amended by the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act of 1973 (30 U.S.C. 185(u)); and provisions of the Export Administration Act, as amended, and to the extent consistent with law, continued in effect through the President's invocation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The Export Administration Act was continued on March 27, 1993, by Public Law 103&hyph;10. The President made findings that exports of California heavy crude oil having a gravity of 20 degrees API or lower: (1) Were in accord with the provisions of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended; 1 The President's memorandum of October 22, 1992, ``Exports of Domestically Produced Heavy Crude Oil'' (3 CFR, 1992 Comp., p. 382). (2) Were consistent with the purposes of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act; and (3) Would not diminish the total quality or quantity of petroleum available to the United States.
