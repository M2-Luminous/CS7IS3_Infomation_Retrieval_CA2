The convoy, which left the Croatian capital Zagreb on Monday morning, was forced to turn back the same day by Serbian forces controlling the bridge at Gradiska, which links Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, said UNHCR spokesman Peter Kessler. The convoy arrived back in Zagreb on Monday night and left again on Tuesday morning. It reached Gradiska again at noon and was undergoing checks, Kessler said, blaming the delay on "bureaucratic difficulties." Bosnian Serbs on Saturday lifted a nine-month siege of Maglaj. The town's population of around 25,000, plus up to 75,000 others in the surrounding enclave, had been forced to rely on air drops for food since October. He said he hoped the convoy would get to Banja Luka, the main town under Serbian control in northern Bosnia, in time to spend the night there before continuing its journey to Maglaj. The convoy is made up of 30 trucks, 10 of them bound for Maglaj, and the rest for Banja Luka, Doboj, to the north, and Zenica in central Bosnia. On Sunday, nine UNHCR trucks loaded with 80 tonnes of food and medicine managed to get into Maglaj without hindrance from Zenica, 70 kilometres (45 miles) to the south. Bosnian Serbs gave the go-ahead the same day for the second now delayed convoy.
