"The international community will have to resort to peaceful and political means to resolve the North Korean nuclear row," said Gorbachev in a press conference in Seoul. He came here to take part in the 2nd World Peace Conference, sponsored by the World Peace Foundation and the Segye Times, both affiliated with the Rev. Mun Son-myong's Unification Church. "There is almost no possibility of the current crisis leading to an armed conflict. Things will get better as time goes by." said Gorbachev. "However, the world shouldn't tolerate any country moving to break international treaties and violating the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty," he said. Meanwhile, Gorbachev, recalling his times as president of the now-defunct Soviet Union, denounced the West, particularly the United States, for "talking much about nuclear arms reduction without taking no practical actions." "I took the initiative to dramatically reduce nuclear weapons and erase them from the Earth by the year 2000. But the West didn't heed my call. They thought my proposal went against their national interests," Gorbachev said. He added that the West seemed to have regarded his initiative as "propaganda from a communist country or a naive approach." Gorbachev warned against "ideologies being linked to political affairs" and the international community should seek a peaceful resolution to armed conflicts by fully taking into account each country's diverse situations. When asked whether he has any channel of contact with North Korea, Gorbachev said "I don't have any. I am not a political figure now but a social worker." "Russia has paid attention to Asian countries including Japan, China and South and North Korea. The attention has been increasing since the collapse of the Soviet Union," he said. Gorbachev is president of the International Foundation for Socio- Economic and Political Studies, better known as the Gorbachev Foundation. He flew into Seoul with his wife Raisa Friday after wrapping up a six-day visit to Taiwan.
