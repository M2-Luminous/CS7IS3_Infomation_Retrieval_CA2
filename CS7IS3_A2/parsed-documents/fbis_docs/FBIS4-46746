But it appears that the main purpose of the visit was something else altogether: to find out how seriously the FRG and the West as a whole are about partnership with Russia. Are they not tending, concealed by declarations of "partnership," to place Russia in the dependent position of a "junior partner" and thereby cement their "victory" in the Cold War? These issues have been the subject of public discussion. In January of this year, during a meeting in Moscow, presidents Yeltsin and Clinton asserted "that relations between Russia and the United States have entered a new stage of mature strategic partnership, mutual benefit and recognition of each other's national interests." However, the overall evolution of relations between Russia and the United States and other Western countries -- most importantly, practical steps in the field of mutual relations -- indicates that the actual state of those relations is very far from a "partnership" as that term is understood in international usage. In fact, the West has undertaken a number of actions -- from the bombing of Serbian positions in Bosnia over Russia's objections, to the humiliating refusal to invite Russia to attend the 50th anniversary of the opening of a "second front" in Europe -- which cannot be interpreted as anything except an attempt to "put Russia in its place." Correspondingly, there is no way that relations between Russia and the West can achieve the balance, the optimum formula, that would calm politicians on both sides and would correspond to their objective needs. And it is unlikely that empty talk about "partnership" will help matters any. What are needed are practical actions that will in fact lead to an equal partnership (if such a thing is possible), or else Russia's relations with the West will continue to be characterized by nervousness and unpredictability. Therefore, so as not to mislead the public and the decision makers, it would be advisable to think about just how justified it is at the present stage to speak of partnership as an accomplished fact in Russia's relations with the West, or whether this is still just a cherished dream that is very far from being a reality. There Is `Partnership,' Then There Is `Partnership' The Americans first began seriously talking about "partnership" as one of the key principles of their foreign policy under President Nixon in the late 1960's. The failure of aggression in Vietnam, the accompanying acute domestic crisis in the United States and disarray in political circles all forced Washington to stop regarding its allies as "junior partners" and attempt to fashion a system of relations with them based on the principles of partnership. Thereupon followed years of intensive efforts to find the most adequate forms of partnership, including active efforts by the Trilateral Commission, which in the 1970's prepared documents on all the main issues in international relations, with consideration for the interests of the United States, Western Europe and Japan, and meetings of the Big Seven countries beginning in1975, though as a rule these took place without a great deal of commotion or public notice. On the whole, one must honestly admit that while the countries of the "socialist commonwealth" were unswervingly heading for the collapse of that commonwealth, in the 1970's and 1980's the Big Seven countries were, on the contrary, moving toward a higher level of cooperation and consolidation. Russia has virtually no experience establishing that kind of relations. Therefore there is little reason to expect that it can immediately, within a few years' time, wade through the mass of obstacles that objectively stand between Russia and partnership with the leading Western states. One will be able to speak of real "partnership" when a solid foundation for it exists in the form of a mutual stake in economic relations and closeness or similarity in the social base and political structure of and cooperation among kindred parties of a democratic, Christian or liberal orientation. When, finally, governing circles have similar or comparable social experience. There is not even a hint of these things in Russia's relations with the West today, and it will take years (if our country develops successfully) for them to begin to appear. The Foundations of a Possible `Partnership' If one were to attempt to assess prospects for a partnership between Russia and the leading Western countries, in particular with the United States, first of all one must acknowledge the marked inequality or asymmetry in the two sides' position. Following the end of the Cold War the United States lost virtually nothing in terms of its international standing. It remains the largest nuclear superpower, its military and political blocs have not collapsed, and it continues to play the role of the largest provider of aid to other countries. The U.S. economy, though experiencing some difficulties, is nevertheless successfully weathering a technotronic era, assuming positions of leadership in virtually every advanced technology. The United States remains a country with one of the highest per capita incomes and well-developed health care, social security and educational systems. The same can be said of the FRG, Great Britain, Japan and other Western countries. Without idealizing their situation, in which problems do exist, one must nevertheless admit that the West is a wealthy and developed society with good prospects for the 21st century. Russia comes up looking badly by comparison. The USSR has collapsed, but virtually no one except the elites of the new republics gained by that, with the possible exception of the Baltic countries. As the largest country in the former Soviet Union, Russia inherited its military status and its role as a great power. But its economy is in deep crisis, a majority of the population is barely making ends meet, and over 35 percent of the population (according to various estimates) are living on the verge of poverty. The country is characterized by instability, and institutions of government are fighting among themselves, unable to propose either a socioeconomic future that is acceptable to the majority or, at the very least, a tolerable existence. The center and the regions are in a state of constant competition, and ethnic minorities are rebelling. A country that has the potential to be the richest in the world is in a state of semi-collapse. It is clear that in this situation there is only one point for Russia to a "partnership" with the West: obtaining a source of funding, technology and know-how to rescue its economy from crisis. Consequently, from the very start the West regards it as a burden on the West's quite frankly somewhat limited available resources, because the United States, Germany and other seemingly "rich" countries themselves require loans and credits to maintain production. Even prosperous Germany is having increasing difficulty coming up with foreign aid funds as it spends approximately $100 billion annually on reconstruction of the former GDR. What does Russia have to offer in exchange? Vague promises of future income from Russian mineral resources? Equally vague promises to open up its capital investment market to foreign corporations? It is hard to imagine that this is an adequate attraction to the West, which is very well aware that even Russian entrepreneurs, though secretly and illegally, are taking their own capital out of the country, and that with current taxes and laws and the reign of the bureaucracy only a madman would risk investing his own money. These concerns increase in proportion to Russia's internal instability: what if Zhirinovskiy comes to power? Or the communists? What then? The only thing that Russia can offer as an adequate contribution to a "partnership" is cooperation in the area of arms control and resolution of international crises. In that regard one must admit that the real partnership that emerged in relations between the USSR and the United States in the course of profound changes in the international arena (this "partnership" was first mentioned by President Bush during a meeting with CPSU Central Committee General Secretary M. S. Gorbachev in Malta in December 1989) could serve as a serious foundation upon which both powers could build broader and more lasting partnership relations. Subsequently events took their course: at the end of 1991 the Soviet Union collapsed, and the United States was skeptical of Russia's attempts to replace it as a "partner." This did not prevent the United States from signing the START II Treaty with Russia. But that was most likely due to inertia from previous years, because the treaty left out Ukraine, Belorussia and Kazakhstan, which were also nuclear heirs of the USSR. As for crises and examples of cooperation with regard to resolving them, the Americans are increasingly disinclined to trust the Russian Government, which is definitely not always prepared to risk unpopular decisions (for example, supporting the West's anti-Serbian course in Yugoslavia) and at times is incapable of defining a given region's degree of importance to Russia. "Partnership" between Russia and the West, if it were actually to begin functioning now, would most likely mean a tremendous inequality between the partners, an inequality that would become increasingly difficult to correct with the passage of time. A weak Russia that has lost its traditional image and has an inefficient economy cannot be an equal partner for the United States or the European Union. It will continue to ask for loans and extension of its debt repayment schedule. Gradually there will emerge (or perhaps already has emerged) between it and the West a dense network of dependency that will ensnare the country, its resources, its policy and even its culture. That is what must be avoided at all costs. We must resolutely focus primarily on fixing the economy, without pinning any particular hopes on anyone curing our ills for us. We should be oriented toward a partnership with the West, but only in some distant future. Entering into one now would be to risk the free future of our nation. The Convergence Has Begun Despite all these seemingly obvious facts, the Russian Government has set itself the task of rapidly building "partnership" relations with the West. As a rule, the response it gets consists of polite ambiguities, vague sentiments and, at the same time, some rather harsh demands. Moreover, those demands apply to the realms of politics, economics, security and even, in a number of cases, internal affairs. Very often those demands give absolutely no consideration to Russia's specific circumstances, and can even take the form of dictates. One can imagine that Western politicians have too thoroughly perceived the "smiling diplomacy" of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs as evidence of Russia's willingness, like a wayward schoolboy, to listen to lectures and commentary in hopes of some unspecified reward in the future. Even in a matter in which Russians could well take pride -- the overthrow of the communist regime -- there has been the usual expression of gratitude to the West for its "energetic efforts," even though it is a well-known fact that after the end of the war in Vietnam the West renounced "crusades" and was prepared to cooperate with the communist Soviet Union or China, if that was in line with its own needs. The initial and quite naive attempts to depict Russia as virtually a ready-made "partner" for the West have given rise to a very incorrect reaction there. There people often forget that Russia, despite all its internal weakness, was and still remains a great power. There people have dared to flagrantly interfere in Russia's internal affairs in the Baltic countries and in Russia's relations with the CIS countries. There people have deemed it possible to reproach Russians over Zhirinovskiy both publicly and on an official level in a way that would be unthinkable if the subject were any Western politician (for example, publicly ridicule of the eccentric American millionaire Ross Perot during the presidential campaign). Western dictates have taken particularly ugly forms in the area of Russian economic reforms. Threatened with the cutoff of loans or refusal to extend debt repayment, Ye. Gaydar's government was forced to take measures that had not been prepared, worked out in detail, carefully considered or discussed in public. Of course, Gaydar was not just a passive observer; he, too, had a burning desire to create a market economy in Russia as quickly as possible. But one would like to think that he did realize how many objective social, political and cultural obstacles there were to accomplishing that. And he probably realized that without painstaking preparatory work that could provide at least a minimal political base for reforms they should not be adopted. There are plenty of examples of Western high-handedness in dealings with Russia. They include the cancelled rocket engine deal between Russia and India, attempts to restrict the Russian arms trade, slowness in repealing formal bans and restrictions on trade, an obvious unwillingness to accept Russia as a member of the Council of Europe, and many more. Among the latest acts of a hostile nature toward Russia one could cite the infamous NATO plan called "Partnership for Peace" and the bombing of Serbian positions in Bosnia carried out by NATO aircraft. One gets the impression that the nascent convergence between Russia and the West, in which "smiling diplomacy" played such a visible role during the first stage, has produced some not very positive results. The foundation without which partnership is impossible -- mutual respect for each side's legitimate interests -- has not been laid down. The West was happy to believe A. Kozyrev when he claimed that Russia does not have any special, "private" interests, and concluded that it could impose its own "values" and "ideals" on Russia as a guide to understanding of what Russia should do in the international arena. These thoughts are brought to mind by the bombing of Serbian positions in Bosnia. It should be noted that on the whole the NATO "initiative," which arbitrarily declares former Yugoslavia a zone under its "responsibility" (unaligned Yugoslavia never was such) and offers its services to the U.N. as a "peacemaker," evokes the strongest reservations. Simple logic says that this military and political bloc, a creation of the Cold War, should follow the Warsaw Pact's example and dissolve itself, as there is no real threat of a major war in Europe. U.N. forces are fully capable of monitoring the conflicts that do occur in Europe, such as the Yugoslavian conflict, and there is no need to assemble huge air armadas to resolve them. The very idea that air strikes could be used to put an end to a highly complex ethnic conflict with a tragic history is simply beneath serious politicians. Nevertheless, despite the vigorous objections of Russia, which has its own interests in the region, the NATO air strikes were carried out. In effect Russia's interests were publicly ignored, and no one even remembered to consult her president. All the doubts that have been expressed about "partnership" with the West should not be interpreted as a rejection of its value for the international system in general and for Russia in particular. "Partnership" has become a fairly good form of mutual relations between groups of countries and ensures that balance is maintained between their interests. Russia also needs "partnership," but only the kind of partnership in which it respects other countries' legitimate interests without any harm to its own legitimate interests. Then Russia's entry into the world community would not destabilize that community, but rather would markedly strengthen it. However, in order to achieve that level of relations both Russia and the United States, as well as all of our country's other possible partners, still have a long road to travel. And that road begins in Russia, not in the West. It is only possible to build partnership relations with other countries if we have a healthy economy, a transparent process for the development of foreign policy, a strong system of democratic institutions and a clear and unambiguous image of our country in the rest of the world.
