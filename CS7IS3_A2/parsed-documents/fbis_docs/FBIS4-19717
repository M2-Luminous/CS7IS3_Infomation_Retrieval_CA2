The suspense remains, pending the 4 May decisive vote by the European Parliament (EP) on the expansion of the Union to Sweden, Finland, Austria, and Norway. The penultimate EP session before the elections next June demonstrated the degree to which the deputies are divided, not so much on the new memberships as on the material conditions for expansion. With a touch of exasperation in some cases.... "We have had to swallow so much that we are bordering on indigestion," French Deputy Yves Galland complained yesterday. Five times over the past two years, the EP has demanded institutional changes ensuring the smooth running of a 16-member Union. After refusing these changes, the Twelve concluded the negotiations, further complicating the decisionmaking procedures. For many deputies, the setback will be fatal to the Union. Opportunity or Threat? On Tuesday, the four candidate countries came to Strasbourg to defend their cause, appropriately expounding on the subjects of democracy, the parliamentary system, and the European commitment. Although Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland did not appear in the position of a supplicant, her colleagues were clearer. "Let us seize this historic opportunity," Finnish Foreign Trade Minister Salolainen urged. "A rejection of the agreements would be likely to cast doubt on the whole process of European building." "What do you stand to gain from joining a Europe which, from the start, will demonstrate its complete impotence?" Belgium's Fernand Herman replied. "The European Union (EU) is heading for disaster for lack of institutional change," French Christian Democrat Jean-Louis Bourlanges warned. "And that can only get worse." Some deputies want to purely and simply reject the agreements. Others, like Mr. Bourlanges and Raymonde Dury, are arguing for the postponement of the vote until the year end. A period in which to negotiate new institutional progress for the EU. Should there be a simple six-month delay, or a postponement of two to three years? Opinions differ. "The effect of a postponement on public opinion in our countries would be disastrous," the candidates retorted. "You would be taking a considerable risk. If you halt the impetus, nobody can predict the future. The train is starting now," Austrian Vice Chancellor Erhard Busek emphasized. The 4 May vote will be very tricky in any case. The advocates of expansion must obtain 260 votes out of 518. The latest counts in Strasbourg yesterday gave a majority in favor of the four treaties. But the majority is a prey to circumstances, in view of the 90 deputies who deserted Strasbourg as soon as they were elected five years ago, in view of those absent because of election campaigns, opponents, and abstentions. In any case, any shortfall will benefit the "no" vote. Between now and then, the EP will be subjected to all kinds of pressure. The Germans have proved most effective at this little game. Virtually all German deputies, of all groups, will vote in favor of membership. "This is a fascination for a MittelEuropa of which Berlin will be the center," according to a French Socialist. The Belgians, however, will vote mainly against the agreements. For oppositionists, the choice is Cornelian. Should they approve of the memberships when they threaten the smooth running or even the EU survival? Or should the expansion be rejected in order to secure a EU strengthening, at the risk of seeming to choose isolation? Yesterday, it was a disillusioned Jacques Delors who called on the deputies to approve the agreements, remarking that the Maastricht Treaty started a drift by Europe which must be combated. The political consequences of 4 May will be great. By approving texts which run counter to its previous demands, Parliament will lose a new piece of its credibility. And it is likely to be regarded as no more than a "rubber stamp" by the governments.... If it rejects them, it will lay the foundation for a new crisis.
