Wu Yi, Chinese minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation [MOFTEC], told a press conference that last year China approved 83,265 foreign-funded projects, with a total contractual value standing at 110.852 billion U.S. dollars. The actual amount of foreign investment used in the period was 25.759 billion U.S. dollars. The figures were 70 percent, 90 percent and 134 percent, respectively, more than in 1992. By the end of last year, Wu said, China had accumulatively approved over 174,000 foreign-funded projects with the pledged and actually used foreign investment topping 217.216 billion and over 60 billion U.S. dollars, respectively. According to Wu, the investment came from more than 100 countries and areas, and Hong Kong, Macao, Japan and the United States were among major sources. Although the lion's share of the foreign investment still flowed to coastal areas, the growth rate of foreign investment in land- locked regions last year surpassed that in coastal areas. The investment was concentrated in such fields as energy, light industry, electronics, machinery, textiles, garments, metallurgy, building materials and real estate. Wu said that one of the outstanding characteristics of the foreign investment in China last year was that many multinational corporations have come to invest in China, and the scope of investment and the scale of projects have expanded continuously. Last year, Wu said, the average contracted foreign investment per foreign-funded project reached 1.33 million U.S. dollars, an increase of 12.9 percent over the previous year. She said that the volume of exports and imports from foreign- funded enterprises stood at 67 billion U.S. dollars-worth, accounting for over one third of the nation's total, with exports at 25.24 billion-worth and imports at 41.83 billion U.S. dollars-worth, increases of 45.4 percent and 58.5 percent over 1992, respectively. After deducting costs of equipment imports employed as investment, imports by foreign-funded enterprises stood at 25.2 billion U.S. dollars-worth, thus exports and imports were roughly balanced, she said. Moreover, Wu added, in the first 11 months of last year foreign exchange sold and brought in by foreign-invested companies reached 8.72 billion and 3.56 billion U.S. dollars, respectively, with the net amount of foreign exchange taken out reaching 5.16 billion U.S. dollars. Meanwhile, China signed loan agreements with foreign governments for 2.01 billion U.S. dollars, and the actual amount it used was 2.89 billion U.S. dollars, 11.2 percent more than in 1992.
