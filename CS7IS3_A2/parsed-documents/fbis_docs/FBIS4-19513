However, in anticipation of further news from Gorazde, the beginning of the debate was postponed to the late afternoon. Results were not available until the copy deadline of this edition. Before the beginning of the deliberations, in which EU mediator Lord Owen also participated, FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said that political and psychological pressure on the Serbs has to be increased. Gorazde has "become a symbol that must show whether they (the Serbs -- FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU editor's note) are really prepared to give in." Kinkel admitted that there are also voices in the EU circle that want to consider at least the withdrawal of the UN blue helmets from Bosnia, while others, like Greek Foreign Minister Theodhoros Papoulias, recommend the lifting of the sanctions that were imposed against Serbia and Montenegro by the UN Security Council. Kinkel had canceled on his own initiative the planned "presentation" of Hans Koschnick, EU administrator designate for the City of Mostar, in the EU Council of Ministers. Kinkel said that he had realized that no time would be left for Koschnick's presentation because of the topical problems. During their meeting in Ioannina, the 12 had already accepted the former mayor of Bremen for the later establishment of a Serbian-Bosnian administration in Mostar at the proposal of Germany. Originally, the debate on the situation in Gorazde should have started during the ministers' lunch. However, instead, the situation in Algeria was discussed. Here possible effects of an increase in the Islamic fundamentalists' power on the neighboring countries had played a role, Kinkel said. EU Commission President Jacques Delors presented a report on possible steps for Algeria's economic support.
