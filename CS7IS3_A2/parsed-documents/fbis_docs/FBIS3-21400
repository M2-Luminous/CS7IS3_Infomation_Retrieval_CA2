Perhaps the most prominent development, which appeared on 24 February, was Hamas' admission of responsibility by its military wing--the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam battalions--for the murder of DFLP member Yusuf 'Abu-Lafi on 15 February. The secretary general of the Islamic Jihad Movement, Dr. Fathi al-Shaqqaqi, told AL-HAYAH that this development "could negatively influence the alliance's continuation." He added: "Continued escalation between the two groups could affect the alliance but will not destroy it. As for the matter of killing Abu-Lafi, that is most serious. Therefore, we have agreed that it is a private matter among ourselves." The case of Abu-Lafi's murder, after having been abducted for three days, increased tension at the meeting of the 10 factions' leaders at the beginning of this week, although Hamas did not claim responsibility for the murder during that meeting. It asked that it be referred to the leadership to make a final decision. However, the DFLP stated that Hamas was responsible, pointing out that the posters hanging in the streets of Khan Yunis were signed by Hamas. This led to tension in the meeting, and a committee was formed, chaired by Talal Naji, a leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC] (led by Ahmad Jibril). Each faction is to submit an official report, in which it will clearly state its views. An internal memorandum will be issued with the investigation's results. Hamas' representative in Damascus, Abu-Muhammad Mustafa, confirmed to AL-HAYAH that Hamas was responsible for Abu-Lafi's death, "because he was an agent of the Israeli occupation forces. He was killed after his dealings with them were confirmed." He stated that he had personally given Mr. Naji a detailed report "exposing Abu-Lafi's activities. A video cassette accompanied the report with pictures confirming our opinion, stressing that he deserved to die." DFLP sources, for their part, told AL-HAYAH that "Abu-Lafi's blood will not be shed in vain. The hands of Red Star battalions (the front's military wing) will reach out for those who committed this crime." The sources stated: "Abu-Lafi was a noble fighter. Representatives from the National Action Committee and prominent national figures, except for Hamas representatives, participated in his funeral." The sources added: "No one has the right to judge people." Abu-Muhammad Mustafa replied vehemently to the accusations that Hamas bears responsibility for hindering the course of the alliance. He stressed to AL-HAYAH that the movement was not backing away from the step it had taken. The first step back must be taken by them (the DFLP)." Mustafa added that Hamas refuses to enter a unified slate with the DFLP in future professional and medical elections, "because of obstacles that would prevent that. First, there is the mistrust between the factions in the occupied territories, as a result of the DFLP's claiming credit for four military operations that we carried out, and their demands for more seats than the votes they won." He pointed out that, in the Engineers Union elections in the Gaza Strip, the DFLP demanded more votes than they had, and made that a condition before entering a unified slate with Hamas. "We refused to give them more than they won. For their part, they refused to enter any future slate. They lost and did not win any seats; we won six seats." The Hamas representative in Damascus added that this matter was nearly repeated in the Doctors' Union elections. "Certain DFLP and PFLP cadres voted for Fatah, rejecting the alliance with us. Some others were reluctant, and some were lightweights. As a result, we entered with the Islamic Jihad in a bloc. The PFLP and the DFLP were in a bloc, and Fatah was allied with independents. 'Arafat's group won 11 seats, and we lost." Abu-Muhammad indicated that the DFLP and the PFLP had demanded more than their share. "The proof is that they won only 13 percent of the vote compared to our 33 percent. Furthermore, the largest number of votes went to Muhammad al-'Akluk, Hamas' candidate, who won 370 votes, compared to 157 votes for the PFLP candidate, Rabbah Mahna'. The two fronts bear responsibility for giving in to Fatah because of factionalism. This is one of the reasons for the mistrust." Regarding the DFLP's accusing Hamas of fationalism for not joining with it in a single slate in the Islamic University elections, Abu-Muhammad Mustafa stressed that "there was no reason for us to join in a unified slate, because it was completely decided for us, just like their position in Bayt Sahur (Gaza) in the Orthodox Club. Consequently, any success for us or for them was success for the alliance. There was no reason for us to be on a single slate." Regarding the question of forming the National and Islamic Command for the Intifadah, Abu-Muhammad stated that Hamas rejects forming this command at the present time. He said: "To form a command like this, everyone must be equal in effective military action at home. However, Hamas carries out all the military action and bears all the daily consequences alone. Forming a command will never suit us, so long as our demand--that the standing in the alliance and command be in comparison to the size of each faction and its weight--is rejected. There must be equality in military fighting, so that our doubts are not confirmed that they want to profit from our efforts, Hamas' efforts." He indicated that there was the possibility of continuing present coordination on the political level, since political action was different from military and security action, and because "forming the unified command would threaten our security. It would be easy to strike at us, especially after a security agreement is signed between the PLO and Israel." In response to the DFLP's charge that Hamas is the faction that is backing away from the alliance, Abu-Muhammad said: "They are the ones who began to back away. When we agreed to form a national, Islamic alliance, they backed away from it, deleting the word `Islamic.' When they were asked for the reason, they said that this was their right." He added that the second retreat was when they did not commit themselves to the alliance's political program agreed to on 9 October 1993. He said that "so long as they have not committed themselves to everything, it is our right not to be obligated when we believe that our interests would be damaged, because they want to hide behind Hamas. They don't want confrontation. This is another indication of mistrust." With regard to the charge that Hamas has backed away from holding popular conferences, Abu-Muhammad Mustafa said: "We have not backed away from this, not for a moment. We understand the conferences to be political mobilization and instigation and nothing more. If they want elections, then let the DFLP and the PFLP be wherever possible in Syria and Lebanon."
