On the way from Zagreb to Sarajevo, the foreign minister and his entourage, together with the whole military region's commander in chief and his many associates, were transported by a fast passenger carrier. On the way back, we were in the hold of a cargo plane together with many containers, and French and British UN soldiers. Here, we had the opportunity to interview Jeszenszky. [Kobanyai] Having visited Sarajevo, you have now been to all three warring south Slav capitals. Do you now have a clear picture? [Jeszenszky] Since the outbreak of the south Slav war, the intention of Hungarian foreign politics has been clear and unaltered: To keep the conflict away from our country and to preserve our good-neighborly relations with the old and new states. This is not easy, although, at the negotiating tables, the hatred that flared up in such a barbaric way between the nations cannot be perceived, in fact, all sides keep expressing their willingness for compromise. The situation is made more complicated by the fact that, in addition to being neighbors, a significant Hungarian minority is also living in the countries in question and we have to represent their interests and alleviate their serious problems caused by the war. An ethnically based explosion makes people suspicious of all national minority organizations or demands. For example, after tough negotiations with the Croatian side, we have not even been able to achieve that they define such administrative boundaries in the areas in Baranja that still belongs to them through which the Hungarian minority can have a say in local politics. The general cultural agreement that has now been signed will provide a chance for the attitude that is also the basis of political views to change. Rather than Jelacic [Croatian general, led army against Hungary in 1848], the Zrinyi brothers [16th-17th century Croatian and Hungary family] should be symbols of our common past. Our intentions to keep ourselves out of conflicts and to prevent further fragmentation have gained respect for our country. I and Austrian Foreign Minister Mock are the ones who have closely followed the conflict from its beginning, and we both have tried to channel the events toward peaceful solutions. Without much success, as can be seen. However, we do not have the means for it, either. However logical it may seem because of the neighborhood, Central European experiences, and the familiarity with sensitivities, the role of mediator cannot be accepted because we do not have any forces of pressure or counter-forces behind us that could be used for achieving compromises. The fact that the Bosnian and Croatian sides are requesting peacekeeping forces from us demonstrates the respect we have in the region. At the moment, this is contrary to our doctrine, namely we cannot participate in the armed conflicts of neighboring countries, not even as peacemaking forces. However, a number of times, I have offered Budapest for the peace negotiations that keep changing site. This site could offer a better and more authentic atmosphere due to its geographical and intellectual properties. After my visit to Sarajevo, I tend to think that these negotiations should be conducted in the Bosnian capital. This barren scenery could awaken the negotiating sides to the fact that the suffering of the innocent population cannot be increased anymore and it would compel them to find a peaceful solution, whatever it takes. Hungary is, by all means, interested in peace. The tensions that would be relieved by peace could also fill us with progressive impulses -- I am thinking of the situation of the Hungarian minorities living outside our borders. It would also have more tangible positive effects, namely economic ones. I emphasized, at my talks in both Belgrade and Sarajevo, that, due to our geographic situation, we would like to play a decisive role in restoration. This includes reconstruction and longer term work. We would like to get access to new, or rather, old markets in the south Slav areas. It can also be expected that the new states formed from the former Yugoslavia will not trade with each other for a while for emotional reasons. With the major restructuring in Eastern and Central Europe, we are also having market problems, therefore, a mutual interest exists here. However, how could we talk about concrete facts before a peaceful settlement is in place, when we have not even been able to achieve that we could directly present the much suffered Hungarians in Sarajevo with a few crates of aid? [Kobanyai] What is the "message" of the south Slav conflict, the Sarajevo syndrome, for Europe? [Jeszenszky] At the beginning of the century, people in this region moved around and communicated with each other freely. They did not hate each other. This was the work of a handful of intelligentsia whose effect increased in certain conflict situations. The artificial states created by the peace treaties following World War I did not prove viable. The effects of the tragedy that was sown at that time can still be felt. The "victorious" countries that dictated the peace have also failed in the long run. They have also become dependent. All this is proved by the south Slav conflict. It is not natural to force people with different cultures and traditions to live together. At the same time, small, ethnically homogeneous countries are also unviable both from a security and an economic point of view. As early as in the middle ages, sections of cities, cities, and city alliances of different ethnic groups coexisted. They fulfilled supplementary functions and organically created the regulatory systems of their coexistence. However, freely chosen integration cannot work without an external force coming from above. The European Community has to fulfill the former role of Vienna. The force that partially failed in Sarajevo -- and this is one of the reasons that everything that is happening there is pointing beyond itself. Up to now, it has only made rather tame steps to curb the bloodshed. At the same time, it also has to be seen that events would have taken an even more tragic turn without it. Therefore, now, the European thought, the European Community as an integrating and conflict-solving force is also being tested. In the European integration, the Scandinavian and the Benelux countries are also maintaining their historically intimate relations and their coordinating and conflict preventing mechanisms. I see the Central European countries -- which are linked together with thousands of historical cords, including the injuries suffered from each other -- catching up with the European Union in units like these. Austria, Slovenia, and Hungary are on this road, and the Croatians also wish to join this model, this is one of the reasons it is important for them to get out of the Balkans war, even through compromises. I very much hope that the idea of the Visegrad group will not be lost, either, the positive changes in Slovakia give hope for this. I see Eastern Central Europe's -- including Hungary's -- future in this integration of rapprochement that preserves the individual characteristics. I believe in this because it is not possible to do what I am doing without some kind of image of the future.
