FBIS4-36955 "drnes115_m_94007" FBIS-NES-94-115 Daily Report 13 Jun 1994 JORDAN Daily on `Deteriorating' Ties With Syria Daily on `Deteriorating' Ties With Syria JN1406164194 Amman AL-MAJD in Arabic 13 Jun 94 pp 1, 5 JN1406164194 Amman AL-MAJD Arabic BFN [Text] Within a few days, the priorities of Jordan's policies have turned upside down. The Jordanian-Israeli track of the negotiations has moved quickly in both the political and economic directions and Dr. Fayiz al-Tarawinah, head of the Jordanian delegation, and Elyaqim Rubinstein, head of the Israeli delegation, have voiced their full satisfaction with achievements made during the first hours of the negotiations. Throughout last week, the Israeli and international media were preoccupied with disseminating reports that high-level Jordanian-Israeli meetings took place in London prior to the Washington negotiations and cleared the way for rapid progress and movement of the talks to al-'Aqabah and Elat. As a result, Jordanian-Syrian relations were strained after they were prepared only two weeks ago to reach a high level of coordination and after the Husayn-al-Asad summit decided in Damascus last month to revive the joint Syrian-Jordanian committee that was suspended for a long time due to the two countries' differences over the Gulf war. For the first time in three years, the Jordanian and Syrian press exchanged polemics in public. The Syrian newspaper TISHRIN commented on an article published in the Jordanian newspaper AL-RA'Y calling for the revival of the Jordanian-Israeli track of negotiations without waiting for the other Arab parties. The Syrian press also implicitly replied to statements that the London-based AL-HAYAT newspaper attributed to the Jordanian prime minister, who quickly denied these statements, which included Jordan's reservation on a Syrian proposal for unity between the two countries. The major phenomenon of the deteriorating Jordanian-Syrian relations is Syria's decision to cancel the visit, which Syrian Prime Minister Mahmud al-Zu'bi was to pay to Amman at the head of a high-level political and economic delegation, including Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar'. The Syrians explained that Jordan, which is currently holding economic negotiations with Israel and the United States within the framework of the tripartite development committee, may turn into a bridge for normalizing relations between Syria and Israel when it concludes economic agreements with Syria. Moreover, any dealing with Israel will prevent integration with Syria, especially since its negotiations with Israel have not yet resulted in peace. Therefore, Jordan's relations, which are deteriorating with Saudi Arabia and most Gulf states, which are weakening with Iraq, and which are fluctuating with the PLO, have also deteriorated with Syria and Lebanon due to Jordan's openness toward Israel.
