The 70-year-old ayatollah was first taken to the late Grand Ayatollah Golpayegani Hospital in the holy city of Qom after complaining of chest pain and headache during a visit to Mofid University in the city Tuesday night. Mas'ud Musavi, the son of the former chief justice, said that his father's left arm and leg have been paralyzed as a result of apoplexy. The doctors treating Ayatollah Ardebili at Tehran's Khatem ol- Anbia hospital, where the ayatollah was later taken, said they expect the ayatollah to fully recover in a week. Talking to reporters, Ayatollah Musavi-Ardebili said he was feeling well. Ayatollah Ardebili, also a substitute Friday prayer leader of Tehran, is the founder and chancellor of Mofid University. He also teaches at the Qom theological school. It is the second time the ayatollah has suffered a stroke. He first fell ill nearly two years ago. Since the victory of the 1979 Islamic revolution, Ayatollah Ardebili has served as a member of the Revolutionary Council, prosecutor general, head of the High Judicial Council and chief justice.
