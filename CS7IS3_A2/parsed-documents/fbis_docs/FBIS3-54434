His visit marked the beginning of a new stage in Iran's diplomatic mediation effort to establish peace between Azerbaijan and Armenia. President Levon Ter-Petrosyan and the Armenian foreign minister received Banki in Yerevan. He conveyed President Hashemi-Rafsanjani and Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati's messages to the Armenian officials. They explained the Islamic Republic of Iran's position on regional issues, particularly on the clashes between Azerbaijan and Armenia, and reemphasized Iran's hope that a political solution will be found to the problem. Banki later left Yerevan for Baku to hold talks with Azerbaijani officials. He met President Aliyev and the Azerbaijani foreign minister and briefed them on his talks in Yerevan and the latest visit of Ambassador Vladimir Kazimirov, President Boris Yeltsin's special envoy on Karabakh, to Tehran. Banki's talks in Yerevan and Baku indicate Iran's wish to contribute to the effort to find a political solution to the war between Azerbaijan and Armenia. [10-second break in transmission] The war has resulted in the occupation of a large part of Azerbaijan's territory. The fighting has harmed the humanitarian forces and resources in other fields on the two sides. And it has put economic, political, and social pressures on Azerbaijan and Armenia. These fields should have helped Azerbaijan and Armenia to strengthen their independence and complete their restructuring. Under the existing conditions, the war must immediately end before it assumes an international nature. The two countries' military forces must withdraw to their recognized borders in accordance with agreements, including that which was signed in Tehran in 1993. Azerbaijan and Armenia must hold talks to resolve their disputes. That was the objective behind Banki's visit to Baku and Yerevan. Iran will maintain its mediation effort to realize that objective.
