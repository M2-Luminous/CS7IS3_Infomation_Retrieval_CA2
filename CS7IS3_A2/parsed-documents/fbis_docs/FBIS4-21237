Wherever it happens to land, you could open a drug case.'' Per Kanding, chief of the national police force's mobile squad, believes that too little is being done to counter the growing drug problem. ``Many small police districts are not doing enough in drug cases. They do not have the resources. After all, the drug trade is not a crime that is reported and, as a result, drug cases are often put on the back burner in favor of crimes that are reported,'' Kanding said. He believes there must be a reprioritizing of police resources if we are really interested in doing something in this area. He is supported in this by Justice Minister Erling Olsen (Social Democrat). ``The police will not get more resources, but those we have must be used differently. I would like to see the effort against organized crime--including drug crimes--be strengthened. Consequently, some policemen must accept being shifted to other duties.'' He did not wish to reveal what jobs the police would no longer do, but he was certain enough police could be transferred. Yesterday the United Nations published its annual report for 1993. It revealed that the global drug trade was becoming more extensive and more aggressive. In particular, Denmark must protect itself from drugs being brought in by way of the chaotic countries of East Europe.
