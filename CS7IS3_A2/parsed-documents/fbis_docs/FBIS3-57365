The same source has made it known that the most probable destination for the Duma is in southeast Moscow, in the building of Moscow's Academy of Management. Incidentally, this option was discussed during the meeting between President Yeltsin and Speaker Rybkin last week after Mr. Rybkin came in for criticism from the leaders of Duma factions for his excessive pliancy.
