As it will be, so will be the Armed Forces, and the course of reforms depends most of all on it. What are the officer cadres like today? They represent more than 100 nationalities and about 80 percent are Russian. About 90 percent have a higher military or specialized military education. More than 28 percent of the officers have served in their positions for less than a year. In comparison with the beginning of last year, the number of officers in the Russian Armed Forces has declined by almost 8 percent, and the strength level of the Army and Navy was 85 percent of the required number of officer cadres (all figures were as of the beginning of 1994). A major problem for the Army was the mass discharge of young officers up to 30 years of age. More than 95,000 of them left the Armed Forces in 1990-1993 becuase of the disorder and the loss of prestige in the service. People in this blossoming age accounted for one-third of those discharged last year and more than half in the Airborne Troops. About 5,000 people are at the disposal of commanding officers, commanders of different ranks--sometimes for three to six months. Through the efforts, by no means insignificant, of the Main Directorate for the Training and Distribution of Cadres [GUPiRK] and local personnel agencies, it was possible to stop the unplanned discharge of more than 20,000 people, and there was a reduction of the number of officers going to sovereign states. By the way, of the more than 13,000 who left last year for the near abroad, [many] were young people who, as everyone knows, are inclined to heed their emotions. Many, not being able to reach the desired place, as they say, are besieging the reception room of the Ministry of Defense of Russia and the GUPiRK with requests that they be allowed to return. As a rule, such people are not accepted, with the possible exception of those who finish school not so long ago, provided that they are not motivated by mercantile considerations. There is still one other painful problem, the discharge of officers who have reached the maximum age and who have a right to a pension. Here last year's plan was fulfilled at 81 percent, in part because the discharge of this category is more than made up for locally by the discharge of young officers. Even of the 1,400 officers sent to other ministries and departments, more than half are junior officers who turned out to be "superfluous" despite the condition of being under strength. As of today, there are about 10,000 officers who have reached the maximum age, and about 6 percent of them have "outgrown" the limit by five years or more. If the plan for discharges is not fulfilled, then by the end of the year, in the opinion of Col.-Gen. Yevgeniy Vysotskiy, chief of the GUPiRK, almost another 12,000 will be added to the present 10,000. Of course it is necessary to maintain experienced cadres, but without thereby forgetting about the prospects of young officers. The condition of being under strength is partially being compensated by women--there are more than 1,500 of them in officer positions, mostly medical personnel and translators. A new source of manpower acquisition is the voluntary service of reserve officers under contract. Last year there were just 820 such volunteers, mostly specialists from the Ground Forces. Apparently a minor help in the situation will be the call-up of 15,000 reserve officers in accordance with a justified edict of the president of the Russian Federation. Even military educational institutions as a basic source of manpower acquisition can hardly fill one-fourth of the existing needs. The enumerated problems can in part be explained by the not always smooth introduction into operation of individual statutes and articles of new laws on military questions, organizational and personnel measures, the reduction of the numerical strength of the forces, and the decline in the prestige of the individual in service. But there are also shortcomings within the Army. Many officers are dismissed from positions, primarily command and staff positions. Last year 26 commanders of brigades, regiments, and ships first rank were removed. In a number of cases, the removal took place less than a year after appointment. The reason clearly lies in the low quality of the selection process. Hence the significant costs--a worthy candidate who is not accepted, undermining of the faith of subordinates in their commander, and a worsening of results as well as expenditures in connection with the move to a new place of service and so on. It is also reasonable to seek the reason for this phenomenon in the existing certification procedures. They were established back in 1977 and refined somewhat in 1985, but, in the opinion of the leadership of the GUPiRK, they have become obsolete. Moreover the simultaneous one-time certification of all officers will inevitably lead to elements of formalism. Work is being done to prepare new guidance on the certification of officer personnel. It will be announced by order of the minister of defense, but after the putting into effect of the Statute on the Order of the Performance of Military Service, which includes 68 articles and 8 chapters. The draft of this document has been submitted to the Government of the Russian Federation and it will also be introduced to the Duma for discussion. Despite some expenditures and difficulties, the officer corps of the Russian Federation is gradually acquiring more definite contours. A normative-legal base has been established in principle, and the first stage in the transition to a contract system has had a positive influence on the quality of the officers. In a number of cases, it was possible to eliminate "ballast" and the system of military education that was disrupted with the collapse of the USSR has been fully restored. The second stage of its reform has begun and a list of specialties for which there is training in institutes of higher education of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation has been refined and put into effect. Still, Col.-Gen. Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the General Staff, calls the situation with respect to military cadres complex and ambiguous, one that requires timely and balanced actions. Among the directions specified for work with cadres in the longer term is the raising of professionalism, the improvement of the system for manpower acquisition and training of officers, and their social protection. But perhaps the main thing is the preservation of the officer corps, without which, I repeat, there is no Army.
