At least 100 such accidents occur in Russia annually and the number is expected to increase. The key parameters of the thermal anomalies (_D_T[.sub]R[/], S) arising with escape of the product from a pipeline and ambient inhomogeneities (_D_T[.sub]back[/]) were studied in key sectors of the Ural-Siberian gas pipeline during summer, autumn and winter under different meteorological conditions (clear, cloudy, rain, snow) with simulation of leakage of the product into the atmosphere, in the ground at different depths, into snow and into the ground beneath snow. Observations were made at altitudes 0.05...0.2 km in the spectral range 8-14 ï¿½m with registry by a specially developed helicopter-borne thermal imager, whose principal technical specifications were optimized, outfitted with a device for measuring the difference _D_T[.sub]R[/]. The behavior of these parameters as a function of many other variables (including helicopter speed and altitude) was ascertained. For example, the maximum level of background radiation temperature fluctuations _D_T[.sub]back[/] is dependent on season and prevailing meteorological conditions: 3 K (summer, daytime, clear), 1 K (summer, daytime, cloudy), 2 K (winter, daytime, clear), 0.5 K (winter, daytime, cloudy). Such measurements are illustrated in the example of several thermal anomalies arising during real leaks into snow-covered ground. Figure 1; references 2: 1 Russian, 1 Western.
