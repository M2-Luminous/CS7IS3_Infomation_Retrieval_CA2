Information from relevant departments reveals that by February 15 of this year, 1,881 out of the 1,900 items put forward by CPPCC members and members of non-communist parties since the First Session of the Eighth National Committee of the CPPCC have been answered through concerted work of 157 organizations, including the Chinese Communist Party central community [as received] and the State Council. This accounts for 99 percent of the total number of matters put forward. Many of the proposals, which concentrated on the reform, opening- up and modernization drive, on the establishment of a socialist market economy, on strengthening the ideological and cultural build- up, as well as the construction of a clean government and the improvement of the Communist Party's working style have been accepted by relevant departments. For instance, many CPPCC members submitted ideas and proposals for a fair, rational tax rating and taxation system, in a bid to concentrate the central government's power of taxation and strengthen its management. On the basis of this proposal, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council decided to implement a new financial system of tax assignment starting this year. Practice proves that over the past year, CPPCC members, non- Communist Party members, and relevant people's organizations have been playing an increasingly greater role in carrying out the spirit of the 14th National Congress of the CPC, deepening reform, promoting economic and social development, and for solidifying unity and stability, by way of putting forward proposals to perform their function of political consulting and democratic supervision.
