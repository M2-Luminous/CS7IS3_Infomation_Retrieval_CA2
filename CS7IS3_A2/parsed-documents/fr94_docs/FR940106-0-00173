FR940106-0-00173 FR940106-0-00022 (2) Section 239(f) of the Act requires cooperating State agencies to furnish four discrete items of information and advice to individuals about TAA Program benefits, commencing with such advice and information to every individual who applies for unemployment insurance under each State's unemployment compensation law. See ยง617.4(e). This amendment became effective on August 23, 1988. Information and advice required by section 239(f) shall be provided in accordance with this part 617. (d) Training and eligibility requirements for TRA. Effective on November 21, 1988, in general, enrollment and participation in, or completion of, a training program approved under subpart C is required as a condition of entitlement to basic TRA. Amendments to sections 231(a)(5), 231(b), and 231(c) of the Act incorporate this new requirement, replacing the job search program requirement which remains in effect through November 20, 1988. Continuation of the job search program requirement through November 20, 1988, and installation of the training program requirement on and after November 21, 1988, is required of all applicants for basic TRA. (e) Eligibility period for basic TRA. (1) Effective on August 23, 1988, and with respect to all decisions (i.e., all determinations, redeterminations, and decisions on appeals) issued on or after that date, the eligibility period for basic TRA is changed from the prior law. Prior to the OTCA amendments, section 233(a)(2) provided that the eligibility period for an individual was a fixed 104-week period that immediately followed the week with respect to which the individual first exhausted all rights to regular benefits after the individual's first qualifying separation. Under section 233(a)(2) the new eligibility period is movable, and is the 104-week period that immediately follows the week in which the worker's most recent total qualifying separation occurs under the same, single certification. Under the effective date provisions of the OTCA, section 233(a)(2) applies to all decisions (i.e., determinations, redeterminations, and decisions on appeals) issued on and after August 23, 1988. Further, the law to be applied in making any such decision is the law as in effect on the date such a decision is made. These interpretative rules apply in all cases, regardless of whether the total qualifying separation occurred before, on, or after August 23, 1988, except as noted in paragraph (e)(3) of this section. (2) The major significance of the change in section 233(a)(2) is that, effective for all decisions (i.e., determinations, redeterminations, and decisions on appeals) issued on or after August 23, 1988, it applies to the ``most recent'' total qualifying separation. This means that, after the first qualifying separation before August 23, 1988, or the first total qualifying separation on and after August 23, 1988, with each subsequent total qualifying separation of an individual under the same certification the individual's eligibility period must be redetermined as the 104-week period that immediately follows the week in which such subsequent separation occurred. (3) Section 1430(g) of the OTCA requires that the new eligibility period not be applied with respect to any total qualifying separation occurring before August 23, 1988, if as a result of applying section 233(a)(2) the individual would have an eligibility period with an earlier expiration date than the expiration date of the eligibility period established under the prior law and based on a first qualifying separation which occurred under the same certification before August 23, 1988. Therefore, for decisions (i.e., determinations, redeterminations, and decisions on appeals) issued on or after August 23, 1988, for a worker who had a first qualifying separation under the same certification before August 23, 1988, it must be determined what the individual's eligibility period is based upon the prior law, and, if the individual also had a subsequent total qualifying separation, what the individual's eligibility period is based on the amended law. Only if the subsequent total qualifying separation occurred before August 23, 1988, and the expiration date of the new eligibility period ends on the same date or a later date than the expiration date of the old eligibility period may the new eligibility period be applied to the individual, and in that event it must be applied; if the new eligibility period would end on a date earlier than the ending date of the eligibility period based on the worker's first qualifying separation, section 1430(g) operates to preclude the application of amended section 233(a)(2).
