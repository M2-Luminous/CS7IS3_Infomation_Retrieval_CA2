In an interview with correspondents upon arrival, he said: If a confederation plan for Bosnia and Croatia fails to succeed, the international community will pay a heavy price. [passage omitted] The Islamic Republic of Iran, which recently has hosted prominent Bosnian and Croatian authorities, not only gives prominence to mutual economic, communications, and political ties with Bosnia and Croatia, but also endeavors to play the role of a mediator to bond the two countries of Bosnia and Croatia and, through bringing their stances closer together, to pave the way for the creation of stable and peaceful relations in the Balkans. [passage omitted] The role played by Iran, as the closest ally and a supporter of the oppressed Bosnian nation, in resolving the Balkan crisis through efforts aimed at establishing a confederation of Bosnia and Croatia -- a plan that was approved by the Bosnian parliament three months ago -- has gained further prominence and is indicative of the realization of Iran's spiritual and diplomatic influence by its guests from the Balkans. That is why the Croatian prime minister has called on Iran to stop the recurrence of clashes, which stem from misunderstanding between the Croats and the Muslims, and to support the confederation plan. Apart from the Bosnian issues, the Croatian prime minister will also hold talks with our country's officials on relations between Tehran and Zagreb. Those ties will include trade exchanges and economic and communications cooperation. Significant outcome is expected from the talks in that respect.
