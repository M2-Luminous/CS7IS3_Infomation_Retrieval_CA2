As the two corporations announced on 16 March, the purpose of working together is to make greater use of the low-temperature carbonization process developed by Siemens-KWU [Power Generation Division], an environment-compatible technology for disposing of domestic waste residue, domestic-type industrial waste, and sewage sludge that cannot otherwise be avoided or recycled. In the view of both parties, it represents the best method of meeting the strict requirements of ecological and economical waste residue reprocessing. Low-temperature carbonization makes for a particularly high recycling quota and an exceptional energy output. Siemens and VEW stated that working together would primarily enable them to offer the local authorities responsible for waste disposal, principally in the catchment area served by VEW and its east German subsidiary, Halle-based MEAG [expansion unknown], not just partial solutions but a complete package comprising everything from planning, building work, and financing to the operation of thermal disposal plants. In low-temperature carbonization, residual waste is converted into commercial substances and electricity, virtually without residue and effluent problems, by a combination of low-temperature carbonization and, subsequently, high-temperature incineration. Organic pollutants, such as dioxins and furans, are safely destroyed, and inorganic pollutants are securely bound in a hot-melt granulate. The leach-resistant granulate can then be used as a substitute for sand or gravel in, for example, road building. A low-temperature carbonization plant with an annual throughput of 150,000 tonnes of waste residue salvages an annual average of 6,750 tonnes of iron and over 700 tonnes of aluminum, which can be smelted without further processing and recycled as high-grade steel and aluminum products. The same plant also generates up to 75 million kilowatt-hours of electricity. For every tonne of domestic waste, no more than 3 kilograms of reaction products from the flue gas dust collector has to end up on the hazardous waste dump, the equivalent of only 0.3 percent of the original quantity at the very most.
