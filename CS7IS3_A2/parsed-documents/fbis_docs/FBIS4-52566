The loan will fall in a range of billions of yen and its disbursement is expected after an international aid panel designates South Africa as an eligible recipient this summer, they said. The loan will be used for projects to be picked up at the request of South Africa and will include construction of roads, ports and power plants, the sources said. Tokyo intends to include South Africa among nations eligible for aid because it is moving toward democracy, they said. Japan will also expand its grant-in-aid program, focusing on education facilities, technical assistance, medical support and agricultural development, they said. In tandem with other industrial nations, Japan to date has not extended full-scale economic assistance in protest of the country's apartheid policy. But some 100 million yen has been given as grant-in-aid to support blacks since the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's development assistance committee allowed the assistance in 1990. Japan and six other Group of Seven industrial nations agreed earlier this month to coordinate their backing to South Africa under its new government following the African National Congress's victory in the first all-race elections.
