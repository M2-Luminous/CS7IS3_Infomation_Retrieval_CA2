Mr Chuan dismissed reports that a large number of politicians were known to be involved in the narcotics trade but conceded that some of the drug suspects were politicians. The Prime Minister said legal action would be taken against any individual suspected of being involved in narcotics trafficking regardless of who he or she is if enough evidence could be found to substantiate the charges. However, he said the Government could not reveal any U.S.-supplied information on drug traffickers to the media in Thailand to avoid defamation charges. PM's Office Minister Thoetphong Chaiyanan, who is also chairman of the Government Parties Coordination Committee, said the allegations against Mr Thanong must be thoroughly checked before the House of Representatives can make further moves on Mr Thanong's case.
