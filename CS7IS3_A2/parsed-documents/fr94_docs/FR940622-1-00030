ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Department of the Treasury (``Department'') is publishing for comment proposed amendments to the financial responsibility rules in Part 402 and a conforming amendment to a recordkeeping requirement in Part 404 of the regulations issued under the Government Securities Act of 1986 (``GSA''). The proposed amendments would raise the minimum capital requirements for all government securities brokers and dealers subject to the requirements of Section 402.2 and establish a written notification requirement for certain withdrawals of capital. The proposed amendments parallel the Securities and Exchange Commission's (``SEC'') final and proposed amendments to the minimum net capital requirements for brokers and dealers subject to the requirements of 17 CFR 240.15c3&hyph;1 (Rule 15c3&hyph;1) and final rules regarding the withdrawal of capital. DATES: Comments must be submitted on or before August 22, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be sent to: Government Securities Regulations Staff, Bureau of the Public Debt, Department of the Treasury, 999 E Street N.W., Room 515, Washington, D.C. 20239&hyph;0001.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Don Hammond (Acting Director) or Kerry Lanham (Government Securities Specialist) at 202&hyph;219&hyph;3632. (TDD for hearing impaired: 202&hyph;219&hyph;9274.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 1. Background The Department is proposing amendments to its financial responsibility rules in Part 402 that would raise the minimum capital requirements and establish written notification requirements for certain capital withdrawals for those government securities brokers and dealers subject to the provisions of ยง402.2. Additionally, the Department is proposing a conforming change to the recordkeeping requirements of Part 404 which is necessitated by the proposals to revise the minimum capital levels. The Department believes that these proposed amendments will enhance the capital adequacy of government securities brokers and dealers and provide for more effective regulatory oversight. These proposed amendments parallel rule amendments adopted or proposed by the SEC. The Department's amendments, if adopted, will increase investor confidence in the financial responsibility of government securities brokers and dealers without creating any substantial new barriers to entry into the government securities market. The SEC published proposed revisions to its minimum capital levels in October 1989 1 and December 1992 2 and to its capital withdrawal rules in August 1990. 3 The SEC published its final capital withdrawal regulations on March 5, 1991, 4 finalized its first change in minimum capital levels on November 24, 1992, 5 but has not yet finalized its second proposal on minimum capital levels for certain introducing firms. The Treasury capital rule 6 uses the SEC capital standard (Rule 15c3&hyph;1) 7 as a foundation and, accordingly, it is useful to strive to minimize the differences between the two rules. Additionally, it is Treasury's objective to maintain consistency with the SEC rule and, ultimately, have a uniform capital rule for all government securities brokers and dealers registered with the SEC. The Treasury would have acted sooner to propose these amendments but its rulemaking authority under the GSA expired on October 1, 1991, and was not reauthorized until December 17, 1993.
