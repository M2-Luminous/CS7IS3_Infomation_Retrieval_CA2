FR940912-2-00025 FR940912-2-00022 Notice of Non-Competitive Financial Assistance Award SUMMARY: The Department of Energy (DOE), Golden Field Office, through the Chicago Regional Support Office, announces that, pursuant to DOE Financial Assistance Rules 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2), its intent to award a grant to the Council of Great Lakes Governors. The award represents renewed funding under DOE's Regional Biomass Energy Program. The goal of this program is to build and maintain the capacity of state energy, forestry and environmental quality offices to responsibly promote biomass technologies and the use of biomass energy in the seven state Great Lakes Region. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Council of Great Lakes Governors is responsible for the administration of the Great Lakes Regional Biomass Program (GLRBEP). The GLRBEP has three basic components. A state grant component provides funds (with a 50/50 matching requirement) to each of the states in the region to strengthen and integrate the work of state agencies involved in biomass energy. The applied research and technology transfer component produces a series of technical reports in areas that have been identified as being important to the development of biomass energy in the region. The third component is a long range planning effort, with substantial involvement from the private sector, to identify activities necessary to spur greater development and use of biomass energy in the Great Lakes Region. The grant is being accepted by DOE because DOE knows of no other organization that is conducting or planning to conduct this type of effort in promoting of the use of biomass energy in the Great Lakes Region. The project period for the award is twelve months, expected to begin September 1994. DOE plans to provide funding in the amount of $730,000. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Juli A.
