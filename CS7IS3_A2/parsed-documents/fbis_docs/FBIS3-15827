Yeltsin's edict, Kabardino-Balkaria's President V. Kokov has issued his own edict envisaging the restoration of the Elbrusskiy and Cherekskiy Rayons in the republic's foothills that existed prior to 1944 -- rayons with a predominantly Balkar population. This edict orders the formation of a Chamber of Nationalities within the republic's current parliament in which the republic's three main peoples -- Kabards, Russians, and Balkars -- would have equal representation. The edict was read out during a sorrowful meeting of the republic's public to mark the 50th anniversary of the deportation of the Balkar people. It was also decided henceforth to celebrate 28 March as the day of the Balkar people's return home. It has been declared a day off in the republic. Experts think that these measures will stimulate the economic, social, and cultural development of Balkaria's population centers.
