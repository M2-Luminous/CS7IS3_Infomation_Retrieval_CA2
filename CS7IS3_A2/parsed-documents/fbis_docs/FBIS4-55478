[passage omitted] [Begin recording] [Konya] I consider these kinds of statements as giving rise to great concern. Here in this country we have succeeded over the past four years in creating a police force that is really free of politics; and now a chairman of a political party -- and what is more, a party which, together with the SZDSZ [Alliance of Free Democrats], is preparing to govern in coalition -- brings into doubt in a public statement the correct behavior, the training, and the professionalism of this police force. I think that such statements may be very significant warning signs for the future. Such an excessive power is a danger to democracy in any case and even more so if the MSZP has a larger than two-thirds parliamentary majority. They will be able to do what they want and that is not at all reassuring in the light of such statements. I hope that in the course of this week the police will be able to provide unambiguously proven facts to the public. [passage omitted] [Unidentified correspondent] Is there the slightest suspicion that it [Horn's road accident] was not an accident? [Konya] No such suspicion exists whatsoever -- apart from the suspicion raised by Chairman Horn. [end recording]
