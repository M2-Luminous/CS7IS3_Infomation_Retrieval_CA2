SUMMARY: Special local regulations are being adopted for the Second Annual Run For The Gold sponsored by the Key West Power Boat Race Association. This event will be held on May 13 and 16, 1994, between 1 p.m. EST (Eastern Standard Time) and 3 p.m. EST, each day. The regulations are needed to provide for the safety of life on navigable waters under the event. EFFECTIVE DATES: These regulations become effective at 1 p.m. EST and terminate at 3 p.m. EST each day on May 13 and 16, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: QMC Coyne, Project Officer, USCG Group Key West, (305) 292&hyph;8727. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking has not been published for these regulations. Following normal rulemaking procedures would have been impracticable. The updated information to hold the event was not received with sufficient time remaining to publish proposed rules in advance of the event or to provide for a delayed effective date. Drafting Information The drafters of this regulation are QMC K.T. Coyne, project officer, USCG Group Key West, and LT J.M. Losego, project attorney, Seventh Coast District Legal Office. Discussion of Regulations The Key West Power Boat Race Association is sponsoring the Second Annual Run for the Gold power boat race. Approximately 65 power boats, ranging in length from 24 feet to 50 feet, will participate in the event. The power boats will be competing at high speeds, and in close proximity to each other, on the 16 mile course, creating an extra or unusual hazard in the navigable waters. Federalism This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that the rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environmental Assessment The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this proposal consistent with Section 2.B.2.08 of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, and this proposal has been determined to be categorically excluded. Specifically, the Coast Guard has consulted with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service regarding the environmental impact of this event, and it was determined that the event does not jeopardize the continued existence of protected species.
