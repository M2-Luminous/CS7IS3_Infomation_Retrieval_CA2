FBIS4-36061 "drnes108_j_94010" FBIS-NES-94-108 Daily Report 5 Jun 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen North Reportedly Attacks Aden Oil Refinery North Reportedly Attacks Aden Oil Refinery Fuel Storage Tank Said on Fire NC0506104094 Paris AFP in English 0930 GMT 5 Jun 94 NC0506104094 Paris AFP English BFN [By Mohammad Attar] [Excerpts] Aden, Yemen, June 5 (AFP) -- Northern warplanes on Sunday [5 June] blew up an oil storage tank at the refinery in the southern stronghold of Aden as Yemen's civil war entered its second month, a southern military spokesman said. The spokesman said a fire "broke out in a fuel storage tank at the refinery," about 10 kilometers (six miles) from here and the main source of fuel for southern troops loyal to 'Ali Salim al-Bid. It refines some 140,000 barrels of crude per day. Anti-aircraft fire shot down one of the warplanes but the others escaped, the spokesman said. Witnesses meanwhile said the north fired two surface-to-surface missiles at Aden overnight, but the southern city's air defenses shot one out of the sky over an uninhabited area and the other plunged harmlessly into the sea. And a northern military spokesman in Sanaa said southern forces fired two Scud missiles at residential areas of the northern city of Ta'izz but both were "intercepted" without causing casualties. Both sides accused the other of cowardice in the attacks. A southern spokesman said the raid on the refinery was a "flagrant challenge to the will of the international community," referring to a UN resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in the month-old war. But the north also called the attack on Ta'izz, about 156 kilometers (90 miles) northwest of the southern stronghold of Aden, "a violation" of the resolution. Neither side in the war which has pitted rival north and south troops since May 5 has respected the ceasefire call adopted Wednesday by the UN Security Council. Heavy artillery fire continued throughout Saturday evening north of Aden as southern forces fought to hold back an offensive by northern troops of President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. The northern forces were reported Friday to be only 15 kilometers (nine miles) from Aden where al-Bid, the country's former vice- president, proclaimed an independent state on May 21 after a failed four-year union. Southern soldiers have launched a counter-offensive to retake the town of Lahij about 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of Aden, according to soldiers near the front. A southern spokesman said "several members of the Jihad" Moslem fundamentalist organisation which backs Salih had been captured at Kharaz. 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jifri, appointed vice president of the breakaway Yemen Democratic Republic, told AFP that his forces might call for Saudi military support in battling northern troops. He said southern leaders had "not yet decided", but added that "everything is possible and legitimate to protect our people." Southern forces are outnumbered by those of the north.
