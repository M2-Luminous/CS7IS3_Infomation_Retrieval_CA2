In his letter, Minister Rasuo says: ``The meeting with the U.S. ambassador to Croatia on the RSK territory, in the circumstances in which the RSK finds itself -- of which the most important one is that the RSK has not been internationally recognized yet -- is extremely dangerous because the visit of Mr. Peter Galbraith to the RSK could be interpreted as extending Croatia's sovereignty over the territory of our state, which is in any case unacceptable. Furthermore, because Mr. Peter Galbraith is continuously putting forward a view that the RSK is an integral part of Croatia. ``For this reason, Mr. Martic, I will not be able to participate in any aspect or any form in the organization of a meeting with the U.S. ambassador to Croatia, a country with whom the state in whose government I am a minister is on hostile terms through no will and blame of its own. ``Second, for the duration of the unscrupulous media war that the Croatian journalists have been waging against the Serbian people as a whole and thus also against the Serbian people in Krajina -- a media war that threatens to grow into a real armed aggression by Croatia against the Serbian Krajina, as the Croatian leaders are announcing -- I believe that Croatian reporters must not be granted permission to enter our state territory. The Information Ministry will not issue them with press passes. Bearing in mind such a stance, it is thus understandable that there is no need for the organization of a reception for the Croatian reporters in the RSK. "Beside this, I inform you, Mr. Martic, that I am not willing to share the responsibility for the decisions that I do not make and in the passing of which I make no contribution. On any other occasion, when my consent and consent of the government whose member I am will exist regarding decisions to be passed and whenever we agree something in advance without the need for persuasion, you can count on my assistance and cooperation."
