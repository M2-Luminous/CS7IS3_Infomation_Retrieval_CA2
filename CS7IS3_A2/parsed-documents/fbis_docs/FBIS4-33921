Moreover, the organization's spokesman, Wesner Morency, recommends the resignation of the Army commander in chief and the formation of a national coalition government with a prime minister. [Begin recording, in Creole] [Morency] Whatever the situation that makes this person or that person chief, we are now on alert. Whether I am for or against, if bullets begin pouring down on my roof, I must counterattack. Self-defense, however, requires unity of command and morality within the command. Can we in the Revolutionary Cohort afford to create a wait-and-see policy, with those men later dragging us through the mud and drowning us underwater. For me to respond to this state of emergency, I must set down some conditions. The first condition is to replace Cedras. It is a fact that he cannot command a battle, as the president has asked him to do. The president said: I ordered... We are also saying that we must dismiss this government. This government does not represent anything. There are many trends within the country and they must be respected, whether they are majority or minority, so establish a national coalition government with a prime minister. The third element is since he, Jonassaint, is talking about stateless people, mercenaries, we say no. The Haitian state uses three means of mass communication: newspaper, television, and radio. You have problems with mercenaries and stateless people, but they are competent. You must recognize that they are competent. It is necessary to oppose competence with competence, not with mediocrity. [Reporter Renois] Does the president of the country, in the face of a threat of intervention -- as you said it, whether you like him or not -- not have a duty to call for mobilization and unity? [Morency] He has the duty. But once he does it, the person he is fighting will say, here are my conditions. It is his duty. But once he does his duty, I must do my duty as well. My duty is to tell him: You want it. You are doing it. Here are my conditions for it to succeed. [end recording]
