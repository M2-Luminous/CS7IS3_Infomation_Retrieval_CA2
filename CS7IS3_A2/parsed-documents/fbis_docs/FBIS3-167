Police forces and the gendarmerie arrested more than 1,000 people in Dakar yesterday. Nicolas Balique reports: [Balique] A total of 1,262 people were arrested for questioning during the operation, a major roundup which required almost 1,000 men during the Sunday [27 February] night. Given the number of arrests -- some for mere identity checks, others for drug trafficking, prostitution or possession of knives -- this cannot be called a routine operation. It is rather an operation carried out within the framework of an all-out policy of firmness after the trauma of the bloody events of 16 February. Forty-eight hours after the raid, it must be pointed out that a similar raid, which was carried out in the caves of Dakar seafront, led to the arrest of more than 150 dropouts, including armed bandits from the subregion, Guinea, Gambia, or Liberia. Meanwhile, the inquiry into the violence of Black Wednesday [16 February] is continuing, the religious movement Moustarchidine has been banned, and the two main opposition leaders have been placed under committal order. Some are wondering whether this latest raid will not be a mere flash in the pan. In any case, the authorities do not think so. This is Nicolas Balique in Dakar for RFI.
