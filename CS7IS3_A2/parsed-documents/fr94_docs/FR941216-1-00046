FR941216-1-00046 FR941216-1-00010 ( 2 ) In year of sale, exchange, or retirement. Any negative adjustment carryforward on a debt instrument for a taxable year in which the debt instrument is sold, exchanged, or retired reduces the amount realized by the holder on the sale, exchange, or retirement. Any negative adjustment carryforward for a taxable year in which the debt instrument is retired is taken into account by the issuer as income from the discharge of indebtedness under section 61(a)(12). (iv) Cross references. If a holder has a basis in a debt instrument that is different than the debt instrument's adjusted issue price, the holder may have additional positive or negative adjustments under paragraph (b)(9)(i) of this section. If the amount of a contingent payment is fixed more than 6 months before the date it is due, the amount and timing of the adjustment are determined under paragraph (b)(9)(ii) of this section. If all the remaining contingent payments on a debt instrument become fixed substantially contemporaneously, the timing of the adjustment is determined under paragraph (b)(9)(v) of this section. (v) Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of paragraph (b)(6) of this section. In each example, assume that the debt instrument described is a debt instrument for federal income tax purposes. No inference is intended, however, as to whether the debt instrument constitutes a debt instrument for federal income tax purposes. Example 1. Net negative adjustment_ (i) Facts. On June 13, 1996, Z, a calendar year taxpayer, purchases a debt instrument at original issue for $1,044. Assume that the debt instrument is subject to paragraph (b) of this section. The projected payment schedule provides for projected payments of $100 on December 31, 1996, and $1,100 on December 31, 1997. Based on the projected payment schedule, Z's total daily portions of interest would be $56 for 1996 and $100 for 1997. (ii) Adjustment in 1996. Assume that the payment actually made on December 31, 1996, is $25, rather than the projected $100. Under paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, Z has a negative adjustment of $75 on December 31, 1996, attributable to the difference between the amount of the actual payment and the amount of the projected payment. Because Z has no positive adjustments for 1996, Z has a net negative adjustment of $75 on the debt instrument for 1996. This net negative adjustment reduces to zero the $56 total daily portions of interest Z would otherwise include in income in 1996. Accordingly, Z has no interest income on the debt instrument for 1996. Because Z has no interest inclusions on the debt instrument for prior taxable years, the remaining $19 of the net negative adjustment is a negative adjustment carryforward for 1996 that results in a negative adjustment of $19 on January 1, 1997. (iii) Adjustments in 1997. Assume that the payment actually made on December 31, 1997, is $1,150, rather than the projected $1,100. Under paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, Z has a positive adjustment of $50 on December 31, 1997, attributable to the difference between the amount of the actual payment and the amount of the projected payment. Because Z also has a negative adjustment of $19 on January 1, 1997, Z has a net positive adjustment of $31 on the debt instrument for 1997 (the excess of the $50 positive adjustment over the $19 negative adjustment). Therefore, Z has $131 of interest income on the debt instrument for 1997 (the net positive adjustment plus the $100 total daily portions of interest that are taken into account by Z in that year). Example 2. Net negative adjustment at maturity_ (i) Facts. Assume the same facts as in Example 1 of this paragraph (b)(6)(v), except that the payment actually made on December 31, 1997, is $1,010, rather than the projected $1,100. (ii) Adjustments in 1997. Under paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, Z has a negative adjustment of $90 on December 31, 1997, attributable to the difference between the amount of the actual payment and the amount of the projected payment. In addition, Z has a negative adjustment of $19 on January 1, 1997. Because Z has no positive adjustments in 1997, Z has a net negative adjustment of $109 for 1997. This net negative adjustment reduces to zero the $100 total daily portions of interest Z would otherwise include in income for 1997. Therefore, Z has no interest income on the debt instrument for 1997. Because Z has no interest inclusions on the debt instrument for prior taxable years, the remaining $9 of the net negative adjustment constitutes a negative adjustment carryforward for 1997 that reduces the amount realized by Z on retirement of the debt instrument. (7) Adjusted issue price, adjusted basis, and retirement_ (i) In general. Paragraph (b)(7) of this section provides rules under the noncontingent bond method to determine the adjusted issue price of a debt instrument, the holder's basis in a debt instrument, and the amount of any contingent payment made on a scheduled retirement. Paragraph (b)(7) of this section also provides rules for an unscheduled retirement. In general, because any difference between the actual amount of a contingent payment and the projected amount of the payment is taken into account as an adjustment to income or deduction, the projected payments are treated as the actual payments for purposes of making adjustments to issue price and basis and determining the amount of any contingent payment made on a scheduled retirement. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(7)(iv) of this section, positive and negative adjustments are not taken into account for purposes of paragraph (b)(7) of this section. (ii) Definition of adjusted issue price. The adjusted issue price of a debt instrument is equal to the debt instrument's issue price, increased by the interest previously accrued on the debt instrument under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section (determined without regard to any adjustments taken into account under paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section), and decreased by the amount of any noncontingent payment and the projected amount of any contingent payment previously made on the debt instrument. See paragraph (b)(9)(ii) of this section for special rules that apply when a contingent payment is fixed more than 6 months before it is due. (iii) Adjustments to basis. A holder's basis in a debt instrument is increased by the interest previously accrued by the holder on the debt instrument under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section (determined without regard to any adjustments taken into account under paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section), and decreased by the amount of any noncontingent payment and the projected amount of any contingent payment previously made on the debt instrument to the holder. See paragraphs (b)(9)(i) and (ii) of this section for special rules that apply when basis is different than adjusted issue price or a contingent payment is fixed more than 6 months before it is due.
