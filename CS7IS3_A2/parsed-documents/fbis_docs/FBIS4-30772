As the governor said, in order to be able to pass such a decision, we had to create certain conditions -- political, economic, and international. In the political sphere, we had to strengthen the democratic system in the Republic of Croatia. In the economy, we had to complete the reconstruction, the transformation of ownership, the restructuring of the socialist economy, of the socialist system into the free market. Of course, that task has not yet been completed but we have laid the foundations for it. We have made achievements in the stabilization program and in curbing inflation, despite unfavorable circumstances and despite the consequences of the war. The former governments -- of Greguric and Sarinic -- have contributed to it, and the government of Nikica Valentic added the final stroke, prompting the astonishment and admiration of the world and of economic experts. In the international sphere we had to create conditions for Croatia to consolidate its position, for it to become not only internationally recognized, but also to win allies in the world both politically and economically. Today Croatia has such allies in the modern world. These were the preconditions necessary for us to launch this final act of marking the national sovereignty of the Croatian people and of the Croatian state. And as for the name: The Croatian nation is one of the oldest in Europe and it has the right to give its currency an original name. As academician Brozovic proved in his thesis, a long time ago, the mink [kuna] was a means of payment in the Croatian lands from Slavonia to Istria. The fur of the marten was a means of payment in other countries as well, but I do not know of any other country that attached the same significance to the mink as it had in Croatian history and [words indistinct]. Thus, the marten is on the historic coat-of-arms of the historic Croatian Kingdom of Slavonia. Therefore, we have the right to give our currency a different name, the one we have preserved in financial transactions since time immemorial. This is why we decided, in that respect as well -- we have survived as a peculiar, different national entity in Europe and in the world -- to appear in the world with a different name for our currency. At all times and in all countries, the introduction of a national currency is of major significance in the moral, political, psychological, and economic sense. I am convinced that the introduction of our currency -- the kuna and lipa -- will have the same significance, that it will encourage our people -- from schoolchildren to the elderly -- to treat our currency in a more serious and economical way in business and in the state administration, so that it becomes the basis for faster economic and cultural development, the basis for our successful cooperation with the modern world because, I believe, it will retain convertibility owing to the results achieved. The Croatian people deserve that. They have contributed, they have in fact achieved this in a political, economic and, unfortunately, military sense by defending their homeland from aggression. The Croatian people today have their own currency as a means for their future development. As head of state, I would like to express the homeland's gratitude to all the people who have created the preconditions for the introduction of our currency and to all the people, technicians and artists, who were directly involved in creating the beautiful design of our currency. Thank you, and let the historic path of our new Croatian currency be happy. [applause]
