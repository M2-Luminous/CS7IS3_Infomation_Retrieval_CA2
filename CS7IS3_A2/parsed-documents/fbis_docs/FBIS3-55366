The statement reads that the statement made on 5 January of this year by the press secretary of the Russian president recognizes Lithuania's right to be concerned about her own security and that Russia respects this right. Now this right is being implemented by an official request to be admitted to NATO, however, Russia's regrets about bloc psychology should be addressed to Russia itself because Russia was the first to take up the initiative to restore the post-Soviet military bloc, which, after Belarus had been included, was threateningly approaching Lithuanian state borders. According to Vytautas Landsbergis, Chairman of the Lithuanian Conservatives Tevynes Sajunga, Europe and NATO should note that the military bloc dominated by Russia today is just 30 kilometers from the capital of Lithuania. Belarus alone declared having 100,000 men in its Armed Forces, and what about the Russian military units in Belarus and the Kaliningrad Region? Therefore, Lithuania has very good reason to be concerned for the expansion of the new Eastern military bloc, especially in view that regrettably the Belarus Government and the members of parliament have renounced the neutrality that was solemnly declared earlier. Russia's neighbors are also not less concerned about the openly aggressive Russia's new military doctrine. Assurances that this doctrine allegedly blocks the way to any manifestations of aggression in Russian foreign policy absolutely contradict the text of the above doctrine and the real actions. The illegal deployment of Russian troops in Latvia and Estonia and Russia's avoidance of carrying out its international obligations in the region is a continuation of the 1940 aggression. Actions of the Russian troops in the Caucasus and Moldavia and threats and pressure exerted on her neighbors are the everyday examples of this deplorable policy. We hope that the democratic forces in Russia will rally and become stronger dissociating themselves from the aggressive nationalism towards people of other nationalities and the neighbors, the statement by the Tevynes Sajunga -- Lithuanian Conservatives -- reads.
