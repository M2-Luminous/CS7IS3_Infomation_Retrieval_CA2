Li made the remark at a reception for Chinese and foreign reporters covering the National People's Congress. Li said that major progress was made during the sixteenth round of negotiations on China's resumption of its contracting party status in GATT. Li said that the overwhelming majority of GATT contracting parties have supported an early resumption of China's GATT membership except one contracting member. Li said China has become the 11th biggest trader in the world. "China's re-entry into GATT will make significant contributions to a healthy development of global trade," he said. The vice-premier said that China will, as always, have further negotiations with other contracting parties with a positive approach and in accordance with the principle of balance between rights and obligations. The European Community and other contracting parties have already put forward a draft protocol on China's re-entry into GATT, Li pointed out, and other contracting parties have also had discussions with China. Regretably, he said, there is one contracting party obstructing China's re-entry into GATT, in disagreement with its earlier promise of support in bilateral negotiations. Li expressed the hope that the contracting party would implement its earlier commitment.
