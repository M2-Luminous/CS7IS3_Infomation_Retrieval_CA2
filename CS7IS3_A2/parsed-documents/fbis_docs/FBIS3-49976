When the Montenegrin Government was being formed in March last year, it decided that the prime minister, Milo Djukanovic, would perform the duty of minister for defense until a federal law on defense was passed which, the government explained, would specify constitutional arrangements in this sphere and create conditions for a uniform discharge of this duty at federal level. Given that the Montenegro Ministry for Defense has been dissolved following the adoption of the federal law in this sphere, the government suggests that the republic's assembly should relieve Deputy Defense Minister Veljko Vukovic of his duty.
