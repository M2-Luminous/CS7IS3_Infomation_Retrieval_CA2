FR940720-1-00021 FR940720-1-00006 For the purposes of Rule 30 of the 72 COLREGS, a ``vessel at anchor'' includes a vessel made fast to one or more mooring buoys or other similar device attached to the bottom. Such a vessel shall be lighted as a vessel at anchor in accordance with Rule 30, except that a barge, unless otherwise authorized by the cognizant Coast Guard Captain of the Port (COTP), shall meet the applicable requirements of 33 CFR 88.13. 7. Section 82.7 is added to read as follows: §82.7 Sidelights for unmanned barges. An unmanned barge complies with Rule 24 of the 72 COLREGS even if it is unable to meet the technical vertical sector requirements for sidelights as prescribed in Annex I(10) paragraphs (a) and (c) of the 72 COLREGS, if the sidelights meet all other technical requirements of these rules, such as requirements for luminous intensity and arc of visibility. PART 84_ANNEX I: POSITIONING AND TECHNICAL DETAILS OF LIGHTS AND SHAPES 8. The authority citation for part 84 continues to read as follows: Authority: 33 U.S.C. 2071; 49 CFR 1.46. 9. In §84.01, redesignate paragraphs (b) through (c) as paragraphs (c) through (d) and add a new paragraph (b) to read as to read as follows: §84.01 Definitions. * * * * * (b) The term high speed craft means a craft capable of maximum velocity equal to or exceeding: V=3.7 D 0.1667 ; where: V=velocity at displacement (meters/second) and D=maximum permissible displacement (meters 3 ). Note: The same formula expressed in knots and pounds is: V(kts)=1.98D(lbs)D 0.1667 ; where: V=maximum vessel speed in knots and D=maximum displacement in pounds. * * * * * 10. In §84.05, revise paragraph (a), redesignate paragraph (b) as paragraph (e), redesignate paragraph (c) as paragraph (b), redesignate paragraph (d) as paragraph (c) and add a new paragraph (d) to read as follows: §84.05 Horizontal positioning and spacing of lights. (a) Except as specified in paragraph (e) of this section, when two masthead lights are prescribed for a power-driven vessel, the horizontal distance between them must not be less than one quarter of the length of the vessel but need not be more than 50 meters. The forward light must be placed not more than one half of the length of the vessel from the stem. * * * * * (d) When only one masthead light is prescribed for a power-driven vessel, this light must be exhibited forward of amidships; except that a vessel of less than 20 meters in length need not exhibit this light forward of amidships but must exhibit it as far forward as is practicable. * * * * * 11. In §84.17, redesignate paragraph (b) as paragraph (b)(1) and add paragraph (b)(2) to read as follows: §84.17 Horizontal sectors. * * * * * (b)(1) *␣*␣* (2) If it is impracticable to comply with paragraph (b)(1) of this section by exhibiting only one all-around light, two all-around lights shall be used suitably positioned or screened so that they appear, as far as practicable, as one light at a distance of one mile. Note: Two unscreened all-round lights that are 1.28 meters apart or less will appear as one light to the naked eye at a distance of one mile. 12. Section 84.27 is added to read as follows: §84.27 High speed craft. (a) The masthead light of high speed craft with a length to breadth ratio of less than 3.0 may be placed at a height related to the breadth lower than that prescribed in §84.03(a)(1), provided that the base angle of the isosceles triangle formed by the side lights and masthead light when seen in end elevation is not less than 27 degrees as determined by the formula in paragraph (b) of this section. (b) The minimum height of masthead light above sidelights is to be determined by the following formula: Tan 27 ○= x / y ; where Y is 1/2 the horizontal distance between the sidelights and X is the height of the forward masthead light.
