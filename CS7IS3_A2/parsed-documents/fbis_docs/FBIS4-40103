Kadannikov of the All-Russia Automobile Alliance group: "Two Billion Reward for Information"] [Text] Blood was spilled yet again in Moscow 7 June. Three shots, three terrorist acts, cost the lives of several of our fellow citizens, and dozens of Russians received wounds. The victims were a driver, a nurse, a worker, a housewife, and the president of a company -- the criminals spare no one. Especially those who carry out practical transformations in the Russian economy and defend people's right to a dignified life. Boris Berezovskiy, general director of the All-Russian Automobile Alliance, was wounded 7 June. It was pure chance that one of the initiators of a major Russian project in which millions of Russians have put their faith and invested their savings survived. His comrade standing nearby was killed. It has become clear once and for all that a parallel power of criminals and murderers is arising in Russia. Those who support the president and the government, who are trying to revive the economy, demand that a stop be put to the existing mayhem forthwith. Both organized crime and the state executive apparatus must finally understand: Enough is enough! We demand that emergency measures be adopted to ensure the safety of Russian citizens. If the law-enforcement organs need extraordinary powers to do this, they must be given them; if additional material and financial resources are needed, they will be provided. Our demand is that the criminals be found. We accordingly announce that anyone who provides information leading to the exposure of the instigators and perpetrators of the terrorist act perpetrated against the leadership and staffers of the All-Russia Automobile Alliance will be paid a reward of two billion rubles. We guarantee confidentiality.
