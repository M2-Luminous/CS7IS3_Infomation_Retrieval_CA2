FR940429-0-00192 FR940429-0-00015 Revocation of provisional certification. Comments: A number of commenters complained that the lack of a formal appeal process for revocation of provisional certification was unfair to the institution because it provided much less due process than is available to other institutions under the appeal procedures in subpart G of the regulations. Some of these commenters also indicated that they believed it would be more appropriate to offer provisionally certified institutions the full appeal rights under subpart G of the regulations, and several commenters believed that more extensive appeal procedures were required to revoke provisional certification than were described in the regulations. Some commenters also suggested that a revocation notice should not be made effective upon the date of the mailing, but either upon receipt by the institution or until a specified number of days after the mailing. A few commenters also recommended that first class mail be used because it is an accepted means of filing legal documents in the court system, or that certified mail be used as an alternative to registered mail. Many commenters also requested that the provision that provides that an institution may request reconsideration of a revocation of provisional certification be modified to provide that any request for reconsideration of a revocation of provisional certification be decided by someone other than the person issuing the revocation. These comments stated that it was important that such requests for reconsideration be made to a different official because it would be more meaningful than having the request be presented to the person that had already made a decision adverse to the institution. Discussion: The Secretary disagrees with the commenters that revocations of provisional certification should receive the same appeal procedures given to fully certified institutions under subpart G of the regulations. Institutions receiving provisional certification are being given the opportunity to participate under limiting conditions because a heightened risk to Title IV, HEA program funds has been identified, either by the institution's current financial condition or through prior problems in the administration of the Title IV, HEA programs by the institution or its owners. Furthermore, section 498(h) of the HEA provides that provisionally certified institutions may be terminated if the Secretary determines that an institution is unable to meet its responsibilities under its program participation agreement. This language is significantly different from the requirement in section 487(c)(1)(F) of the HEA that provides that an adverse action against a fully participating institution be determined after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing. The regulations require that the notice revoking the provisional certification contain the basis for the action, explain to the institution the consequences of such revocation, and detail the procedures required to request reconsideration of the action. The notice and opportunity to request reconsideration of the decision to revoke the institution's provisional certification provide adequate protection to the institution that it will have the opportunity to respond directly to the stated basis for the action, and establish a reasonable mechanism to resolve the dispute in a fair manner. The Secretary believes that such procedure provides an institution with a fair opportunity to be heard, and the final agency decision will be subject to Federal court review to ensure that the action was not arbitrary and capricious. The Secretary does not agree that a notice of revocation of an institution's provisional certification should be effective on a date other than the date that the letter is sent to the institution. An institution that participates under provisional certification does so with the understanding that it is subject to greater scrutiny with fewer procedural rights when problems are identified. A notice advising the institution that its provisional certification is revoked will identify the reasons for such action and give the institution an opportunity to request reconsideration of that decision. The effective date of the revocation is the date that the notice is mailed; this provides greater protection of Title IV, HEA program funds while still giving the institution an opportunity to have that decision subsequently set aside. The Secretary agrees that it would be more appropriate to provide that notices of revocation decisions will be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, rather than by registered mail. The Secretary notes that certified mail is already used to initiate adverse actions against fully participating institutions under subpart G of the regulations, and therefore believes that it is appropriate to standardize this notice requirement for revocations of provisional certification. The regulation also provides that, where practical, more expeditious notice may be provided through facsimile or overnight mail. The Secretary agrees that the designated department official making the decision concerning an institution's request for reconsideration of a revocation should be different from, and not subject to supervision by, the official who initiated the revocation of the institution's provisional certification. This separation of function will ensure that the official making the final decision for the Department is independent from the supervision of the official issuing the initial decision, and this procedural protection strengthens the integrity of the review procedures for revocation of provisional certification. Changes: A change has been made to provide for notices of revocation of provisional certification to be sent by certified mail. The regulations have been modified to require that the official reviewing a request for reconsideration of provisional certification must be different from, and not subject to supervision by, the official that issued the notice of revocation. Section 668.14‚ê£Program participation agreement. Comments: Five commenters suggested that an institution's program participation agreement should only cover those branches or locations which are specifically listed in the institution's notice of eligibility. One commenter indicated that this provision makes clear that the program participation agreement applies to each branch campus or location of the institution. Discussion: The provision emphasizes that the program participation agreement applies only to those branch campuses and locations that meet the applicable requirements of this part; therefore, additional clarification is unnecessary. Changes: None. Comments: Four commenters asserted that the regulations should specify that the terminology ``special arrangement, agreement, or limitation'' applies only to the Title IV, HEA programs, and not any other programs in which the institution participates. Two commenters suggested that the proposed regulations marked a radical departure from existing regulations, and that a ``phase- in'' period was in order.
