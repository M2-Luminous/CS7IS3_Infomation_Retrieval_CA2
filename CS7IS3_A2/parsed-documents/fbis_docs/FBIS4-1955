Investment in the development of transportation and telecommunications in 1993 reached 1.87 billion yuan, accounting for seven percent of the province's total capital construction funds. These fast-growing industries boosted the province's gross national product and financial revenue by 28 percent last year. The Shenyang Railway Bureau, the biggest of its kind in China, pooled 448 million yuan in 1993 to back the construction of major projects within and outside the province. A 147-million-yuan project, the Dayaowan Line, was completed at the end of 1993. It also invested 5.25 billion yuan last year in a joint effort to renovate the Harbin-Dalian line. In addition, the province put about 1.37 billion yuan in 1993 into fixed assets for highway construction, an 82.1 percent rise from the previous year. The total investment in highway building hit more than 1.19 billion yuan. The 43.3-km expressway of the south section ring road around the capital city of Shenyang has now opened to traffic, and the construction of the north section of the ring and another expressway from Shenyang to Tieling, a grain-producing city in northern Liaoning, has started. The province now has highways and expressways totalling 41,638 km. In 1993 it earmarked a total of 229 million yuan to boost port development, up 46 percent over the planned investment. To quicken the pace of port construction, it also attracted a record 83 million U.S. dollars in foreign investment. The construction of China's biggest ship repair center, which was built jointly by the Dalian Ocean Shipping Company and a Hong Kong firm, has started at Dalian Bay. Four berths of the first phase have already been put into operation, and another six such berths are well under way. In Jinzhou city a new management system, the joint stock system, has been introduced since early 1993 to invigorate port construction. One 10,000-dwt [deadweight tons] bulk cargo berth has been built, boosting the handling capacity of the port to 300,000 dwt. In Dandong the building of another three 10,000-dwt berths has been completed, and they are expected to go into operation soon. Meanwhile, the provincial postal department invested 2.18 billion yuan in the sector in 1993, up 135.4 percent from the previous year.
