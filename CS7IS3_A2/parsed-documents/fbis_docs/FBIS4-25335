After continuous inquiries by his wife Zhang Hong, the Public Security Sub-bureau of Beijing's Xicheng District finally admitted that Jiang Qisheng was "under detention for investigation." According to Xiang Xiaoji, a responsible person of the former student delegation to the dialogue who is now living in New York, Zhang Hong, who is working with the Shoudu Teacher's University, asked the authorities why Jiang Qisheng had been "detained for investigation" but the public security authorities refused to give an answer. After Zhang Hong's repeated requests, on 3 June, the Xicheng Public Security Sub-bureau allowed her to take some clothes to No 3 Detention Center in Beijing's Qinghe Longgang, but she was not allowed to bring Jiang a quilt to prevent him from committing suicide. Only then did Zhang Hong know where her husband was detained. Jiang Qisheng was born in Changshu, Jiangsu. He was enrolled in the Chinese People's University in 1988 as a doctorate candidate in the Department of Philosophy. In the prodemocracy movement in 1989, together with Xiang Xiaoji and Shen Tong, Jiang Qisheng became one of the executive members of the student delegation to the dialogue and one of the executive members of the Autonomous Student Council in the Chinese People's University. He also managed the "Voice of Beijing" broadcast station. After the 4 June Incident, Jiang Qisheng was jailed in Beijing's Qincheng Prison and was released on 7 February 1991. After his release, Jiang Qisheng continued his theoretical research and also helped Ding Zilin, who lost her son in the 4 June Incident, in visiting families of other victims and to distribute the donation money to them. Thus, he was traced by the security personnel. On 5 April, he was openly beaten up by the security personnel. Jiang did not give in and demanded that those who used violence against him make a written apology to him; otherwise, he would take legal action against them in order to safeguard his personal freedom and dignity.
