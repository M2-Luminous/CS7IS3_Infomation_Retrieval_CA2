FBIS3-28292 "dreas025__a94004" FBIS-EAS-94-025-A Document Type:Daily Report 7 February 1994 ANNEX Japan Bureaucrats React to Statement OW0502134894 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN in Japanese 5 Feb 93 Morning Edition p 1 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0502134894 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] It was learned on 4 February that during a series of meetings with Japanese cabinet ministers, U.S. Trade Representative Kantor proposed that "Japanese and American politicians join delegations of the two countries to the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks." In a bid to hammer out an accord in the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks prior to the Japan-U.S. summit slated for 11 February, vice ministerial talks will be held in Washington beginning 7 February. The United States is still critical of Japanese bureaucrats, saying, "No progress can be expected because of tough Japanese bureaucrats." Mr. Kantor's proposal is believed aimed at extracting concessions from Japan on the issue of setting numerical targets which have become a focal point at the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks by having Japanese cabinet ministers attend the talks. In response, the Japanese Government rejected Mr. Kantor's proposal, saying, "We do not want to bring any change to the way the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks are held," (says a senior official in the Ministry of International Trade and Industry). As a result, vice ministerial officials from the two countries will hold the talks. Speaking at a news conference on 4 February, Mr. Kantor said, "Foreign Minister Hata will lead the Japanese effort and he will assume the responsibility for the talks." In this way, Mr. Kantor talked as if the Foreign Minister had promised him during a meeting that he would assume the responsibility for the talks. In response, Japanese bureaucrats reacted against Mr. Kantor's statement, saying, "Foreign Minister Hata did not make that promise," and confirmed anew that mainly working-level officials will attend the talks.
