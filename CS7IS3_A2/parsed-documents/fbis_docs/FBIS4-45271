After noting that the government and the Armed Forces are in charge of keeping public order and preserving state security, he said this duty is being reduced more and more with each budget cut and every time a combat unit is disbanded. He said those who have suggested such cuts have not taken into account the great harm being done to the country. "But we obey all orders from the president without question," he added. He also said there are no disputes within the Armed Forces over the crisis that the institution is experiencing. "There are no blocs that either favor or oppose the restrictions." All of the men have become highly professional because of the training of troops in several exercises conducted jointly with the U.S. Army support. No special training for troops or officers can be completed if U.S. economic aid is reduced, he said. Gen. Armijo Ucles said the equipment used by the Public Security Force belongs to the Armed Forces. Therefore, these arms will have to be returned to the Army once the Attorney General's Office takes control of the police. He added, "The decision could be changed, however, providing the government and the Higher Council reach a better understanding." He said he wished the new police force a good start. "We are awaiting the results. We hope the crime rate will not increase, because this would present problems for a new and inexperienced police force." Gen. Armijo Ucles also expressed his concern for the members of the National Investigations Directorate [DNI], "most of whom will enter the ranks of the unemployed." He warned about the possibility of jobless DNI agents being hired by drug traffickers or becoming ruffians whose activities could disrupt the country's order and democratic system. He said the Armed Forces General Command will soon meet with the executive to outline a plan to hire the dismissed police officers. Otherwise, the people will have to deal with criminal gangs in which Armed Forces-trained agents could become death squad members or drug traffickers.
