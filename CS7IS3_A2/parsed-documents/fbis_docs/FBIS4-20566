Japanese CSO [Article by T. Kuriyama, Daihatsu Motor Co., Ltd.] [Text] Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) affects many areas of automobile design. The development of the supercomputer has spurred interest in CFD research. There are very few case studies in which CFD has been used as a design tool. The areas that present the biggest difficulties in using CFD include geometrical complexity, unsteady and turbulent flows, and boundary conditions. In this paper, we present some practical ways in which CFD has been used, and outline what the requirements are for using CFD. We also discuss the management of CFD R&D. 1. Introduction Starting in 1986, right about the same time that supercomputers first appeared, scientists working in the field of CAE analysis began doing research into collision analysis and fluid analysis. Collision analysis is being used more and more in design and laboratory testing, and has contributed enormously to shorter lead times for new automobiles, lower prototype costs, and improved performance. On the other hand, however, there appears to be some doubts about fluid analysis as exemplified by aerodynamic analysis. We believe that this is due to the fact that very little has been produced in the way of concrete results where fluid analysis has been used in design, despite the fact that a great deal of time and effort has gone into R&D. In this paper, we try not to describe the complex techniques used in analyzing fluids, but rather discuss the question of what we could expect if computational fluid dynamics was used in research and development and design with a personal view toward uses in this company. 2. Reasons Why is CFD Ineffective in Design As we can see from Table 1, there are a lot of areas where CFD has a direct effect on the performance of a car. In the last few years in particular, companies are turning to CFD as a design tool for achieving lower fuel consumption, lower exhaust emissions, and better driving comfort, and it would not be overstating matters to say that CFD is being used more and more. There are some CFD researchers who believe that the technology would have already been developed if high-performance computers were available, but as things stand now, CFD is inadequate in terms of reliability, analysis precision, cost-performance, and ease of use. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.

(2) It cannot produce a mesh around complex shapes very easily (Cartesian mesh, BFC, unstructured mesh, etc.). (3) It takes a long time to do calculations and requires a large memory (no inexpensive, large-scale CPUs or memories available at present time). What is at the bottom of this is that more than 10[.sup]13[/] grid points are needed in order to calculate three-dimensional mixed flows (based on the Kolmogorov vortex scale of Re10[.sup]6[/] Reynolds number), and no matter how advanced super high-speed parallel computers become, there is still a limit in numerical analysis to being able to directly solve Navier-Stokes equations that describe viscous flows. 3. Various CFD Approaches 3.1 Mixed Flow Model At the present time, one of the practical problems being faced in theoretical research into CFD is constructing a mixed flow model. This is a problem of trying to present a comprehensive picture of flow by averaging the amount of small swirls and fluctuations in a mixed flow. The Japanese automobile industry is divided into those companies whose researchers use the k-_e_ mixed flow model, and those companies whose researchers do not use the mixed flow model but rather solve direct Navier-Stokes equations by rough computational grids. In Table 2, we show the unique characteristics of both approaches. The important point to remember here is that both approaches have their weaknesses. When considering CFD use in design, the following conditions must be met: (1) Simple generalized computation method (2) Inexpensive high-speed output (3) Reliable calculations and evaluation methods ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 2. CFD Approaches | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Computation Accur-|Number of Computa-|Computation Time | | |acy |tion Grids | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |k-_e_ mixed flo-|Not very good |Normal - 20,000-30|Short - from 2 to | |w model | |,000 points |20 hours | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |3-dimensional adv-|Depends on grid |Very many - more |Long - more than 1| |anced calculus me-| |than 1 million po-|00 hours | |thod | |ints | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Moreover, the technical level at which most designers wish to see CFD is not for absolute evaluations having the same level of accuracy as experiments but rather in relative evaluations in which designers can judge the relative merits of a number of different design plans. Even if the supercomputer makes notable progress in the future in terms of the above conditions, it will still be necessary to introduce appropriate models to analyze mixed flows. We could say that the CFD approach using the k-_e_ mixed flow model is the early method of choice among design specialists at this time. There are some designers, however, who have the knowhow to know the weaknesses of the k-_e_ mixed flow model, and are able to make careful analysis and analyze relative changes. 3.2 Pre- and Post-Processing Programs--Areas of Complexity In CFD, it is necessary to form discrete spaces around an object having a complex shape, that is, to divide it into a grid. Some different types of grids include Cartesian meshes, body-fitted coordinate meshes, and non-structural meshes, but there are no discrete methods at the present time which integrate these. For that reason, it is necessary to separate grid types according to their strengths and weaknesses as shown in Table 3. Conversely, however, since there are no good grid-generating preprocessing programs that specialize in fluid analysis, a decision has to be made with regard to the desired accuracy and the time allowed to produce the grid. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 3. Preprocessing Characteristics | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Time |Flexibility |Accuracy |Software | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Cartesian mesh|**** |**** |** |STREAM | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |BFC |** |** |**** |SCRYU FIRE | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Non-structura-|** |*** |*** |STAR-CD | |l mesh | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- The use of post-processing software, which visualizes flow, is divided into those uses having mainly to do with good responses, i.e. being able to simply compare calculated results with actual measurements, and to use those mainly concerned with beautiful appealing visual presentations although they might be more time-consuming and expensive. 3.3 Computer and CFD The person in charge of computational flow dynamics is always complaining about the CPU not having enough memory. This is because the finer he/she draws the mesh, the greater the importance of computational accuracy. The addition of more grid points is not an issue when it comes to structural analysis. Thereupon, what is necessary is that the person in charge of CFD be aware of the purpose for which it is being used. It is important that CFD be steadily made more practical while techniques are developed that enable it to be used with fewer large-scale calculations and better cost-performance. It will not be too many years from now when we see a technical revolution in supercomputers in which massive parallel computers and supercomputers will be downsized to desktop models. In any event, we must not forget that developing computational flow dynamics based on advances in computers will realistically yield more useful analyses and alleviate some of the work entrusted to designers. 4. Present Status of CFD in Daihatsu In Figures 1, 2, 3, and 4 [figures not reproduced], we show some examples of the work Daihatsu is doing with CFD in R&D and design.[.sup](1-3)[/] Also, in Figure 5, we show the computer system being used with CFD. We select a hardware and software suited to the type of analysis and put it into full service. We check the following basic points when developing a model: (1) Ascertain the needs of the designer and determine the time required. (2) Lay down the results to come out of analysis in stages. (3) Select a method that does not require a lot of CPUs. Figure 5. CFD Supercomputing Network Organizationally speaking, the persons in charge of CFD are assigned to a single group and are responsible for both hardware and software. This naturally promotes a good interchange with respect to problem areas and knowhow, and enables models to be developed with greater efficiency. Moreover, the design, testing, and CFD groups have formed a single entity and are promoting various R&D activities including projects involving the development of new automobiles. 5. R&D Computer makers have been coming out with one new product after another, but software companies too have been coming out with one new CFD software package after another. One of the big choices that has to be made with regards to software is whether to purchase it on the market, or develop it in-house. There has been a tendency until now to equate the development of software with a company's technical strength, but in recent years, the questions have come down buying commercial software or developing it in-house software, and how far does it go in clarifying phenomena and how much does it contribute to product development. The research institutes of companies are no longer places that develop software, but instead are becoming places that develop and apply analysis techniques and knowhow. If we talk about effective research or improving technology, it generally means adapting software to fit the needs of the company after it has been purchased, and developing new technologies with in-house knowhow. To that extent, the performance of commercial software has been much improved over the past few years. The research conducted by universities and corporations is naturally quite different. Universities focus on basic research while companies focus on applied research, so it is important that these two groups work together to exchange information. In other words, it would probably be more effective for companies to adopt the specialized system of research shown in Figure 6. Figure 6. Role of Various Laboratories in CFD Research 6. Making CFD Useful in Design In order for CFD to be used in design, we will start providing the design specialists and test researchers with estimates prior to the test results being received in order that we can begin trying to gain their confidence. Since the faster we get the results the better, it will be necessary to devise a way to simplify and standardize the analysis method, and be able to output data quicker. Needless to say, we think it would be best if designers were able to do the analysis, but the flow phenomenon itself is quite complex, so in most cases, a CFD specialist must be called in to determine whether the calculations are correct or not. In other words, it is important not to believe the CFD calculations as they are given, but to use estimates and opinions corrected by knowledgeable analysts. As things stand now, CFD fails to produce adequate calculations no matter what the task, so it is only natural to want to use these calculations with earlier experiences and adopt a single track approach. In other words, to ignore the parts that do not have a major effect on flows, simplify shape as much as possible, and quickly output calculations. After that, the tested knowhow that has been built up from previous test results is used as a shortcut in making CFD useful in design. 7. Conclusion Below, we list the main points taken from our discussion above on the practical use of computational flow analysis in R&D and design. (1) A computer is necessary for analyzing mixed flow models no matter how advanced. (2) Researchers must develop techniques that meet design needs. (3) If earlier knowhow is added to simplified calculations, CFD can be made sufficiently useful in design. Now and then we see an analysis in which the flows are beautifully animated and which make heavy use of computers, but more often than not, they lack a colorful presentation and are a long way from being of practical use in design. It will probably be necessary for CFD to plod along a dark and lonely road step by step until it builds up its own credibility. Bibliography 1.
