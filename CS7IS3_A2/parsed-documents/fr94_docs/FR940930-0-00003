FR940930-0-00003 FR940930-0-00002 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;CE&hyph;37&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;9032; AD 94&hyph;20-04] Airworthiness Directives; Beech Aircraft Corporation 35 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment supersedes Airworthiness Directive (AD) 57&hyph;18&hyph;01 and AD 87&hyph;20&hyph;02 R1, which currently require several ruddervator checks and modifications on certain Beech Aircraft Corporation (Beech) 35 series airplanes. This action maintains the requirements of each of the superseded AD's and requires rebalancing the ruddervators (off the airplane) anytime the ruddervator is repaired or repainted (even if stripes are added). The required action imposes no new speed restrictions. Several incidents where empennage flutter occurred on the affected airplanes prompted this action. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent structural failure of the V-tail, which could result in loss of control of the airplane. DATES: Effective November 28, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of November 28, 1994. ADDRESSES: Service information that applies to this AD may be obtained from the Beech Aircraft Corporation, P.O. Box 85, Wichita, Kansas 67201&hyph;0085. This information may also be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Larry Engler, Aerospace Engineer, Wichita Aircraft Certification Office, FAA, 1801 Airport Road, Mid-Continent Airport, Wichita, Kansas 67209; telephone (316) 946&hyph;4122; facsimile (316) 946&hyph;4407. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Several incidents involving certain Beech 35 series airplanes where empennage flutter occurred prompted the FAA to re-evaluate current airworthiness directives that relate to the same subject, and apply to the same airplane models. These AD's are: •AD 57&hyph;18&hyph;01, Amendment 39&hyph;1759, which currently requires repetitively inspecting the fuselage bulkhead for cracks, buckles, or distortion on certain Beech 35 series airplanes, and also requires checking the ruddervator to ensure that the static balance is within acceptable limits. The inspections and checks are accomplished utilizing information in Beech Service Bulletin (SB) No. 35&hyph;26, dated May 20, 1953. The Bonanza Maintenance Manual 35&hyph;590073 also specifies information for the ruddervator checks; and •AD 87&hyph;20&hyph;02 R1, Amendment 39&hyph;5944, which currently requires the following on certain Beech 35 series airplanes: (1) installing external stabilizer reinforcements; (2) inspecting the rear fuselage and bulkheads in the area of the empennage for cracks or distortion for those models equipped with an increased stabilizer chord length/overhang, and repairing or replacing any cracked or distorted parts; and (3) checking the ruddervator static balance to ensure that the static balance is within acceptable limits, and correcting if necessary.
