Toma stressed: "The United States has an excellent chance to send an unmistakable signal, not only to Argentina, but to other Latin American countries that its call for integration and joining in is genuine and not mere words." The Buenos Aires lawmaker expressed support for the sale of sophisticated U.S. radars requested by Argentina to equip the Douglas planes for training Air Force pilots. In a press communique, the ruling-party deputy also deplored UK "pressures" to prevent this operation from materializing. Toma stressed: "The United States must choose between sending a concrete signal to Argentina on its decision to be reciprocal with us or, otherwise, continue bowing to British pressure and interests." Toma warned: "There is no lasting association in which one partner alone has privileges." He expressed his hope that those who "still think like in Cold War times" will no longer sway the U.S. political "establishment." [preceding word in English]
