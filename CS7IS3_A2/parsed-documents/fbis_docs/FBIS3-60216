A new protocol was signed today. The government initiative involves three ministries: Internal Administration, Justice, and Finance. The main objectives are to combat the entry of narcotics into Portugal, prevent their distribution, and to make access to consumers more difficult. Celso Paiva reports. [Paiva] Three ministries stand united against drugs. All of them are responsible for key sectors, that if coordinated can achieve better results. From Internal Administration there is the security forces, from Finance there is the Borders Directorate-General, and from Justice there is the Judicial Police [plain clothes police] and obviously the legal processes necessary to carry out certain operations. With the protocol signed today, the government is trying to coordinate the prevention and fight against drugs. It is trying to allocate a specific mission to each entity but without them stepping on each others' toes. And together, with coordination, they will be able to fight drug trafficking. Firstly, it is necessary to fight the entry of drugs into the country, but it is also necessary to work from within: To prevent distribution and to make access to consumers more difficult. The document was signed by the directors general of the Judicial Police, of the PSP [Public Security Police], of the GNR [National Republican Guard], of the Borders Directorate-General, and of the Planning Group for the Fight Against Drugs. The three ministers were left to make the speeches. Dias Loureiro [internal administration] was the first to speak and began by revealing crime figures for 1993. A 2.5 to three percent increase, according to the minister this is a very good figure, bearing in mind that in 1992 the increase reached nine to 10 percent. Dias Loureiro was quoting figures from the Attorney General's Office. The minister went on to add that the 2.5 to three percent increase is mainly due to drugs--after all, the main topic of this meeting of the Higher Council for Internal Security. Laborinho Lucio [justice] spoke next. He confirmed the crime figures and said he was very pleased with the protocol just signed. [Announcer] The government is committed to the fight against drugs. A difficult mission as the business does not stop growing, you just have to look at the quantities of drugs being seized. Teresa Xavier reports. [Xavier] The police have stated that the amount of drugs being seized in Portugal is rising. With regard to heroin, in 1993, 86 kilos were seized--62 percent up on 1992. As for hashish, 48,000 kilos were seized in 1993--seven times the amount seized in 1992. Cocaine is an exception, the figures show a downward trend. The police said that in 1992, 1,900 kilos were seized, while last year only 166 kilos were seized. The amount of cocaine seized dropped by 91 percent. Most of the drugs were seized at borders and airports. [Begin Anselmo Louro recording, identified below] With regard to heroin, a small percentage was seized at the Vilar Formoso border. A higher percentage was seized in private homes in the interior of the country. As you know, heroin is destined for internal consumption, and it has been difficult to seize it at the borders. As for cocaine, most of it--about 80 percent or more--was seized at airports. Hashish was seized in the interior of the country, coming from ships, via the sea, and from Morocco. [end recording] [Xavier] That was Anselmo Louro from the Department for the Investigation and Fight Against Drug Trafficking. The drugs seized in Portugal come from, among other places, Germany, Peru, and Morocco. [Begin Louro recording] With regard to cocaine, most of it comes from Peru--1,754 kilos. As for hashish, the largest amount came from Morocco--8,862.3 kilos. As for heroin, 55 kilos were seized nationally, 30.235 kilos alone from Holland--more than 50 percent. [end recording] [Xavier] Heroin, cocaine, and hashish are the drugs most consumed in our country, and the ones most sought after by the police, who only manage to seize less than 10 percent of the drugs that enter Portugal.
