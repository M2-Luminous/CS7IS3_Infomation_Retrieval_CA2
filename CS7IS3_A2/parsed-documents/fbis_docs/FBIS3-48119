The so-called framework trade negotiations between Japan and the United States move up to the deputy minister level Sunday as working-level officials were struggling to complete a "progress report," their positions deadlocked over pivotal provisions of the framework accord. "I guess objective criteria will be main theme at the deputies' meeting" on government procurement, a Japanese official involved in the trade talks told reporters after completing yet another working-group session with U.S. officials Saturday. A huge Japanese Government team comprising 40 to 50 officials is in Washington for a wide range of sector-by-sector trade talks set for the coming week. Two sets of deputy minister meetings are set for Sunday, one on the implementation of existing trade agreements concluded between the two countries and the other on foreign access to the government procurement market in Japan. The U.S. insists on setting "quantitative criteria" to measure the progress of foreign access and sales in the Japanese Government procurement market. Japan has balked at the U.S. demand, arguing that any numerical yardstick would inevitably be regarded by the U.S. as a formal commitment by Japan to set aside a certain market share for foreign firms. Japanese officials appear not to be hopeful of any breakthrough on the "objective criteria" issue at the deputy ministers' meetings. "The prognosis looks dicey," one official said. The stalemate on objective criteria is just one of many gaps between the two sides on the government procurement issue. Japanese officials said there is no agreement on the scope of public entities that must be covered under new government procurement codes nor on the amount of government procurement that must be open to foreign participation. In addition to government procurement issues, other areas of framework trade talks scheduled for the coming week in Washington include sales of foreign-made automobiles and auto parts in Japan, regulatory reform and issues of competitiveness between the two countries. The entire set of negotiations is supposed to be concluded prior to the summit meeting between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton on February 11 in Washington.
