FR940706-0-00005 FR940706-0-00001 Response: Section 13951(c)(4) of the Leland Act deleted the provision of section 603 of the HPA which provided that the Secretary retained the authority to waive some or all of a State's QC claim where the Secretary determined that the State agency had good cause for failure to meet its error rate goal and that the decision of the Secretary was not subject to review by the ALJ. The Leland Act requires that the ALJ, in considering a State agency's appeal of QC liability consider all grounds for denying the claim, in whole or in part, including the contention of a State agency that the claim should be waived, in whole or in part, for good cause. The Department intends to publish a proposed rulemaking addressing the good cause criteria, as defined in the Leland Act. The regulation will be used by the Secretary and/or the Secretary's designee to assess, evaluate and respond to claims by the State for a good cause waiver of liability in conjunction with the appeals process. The Department has deleted §283.4(d) of the NPRM. Additionally, §283.5(a) of the NPRM has been amended to reflect Leland Act changes to good cause. Receipt of notice of appeal and assignment of docket number: In §283.4(e)(iii) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that the Hearing Clerk would acknowledge timely receipt of the notice of appeal and advise the State agency that the appeal petition must be filed within 30 days of service of the Hearing Clerk's letter. Comment: The Department received one comment on this provision. The commenter indicated that the 30-day deadline for filing the appeal petition is too burdensome for States and that a 60-day deadline would be more appropriate. The commenter believed that the extended time period would enable States to obtain necessary legal support and to better develop appropriate arguments in support of the appeal petition. Response: The Department has revised the deadline for filing the appeal petition from 30 days to 60 days. Section 13951(c)(4) of the Leland Act requires that the State agency submit evidence in support of the appeal not later than 60 days after receiving a notice of the claim and provides that the ALJ shall extend the 60-day deadline for cause shown. As previously discussed, §283.22(f) of this final rule requires the State agency to file a written request for the extension prior to the due date for the submission with a showing of cause for the extension. This provision is in keeping with the legislative intent of the HPA that the appeals process be streamlined and the appeal procedures be as expeditious as possible. Stay of Collection: In §283.4(f) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that a timely notice of appeal would automatically stay collection action on the QC claim. However, interest would continue to accrue on the outstanding claim. Comment: The Department received one comment on this provision. The commenter noted that since the NPRM would allow the Department to seek review by the Judicial Officer, the final determination of the ALJ may be delayed beyond the two year period during which interest on a QC claim would not accrue. The commenter suggested that in order to avoid the imposition of interest due to a delay that the State agency did not seek, the accrual of interest should be tolled (suspended) during the review by the Judicial Officer. Response: The Department has considered this comment but cannot adopt this suggestion. Section 13951(a)(2) of the Leland Act provides that interest on the unpaid claim would accrue either from a date that is one year after the date the bill is received or the date of the decision on the administrative appeal, whichever is earlier. The Leland Act does not allow a suspension of interest beyond the one-year period, regardless of the reason for the delay in a final administrative decision. Content of the Appeal Petition: In §283.4(g)(3) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that the State agency must request an oral hearing and that failure to request that hearing would result in the forfeiture of the opportunity for an oral hearing. The QC claim would then be decided using the procedures established under subpart C.
