This plain statement contains a gentle reminder to his European partners, above all, his counterpart in Bonn, Klaus Kinkel. At the beginning of the NATO spring meeting, Kinkel had created the impression that he was toying with the idea of a "special relationship" between the Alliance and Russia, which could devalue the PFP (NATO jargon). PFP is the invitation of the Alliance to the members of the defunct Warsaw Treaty and the CIS republics to enter into an as close relationship with NATO as each one of them wishes. For its part, NATO stops short at giving security guarantees, but holds out prospects of de facto membership for some PFP members. It would be almost too good to be true if this invitation were followed in a way that its initiators, the Americans, have in mind. NATO would lead such a partnership and would be the supporting pillar of a security architecture which would virtually cover the globe north of the Tropic of Cancer. In this connection, the inner cohesion of the transatlantic Alliance would remain intact, and the status of the United States as the power guaranteeing Europe's protection and security would not be in jeopardy, despite Russia's presence. The East European neighbors would get what they were really seeking -- the warming closeness of the Western super power. Thus Christopher's preventive resistance to a Russian chair with a higher back was only consistent, since Moscow with its demand for a special status had ulterior motives. Defense Minister Pavel Grachev had specifically suggested that the NATO Cooperation Council be integrated into the CSCE and NATO itself be forced, through a binding consultation mechanism, into a subordinate relationship with the CSCE. This was of course not acceptable to any of the 16 NATO allies. However, Christopher was the only one to make his allies aware that the PFP was intended as a flexible concept to honor Russia as the first power of the East. What else could a special relationship between Moscow and NATO bring about? It would certainly not replace or make unnecessary the higher hierarchy of the U.S.-Russian relationship nor, for that matter, the Europeans' search for orderly relations with the postcommunist Moscow. So the U.S. secretary of state argued logically by referring the Russians with their special wishes to the national capitals from the start. Of course, in so doing, he kept in mind that Washington is the most important of all capitals. But there is a difference if it is the United States or Russia that has "ulterior motives." The outstanding U.S. position in any European security structure is absolutely indispensable and the centerpiece of the Western security philosophy. It was not to be expected at any point that differences of opinion on the PFP would lead to a conflict within NATO. There was never a controversy, but there were differences over the precise formulation. What is more, in the difficult transition phase following the Cold War, the Alliance demonstrated almost amazing harmony in Istanbul, which sheds a paradoxical light on the European Union. The Alliance is ruled by the principle of strict unanimity, whereas the European Union has long viewed itself as something of higher value and even supranational. Nonetheless, it has not yet found its course in Europe. In NATO, however, even the French, the traditional dissidents, have fully endorsed the PFP project. In Istanbul, the West had to find an answer to Russia's special wishes. The answer has been found, there will be no special status. However, the discussion on the PFP and Russia's place in the European security architecture has not yet ended. Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev used delaying tactics in Istanbul and called for further talks. He would possibly have agreed to a supplementary protocol that Kinkel had suggested prior to the NATO meeting. The German foreign minister's argument is not unrealistic. Kinkel wants the Alliance to take into account that actually, it does not have the leeway of action that it claims it has toward Russia. He argues that NATO will be careful not to act against Moscow's declared will in East Europe, because, moreover, this would lead away from its goal, since security cannot be created there in confrontation with Russia. Antagonism would devalue the PFP and even reverse it. Its higher goal is to make Moscow agree to East Europe's orientation to the West. No front line in Europe, is the Germans' motto. In dealing with Russia, however, the European allies are constantly reminded of the fact that it is the United States that has the decisive say on European security problems. Europe has always fared well with this principle.
