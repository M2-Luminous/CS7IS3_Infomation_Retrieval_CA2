The talks, scheduled to have started Friday, follow a ceasefire signed Monday by Georgia and Abkhazian separatists which allows for multinational peacekeeping force to be sent to the breakaway republic in northwest Georgia. The meeting, to be headed by Butrus-Ghali's special representative Eduard Brunner, is to deal only with military aspects of the agreement such as the number and deployment of the maximum 2,500 troops. The trickier question of Abkhazia's status will be discussed in Geneva on April 19 at a meeting of the two sides, Russian and UN facilitators and members of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the spokeswoman said. Last week's ceasefire agreement aimed to help the return of some 250,000 Georgian civilians who have fled the area in more than a year of war, and holds out the possibility of far-reaching autonomy for Abkhazia within Georgia. Talks on the return of refugees began Friday in Sochi in Russia, presided over by Russia and the UN High Commission for Refugees [UNHCR], Gastaut said. On Thursday, the two sides accused each other of violating the ceasefire which had been signed in the presence of UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev.
