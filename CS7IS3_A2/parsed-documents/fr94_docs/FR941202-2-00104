FR941202-2-00104 FR941202-2-00070 DEPARTMENT OF STATE [Public Notice 2124] Bureau of Consular Affairs; Registration for the Diversity Immigrant (DV&hyph;96) Visa Program ACTION: Notice of registration for the second year of the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program. This public notice provides information on the application procedures for the 55,000 immigrant visas to be made available in the DV category during Fiscal Year 1996. This notice is issued pursuant to 22 CFR 42.33 which implements Sections 201(a)(3), 201(e), 203(c) and 204(a)(1)(G) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended, (8 U.S.C. 1151, 1153, and 1154). The Department published regulations related to this Notice in the Federal Register on March 31, 1994 [59 FR 15303.] Information on the Application Procedures for the 55,000 Immigrant Visas To Be Made Available in the DV Category During Fiscal Year 1996 Sections 201(a)(3), 201(e), 203(c) and 204(a)(1)(G) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended, taken together establish, effective for Fiscal Year 1996 and thereafter, an annual numerical limitation of 55,000 for diversity immigrants. Aliens who are natives of countries determined by the Attorney General according to a mathematical formula specified by the law will be able to compete for immigration under this limitation. This program for Fiscal Year 1996 is identified by the visa symbol DV&hyph;96 and is informally known as the ``visa lottery.'' The law specifies that there must be a separate registration for each year's DV visas. This information concerns the application period during 1995 for visas to be issued during Fiscal Year 1996. Qualifying Countries and Areas Under the DV&hyph;96 Program The law apportions immigrant visa issuance among six geographic regions (Africa, Asia, Europe, North America_other than Mexico, Oceania, and South America including Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean) according to a formula based on total immigrant admissions over the most recent five-year period. The formula identifies both high and low admission regions and high admission foreign states. A greater share of the available visa numbers go to low admission regions than to high admission regions. High admission states are excluded entirely from the program. No single country may receive more than 7 percent (3,850) of the world-wide total of visa numbers. The U.S. Attorney General has determined as follows the countries whose natives (term is explained in question 1) are entitled to apply for DV visas for Fiscal Year 1996. According to the law, countries are grouped by region (see list at the end of this notice). The allotment of visa numbers for each region is shown in parentheses below: Africa: (20,426)␣All countries. Asia: (7,087)␣All countries EXCEPT the following: China_mainland born and Taiwan born, India, Philippines, Vietnam, and South Korea. (Hong Kong is eligible.)
