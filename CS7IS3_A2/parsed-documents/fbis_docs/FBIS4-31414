[Meciar] Many issues have been resolved compared with 1992. Slovakia has become an independent state, and its foreign policy orientation is also clear. The transformation process is continuing. It is necessary, first and foremost, to deal with economic issues. Our domestic conditions also need to be arranged afresh. If we win the elections, we will have new policy priorities in the HZDS. Our strategy is changing; the next four years will require something different from what it has been up to now. [EXTRA SLOVENSKO] If you were to win the elections, would you sever all links to the current government, or would you carry on with the things you consider to be good? [Meciar] This government has made several mistakes. It has halted the construction of the state and the state administration. It has, admittedly, implemented a verbal continuity, but, in fact, it prefers a different strategy for economic life. While we chose the strategy of recovery, it is proceeding toward a strategy of restriction. It favors a different form of privatization; it is returning to what was rejected in 1993. So, we could not follow up on this. We would have to go back to 1992. [EXTRA SLOVENSKO] If you were to lose the elections, would you leave politics? [Meciar] Probably, yes. I am offering the citizen an alternative. If you do not want it, fine, you have others. [EXTRA SLOVENSKO] Why do you not have a good personal image in many countries? What do you intend to do to change this situation? [Meciar] First and foremost, if we win the elections, the Foreign Ministry has to improve. Every state and its representatives make a name for themselves abroad via the professionals, which is something I personally have not made use of yet. We also never had a foreign lobby, although the potential for organizing one from among Slovaks is great. We never knew how to address them properly. We have to change this.
