The Visit in Figures $400 million is the cost of the joint work on a space station. U.S. Vice President Al Gore said at a press conference on Thursday that Russian participation will make the project "better, cheaper, and quicker." Stressing another aspect, Viktor Chernomyrdin said that Russians "are not doing anyone favors," inasmuch as we have managed to get a decent price for our endeavors. But the main point clearly is that money to keep our space industry as a going concern will continue to come in from the United States. The overall cost of the project, according to the pessimists, is $30 billion. The pessimists in the House of Representatives numbered 215 -- that's a pretty large number, but it was one less than the optimists, and that proved sufficient for the project to start to implemented. $820 million is the promised and repromised money for systemic transformations which was allocated Russia in Tokyo one year ago, but it has all been deferred because of inflation and delays with reforms. The World Bank is now granting the money and promises to allocate even more -- all of it, of course, has to be repaid. The IMF has allocated $300 for highway repairs, $200 million for the development of Russian banks, $240 million for private farms, and $80 million for measures connected with land reform. Is it necessary to remind people that the IMF -- a purely commercial organization -- grants money for projects which it regards as promising and will recover it all with interest -- by hook or by crook. These are all sizable figures, but they are not the biggest. That comes next. $9 billion and 10 Affable Jews The Russian premier began his stay in Washington with a problem that he had never dealt with in his life and ended it with a matter that he has dealt with throughout his life. It is rare occurrence when such diverse questions are so closely linked. The premier began his visit with a meeting with leaders of American Jewry. This happened immediately after his arrival -- this meeting, which was certainly scheduled in advance, was not announced on the itinerary of the visit and was known to only a very restricted circle of people in the embassy. During the course of the 90-minute meeting the 10 delegates from the National Conference on Soviet Jewry asked the head of government the most varied questions connected with the emigration of fellow-Jews who want to leave Russia and with ensuring a decent life for those who wish to remain there. Viktor Chernomyrdin showed patience, gave exhaustive answers, and was well disposed toward them. He gave assurances regarding the small number of refuseniks (less than a dozen) who have not obtained the right to leave because of their access, according to the Russian authorities, to state secrets. He outlined a government program to combat anti-Semitism. He promised close cooperation wiith Israel's ministries of culture and national education [as published] in drawing up appropriate programs in Russia. In short, the premier so pleased his interlocutors that they promised him their full support and subsequently themselves telephoned various news agencies to ensure that they reflected the deep satisfaction felt by these influential representatives of an influential community at their meeting with the premier of the new Russia. A meeting immediately followed with former Congressman Vanik, coauthor with legislator Jackson, now deceased, of the well-known amendment which bears their names. The Jackson-Vanik Amendment, which became law at the height of the Cold War, forbids the granting of most-favored nation status to a country where human rights are violated in the form of people being prevented from leaving the state. Given that it is not difficult to leave Russia now, the codrafter of the law recognized it was obsolete. As a high-ranking member of the delegation reported, "Vanik said that he now regrets having proposed such a law." Although there is more politeness than truth in that remark, the problem is now becoming both more serious and bizarre. If present-day Russia maintains its course, the U.S. president will certainly extend most-favored nation status each year. This will virtually have no effect on many kinds of commercial exchange. However, ultralarge, long-term investment becomes a top-level matter so long as the amendment is not repealed. No one wants to risk many billions of dollars which may turn a profit only after decades. The advent of a new government -- and not just in Russia but in the United States too -- becomes potentially dangerous. It is very difficult to change laws in America. It is difficult to pass them. It is difficult to repeal them. Thousands of proposed amendments remain simply vain endeavors, mustering just one or two votes. But laws are repealed by the same procedure. And that is why Viktor Chernomyrdin needs not just the sympathy but the active help of the Jewish community in the United States to repeal the Jackson-Vanik Amendment. The community put immense effort into getting it passed at the time. Today the Russian premier, acting in a completely new sphere for him, is doing his utmost to ensure that the Jews of America help Moscow, as they did during War II. The delegates of the Jewish community promised to do this after their uplifting meeting with him, which is why the work with which Chernomyrdin has been professionally occupied all his life has now become realizable in practice. During his last visit here last September the Russian premier, who is a gas and oil industry man by profession, devoted a lot of time to the Marathon Oil company. This oil concern -- a pretty major company, albeit not a giant -- enjoyed his special attention during his visit to Houston, Texas. Some Russian experts claimed at the time that Marathon was developing a very profitable project for Russia involving work at Sakhalin. Marathon has now become the leading company in the Sakhalin Energy Investment consortium, which is investing #9 billion in developing the Sakhalin shelf, with its rich reserves of oil and natural gas. In the opinion of experts from the Chernomyrdin-Gore group, total U.S. investment, which now stands at approximately $1 billion, will grow to $40-50 billion by the end of the decade. True to himself, the prime minister preferred to talk about the economy, but you can't escape politics in his job. Moreover, the meeting with Clinton took place the day after the signing of the agreement with NATO in Brussels -- you couldn't, in general, devise a better situation. But the premier himself has been persistent in creating an atmosphere of openness, friendship, and understanding that a partner has national interests; and most importantly, whether assenting or dissenting, he has sought to speak the same language in both politics and economics. Only one sticky moment arose. On Thursday, from early morning on, all Washington political circles were discussing an article in THE NEW YORK TIMES claiming that the Russian Government is not providing full information on work on chemical weapons, that is to say, improvement of binary gases is continuing, and that the revelations by the chemist Vil Mirzoyanov, whom the Russian authorities -- with staggering clumsiness -- tried to imprison, are confirmed by other sources at CIA and military department level. Nevertheless, CIA Director R. James Woolsey and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Shalikashvili advised the legislators to ratify the treaty on the prohibition of chemical weapons. And although doubts among the congressmen are considerable, the majority do seem inclined to ratify it if Russia is more frank and honest in furnishing information. Whether Chernomyrdin failed to be briefed by his aides or whether he himself failed to pay heed (perhaps out of dear Moscow habit he thought it doesn't matter what they write in the newspapers there), his answer at the press conference was brusque but unconvincing: This is all nonsense born of utter ignorance. That may be the case, of course. However, in America they have somehow gotten used to the idea that if THE NEW YORK TIMES, the CIA, and the Defense Department make a claim it is better to attempt to rebut it with more proof and less emotion. Vice President Al Gore hurried to help out his colleague and cochairman, suggesting that in Moscow, unlike Washington, the top leaders don't have time to read the newspapers first thing in the morning. But that was merely a sideshow. On the whole, the current premier, who, even one year ago frightened capitalist-raised kids here, has proved to be fully deserving of the assessments which World Bank President Jacques Camdessus [name and title as published] brought back from Moscow in the spring. In a number of interviews and private discussions Jacques Camdessus expressed complete satisfaction at not just his week spent in Moscow but -- most importantly -- the approach to the economic realities by the Russian premier himsslf. Camdessus would most likely not have experienced such a happy shock had Gaydar still been in that high post. They had probably not expected from Chernomyrdin such commitment to tough monetarist policy, steadfastness in pursuing a market course, or readiness to crush all who stand in the way of the country's financial recovery. Had Camdessus understood the real meaning of the Soviet expression "our man," he might well have used it. The World Bank president's views had merely grown stronger by the time of Viktor Chernomyrdin's arrival. Demonstrating in every possible way his support for Russia (for lack of which he severely criticized Vice President Al Gore and Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott), he said that Russia "is making determined efforts in favor of reforms and stabilizations." Reflecting the growing opinion here that Prime Minister Chernomyrdin has serious chances of becoming Boris Yeltsin's successor, the U.S. vice president said: "Mr. Chernomyrdin is a tremendous leader of Russia as regards the active implementation of reforms." Relations between our countries do not simply develop dynamically, they also have their ups and their downs. It now looks as if the latest up following a down has begun. All 22 of the documents prepared in advance have been signed, including those regarding whose prospects very serious misgivings had been voiced. For example, the treaty stopping the manufacture of plutonium looked to have slim chances of survival. Russia demanded compensation, the United States did not understand why, strictly speaking, it should pay, given that it is doing the same thing back home on a reciprocal basis. They have agreed to an apparently strange compromise. The treaty was signed not by ministers, as envisaged, but at a higher level -- by Chernomyrdin and Gore. The United States won't give money for the shutdown of production. However, it will allocate $1 million for research work in two Russian scintific research institutes. Of course, no single meeting clears up absolutely everything. The problems of chemical weapons remain for Naples, where Boris Yeltsin will go to talk with the G-7 leaders. Decisions are still awaited on the question of NATO, nearby foreign parts, peacemaking efforts, and so forth, on which neither side has given an exhaustive answer to date. And this is unlikely to emerge by September, when Boris Yeltsin will be coming to the United States.
