These reports included a statement by an informed Palestinian source in Tunis which says that this development in the Palestinian stand comes in the wake of the failure of all political and diplomatic efforts and moves led by the PLO since the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre at all levels to make Israel respond to the Palestinian demands to disarm the settlers in the occupied territories and to provide an international presence to protect the Palestinians living under the occupation. The Palestinian source added that the Palestinian leadership is following with concern the premeditated U.S. prevarication aiming to thwart a Security Council resolution on the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, especially in light of the insinuations by a number of officials in the U.S. Mission at the United Nations on the possibility of delaying the Security Council debate on the issue until further notice. This source revealed that the Palestinian leadership has received demands from Palestine National Council members and a number of national figures in the occupied territories demanding the breaking off of negotiations. The Tunisian newspaper AL-SABAH today cited a prominent Palestinian source as saying that the Palestinian leadership is still continuing diplomatic efforts in an attempt to break the deadlock in the negotiations. This source did not rule out the possibility that the coming few days could be decisive for either speeding up the peace process or closing this file for good. The same paper also cites informed Palestinian sources as saying that Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat refrained from following up on the telephone call he received from Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin the day before yesterday lest any talk could be construed as a return to the peace negotiations, which were halted as a result of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. The sources added that 'Arafat explained this position as insistence on the official and popular Palestinian stand of waiting for a clear resolution from the Security Council that condemns the massacre and its perpetrators, sends international observers to the occupied territories, demands the disarming of the settlers and the removal of the settlements, and ensures security. They added that the PLO command also wants to know the results of the official Israeli investigation and the identity of those responsible for not providing protection for the worshipers in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque. Regarding the several contacts held recently between the Palestinian leadership and Russian envoys, the Palestinian source said that Russia now has new and positive stands on the issue of peace in the Middle East and these stands stem from the restoration of the Russian political leadership's self-confidence resulting from defusing the armed conflict between Serbia and NATO over Bosnia. The source noted that Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev will visit Tunis in the next 48 hours to continue the consultations and efforts on the Middle East. It said that Russia supports the Palestinian demands and the Palestinian side agrees to the Russian proposal to hold a second international conference on the Middle East, which will be a new Madrid conference. The source expressed the belief that Russia has made a strong and influential return to the Middle East on the basis of a new concept of its relations with the countries of the region. It said that the PLO will hold meetings at the Executive Committee, expanded leadership, and possibly the Central Council levels in the next few days to assess the situation.
