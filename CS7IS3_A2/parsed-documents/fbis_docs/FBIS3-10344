The PRI members have gathered at the central plaza and are armed with sticks and stones under the surveillance of the police who have not intervened up until now, according to sources from the municipality of Teoloyucan, which has a population of 52,000. Pedro Zenteno, the municipal mayor of Teoloyucan, told EFE that the municipal palace was looted, some windows were shattered, and part of the building was set on fire by the PRI members. Zenteno was appointed municipal mayor of Teoloyucan by the Congress of the State of Mexico on 25 January, after participating in the municipal elections on 14 November. The PRD leader in the state of Mexico, Gerardo Fernandez Norona, told EFE that the situation in Teoloyucan "is delicate" because the state government "has had difficulties in enforcing the decisions of the congress." We know that "behind the group of PRI members are strong interests and chieftains, who have even clashed with Mexico State Governor Emilio Chuayffet Chemor. The PRI spokesman in the state of Mexico, Eleazar Flores Arriaga, told EFE: "We know there is a group of people who are unhappy with the acting mayor; we do not know if they are PRI members. I could not say for sure." He denied that the municipal palace was burned and said a fire only broke out in the attic, where a group of persons looted some offices.
