Rejecting the two nonpapers given by the Pakistan Foreign Office to the Indian high commissioner in Islamabad yesterday, New Delhi said the question of plebiscite in any part of India, including Jammu and Kashmir, simply does not arise. Terming the non-papers as Pakistan's propaganda, a spokesman of the External Affairs Ministry said in New Delhi today that the exercise is an attempt to obscure the realities of the situation in Jammu and Kashmir. He said that violence in the state is being created by militants and foreign mercenaries trained and equipped by Pakistan to erode the territorial integrity and political stability of India. Recalling New Delhi's repeated call upon Pakistan to desist from sponsoring trans-border terrorism, he said India has the will and the commitment of the people of Jammu and Kashmir to counter the violence generated by militants with external support.
