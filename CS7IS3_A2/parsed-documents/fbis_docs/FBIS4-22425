(Including $2.703 billion to Russia, $693 million to Turkmeniya, $28 million to Moldavia [Moldova] and $1.3 million to Kazakhstan.) Aleksey Berezhnoy, chief of the department of foreign debt for the Ukrainian Finance Ministry's currency-economic administration, reported this. He noted that in 1994, according to an intergovernmental agreement, they plan to pay nearly $1.5 billion (including $421 million to countries of the far abroad, $668 million to Russia and $359 million to Turkmeniya) although at the present time Ukraine does not have available the hard currency funds in the amount which would allow it to service its foreign creditors. Mr. Berezhnoy remarked that this year payment of the debt to Russia included the basic debt and interest in accordance with an intergovernmental agreement. As regards the debt to Turkmeniya, it is a result of the unbalanced import of energy sources for Ukraine's enterprises and agriculture. It is expected that by the end of the year the centralized hard currency funds, the amount of which today does not exceed $1 billion, will increase to $1.3 billion due to profits from exports according to state contracts. According to forecasts of Ukraine's Ministry of Economics, the general profit from exports will amount to $20 billion by the end of the year. However, the same amount of expenditures on critical imports is planned (in 1993 Ukraine was able to ensure receipt of only 20 percent of the predicted profits from exports). In the opinion of experts from Ukraine's Ministry of Economics, the debt problem can only be solved after the resumption of trading in freely convertible currency in Ukraine's interbank currency market and the liberalization of foreign economic activity. According to Mr. Berezhnoy's information, the republic government is currently reviewing a draft Ukrainian-Latvian agreement which is also supposed to determine the amount of Ukrainain debt to Latvia for 1993.
