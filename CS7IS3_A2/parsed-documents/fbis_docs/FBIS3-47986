There are some optimistic views in the capitals of South Korea, the United States and Japan that Pyongyang is approaching a limit in its diplomatic hide-and-seek over the nuclear problem, and may drop the nuclear card and instead try flexibility by announcing an open policy, which the diplomats said was "dangerous and utterly wishful thinking." North Korea's acceptance in recent talks with the United States of international nuclear inspections is simply a tactical move to get the South Korea-U.S. "Team Spirit" military exercise suspended and therefore cannot be regarded as a basic change in attitude, they said. Pyongyang is well aware that Washington will raise the question of human rights after the nuclear issue is settled, threatening a peaceful transfer of power from Kim Il-song to his son, Kim Chong-il. With that in mind, the Stalinist regime will not bare all of its nuclear sites nor give up its nuclear program unless it is sure not only that it is out of danger of economic sanctions from the United States and the Team Spirit drill has been stopped, but also that it is guaranteed diplomatic normalization with Washington and Tokyo, recognition and support for its communist regime, and economic aid, they said. Pyongyang, which displayed sophisticated diplomatic maneuvering with its surprise withdrawal from the nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty in March last year, is apparently well aware of the fact that Washington is worried North Korea's nuclear development might cause Seoul and Tokyo to go nuclear as well. The communist country seems to have decided that the United States may find it to be a hard work to apply military threats against it, the diplomats speculated. A senior South Korean diplomat, agreeing with these views, said that North Korea will not give up its nuclear card unless it wins diplomatic recognition from Washington and a safety guarantee for its communist regime. Beijing knows this, he said, and is limited in its ability to persuade Pyongyang. If the prerequisites are not met, North Korea is unlikely to change to an open policy as many expect and the current situation shows that the leadership is in no hurry to resolve the nuclear issue and prepare for openness, he said. An eastern European diplomat said that a friend in Pyongyang had told him that North Korea is weighing whether to pursue peace or wage war over the nuclear problem, and that some citizens and soldiers are prepared to fight the perceived enemy.
