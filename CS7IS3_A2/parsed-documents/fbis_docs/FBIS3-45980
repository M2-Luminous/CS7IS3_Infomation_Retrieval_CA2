"We cannot let those countries and people working to rid themselves of tyrannical rule fall into slavery again," Lee said during an address to the World Freedom Day gathering here. All countries should join hands to promote economic development and improve the people's livelihood in an effort to eliminate the source of world violence, the president said. For the future of world liberty, the president added, the world should confirm the achievements in the Middle East and South Africa and condemn regimes which use political power to intervene in the democratic movement. The world should urge these countries to release political prisoners and encourage joint efforts to halt the proliferation of nuclear weapons, he said. More than 500 political leaders from some 40 countries around the world were present at the gathering, sponsored by the World League for Freedom and Democracy and the Asian Pacific League for Freedom and Democracy. The organizations were established 40 years ago with the purpose of promoting world freedom following the defection of 14,000 Chinese Communists POWs to Taiwan.
