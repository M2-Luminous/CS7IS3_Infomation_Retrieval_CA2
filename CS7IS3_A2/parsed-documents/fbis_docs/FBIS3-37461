Andrejevs cited the size of the military personnel at the Skrunda radar, the size of the radar's rent and the social status of retired servicemen in Latvia as the main obstacles that block Latvia and Russia from withdrawal agreement. Commenting on the controversial citizenship issue, Andrejevs reminded Hurd that Latvia suffered from a heavy influx of Russian-speaking immigrants during the 50-year Soviet occupation. At the same time, Andrejevs said, Latvia takes into account the reality of today and understands that "some compromises" are needed to implement a slow and careful process of naturalization. Latvia regards its enrollment to NATO's Partnership for Peace program as the first step toward full-fledged membership in the Western alliance, Andrejevs said. Hurd praised Latvia's efforts to return to Europe saying that "we see Latvia as part of the European family." Hurd also spoke positively of Latvia's resolution to compromise with Russia on the Skrunda radar installation. The foreign secretary pledged his countries' support to Latvia and other Baltic states in becoming active participants of the Partnership program.
