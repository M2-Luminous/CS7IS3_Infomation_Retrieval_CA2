The decision applies to areas where dangerous, ramshackle houses and crowded old-style alleys account for more than 50 percent of residential space. Investors will enjoy preferential prices for the lease of land use rights and the limit for the lease of land use rights will be 70 years, according to the decision. Under the decision, an investor may acquire land use rights after turning over to the government a sum of money. Investors will have to shoulder relocation fees and other expenses. The foreign-funded commercial housing will be targeted at Chinese individuals, enterprises or institutions, the decision noted. Investors will have to re-sign the contracts for the lease of land use rights if they want to sell the houses abroad, the decision pointed out.
