The message notes serious concern over the course of developments in Crimea. Ukraine's government knows that China maintains a consistent and clear stance with regard to our state's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. This principled stance is outlined in the communique on the establishment of diplomatic relations between our countries, and in the Chinese-Ukrainian joint communique signed in 1992. During a discussion of Sevastopol's independence at a session of the UN Security Council last year, the Chinese side voted to support Ukraine's position on the basis of these principles. "China will always adhere to these principles in its relations with Ukraine," the message notes.
