A production growth, however, can be expected only in some branches of industry (i.e. consumer goods, chemicals, wood-processing, and some areas of mechanical engineering) and in construction. On the other hand, a further decline is likely in coal mining, metallurgy, and agriculture. We can again expect imports to grow faster than exports. This is a result of the growth of personal and public consumption and the demand for investments arising from the necessary change of the production basis. This deficit will be probably covered by a surplus of services in the balance of payments, which, as a whole, will be balanced. Our economic development will be favorably affected next year particularly by the following: -- a continuing stability of the currency -- a substantial decline in the rate of inflation -- the interest of private owners in good management -- a recovery of demand (a moderate increase in personal consumption and investment activities on the domestic market and the possibility of placing Czech goods on some foreign markets) -- social peace and, in comparison with other countries, a relatively low rate of unemployment -- budget stability -- an increased interest of foreign capital in investing in the Czech Republic. On the other hand, the ongoing recovery process in our economy will apparently bring also some negative trends, for instance: -- pressure for a growth of wages faster than that of social productivity -- a high insolvency of companies and enterprises -- the harmful effect of bankruptcies on business partners of the bankrupt enterprises, i.e. also on banks -- a regional disparity of certain phenomena, such as unemployment, for instance. Of the foreign influences, in addition to the, on the whole, already compensated-for losses of the markets in the former socialist camp, we can be unfavorably affected, above all, by the following: -- the certain uncertainty in the future development of the economic relations with the Slovak Republic -- the surviving protectionist efforts of the economically advanced countries -- the continuing economic stagnation in the countries of our most important trade partners, demonstrated not only by the closing of their domestic markets, but also by their intent interest in third markets. The gradual liberalization of some more prices (rent, power, etc.) can combined with the growing unemployment reflected in the decline in the pace of growth of the purchasing power of the population, and, in extension, effect the deposits by the population and thereby the bank resources. That could weaken the activity of the banking sector -- credits, capital market operations, etc. Thus, the interest of the banks in domestic primary deposits will grow, and the banks will seek funds abroad. This will increase the importance of audits of bank balances according to international standards as a token of their reliability for foreign partners. The basic systemic measures of the transformation have been adopted. Next year, we expect the government to fine tune the conditions for the support for the growth of the economy as, for instance, exports advancement law, tax adjustment, details of the legislative conditions for the entry of foreign investors, the drafting of housing market legislation, etc. The work will continue on the prerequisites for the external convertibility of the Czech koruna, and both more radical avenues and slower gradual steps will be investigated. We expect an amendment to the law on banking, which will facilitate the development of other types of banking operations (mortgage loans, for instance). The ongoing privatization, with the emergence of stockholding companies, will put great demands on the perfection of the capital market with securities. Many of the shareholders (there are several million of them in the Czech Republic) will gradually start trading either on the exchange or on the RM-system. The reduced inflation will result in pressure on reducing the interest rates. Over the next two years, the interest rates on the Czech banking market will gradually adjust to the rates in the advanced countries. It is, together with other prerequisites, one of the steps the banking sector must take in preparation for a possible entry of the Czech Republic into the European Community. What are then the tasks of the Komercni Banka [Commercial bank] for the next year? We want to keep and reinforce our position as a leading Czech universal bank, and that while fully respecting the legislatively defined monopoly limits. We must complete the organizational and technical restructuring, began three years ago, to a standard modern European bank, and so improve the services to our customers. We will enhance the extent of our business activities, in credits as well as in trading on the capital and financial markets. We will, above all, expand credits for the private sector. For selected, superior projects, we have prepared a so-called KB PRO program with better credit conditions (substantially lower interest rates, lower collateral required, etc.) and, at the same time, with demanding criteria for assessment of these projects. We intend to more than double the trade in securities, and we will continue to expand the operation on the interbank market. To improve the situation in resources, we will expand our offer of deposit products, particularly the term deposits, so we satisfy the demands of our customers to the utmost. We are also preparing another bond issue. The possibilities of the development of the business activities of the Komercni banka are limited by its capital as assessed by the index of capital adequacy [kapitalove primerenosti] set by the Czech National Bank. Therefore, we have decided to raise the bank's capital from the original 5 billion korunas at the end of 1992 to at least 9.5 billion korunas in 1994. We are conducting this increase in two steps -- first, by an increase of 2.5 billion korunas from the equity ratio, and second, by a new issue of shares in the nominal value of 2 billion korunas. The talks on the preparation of the new issue indicate a great interest of the current shareholders as well as of the selected foreign investors. This interest is given, among other things, by the fact that the price of KB shares listed on the market show a mostly advancing trend and is a multiple of the nominal value. The Komercni banka intends to continue in the policy of the lowest interest rates on credits, while keeping the corresponding real level of interest on deposits. In practice, this means another decline in the bank margin. The Komercni banka has founded a home ownership saving bank and is preparing a mortgage bank as subsidiaries. Thus, it intends to fill the voids in the banking services in the Czech Republic. The home ownership savings and the mortgage loans may contribute significantly to the development of the Czech economy by stimulating the demand for construction, but also for the industry manufacturing needs for the construction and equipment of housing etc. I believe that the banking sector in general and the Komercni Banka in particular will make another step in 1994 towards an increase in both the number and quality of financial services that are necessary for the development of a healthy market economy.
