Interviewed for the National Television and talking to Bulgarian and foreign reporters, President Zhelev expressed his serious concern over "the Zhirinovskiy phenomenon," comparing the Russian politician to Hitler three times. Dr. Zhelev voiced his doubts that Mr. Zhirinovskiy would ever be allowed to visit Bulgaria again, no matter what his future position might be. Vladimir Zhirinovskiy arrived on a private visit to Bulgaria on the evening of December 25. In the three days of his stay, he made a number of statements saying, among other things, that President Zhelev should be replaced with one of his advisers, Bulgarian-born Svetoslav Stoilov, unknown here so far, that Bulgaria should regain Thrace, Macedonia and Dobrudzha, and that Romania was an invented state. At 1930 hours local time last night, the Bulgarian Ministry of the Interior ordered Mr. Zhirinovskiy to leave this country within 24 hours. The Sofia Airport authorities reported that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy left on a regular service flight to Moscow at 1420 hours local time today. "A self-respecting sovereign state cannot allow any politician coming from another country, be it even a great power, to insult the people he has come to by his statements, injure the country's sovereignty and retailor the borders it has with neighbouring countries, especially at a time when hostilities are going on in the immediate proximity, or strike off at one scoop whole states as in the case of Romania, a circumstance which, if we keep silent, could sour this country's relations with its neighbours," the president said, explaining why the Bulgarian Ministry of the Interior expelled the Russian politician from the country. "Had we taken action earlier, it would have created the impression of a nervous reaction indicating possibly fear or uncertainty on our part," President Zhelev said in reply to the question if Zhirinovskiy's expulsion from Bulgaria was not belated. "And yet Zhirinovskiy did a very good job, showing what he really is; now that he has been expelled, no normal person can suspect us of having some other considerations besides the actual one. He is an inadequate politician who, wherever he goes, is always getting into mischief," the Bulgarian president went on to say. Commenting on Zhirinovskiy's intentions to visit Bulgaria, possibly in another capacity, next year again, Dr. Zhelev said that this would be a political issue which the Bulgarian institutions would have to decide. Having been expelled once, he may be denied entry next time, Dr. Zhelev said. Invited to say what his reaction would be should Zhirinovskiy win the Russian presidential election, Dr. Zhelev said: "There is a lot of time until the presidential election, and in the meantime the Constitution may change, there may be a number of other elections, parliament may also change." Dr. Zhelev did not rule out the possibility of the LDP reacting negatively to its leader's statements. Commenting on Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's statement that Bulgaria should regain Aegean Thrace and Macedonia, President Zhelev recalled that before Zhirinovskiy, Hitler also wanted to give Bulgaria those lands. The Bulgarian president described this statement as funny because "he brought down a peg or two certain Balkan politicians who have been trying to counter some sort of local education based on Christianity, Eastern Orthodoxy, Pan-Slavism and other anachronistic ideas to Europeanism, Eurocentrism and the Euro-Atlantic structures." The path to follow is unification with Europe, becoming an integral part of Europe, and not inventing local structures like the ones we have already had, but they all came to nothing," Dr. Zhelev stressed. However, responding to another question, he said that NATO could continue its existence only by turning into a system of collective security, "otherwise sooner or later this will lead to the establishment of other regional groups, blocs and alliances because none of the former socialist countries has reliable foreign political and military guarantees for its security at the moment." President Zhelev expressed his opinion that the LDP leader's statements will by no means influence Bulgarian-Russian relations or, if they have some effect, it will be rather positive. According to the Bulgarian president, what matters is not Zhirinovskiy as an individual but Zhirinovskiy as a phenomenon emerging in most Central and East European countries as a logical consequence of the difficulties they face in the period of transition. Zhelyu Zhelev, who wrote the book "Fascism" and was awarded a Ph.D. degree for his dissertation on the totalitarian state, expressed his fears that having won over the masses with demagogic promises and coming to power, such an individual would replace demagogy with dictatorship. In my view, now that we are building democracy at the end of the 20th century, our democracy has no right to be naive and helpless as liberal democracy was at the beginning of the century when it was so easily usurped by totalitarian adventurers, the president said. In his opinion, "democracy at the end of the 20th century should have all the antibodies needed to counter all possible mutants and relapses of totalitarianism -- both of a fascist or communist type." "Producing those antibodies is a must and I think we will be compelled to produce such antibodies to counter any possible relapses of totalitarianism," Dr. Zhelev stressed. The president said that the prosecutor's office in Bulgaria should take action against Vuzrazhdane, a recently established ultra-right organization led by Father Georgi Gelemenov who declared his intention to persecute Gypsies and Bulgarian Turks. "I think that the prosecutor's office should have taken action against Gelemenov long ago because his statements run counter to the Constitution, they are an open incitement to subversion and violation of human and minority rights which is impermissible in a democratic society," President Zhelev said, adding that "the constitution, they are an open incitement to subversion and violation of human and minority rights which is impermissible in a democratic society," President Zhelev said, adding that "the prosecutor's office should act very quickly and categorically."
