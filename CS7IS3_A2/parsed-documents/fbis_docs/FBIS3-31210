"I do not think that I have breached the HZDS principles.... One thing is the prime minister's opinion, the HZDS's opinion is another thing. We should distinguish between them," Moravcik told CTK. He said that further developments depended on tomorrow's session of the HZDS leadership, which would decide whether the alternative was acceptable within the movement. The Alternative of Political Realism was set up by Moravcik, Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac and ten HZDS parliamentarians on Thursday [10 February]. "Every democratically functioning organization must respect the principle of protection of a minority opinion. Even if we do not succeed, this does not mean that we should not be active. More clear conclusions will be reached at the (March) HZDS assembly," Moravcik said. "The movement must unequivocally target certain strata of the population, else it will be pushed aside by other political parties," Moravcik said. "The middle of the political spectrum is the place which corresponds to the HZDS's goals -- liberal-social orientation," he added. Moravcik admitted that the alternative, which started to be created several weeks ago, had negotiated with the opposition. "We did not make any binding statements because we were not entitled to. But we must communicate with members of other parties, this is nothing abnormal, we need to know the political scene." But he did not say with whom the alternative had negotiated. Moravcik said he considered a government formed along with opposition parties, but without political tops, "an optimum solution" to the political crisis before early elections, which he said were "necessary," were held. Moravcik said the most suitable date for the elections was the spring of 1995.
