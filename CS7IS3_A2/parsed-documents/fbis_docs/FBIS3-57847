He placed particular emphasis in this context on relations with Greece, the European Union, and Azerbaijan. In a hard hitting message to Greece, in response to recent statements from the Greek government, Cetin cautioned Athens against miscalculating Turkish calm and reserve, thus leading to consequences it could not deal with. Cetin, who was addressing reporters at a press conference on the last day of the year, also announced that Turkey was going to prepare a new border accord with Azerbaijan. Diplomatic observers interpret the announcement as a warning to Armenia, which has escalated its aggression on Azerbaijani territory. Recalling that Armenian aggression was today widely condemned by the international community, Cetin said there was no way that Armenian invaders would be allowed to stay in Azerbaijan. "With the dismemberment of the Soviet Union, Ankara now shares a border with Azerbaijan. Turkey is now preparing to sign a new border accord with Azerbaijan. Turkish and Azeri officials are currently studying previous documents," he said. Cetin added the accord with Baku was expected to be signed during the visit of Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev to Turkey in January. Foreign Minister Cetin also predicted important activity in the new year regarding the transportation of Caucasian and Central Asian oil. "The two set points in the proposed Azerbaijani pipeline's route have been specified. These are Baku, the starting point, and Ceyhan, on Turkey's Mediterranean port. How these two points are connected is not important for us and will be talked about," Cetin said. Ruling out the use of the Turkish straits for major oil transportation due to heavy traffic, Cetin said Turkey could not accept heavy tanker traffic in the already congested straits. He recalled the dangers that a city like Istanbul with a population of 10 million would face in the event of the extreme increase in high tonnage tanker traffic. Cetin said contacts with Russia, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Western oil companies on this subject would continue. "We suggest the oil should be transported through Turkey to the Mediterranean. It could be directly over Turkey by pipeline, or it can be brought to the Russian port of Navorossisk and then brought to Turkey. It can go over Georgia or Iran, or, if peace is secured, it can even come over Armenia," Cetin said, signalling that the way Baku and Ceyhan were connected was ultimately not significant for Turkey. Referring to recent announcements by the government of Andreas Papandreou in Greece, particularly in connection with the illegal arming of the Greek islands just off Turkey's coast, Cetin noted that these left little to be optimistic about Ankara's relations with Athens in the new year. He said, however, that Ankara had no plans at the preset time to bring these provocations by Athens up at international fora. He suggested that Turkey was satisfied with seeing Greece alienate itself internationally through its behavior. Indicating that Ankara's wish was to maintain the channels of dialogue with Athens, Cetin nevertheless cautioned that Turkey was ready for any eventuality in the face of potential Greek adventurism. He also expressed exasperation with continued Greek obstructions in Turco-European Union relations, reminding again that means to overcome the problem of the Greek veto in this context should be found. He said if a solution was not found to this problem, then future problems between Turkey and Greece would automatically become problems between Turkey and the EU [European Union] which, he suggested, would be debilitating. Referring to the Customs Union between Turkey and the Union proposed for 1995, Cetin said Turkey was ready to shoulder its share of the burden. "But the Union should also do its share. Under the Additional Protocol, Turkey has to receive financial support from the Union. The 4th Financial Protocol has not materialized due to the Greek veto. Neither has the fifth. Together with these and the 6th Financial Protocol, the support which Turkey is now entitled to is about $3.5 billion," Cetin said. Cetin said the financial support which the Union should provide for Turkey would be one of the items in the upcoming talks between the foreign ministers of Turkey, Germany and Britain which is scheduled for January 20. Cetin stressed that 1993 had been a difficult year but one which also brought fruitful results for Turkey, which he said had now become a major center of diplomacy in line with a wish expressed by Ataturk so many years ago. The foreign minister underlined the following developments in Turkish policy in this context: In the last year Turkey has become a country that is no longer on the periphery, but on the crossroads of the Caucasus, the Balkans and the Black Sea. Through the Balkans we are connected to Europe, with the Caucasus to Central Asia and with the Black Sea to Russia and Ukraine. The institutions of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation are now prepared. The Economic Cooperation Organization, on the other hand, has now been enlarged with the Central Asian Republics and its members number 10. It is also ready to activate further cooperation. Ankara has enhanced its relations in the Balkans. Our ties with Russia are based on good neighborliness and common interests. We have also established institutionalized ties with the Central Asian republics. We have taken 7,00 students from those republics last year giving them full scholarships. We have extended $1 billion dollars in eximbank credits to them, and some 300 million of this has been used. Our private sector has made $2.48 billion in direct investments in Central Asia. Our foreign trade with the region has increased to $287 million in the first eight months of 1993. Turkish Airlines now flies twice a week to most Central Asian capitals. There is also great deal of cooperation in the communication sector. Today, the Turkish TV channel Avrasya is only surpassed by the CNN as the most-commonly watched channel. A Turkic Summit, which President Demirel will attend, will be held in Baku on January 21. Turkey has made its European allies understand the nature of PKK terrorism, to condemn it and to ban PKK activities. With Iran we have launched fresh cooperation on security and are keeping our channels of dialogue open with this country. We are also ready for dialogue with our neighbor Syria, but this depends largely on Syria's attitude. Our attitude toward terrorism was explained to Damascus. Our political security mechanisms with this country continue to operate. A Turkish delegation will hold meetings in Damascus in the new year. We are going to hold a tripartite meeting with Iran and Syria in Istanbul at which we will discuss regional problems and the issue of security. Bilateral issues can also be discussed during the bilateral meetings of the foreign ministers. Turkey has no problem with Iraq. Iraq's problem is with the international community. We are of the strong belief that the 3.5 years of isolation Baghdad has suffered is enough, and all parties, particularly Iraq, should strive for this country's reintegration with the world. A delegation from the Iraqi Foreign Ministry will come to Turkey to discuss what could be done with the oil in the Yumurtalik-Karkuk pipeline. There are two major problems in this context: What will be done with Iraqi portion of the oil once it's taken out of the pipeline, and how will the pipeline be filled again to prevent damage? We are also discussing this issue with the Americans. Operation Poised Hammer (Provide Comfort) is here due to regional conditions. Its removal or continuation will not solve anything, although its going may aggravate the situation. What will solve the problem in this context is talks between the northern Iraqi leaders and the Baghdad government. Our enhanced partnership with the United States has been furthered during Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's visit to Washington and the intense diplomatic efforts which followed. Cetin went on to say that 1993 had underlined the need for new policies based on new political realities. Cetin stressed the search for a New World Order which would replace the former bipolar world. "There is little that causes us to be optimistic," he said. "On the contrary, it is clear that this period of disorder will continue in the coming days, and this situation is particularly valid for our part of the world." Stressing that "long-term planning was necessary in domestic and foreign policy," Cetin said: "In 1993, which seemed to be longer than a normal calendar year, Turkey had to deal with a multitude of foreign policy problems and crises, and at the same time. Unlike some other states, we did not have the luxury of concentrating on a single thing." He added the developments in the field of diplomacy in 1993 were not always black and white. "The problems we confronted, the lack of will in the international arena, the double standards in the world and the inaction in the face of major crises is not something Turkey can be accused of having taken part in," Cetin said responding to criticism that Turkish foreign policy had been ineffective.
