People's governments at all levels should take emergency action to conscientiously carry out various rural economic policies, continue to lighten the peasants' burdens, further mobilize the peasants' initiative in production, lose no time in making preparations for spring plowing, and work assiduously to strive for another bumper harvest in agriculture this year. The circular says: Last year, a relatively good harvest was reaped in agriculture, and comprehensive development was attained in the rural economy, with grain yields rising to the new level of 450 billion kg. This has exercised an important role in increasing effective supplies of agricultural products and promoting national economic development. This year, we should seize the good opportunity to carry out in-depth reform, make further efforts to intensify agriculture and rural work, and initiate an exceptionally favorable situation in rural areas. At present, spring plowing is being gradually carried out from south to north, so that it is time to make full preparations for spring plowing in the north as well. People's governments at all levels and the various departments concerned must enhance their awareness of the urgency and must seriously do a good job of preparations and spring plowing. To this end, the State Council has set the following demands in its circular: 1. Acquire a clearer understanding and take the preparation work and spring plowing very seriously. This year, the principal tasks of rural work include: Developing the rural economy, increasing the peasants' income, and ensuring effective supplies in the market. These are arduous tasks. In order to do rural work well this year, it is of vital importance to ensure the smooth implementation of various reform measures, maintain a sustained, rapid, and healthy [as received] development in the national economy, and maintain social stability. With regard to the current rural work, it is necessary to concentrate efforts on making proper preparations and organizing the appropriate manpower for spring plowing so as to lay a solid foundation for the steady increase of output of the major agricultural products, including grain, cotton, edible oil, and so on, as well as products from the "shopping basket" project. As the whole year's work depends on a good start in spring, people's governments at all levels and the various departments concerned should, under the new situation of establishing a socialist market economic structure, further deepen their understanding, intensify the position of agriculture as a foundation, and take the preparation work and spring plowing seriously to avoid bungling the farming season. 2. Strengthen leadership and ensure that various policies are put into practice. The crux of taking firm control of spring plowing this year lies in the serious attention paid by the leading cadres and the actual implementation of various policies. At present, it is necessary to urgently carry out the various policies formulated by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the central rural work conference, and the national work meeting on the "shopping basket" project as well as grain, cotton, and edible oil. We must resolve practical problems which crop up in the course of policy implementation and ensure that various state policies to foster agriculture are put into practice. People's governments at all levels should concentrate their energies on strengthening leadership in spring plowing. The various departments concerned should clearly understand their responsibility, perform their duties properly, and enthusiastically give assistance and support to agriculture. It is necessary to enlist cadres to go deep into the grass-roots level to resolve various practical problems in spring plowing in a timely manner. Leading cadres at prefectural (city) and county levels should personally work on the front line of production in these crucial times in order to become acquainted with the real conditions there and resolve any problems. 3. Give positive guidance and concentrate efforts on ensuring sufficient grain and cotton acreage. The effort to maintain stability in the farming area of bulk agricultural products such as grain, cotton, and others, which have a bearing on the national economy and people's livelihood, is a task of primary importance for spring farming this year. Governments at all levels must adopt vigorous measures to encourage peasants to boost production in grain, cotton, edible oil, and other agricultural products through various forms. In both producing and marketing areas, the increase of grain and cotton output must be placed in a significant position. Under the precondition of ensuring stabilized acreage for grain and cotton, efforts should also be made to rationally readjust structure and layout so as to enhance economic results. People's governments in the cotton producing areas along the Huang He, the Huai He, and the Hai He should try every possible means to guide peasants in growing more cotton and ensure that the existing fallow land [chun bai di 2504 4101 0966] and reserved cotton fields are properly grown, while cotton producing areas in the Chang Jiang valley and Northwest China should try their best to increase cotton acreage. An inspection on ensuring sufficient grain and cotton acreage should be carried out immediately in various localities so that the work is conducted according to plan. In the meantime, field management for grain and oil-bearing crops should be reinforced, and various measures for increasing output should be intensified to ensure that another bumper harvest in grain and edible oil will be reaped this summer. 4. Make overall planning and develop the rural economy in a comprehensive way. During the spring plowing, it is necessary to make overall planning while giving prominence to key points, keep in mind the goal of increasing the peasants' income, organize rural economic work in a comprehensive way, make proper arrangements for spring afforestation, vigorously develop animal husbandry and aquiculture, increase the output and supply of "shopping basket" products, lead township and town enterprises in their robust and healthy development, and so on. To achieve the above aims, it is necessary to make comprehensive arrangements and conscientiously put them into effect. 5. Provide better services to agriculture and do a good job of supplying adequate agricultural means of production, loans, and so on. All trades and professions should increase their awareness of serving agriculture and conscientiously perform various tasks to serve agriculture. It is necessary to stabilize the organs that disseminate agricultural science and technology and the contingent of agricultural scientific and technological personnel, vigorously disseminate improved varieties, and popularize advanced and applicable agricultural production technology. As regards the production and transfer of agricultural means of production, fertilizer in particular, the State Council has set explicit demands, and various departments and local governments at all levels should really take up responsibility to put them into effect. The departments in charge of material supplies and marketing should provide peasant households with the necessary chemical fertilizer, pesticides, plastic film, diesel oil, and farming implements. Departments in charge of water resources should take firm control of building water conservancy projects in spring and continue to enlist the masses in the construction of irrigation works. The departments in charge of agricultural machinery should step up their work in organizing the overhauls, repairs, transfers, and experiments of farming machines. In various localities, the masses should be mobilized to collect farmyard manure, publicize the application of mixed manure, spread fertilizer deep into the earth, and popularize other effective techniques to economize on fertilizer and increase soil fertility. The departments in charge of commodity prices and administrations for industry and commerce should intensify their supervision over the markets of agricultural production means, strictly check arbitrary price rises, resolutely crack down on the production and marketing of forged and inferior goods, and safeguard the peasants' legitimate rights and interests. 6. Make proper arrangements of the masses' lives and production in impoverished and disaster-hit areas. Governments at all levels must guarantee the supply of grain to the masses in impoverished and disaster-hit areas so that grain will not be out of supply in these areas under any circumstances. To counter the situation of spring crop failure in a small number of disaster-hit areas, the state has arranged 1 billion kg from the special reserved grain to overcome the masses' grain shortage in these areas. At the same time, various localities must arrange a certain quantity of relief grain and organize the transfer and supply of such relief grain in a conscientious manner. Special consideration should be given to the peasant households who are short of money and grain. The supply of materials and funds necessary for the preparation work of spring plowing should be meticulously organized for the masses in the areas encountering spring crop failure, and the people's ability to combat disasters and provide for and help themselves in the disaster-hit and impoverished areas should be augmented.
