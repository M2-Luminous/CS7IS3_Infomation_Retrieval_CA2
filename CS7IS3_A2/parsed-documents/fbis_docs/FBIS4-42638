His Danish colleague Henning Christophersen had worked out for the public what it would cost the taxpayer to cover the European Union with a transportation infrastructure, especially one for a high-speed railroad service, in line with the ideas of the Brussels Commission. Christophersen arrived at a figure of between 30 and 40 billion German marks, which would account for between a quarter and a third of the total investment cost, excluding credit financing through EU institutions. The Dane then gave up his place before the television cameras to the German, who began his presentation with the words: "Our project does not require any public money." Both commissioners were talking about "trans-European networks" (TEN), which the EU is already dreaming of as a symbol of the integration and economic renewal of the old continent. However, black and white have seldom been so close to each other. On the one hand, the Commission has been truly indulging in gigantic expenditure programs. The idea of European integration has already become perverted into the Right to put one's hand into one's neighbor's pocket, and it would appear that the people in Brussels want to go one further than that with their fast railroad network. On the other hand, they created the concept of the "information society" with which they have prompted a new "industrial revolution." "It is a revolution," begins the report that was prepared by Bangemann along with top European businessmen from the computer sector, "based on information. Technical progress places us in a position to communicate information in any form, irrespective of distance, time, and quantity." The opportunities for new economic activity and thus for work and jobs that this technology promises is something that today's ordinary mortal cannot imagine. The report shows "Brussels" from its best angle. It is the European Commission's fundamental task to think for the community about what it must do if it does not want to drop out of the high performance economy league. That is what is happening, and the people in Brussels are not afraid to tell hard truths to the Europeans, who have been fixated about their superiority for ages: If they believe that the state will carry on fixing things, then they are lost. What counts in the future are not ministers, taxpayers, and regulations, but entrepreneurs and free markets.
