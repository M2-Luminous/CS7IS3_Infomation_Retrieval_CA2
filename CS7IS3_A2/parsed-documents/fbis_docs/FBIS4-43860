FBIS4-43860 "drweu120_q_94009" FBIS-WEU-94-120 Daily Report 18 Jun 1994 TURKEY Ankara Prosecutor, Others Differ on DEP Ankara Prosecutor, Others Differ on DEP NC2106201494 Ankara TURKISH DAILY NEWS in English 18 Jun 94 pp 1, A8 NC2106201494 Ankara TURKISH DAILY NEWS English BFN [Text] Ankara--Parliament speaker Husamettin Cindoruk said Friday afternoon [17 June] that the 13 deputies from the now-defunct Kurdish based Democracy Party (DEP) still retained their parliamentary status. After receiving a copy of Thursday's verdict issued by the Constitutional Court, Cindoruk told journalists that the deputies, who on Wednesday resigned from the DEP in a last minute bid to avoid being banned from founding a new party, were still members of parliament. His statement coincided with State Security Court chief prosecutor Nusret Demiral's claim that at least six of the deputies, who have announced they will not return to Turkey, were terrorists. "They are terrorists," Demiral said, without referring to the fact that he was preparing to charge them, like the five deputies who were arrested in March, for the opinions they have expressed either in writing or verbally. "It is up to them if they decide not to return... They are terrorists and we know how we'll get them back," he added, noting that Turkey had signed international agreements for the extradition of criminals. He also said, however, that until the detailed verdict emerged and was published, the deputies would continue to enjoy their parliamentary immunity. A lawyer for the DEP told the TURKISH DAILY NEWS the same day that under normal circumstances it would take some three months for such a verdict to be published, but he claimed that since the court was under political pressure, the process could be speeded up. Legally, he pointed out, Demiral's reference to elected members of Parliament as "terrorists" even before they had lost their immunity or been in front of a magistrate, was an offence. Meanwhile, reaction to the DEP closure started to build up throughout the world as well as in Turkey itself. Deputy Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin said in a statement that this development showed how vital it was for an amendment of article 84 of the Turkish constitution to be enacted. He insisted, however, that he would not comment on a court decision. New Democracy Movement leader Cem Boyner said, on the other hand, that the closure of DEP was against the principles of justice and that the judicial system shaped according to the 1992 constitution, which was prepared under a military regime, was "too tight for Turkey." Boyner called for major constitutional amendments. In a separate statement, Turkish Human Rights Association Chairman Akin Birdal said the decision of the court was a political one, and branded the verdict as "a blow to freedom of opinion." Murat Bozlak, chairman of the People's Democracy Party (HADEP), said in his statement that the verdict had shown there was no true democracy in Turkey and that the principles of a judicial state were not being met. Labor Party press secretary Hacer Nursel Uguz concluded that Turkey was basically insisting on "a policy of violence" in its search for a solution to the Kurdish problem.
