Without entering upon a discussion of the political reasons behind these statements and the reasons why the interests of Ukraine have become so dear to the Black Sea Fleet, I would like to express my views from a professional standpoint regarding the military potential of today's Black Sea Fleet and its present condition. An objective analysis shows that today this Fleet is not capable of successfully performing its tasks. The claims about its high level of combat readiness are pure myth that belie the real state of affairs. Numerous facts attest to this. The Black Sea Fleet is equipped with obsolete models of missile weaponry of the former USSR, some of which are no longer produced by industry. For the past seven to ten years, no regular maintenance [planovi remonty] has been performed on the missile/artillery weaponry [raketno-artyleriyska zbroya], and only breakdown repairs [avariyno-vidnovchi remonty] are being carried out. Considering that the average age of the ships is 15 to 20 years and that lately no funds have been spent on their maintenance, it is obvious even to a nonspecialist that the Fleet will die of its own accord by the year 2000 because it will be morally obsolete [moralno zastarilyy], as well as because of its technical condition. Given their service life and technical condition, it makes no sense to modernize and refurbish these ships. The intensity and quality of ensuring their combat readiness has dropped for many reasons. One-time sorties by a group of 20-25 ships are hardly proof of the Fleet's might and combat readiness. Hence, it is a myth to describe this Fleet as a guarantor of the CIS. For several years now, no new surface or underwater ships and no auxiliary vessels have been added to the Black Sea Fleet. The majority of the combatant ships need both minor and capital repairs. Currently, 20 combatant ships of the Black Sea Fleet, five submarines, 20 auxiliary vessels, and five special-purpose vessels are undergoing repairs at Ukrainian ship repair facilities. Plans calls for sending another 77 ships and vessels for repairs. As we know, even the shortest halt in the development of military equipment is intolerable, because it becomes both morally and physically obsolete very rapidly. Thus, if the ships of the Black Sea Fleet are not being equipped with the latest equipment today, one can hardly speak with any credibility about their high level of combat readiness. Take, for example, one of the mine-sweeping elements [divizion tralshchykiv] of the 68th brigade of the Sea Area Defense Force [OVR]. Half the mine-sweepers in this element were put into service before 1975, or almost 20 years ago. Their twenty-year-old sweeping and other equipment is hardly likely to be suited to sweeping for today's mines. The situation in other subunits, units, and formations of surface ships is similar. Nor is the combat readiness of the Black Sea Fleet's submarines up to the necessary level. There are plans to write some of them off as unsuited for further military service. Some have been unable to sail for a year because of damage to some material part, because their storage batteries have run down, etc. For example, the storage batteries in all the submarines in one formation have been fully depleted or are nearing depletion, and the submarines have been off combat-ready status since February of this year. The command of the Black Sea Fleet is planning to remove them from active service in the combat-ready forces and mothball them. One hundred percent of the aircraft fleet of the Black Sea Fleet needs to be renewed. Due to a lack of fuel and lubricants [PMM] and spare parts, there are almost no training flights for aviation personnel. Under such circumstances, the skills and expertise of flight personnel grow rusty. The hydrographic department of the Black Sea Fleet is not performing its full range of duties from Izmayil to the village of Chornomorske and in the vicinity of Yalta because there are no funds to pay rent for this territory. The Black Sea Fleet is in a difficult financial situation. There are extremely serious problems in the staffing of the Fleet's subunits, ships, and units with command cadres. For example, only one-third of the ships in the mine-sweeping element [divizion morskykh tralshchykiv], of which we spoke earlier, have Combat Section-1 [BCh-1] and Combat Section 2-3 [BCh2-3] staff commanders. Only 60 percent of the slots for warrant officers [michmany] and 50 percent of those for petty officers [starshyny] are filled. Every second ship lacks such leading specialists as sonar operators [akusty] and radiometric operators [radiometrysty]. When making sorties for military training exercises, ships are forced to "borrow" sailors, petty officers, warrant officers, and officers from the ships remaining in port. A similar situation exists in many other subunits. At present, 20 percent of all junior officer slots are unfilled. Graduates of Russian military schools are unwilling to serve in the Black Sea Fleet because of the unstable situation. The command of the Black Sea Fleet is forced to reorganize the Fleet. This reorganization anticipates retiring a number of obsolete and unsailable [nekhodovi] ships and transferring their specialists into the crews of operating ships. Certain subunits and units of the Black Sea Fleet are being reorganized, and ships and vessels are being removed from active service and mothballed. For example, in September of last year, a separate helicopter regiment was disbanded in one of the garrisons. A radiotechnical observation platoon [radiotekhnichnyy vzvod sposterezhennya] was disbanded at one of the bases, which had a sharply negative impact on navigation in this region of the Black Seal. The construction of a secure command post [zakhyshchenoho komandnoho punktu] of the staff of the Black Sea Fleet has been frozen. The expensive equipment that had already been installed there is being stolen. The incidence of theft and squandering of equipment and other property is very high in the Black Sea Fleet. The number of such incidents is rising in spite of the fact that criminal charges have been lodged in some instances. As, for example, in connection with the disapperance in one of the units of 44 silver-zinc batteries valued at many millions of rubles. The number of ships, vessels, and military equipment that is being written off, as it were, is also very large. All this is being done unilaterally, without the approval of the Ukrainian side, even though, as has already been stressed, the Black Sea Fleet in this transitional stage belongs to Russia and Ukraine in equal parts. Nevertheless, the fleet takes orders only from Moscow. Thus, the Commander in Chief of the Navy of the Russian Federation issued an order on 24 August 1993 instructing that 15 combatant ships and vessels, including the SKR Krasnyy Krym [guided missile destroyer Kashin class DDG], several submarines, amphibious assault, and other ships be written off during 1993-94. In the aviation units, aircraft equipment and motor vehicles [aviatsiyna i avtomobilna tekhnika] are being written off in bulk and by the piece, as they say. The large-scale commercial activity on the Black Sea Fleet cannot help but be of great concern as well. This activity is also being carried on unilaterally, without the participation of the Ukrainian side and without handing over 50 percent of the earnings from the sale of this property to Ukraine as required by the existing agreements. The PSK Donbass [coastal rescue ship], the SRZK Ladoga and Kursk [AGI Mayak class] have already been sold to commercial structures at below-market prices, and the SRZK Ritsa [AGI Mayak class] has been handed over to the hydrographic department to be passed on to businessmen. The RS-239 and the PAS Kuban [personnel support ship] have been given to Bulgaria purportedly in payment for repairs performed for the Black Sea Fleet. The facts cited above are only the visible tip of the ruinous process of squandering and theft that is taking place in the Black Sea Fleet. Much of what is happening here is veiled in secrecy. And the commands of the Navy of the Russian Federation and of the Black Sea Fleet fiercely defend these secrets. What other explanation is there for the categorical rejection of the insistent and frequent demands of the Ukrainian side that a competent bilateral commission conduct an inventory of the Black Sea Fleet's assets and determine what it possessed on 6 December 1991? It is clear from the facts presented above, as well as many other facts known to us, that to speak of the Black Sea Fleet as a guarantor of Ukraine's security is, at best, irresponsible. The Crimea is an integral part of Ukraine, and the borders of Ukraine are protected by her Armed Forces, including those that are stationed in the autonomous republic. The security of the people of Ukraine can be guaranteed only by her own Naval Forces. According to the document signed by the two presidents in Yalta, these Naval Forces, like the Navy of the Russian Federation, are to be created on the basis of the existing Black Sea Fleet. Only after this has been done will it be possible to consider unifying the command of the two fleets, which could ultimately guarantee the security of Ukraine and Crimea as well as the Russian Federation on the southern maritime perimeter.
