FR940720-0-00032 FR940720-0-00001 With respect to 10 CFR Part 171, on November 5, 1990, the Congress passed Public Law 101&hyph;508, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA&hyph;90) which required that for FYs 1991 through 1995, approximately 100 percent of the NRC budget authority be recovered through the assessment of fees. OBRA&hyph;90 was amended in 1993 to extend the 100 percent fee recovery requirement for NRC through 1998. To accomplish this statutory requirement, the NRC, in accordance with ยง171.13, is publishing the final amount of the FY 1994 annual fees for operating reactor licensees, fuel cycle licensees, materials licensees, and holders of Certificates of Compliance, registrations of sealed source and devices and QA program approvals, and Government agencies. OBRA&hyph;90 and the Conference Committee Report specifically state that_ (1) The annual fees be based on the Commission's FY 1994 budget of $535.0 million less the amounts collected from Part 170 fees and the funds directly appropriated from the NWF to cover the NRC's high level waste program; (2) The annual fees shall, to the maximum extent practicable, have a reasonable relationship to the cost of regulatory services provided by the Commission; and (3) The annual fees be assessed to those licensees the Commission, in its discretion, determines can fairly, equitably, and practicably contribute to their payment. Therefore, when developing the annual fees for operating power reactors, the NRC continued to consider the various reactor vendors, the types of containment, and the location of the operating power reactors. The annual fees for fuel cycle licensees, materials licensees, and holders of certificates, registrations and approvals and for licenses issued to Government agencies take into account the type of facility or approval and the classes of the licensees. 10 CFR Part 171, which established annual fees for operating power reactors effective October 20, 1986 (51 FR 33224; September 18, 1986), was challenged and upheld in its entirety in Florida Power and Light Company v. United States, 846 F.2d 765 (D.C. Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1045 (1989). 10 CFR Parts 170 and 171, which established fees based on the FY 1989 budget, were also legally challenged. As a result of the Supreme Court decision in Skinner v. Mid-American Pipeline Co., 109 S. Ct. 1726 (1989), and the denial of certiorari in Florida Power and Light, all of the lawsuits were withdrawn. The NRC's FY 1991 annual fee rule was largely upheld by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in Allied-Signal v. NRC, 988 F.2d 146 (D.C. Cir. 1993). VIII. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis The NRC is required by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 to recover approximately 100 percent of its budget authority through the assessment of user fees. OBRA&hyph;90 further requires that the NRC establish a schedule of charges that fairly and equitably allocates the aggregate amount of these charges among licensees. This final rule establishes the schedules of fees that are necessary to implement the Congressional mandate for FY 1994. The final rule results in an increase in the fees charged to most licensees, and holders of certificates, registrations, and approvals, including those licensees who are classified as small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, prepared in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 604, is included as Appendix A to this final rule. IX. Backfit Analysis The NRC has determined that the backfit rule, 10 CFR 50.109, does not apply to this final rule and that a backfit analysis is not required for this final rule. The backfit analysis is not required because these final amendments do not require the modification of or additions to systems, structures, components, or design of a facility or the design approval or manufacturing license for a facility or the procedures or organization required to design, construct or operate a facility.
