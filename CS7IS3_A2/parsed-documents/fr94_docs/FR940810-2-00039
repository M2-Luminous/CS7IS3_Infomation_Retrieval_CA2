FR940810-2-00039 FR940810-2-00023 Table 1._ Recommendations for Ongoing NEPA Reviews 1Title, summary 1DOE program sponsor/NEPA determ. date 1Discussion, initial recommendation 2 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS STATEMENTS (EISs) 0 s Radioactive Liquid Wastewater Treatment Facility, TA&hyph;63. Proposed facility would replace existing 30-year-old wastewater treatment facility which has reached the end of its design life EM 02/08/93 Discussion: The existing wastewater treatment facility, completed in 1963, is still able to be operated safely and reliably for a few more years, although design standards have changed considerably since that time. It is possible that certain design details, such as wastewater stream source and type, may depend on sitewide decisions regarding the location and use of other facilities at LANL. Detailed design for a replacement facility cannot be started until the NEPA review is completed, which in turn would affect construction schedules. Initial Recommendation: Include in the SWEIS. s 2 ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS (EAs) 0 s Chemistry and Metallurgy Research (CMR) Building Upgrades, TA&hyph;3. Part of a series of proposed infrastructure renovations to a 40-year-old facility used for various research projects. CMR supports activities in several other LANL facilities. The purpose of the upgrades is to reduce risk, enhance the safety margin, and provide for the continued safe, reliable, and effective use of the facility to support LANL missions for at least another 20 to 30 years. Some renovations were covered by prior NEPA review and are currently underway DP 09/13/93 Discussion: CMR first operated in 1952. Since then, environmental, safety and security design and operating requirements have changed. Utility and infrastructure systems at CMR have aged and need to be replaced. Although current operations in CMR are conducted in a way that protects the safety of workers, the public and the environment, some utility and infrastructure upgrades would allow CMR operations to more closely adhere to current environmental, safety, and health requirements. These include improving or replacing the building's structural, ventilation, electrical, facility monitoring, waste management, and security systems. Another element of the CMR upgrade projects would refurbish Wings 2 and 4 at CMR, to accommodate LANL program needs. If the upgrades were deferred until after the SWEIS, CMR would continue to be used but would also continue to deteriorate as the building systems aged. Initial Recommendation: Analyze in the EA those components of the proposed upgrades that are needed to maintain the existing operation infrastructure, improve safety of operations to workers and the general public, enhance CMR environmental management systems, and provide for improved security. Include in the SWEIS the remainder of the proposed CMR upgrades which relate to long-term programmatic needs, including refurbishing Wings 2 and 4. High Explosives Materials Test Facility, TA&hyph;11. Proposed construction and operation of a new 3,000 square-foot building for mechanical and thermal tests on high explosive materials and related assemblies in support of DOE's science-based stockpile stewardship program. The proposal would consolidate in one building the high explosives work now done in several locations at LANL; the existing facilities have deteriorated substantially and are inadequate to reliably support current needs. LANL has an ongoing mission to evaluate aging weapons to ensure that the enduring nuclear weapons stockpile remains safe and reliable; therefore, LANL must maintain the capability to assure the continuity and reliability of evaluation tests and the safety of workers performing those tests DP 03/10/92 Discussion: This is a small-scale construction project to consolidate ongoing activities at LANL and would not increase LANL's existing testing program. If constructing the building were deferred until after the SWEIS, testing and evaluation would continue in the existing facilities. Further deterioration of the existing buildings could disrupt the evaluation program and create uncertainty in LANL's ability to safely and reliably test high explosives materials. A decision to construct this building would not influence, nor be influenced by, sitewide decisions. Initial recommendation: Proceed with EA. Isotope Separator Facility, TA&hyph;48. Proposed 4,000-square-foot laboratory facility to develop pure samples of isotopes to be used as standards for weapons and non-weapons research. This project has been deferred DP 12/10/92 Discussion: NEPA review of this project is not needed at this time. Initial Recommendation: Defer until after SWEIS. Low Energy Accelerator Laboratory (LEAL), TA&hyph;53 (formerly Accelerator Prototype Laboratory). Proposed 7,000-square-foot laboratory to support development of proton accelerators for ongoing programs. The low-energy, high-current front end accelerator prototype would be housed and operated in this proposed building DP 08/23/92 Discussion: This is a small-scale construction project to support ongoing research. If constructing the building is deferred until after the SWEIS, the research would continue in existing buildings if space allowed. A decision to construct this building would not influence, nor be influenced by, sitewide decisions. Initial Recommendation: Proceed with EA. Nuclear Materials Storage Facility Upgrade, TA&hyph;55 (Revision to 1986 EA). The 1986 EA covers actions currently needed to correct identified design and construction deficiencies. The revised proposal is to increase the storage capacity of an existing nuclear materials storage vault from about 6.6 metric tons of plutonium to about 25 metric tons (LANL's current inventory is about 2.6 metric tons), with a corresponding increase in heat removal capability from 20 kilowatts to 75 kilowatts. The proposed upgrades would also allow storage of material that generates more heat due to radioactive decay DP 08/10/93 Discussion: The 1986 EA analyzed constructing and operating the existing vault to consolidate nuclear material storage at LANL. The proposal was revised in 1993 to allow for increased storage capability in the vault; the NEPA determination was to revise the 1986 EA to provide the NEPA review for the increased capacity. If the revised NEPA review were to proceed, DOE could make an early decision on whether to increase the storage capability of the existing vault. This would be necessary if, prior to completing sitewide decisions, DOE needed to store at LANL more material, or different types of material, than is now on-site or anticipated under current mission workloads. If a decision to increase the capacity were deferred until after the SWEIS, DOE and LANL could continue to work towards correcting design and construction deficiencies but could not undertake work that would lead to increased storage capacity. The SWEIS will be used to help develop a nuclear materials storage and handling strategy, which would include projections of amounts of material anticipated to be on site if LANL's weapons mission changed; sitewide decisions could influence decisions on the future use and capacity of the vault. Initial Recommendation: Include in SWEIS the proposal to increase the vault's capacity as part of nuclear materials storage and handling strategy. Work to correct existing design and construction deficiencies would continue. Safety Testing of Pits Under Thermal Stress, CMR Building, TA&hyph;3 (formerly Fire Resistant Pit Test Program). Proposed experiments to ensure that the enduring nuclear weapons stockpile is safe and would not cause environmental or health problems in the event of a fire. The project would require minor modifications to one of the hot cells at CMR, but would not require construction of any new facilities. The tests would be on disarmed nuclear weapons devices (pits) to determine the potential for materials failure under fire conditions. LANL has an ongoing mission to evaluate weapons to ensure that the enduring nuclear weapons stockpile remains safe and reliable DP 06/02/93 Discussion: This is a small-scale project that would not require construction of a new facility. It is not connected to the infrastructure upgrades at CMR. If the test is deferred until after the SWEIS, some existing uncertainties regarding the safety of the nuclear weapons in the enduring stockpile would remain unresolved. A decision to conduct this test would not influence, nor be influenced by, sitewide decisions. Initial Recommendation: Proceed with EA. Transuranic Waste Drum Staging Building, TA&hyph;55. Proposal to convert an existing 1,000 square-foot building within the Plutonium Facility to temporarily stage transuranic waste pending transportation to LANL's radioactive waste management area at TA&hyph;54 DP 06/11/91 Discussion: This is a small-scale project that would not require construction of new facilities. If the project were deferred until after the SWEIS, waste could continue to be stored in laboratory space. A decision to proceed with this modification would not influence, nor be influenced by, sitewide decisions. Initial Recommendation: Proceed with EA. Weapons Components Test Facility Relocation, TA&hyph;16. Proposal to relocate a test shop to a nearby 11,000-square-foot area now used as a warehouse. The shop is used for materials tests on weapons components and for non-weapons structural tests. A new hydraulic load-test machine press would be installed, and a small addition built to house hydraulic pumps DP 12/25/92 Discussion: This is a small-scale project that would not require construction of a new facility. If the project were deferred until after the SWEIS, the same testing operations would continue in the existing space, but the proposed hydraulic press could not be installed. A decision to proceed with this modification would not influence, nor be influenced by, sitewide decision. Initial Recommendation: Proceed with EA. Decontaminate, Decommission and Demolish (DD&D) Building 86, High Pressure Tritium Laboratory, TA&hyph;33. Proposed demolition of a 40-year-old tritium-contaminated building after removing tritium-contaminated equipment. Tritium inventory and equipment removal were covered under a separate NEPA review and are currently underway. The building is being monitored to determine residual tritium levels. Future DD&D of the building would be done under the EM program, but the facility currently remains under DP management DP/EM 11/04/91 Discussion: This facility has not operated since 1991. The immediate safety hazard was the removal of tritium-contaminated equipment, which is being accomplished. There is no immediate need to perform DD&D, and this action would produce potentially contaminated building rubble that would have to be disposed of. Initial Recommendation: Include in the SWEIS the remaining DD&D to help determine potential waste volumes for future disposal. New Sanitary Landfill. Proposal to locate, construct, and operate a new sanitary landfill at LANL DP/EM 05/09/91 Discussion: A decision on where to locate the new landfill and how much capacity it should have would depend on sitewide decisions regarding other facilities and a waste management strategy. Initial Recommendation: Include in SWEIS. Actinide Source Term Waste Test Program, CMR Building, TA&hyph;3. Proposal to conduct tests to determine under controlled conditions how actinides (radioactive elements) behave when exposed to brine. This test will be used to provide information important to the decision on whether or not to operate the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in Carlsbad, New Mexico. The test results are needed by 12/95 to complete the WIPP performance assessment; to meet this schedule, tests must begin in 1994 EM 12/09/92 Discussion: This is a small-scale project that would not require construction of a new facility. It is not connected to the infrastructure upgrades at CMR. If the test program is deferred until after the SWEIS, existing uncertainties regarding the performance of WIPP would remain unresolved and the schedule for completing the performance assessment would not be met. A decision to conduct this test would not influence, nor be influenced by, sitewide decisions. Initial Recommendation: Proceed with EA. Controlled Air Incinerator, Expanded Operations, TA&hyph;50. Proposal to use an existing incinerator to treat environmental restoration and operational waste generated at various areas of LANL. The incinerator has previously been permitted and has operated a total of 2,607 hours over 15 years as a research and development facility. Incinerating waste destroys toxic organic constituents and generally reduces waste volume dramatically. Incineration is a recommended best demonstrated available technology within environmental statutes. DOE has a milestone to complete a trial burn by 02/13/95 under its Federal Facility Compliance Agreement with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). If the trial burn is successful, DOE and the EPA will develop a plan for additional milestones EM 10/20/90 Discussion: The Controlled Air Incinerator has undergone extensive safety and environmental upgrades to support converting the facility's mission from a research and development facility to an operational facility in support of treating both hazardous and mixed waste. The SWEIS will be used to develop a waste management strategy; analyzing impacts of incinerating operational waste could be an important element of that strategy. Initial Recommendation: Include treatment operation of the incinerator in SWEIS. DOE makes no recommendation whether work would continue to conduct a trial burn as required by the Federal Facility Compliance Agreement. DOE will continue to work with regulators and the public to determine the appropriate activities for the Controlled Air Incinerator. Expansion of Area G, Radioactive Waste Disposal Site, TA&hyph;54. Proposal to expand an existing 63-acre low-level radioactive waste management area which is anticipated to reach capacity in 3 to 5 years. The original proposal was to expand by an additional 70 acres to provide an additional 20 years of disposal capability; a smaller 30-acre area is also considered, as well as a 5-acre area that would provide disposal capability for up to 8 years. There are no archeological sites in the 5-acre area EM 10/20/90 Discussion: The original proposal would provide long-term, large-scale expansion of the waste disposal area. Some expansion of LANL's waste handling capacity would be needed in 3 to 5 years to accommodate environmental restoration, D&D, and other operational waste. It is not clear at this time what the projected volumes of waste might be over the next 20 years. LANL is increasing waste minimization efforts and it is possible that site missions could change; the sitewide analysis will help develop projections of waste volume and type. The smaller, 5-acre proposal would allow for up to 8 years of additional disposal capacity in the event that it is needed while the sitewide analysis is being completed. If no expansion takes place prior to the SWEIS, it is possible that existing waste disposal areas may be filled prior to completing sitewide decisions. Initial Recommendation: Include in the SWEIS. If a compelling need can be shown for additional disposal capacity prior to completing sitewide decisions, DOE may, at a later time, propose a separate NEPA review to address those needs. Hazardous Waste Treatment Facility and Mixed Waste Receiving and Storage Facility, TA&hyph;63. Proposal to construct and operate two waste management facilities to repackage, stage and treat hazardous and mixed wastes which cannot be placed in land disposal areas. The two facilities would be connected actions because they would be located close together and they support each other; therefore the NEPA review has been combined. DOE has an initial milestone of 01/30/95 for completing the detailed design for the proposed Hazardous Waste Treatment Facility to comply with its Federal Facility Compliance Agreement with the EPA; the NEPA review must be completed prior to beginning the detailed design. The proposal includes using small-scale, self-contained portable ``skids'' to treat the waste EM 04/26/91 Discussion: The Hazardous Waste Treatment Facility is needed for on-site waste management and to help DOE meet compliance milestones regarding legacy waste. Delays in completing design and initiating construction could jeopardize meeting the Agreement. If this project is deferred until the SWEIS, the compliance milestone could not be met. The Mixed Waste Receiving and Storage Facility, while not tied to a specific compliance milestone, would assist DOE in meeting near-term site waste management goals. Although the NEPA determination was to analyze these two facilities together, the cumulative impacts of waste disposal operations would be analyzed in the SWEIS. Initial Recommendation: Proceed with EA. High Explosives Wastewater Treatment Facility, TA&hyph;16. Proposal to construct and operate a wastewater treatment facility to treat wastewater containing trace amounts of high explosives waste. The project would include constructing a delivery pipeline and decontamination and demolition of an existing treatment facility. The project would minimize wastewater generation by eliminating 99 percent of current wastewater flows through a combination of wastewater elimination, recycle, and reuse. It would reduce the number of industrial wastewater outfalls from the 17 currently in use to 1. On 6/15/94 the EPA issued an Administrative Order to LANL requiring compliance with Clean Water Act permitting requirements. DOE has a milestone of 10/97 to start construction under its Federal Facility Compliance Agreement with the EPA EM 06/29/92 Discussion: DOE needs to address water pollution compliance independent of SWEIS analysis. If construction is not started by 10/97, DOE would not meet its compliance milestone and LANL would not meet the Administrative Order. To start construction by that date, design work must be completed; detailed design could not start until the NEPA review is completed. If the design work was deferred until after sitewide decisions, the schedule could not be met. The SWEIS is expected to result in a sitewide waste management strategy; this facility could be important to that strategy. Work to minimize in-plant waste and eliminate some wastewater outfalls would not influence, nor be influenced by, sitewide decisions. Initial Recommendation: DOE makes no recommendation at this time regarding proceeding with this NEPA review. Mixed Waste Disposal Facility, TA&hyph;67. Proposed facility to treat and dispose of mixed (radioactive and hazardous) waste generated at LANL. The entire project would consist of up to 11 waste disposal cells and would hold up to 475,000 cubic yards of waste generated by environmental restoration work at LANL EM 07/13/93 Discussion: The EPA issued a Hazardous and Solid Waste Act Permit to LANL that requires LANL provide a list of solid waste management units. The workplans for cleanup of the units, to be submitted prior to the investigation phase, will contain schedules for completing the site investigation work. These schedules, once accepted by the EPA, will be legally enforceable milestones under the conditions described in the Permit. In addition, it is expected that voluntary corrective actions will be undertaken to remediate a majority of the sites during the site investigation phase. The facility would provide the capacity to safely treat and dispose of the waste expected to be generated by this program. The NEPA review must be completed before detailed designs are started. If the detailed design phase is delayed until the SWEIS is completed, the DOE and LANL will not be able to meet the cleanup schedules. In 1993, DOE conducted nine public meetings on the scope of the NEPA review of the entire project to allow the project milestones to be met while the SWEIS is under preparation. Under the Environmental Assessment currently being prepared, the facility would be constructed for the disposal of environmental restoration waste only. Discussions concerning the potential disposal of legacy and operational mixed waste will be part of the SWEIS environmental restoration and waste management strategy. The total projected volume of legacy and operational mixed waste would be less than one percent of the projected total annual waste volumes. Initial Recommendation: DOE makes no recommendation at this time regarding proceeding with this NEPA review. However, DOE proposes to proceed with the EA review for the environmental restoration waste only and make the draft EA available to stakeholders to assist in the decision making process. Include in the SWEIS the analysis of the disposal of legacy and operational mixed wastes. National Biomedical Tracer Facility. Proposal to locate, construct, and operate a facility at LANL to use accelerator technology to produce radioisotopes for medical research and applications. The facility would house a proton accelerator, laboratories, and office space none 12/17/93 Discussion: DOE has not yet determined a sponsor or funding profiles for this project. Initial Recommendation: Defer until after SWEIS.

Table 2._ Planned NEPA Reviews Recommended to Proceed Prior to Completion of SWEIS 1Title, summary 1DOE program sponsor 1Discussion Laundry. DOE is considering proposing to locate, construct, and operate an on-site facility to launder anti-contamination clothing which may potentially be contaminated with radioactive materials from ongoing activities DP Currently, laundry is done in an off-site facility. It is possible that an on-site facility would be more efficient. This is a small-scale project that would not influence, nor be influenced by, sitewide decisions. If decisions on the laundry are deferred until after the SWEIS, DOE would continue to use an off-site contract laundry. Receipt and Storage of Nuclear Material for Criticality Experiment, TA&hyph;18. DOE is considering proposing to ship nuclear material from various DOE sites to the Los Alamos Critical Experiments Facility (LACEF), and store the material at that facility, until it is needed for criticality experiments or training exercises. The experiments or training exercises would be covered by separate NEPA review. DOE currently has about 3,000 unirradiated low-enriched uranium nuclear reactor fuel rods at its Hanford Plant, Richland, Washington; about 30 kilograms of unirradiated high-enriched uranium particle bed fuel at its Sandia National Laboratory, Albuquerque, New Mexico; and about 250 kilograms of high-enriched uranium reactor fuel from the critical mass assembly at its Health Physics Research Reactor, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The LACEF is the only remaining DOE facility where criticality experiments are routinely conducted. In response to the 1993 Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board recommendation regarding critical facilities infrastructure, DOE is considering consolidating unique critical mass assemblies at the LACEF in order to continue to reliably analyze the criticality of nuclear systems DP The DOE sites listed no longer have any programmatic need for this material. Hanford can no longer provide long-term storage due to clean-up operations now going on; if not moved off-site, it will be disposed of by burial at Hanford. The Sandia material is unique and was developed at significant taxpayer expense; the Department of Defense might fund shipment to LANL if it can be accomplished in the near-term. The Oak Ridge material has been used as an important calibrated radiation source for accident simulation and radiation dosimetry; this device is the only one in this country which has been characterized to make the dosimetric measurements essential for analyzing accident conditions and other radiation experiments. LANL has an ongoing criticality experiments and safety training program and can make use of this material in the future. If decisions on receiving and storing the material are deferred until the SWEIS, it is possible that storage, shipping or funding constraints would make the material unavailable to LANL. Decisions regarding the long-term use of the LACEF would be made in the SWEIS as part of the sitewide nuclear materials storage and handling strategy Hazardous, Low Level Radioactive, and Mixed Waste Treatment Skids. DOE uses portable, self-contained treatment units, or ``skids,'' to treat hazardous, low-level radioactive, and mixed (radioactive and hazardous) waste. In addition to the ``skids'' specifically proposed as part of the Hazardous Waste Treatment Facility, DOE may require additional ``skids'' to treat waste at various locations at LANL EM The current Hazardous Waste Treatment Facility and Mixed Waste Receiving and Storage Facility proposal includes the use of certain ``skids'' specifically for treating waste at these facilities. DOE may need to use additional ``skids'' to treat on-site waste at various locations at LANL in order to meet the schedule for DOE's Federal Facility Compliance Agreement with the Environmental Protection Agency. The additional ``skids'' would be designed, constructed, and possibly operated prior to completion of the proposed Hazardous Waste Treatment Facility and prior to completion of the SWEIS to meet the Agreement schedule. If the project is deferred until the SWEIS, the ``skids'' could not be designed, constructed or used in the near-term. Replacement Waste Compactor TA&hyph;54. DOE is considering proposing to replace an existing 50-ton waste compactor at the low-level radioactive waste management area at Area G, TA&hyph;54, with a 200-ton compactor in a new building adjacent to the existing facility. Initially, DOE considered including the analysis of this proposal with the NEPA review for the proposal to expand Area G, TA&hyph;54; however, the NEPA determination for that proposal did not include the compactor. The existing compactor is not operating. The proposed replacement compactor would increase the operating life of the existing waste disposal area by increasing the efficiency of waste minimization practices, including reducing the volume of waste for disposal and eliminating void spaces between waste containers. This, in turn, would postpone the need to expand the existing waste site EM Discussion: This is a small-scale project which would increase operational efficiency and reduce waste volume. This, in turn, would extend the useful life of the existing disposal area. If installing the proposed compactor is deferred until the SWEIS, the existing compactor would not be replaced and inefficient waste disposal practices would continue in the existing area. A decision to install and operate the compactor would not influence, nor be influenced by, sitewide decisions. Radioisotope Heat Source Fabrication, CMR, TA&hyph;3 and TA&hyph;55 (Revision to 1991 EA). Plutonium-238 is used as a long-term, reliable source of heat that is converted to electricity to power spacecraft. In 1991 DOE completed an EA for the Cassini mission and the Comet Rendezvous Asteroid Flyby (CRAF); CRAF was later canceled. The work at LANL to support the Cassini mission is ongoing. The project to build more units for other uses may be extended at LANL NE The 1991 EA analyzed using LANL facilities at TA&hyph;55 to support radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) work for the space mission. The proposal may be revised to allow for RTG work for other missions, beyond the timeframe included in the 1991 EA, and possibly using facilities at the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Building in addition to TA&hyph;55. If so, the 1991 EA would be revised to provide the NEPA review for the revised mission. If the revised NEPA review were to proceed, DOE could make early decisions on whether to use LANL facilities for the additional RTG work. This would be necessary if, prior to completing sitewide decisions, DOE needed to determine where the additional RTG work would be done in the near-term in order to meet mission schedules. If the project is deferred until the SWEIS, it is possible that DOE may not be able to deliver heat sources to meet mission needs. Any future long-term uses of LANL facilities for such missions, and long-term strategy for storing and handling plutonium-238, will be included in the SWEIS.
