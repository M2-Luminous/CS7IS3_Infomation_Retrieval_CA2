Speaking at the opening session of the annual meeting of the board of directors of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in Russia's second-largest city of St. Petersburg. Chernomyrdin stressed that the continuation of reforms remains at the center of Russia's economic policy. The EBRD meeting, which will discuss how it will further its financial cooperation with Russia, is expected to play a big role in the bank's further contacts with Russia. After the first two months of this year, the inflation rate fell below 10 percent in the country, the Russian government head said in his speech. "As long as the planned budget expenses are not exceeded, inflation will fall to seven or eight percent a month by the end of the year," he added. "We are now going through the crisis' very lowest point," Chernomyrdin stated. "Russians have stepped right up to the line." "However, such a change will occur only if investment increases," he stressed. The Russian premier appealed to the EBRD's management, the official delegation members and businessmen from G7 nations who hold shares in the bank to be active on the Russian market. "I see today's forum as weighty evidence that our international partners' worry over the fate of economic reforms in Russia is being replaced by other moods and other expectations," he said. After Chernomyrdin's speech, the participants discussed the results of the bank's activity in the past two years and of the top priorities for the next two years.
