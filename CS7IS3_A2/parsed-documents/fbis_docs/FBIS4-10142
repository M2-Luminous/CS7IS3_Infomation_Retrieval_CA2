Martin Rodin, president of Mitsubishi Motors in Cuba, was interviewed by Mariela Diaz. [Begin recording] [Rodin] We have been working in Cuba for almost 14 years. Mitsubishi's decision came after eight months of work. This decision encompasses more than importing and selling vehicles. Once the decision to enter the Cuban market was made, the Japanese sent a work group to Cuba to examine all technical aspects involving the vehicles. [Diaz] What types of vehicles will you be marketing? [Rodin] The automobile will be the Lancer. They will be used, for now, as rental cars for tourism. There is also a great demand for diesel engine box vans, minibuses for 12 and 26 passengers. Following today's or tomorrow's signing of the contract with Transimport (as heard), we will begin to import a full line of trucks, both medium and heavy load. [end recording]
