It is a serious moment. Haiti, our country, is in great danger. Reviled, ridiculed, humiliated, and strangled, Haiti risks invasion and occupation. I appear before you tonight with certainty and faith, determination, and the courage of men of peace and goodwill. As president of the Republic -- the one who is primarily responsible for the nation's fate -- it is incumbent upon me to fully assume the responsibilities of our time before the Haitian people and the international community. Without beating about the bush and with all the necessary serenity, and invested with all the authority of my office, I clearly state that history, the Constitution, and the permanence of our deep values forbid me from giving in to threats, and imperatively orders me to defend, by all means, the imperiled fatherland. It will be defended. Tonight, I come to ask you -- all quarrels and disagreements aside -- to mobilize for the defense of our country. I solemnly declare that Haiti will not give in. Haiti will not submit to orders from foreigners. Haiti will face them. I have demanded and have obtained the provisional government's word that it will take all measures to ensure our survival as an independent and fully sovereign nation. Thus, a state of emergency is declared. A series of government measures will go into effect immediately. I order the Haitian Armed Forces commander in chief to guard against all possibilities. Haitians who have forgotten their patriotic duty and have joined with foreigners to demand the invasion and occupation of our sacred land, again enslaving the Haitian people, further adds to the excessiveness of our tragedy. I feel sorry for them. I ask you to overcome this painful treason. Haiti cannot and must not die. Tonight, I ask you to preserve the heroic legacy of Toussaint Louverture, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, and Alexandre Petion. I ask you to move proudly toward this period of resistance, the royal path carved by our ancestors. Together, may we write this new chapter, surpassing ourselves with renewed dignity and the celebrated unity of all social forces in this country! May it be said that the men and women of this country will fervently relight the torch of resistance to foreign invaders and unflinchingly undergo the constraints of this time of struggle and heroic uprising [marronnage heroique]! May it be said simply that we have greater commitment to our responsibilities and the requirements of our time! In these tragic moments of the national life, I ask you to keep cool and to attend to your daily affairs as usual. On the other hand, it is the responsibility of all of us to remain mobilized and vigilance for the sake of unity and determination, like the ancestors, to struggle to the death in ensuring the country's defense before the enemies. From now on, may each man and woman in this country take responsibility for the endangered fatherland. The honor of a country cannot be divided. Enlightened by the shades of our ancestors, enlivened by the sources of our beliefs, mobilizing all the resources of our ancestral strategies, we again find ... [pauses] we will reclaim the dignified legacy of the illustrious runaways, the obscure blacksmith of our freedom. On behalf of the Haitian nation, I thank all those nations that have refused to give in to the immorality, the arrogance, and the perfidy of a certain international community, to those that have relieved us of our misfortunes. May God and the protecting gods of the homeland help us in our quest to go beyond ourselves. Courage! We will manage to reach that together. Haitian men and women, I am obliged to appear before you today to say a few words as the country is in danger. We have been aware of the propaganda against us for a long time, but today it is worse. A giant that can destroy us in five minutes because we are weak and do not have atomic bombs has declared war on us even though we have done nothing against it. Why? I have heard it is because they want to restore democracy in this country. Where was that democracy? I never knew about that democracy. During the 1990 elections, I was a State Council member. I also took the candidate for whom everybody was voting seriously, and voted for him myself. Today, I am obliged to say that. But I am ashamed of having voted for him because today, a Haitian [Aristide] who was always referring to Charlemagne Peralte, Dessalines, and so on, and who was always criticizing those with whom he is today cohabiting, is imploring those people to come and invade Haiti, to reduce us to slavery. Everyone has the right to vote for the one they want. I too voted for the person I wanted. But I do not think that any Haitian can accept another Haitian asking that Haiti be reduced to slavery. It is not possible. This is why we say no, this is impossible. I remember the words General Henri Christophe said when Gen. Leclerc appeared in the Cap-Haitian harbor. Leclerc asked Christophe to lay down weapons, but Christophe replied as follows: You will enter Cap-Haitien after all cities... [pauses] after the whole country is burnt, and I will still be fighting you even on the ruins. A Haitian Army officer said the same thing recently. Well, today, I repeat it as well. We cannot give in to anyone. We acknowledge that Haiti is weak and that we cannot fight against giants because we do not have atomic bombs that we could drop on their countries. If they knew we had atomic bombs, they would all respect us. But today, they have dropped in on us. They want to come and destroy us, to reduce us again to slavery. Why? We do not know. For democracy? Was there ever any democracy? When it was asked to burn people with tires, I was ashamed. I never knew Haitians could reach that level of savagery. I always knew Haitians as docile people who loved everyone, loved one another. They [not further identified] make them hate one another now. That is no longer possible. Today, we are tired of that. I believe we must all unite because we cannot return to slavery. That is not possible. And those who want to make us return to slavery, they themselves should come here. They do not know what kind of negroes they are dealing with. Several foreign journalists came to question me lately. I told them Haiti does not have the atomic bomb, but Haiti has better than that. Haiti has guardians they do not know, and the day the guardians intervene, get involved, then everyone will ask where they had been, where they came from, who they are. The foreign journalists came to ask me, and I told them that. Many people will be surprised. Many cities may disappear, and no one will understand. They think anyone can do whatever he pleases in Haiti. That is not true. We all know that, and you all understand very well what I am telling you. Everyone who is able must help. And I know that everyone will help. We will see what will happen. We cannot bend before the enemy. We cannot let them destroy us. They can reduce us to ashes in a few minutes, as I told you. We do not have the means to defend ourselves. We do not have enough weapons. We are a small goat before a lion. They can devour us in a moment. But, only if God wishes it. We know the word: (Agarou) says, if God wishes it! The people, the Haitians who ask that we be invaded, what are they themselves doing abroad? For two and a half years, they have been wasting the country's money, giving it to white Americans while we Haitians are dying of hunger. They did not do anything for us. The Taiwanese Government gave them U.S. $2 million. How much did they give us? We all know who benefited from that money. We did not receive anything. We did not get even a gourde. Therefore, I do not think today that we can stand up and let foreigners invade us because of a criminal who burns people. I do not know where he got all the bad things that he carries in him. He chose the wrong road. We cannot follow him on the road he has chosen. We have chosen the right road because we know that we do not make many of the things happen that happen. We are not alone on this earth and every Haitian knows that. Once there was an OAS director general who visited Haiti. I believe his name was (Alejandro Ofila). He paid a visit to one of the big newspapers in Haiti. As he was leaving, he told the director [as heard]: They say, Director, that your country is poor. But what amazes me in Haiti is the human warmth and spirituality in all Haitians. Haitians have something in their eyes that no other people have. This is someone who had traveled around the world. I believe that what he said is true. I wrote something in French at that time. I said: Honor to this great man who knew how to look at us, not with physical eyes, but with the eyes of the spirit because the spirit sees farther than physical eyes, which are nothing. The physical body is nothing. It can be destroyed. But no one can destroy spirit. That is all I wanted to tell you. I believe we will all unite to defend the country. Toussaint Louverture, Dessalines, Christophe, Petion, Capois-la-Mort said no, this cannot be done. Today, we are obliged to say the same thing. We know they can destroy us. We do not have enough weapons to defend ourselves. But, we have possibilities that they do not know. They may face misfortune. Only God knows! I will not stay too long because I know that you need many things. At one time, that government was trying to help you, but now they are talking to us about invasion. They are going to invade us. Why? What did we do to the white men? Nothing. Haitians did not do anything to the white men. To restore democracy in the country. Was there democracy in Haiti? Has democracy ever existed in Haiti? I do not know what the foreigners call democracy. Perhaps, they have democracy in their country. Yet, in their country, negroes do not have rights. It is only now that negroes, more or less, have rights in their country. Then, what does that mean? So now they can defend negroes -- to bring the little negro [Aristide] back to Haiti. Why does this little negro not come by himself? If he is really strong, why does he not come? He has given all the money he is spending to Americans. He has given millions of Haiti's money, which was saved abroad, to one American. Do foreigners have the right to do that? This is a crime they have committed against us because we are weak. They have taken advantage of us. But they do not know that they will not endure for long because of that. Look and you will see that what I say will happen. They think Haitians are a little thing. Yes, Haitians are nothing. But all Haitians have behind them a lot of things that they do not know about. They will realize this before long. All those who harmed Haiti have succumbed. There is a certain president who is now in jail for theft. He was leading the group who were saying that Haiti should be destroyed. Where is he? He is in prison for theft, for a bad cause. Others have fallen; others will fall. They even have many problems in their own countries. We must know that, too. They see fleas on us because we are thin dogs while they have big ticks walking on them in their country. They are not serious, they are not more serious than we are. Then, it is only that I was telling you. I ask all of you to unite, to remain mobilized in order to defend the country. If they destroy us, we will all die together. Haitians never fear death. I (?remember) when I went to take the oath at parliament, I saw the Independence Act. It began: Freedom or death. Haitians can no longer live in slavery. Either we die, or we remain free. But they will cool before long, you will see, and I say thanks to you.
