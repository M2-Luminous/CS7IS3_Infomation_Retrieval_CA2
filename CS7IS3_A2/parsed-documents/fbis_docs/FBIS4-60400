FBIS4-60400 "drnes100_r_94001" FBIS-NES-94-100 Daily Report 18 May 1994 India Enforcement of New Copyright Law Outlined Enforcement of New Copyright Law Outlined BK2005140294 Delhi INDIAN EXPRESS in English 18 May 94 p 11 BK2005140294 Delhi INDIAN EXPRESS English BFN [Text] New Delhi - The Government is hoping to tighten the enforcement of copyright laws against pirated video films and radio cassettes through new training programmes to educate police and customs officials on the intricacies of intellectual property rights. Come November, a series of seminars will be held in Delhi in collaboration with the World Intellectual Property Organisation in Geneva for senior levels of the police and customs departments. These seminars will shift later to the states for the benefit of junior officials. The Centre is also planning to request the states to set up a Copyright Enforcement Cell which will oversee the enforcement of the copyright laws. Briefing newspersons on the amended Copyright Law passed by Parliament last week, the Additional Secretary in the Education Department, Y.N. Chaturvedi admitted that the Law was a "braintwister". Its implementation was faulty, he said mainly because the police, which is the enforcing agency, did not have a basic knowledge of its provisions. Regarding the recent Amendment, Chaturvedi said it would have "far reaching effects" in protecting the intellectual property rights of creative artists, particularly the poorer and more vulnerable ones. One of the important changes introduced by the Amendment is redefining what constitutes a copyrighted musical work. The Amendment moves away from the traditional British definition that musical compositions had to be written of notation to warrant copyright protection. Since much of Indian music is not in the form of graphic notations, the identity of a musical composition will now be through its author, Chaturvedi said. In addition, the Amendment for the first time gives rights to performers such as snake charmers, acrobats, conjurers, actors and singers, making it mandatory for anybody to seek their permission for a video or audio recording. Computer programmes, cinematograph films and sound recordings have also been brought under the purview of the Act with the Amendment. Another first is the introduction of the mechanism of collective registration for creative artists. By forming a duly registered society, these artists can fight for their rights against exploitation by economically powerful producers.
