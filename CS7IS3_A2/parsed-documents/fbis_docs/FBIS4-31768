Reiterating the PNTCD's belief that President Iliescu has breached the "independence of the judges" through his statements made during a visit in Satu Mare, northern Romania, referring to the issue of the nationalized houses, the PNTCD deputy drew attention upon the serious consequences of any interference with judges' rulings. The PNTCD deputy emphasized the fact that his party considered as a "real danger" the maintaining in office of a president who "does not watch for the good functioning of the state authorities."
