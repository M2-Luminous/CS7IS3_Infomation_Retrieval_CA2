FR940119-0-00046 FR940119-0-00014 Response: The Magnuson Act requires the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) to follow a mandated time schedule for approval of a plan amendment once it has been submitted by a Fishery Management Council. On July 30, 1993, the New England Fishery Management Council submitted its plan amendment to NMFS, thereby triggering under the Magnuson Act the 95-day time period in which the Secretary must approve or disapprove the amendment. Because of this limited time frame to consider and respond to public comment and prepare the final rule for publication, NMFS allows for 45 days of public comment. NMFS believes the 45 days given for comment are adequate. Comment: Two industry associations stated that they do not support staggering of implementation dates for measures contained in the amendment and recommend that the meat count system remain in effect until all management measures contained in Amendment 4 are implemented. Response: The final rule retains the meat count measure until the new measures are implemented. Comment: Two industry associations commented that the requirement to submit applications for Operator permits 30 days prior to the date on which the permits are desired is unreasonable and recommended issuing permits locally or by FAX. Response: Due to the projected initial volume of applications for Operator permits required under Amendment 4, the NMFS needs the flexibility to take 30 days to process and mail permits. However, NMFS will make every effort to process permits sooner. NMFS will make available permit applications well in advance of March 1, 1994, in order to maximize the likelihood that all participants in the scallop fishery will have the ability to obtain a permit before March 1, 1994. Comment: One industry association commented that the requirement to provide written notice of changes in application information sections for Vessel, Operator, and Dealer permits was ambiguous and recommended that the changes be sent by registered or certified mail. Response: The sections have been rewritten and now require that within 15 days after a change in the application information, a written report of the change be submitted and received by the Regional Director. Requiring all changes to be sent by registered or certified mail would be too burdensome. Nevertheless, permit holders could choose to send the notice of change by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, if they want to verify that timely notification occurred. Comment: Two industry associations and three individuals requested that the requirement of no more than double links between rings of a scallop dredge be changed to allow the placement of a new link between any two worn out ones or that the requirement be limited only to the apron of the dredge. Response: Requiring double links between rings throughout the entire dredge is necessary to insure the escapement of small sea scallops in order to mitigate the impact of removing the meat-count-age-of-entry requirement. The NMFS recognizes that this may require some change in industry practices but considers these measures to be necessary to the overall success of the management program. Comment: Two industry associations commented that the vessel recording and reporting requirements were burdensome and unnecessary. Response: A mandatory real-time data collection system including census coverage is necessary to assess the effectiveness of the new management measures and to make the necessary adjustments through the framework system. Comment: An industry association objected to the requirement, under the recordkeeping and reporting requirements of ยง650.7 (a)(1) and (b)(1), to provide any other information required by the Regional Director. Response: This requirement provides NMFS the flexibility to obtain the information necessary for management, and is not open-ended since the Regional Director must demonstrate that any additional data requested is necessary to manage the fishery. Comment: An individual objected to the prohibition on transferring scallops at sea because it would not allow the transfer of sea scallop product to freezer vessels at sea. Response: The transfer prohibition reflects the Council intent to control and equalize the amount of fishing pressure associated with allocated DAS. From an enforcement perspective, the prohibition is considered critical because it would be difficult to detect violations unless all transfers are prohibited. Comment: Two industry associations requested that the at-sea observer requirements under ยง650.28 be deleted because the provisions of this section were not clear regarding observer and vessel responsibilities. Response: A high level of monitoring is required to ensure the effectiveness of the management program and to avoid imposing more restrictive measures than necessary on the industry because of insufficient data. This provision gives the Regional Director the discretion to require a vessel to carry an observer to enhance data collection, if necessary. In most cases where observer coverage is considered necessary, the Regional Director will first attempt to enlist voluntary participation. Observers would be provided through existing NMFS observer programs. The vessel would not have to pay the salary for the observer but would have to provide adequate accommodations and food. Neither NMFS nor the government is responsible for providing insurance coverage for the observer; each vessel should provide appropriate coverage. Comment: Two industry associations supported the framework measures as described under ยง650.40. Response: Comment noted. Comment: An individual opposed, based on efficiency and safety concerns, limiting scallop vessel crews to no more than nine people, including the operator, while fishing under the scallop DAS program. Response: Most scallop dredge vessels currently have their crew members shuck scallop meats by hand while at sea. The amount and size of scallops selected for shucking is a function of the crew size and the catch rates. The crew size restriction reflects the Council's intention to cap the fishing power of these vessels at sea by limiting their processing (shucking) capacity. Currently, the average crew size on sea scallop vessels is nine; in the past, crew sizes were larger but this was a reflection of the condition of the resource. NMFS is not aware of any data or information indicating that the limitation on crew size will affect safety at sea. Comment: An individual opposed the use of vessel landings in 1988 or 1989 as a criterion for limiting access to participation in the fishery and stated that this measure does not meet the requirements of the Magnuson Act. Response: This requirement complies with the Magnuson Act for establishing a system for limited access to a fishery. If a system for limiting access to a fishery is included in a plan, the Magnuson Act requires the Council and the Secretary to ``take into account'' such factors as present participation in the fishery, historical fishing practices and dependence on the fishery, and capability of vessels to be used in other fisheries. The Council and NMFS considered all of these factors in establishing criteria required to qualify for full participation in the scallop fishery. A control date was announced on March 2, 1989, which gave notice to participants and potential participants of the fact that future participation in the fishery may be limited for vessels that entered the fishery after the control date.
