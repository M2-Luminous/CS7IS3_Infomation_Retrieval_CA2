The new personal income tax law will be very important in intensifying tax reform, streamlining our tax system, and making tax burdens fairer. The amended personal income tax law preserves the continuity of the original policy, while making further additions and improvements aimed at changed circumstances, with the following distinct features: It has a clear guiding ideology. The general guiding ideology of this amended personal income tax law is: To adapt to the needs of a socialist market economy by streamlining our tax system, making tax burdens fairer, strengthening the organization of revenues and the proper regulation of personal income, preserving national rights and interests, and enhancing public tax payment awareness to improve the personal income tax collection system. Based on this guiding ideology, the particular amendment principle, premised on preserving policy continuity, is to make appropriate adjustments: It retains as much as possible certain effective existing provisions that have been accepted by all, essentially maintaining the current tax policy, while suitably adjusting tax burdens and collection and exemption items; it adjusts high incomes to ease the conflict of the personal income gap by placing the taxation priority on those with high incomes, to reflect the policy of taxation based on income and fair tax burdens; it proceeds from China's realities while drawing on valuable overseas methods, being more suited in tax model and collection method to the tax payment awareness of Chinese citizens and the tax collection and management status quo, and operable in line with our realities, by making it easier for taxpayers to pay taxes according to the law, while contributing to the tax management of tax collection organs. It streamlines our personal income tax laws. The amended personal income tax law is "a merger of three taxes." Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the state had successively promulgated three personal income tax laws and regulations; that is, the "PRC Personal Income Tax Law" passed by the NPC in 1980, and the "PRC Interim Regulations on Urban and Rural Individual Industrial and Commercial Household Operation Income Taxes" and the "PRC Interim Regulations on Individual Income Adjustment Taxes" promulgated by the State Council in 1986. While the application of these three laws played a positive role in areas, such as increasing revenues, serving reform and opening, attracting overseas talent, easing social-distribution unfairness, and promoting public stability and unity, the intensification of reform and opening has gradually shown up conflicts unsuited to changing circumstances in these laws and regulations that were put into effect under particular historical conditions. Taking our personal income-tax law and the interim provisions on individual-income adjustment taxes for instance, the former law is applied to foreigners, while the latter regulations are in force for Chinese, which state of affairs is hard to interpret in both legislation and enforcement, as well as being out of line with normal international practice. Then as to our individual industrial and commercial household operations, their income is also essentially in the category of personal income, with many countries throughout the world now also including income from individual industrial and commercial household operations in personal income taxation. So the current amendment of these provisions is in line with international practice. It stabilizes tax burdens, while giving consideration to state revenue. The amended personal income-tax law makes taxable income of monthly wage and salary income over 800 yuan or minus surcharges. This provision, in comparison to the current regulations, raises the tax collection starting point for domestic wage and salary income, which adjustment was made mainly in consideration of the increases in recent years in both the price and employee cost-of-living indexes that have raised cost-of-living expenditures. As this raises the tax base, it may correspondingly reduce tax revenues, but as collection and management work intensifies and employee income increases, more people will become taxpayers, so that revenues will increase somewhat instead. As to taxpayers who have no residence in China but earn wage or salary income in China, and those who live in China but earn wage or salary income outside of China, the exchange-rate adjustments of recent years mean that continuing to maintain the original deductions would obviously be unsuited to the changed circumstances. The amended items are more feasible, contributing to our opening up to the outside world, as well as to the introduction of talent from abroad. As to tax burdens, while they generally are essentially fair as before, the burden on high-income taxpayers is increased slightly, which is also in line with the principle of taxation based on income. This personal income-tax law passed by the NPC Standing Committee, in comparison to the one promulgated in 1980, makes certain amendments in areas such as tax objects and limits, tax reductions and exemptions, payment terms, and collection management, mainly in the following points: --It sharply adjusts the tax rate for individual industrial and commercial household operations. The "Interim Regulations on Urban and Rural Individual Industrial and Commercial Household Operation Income Taxes" issued by the State Council in January 1986 provided that income taxes on individual industrial and commercial household operations would be collected according to a 10-grade progressive tax rate for excess income, with the lowest grade being annual income of 1,000-2,000 yuan with a tax rate of 7 percent, and the highest grade being annual income of over 30,000 yuan with a tax rate of 60 percent. They also provided that when annual taxable income exceeded 50,000 yuan, an additional 10-40 percent income-tax markup would be collected on the excess taxable income. But this amended personal income-tax law provides for a five-grade progressive tax rate on excess income for individual industrial and commercial household-operation production and business income, with the lowest grade being annual taxable income up to 5,000 yuan with a tax rate of 5 percent, and the highest grade being annual income over 50,000 yuan with a tax rate of 35 percent, as well as abolishing the markup taxation method. The amended terms show clearly that the tax burden on individual industrial and commercial household operations is sharply lower than before. This provision is a tangible expression of the state's policy of support for individual industrial and commercial household operations, in order to spur individual industrial and commercial household operations to sounder market economy growth. -- It provides tax reductions on income from payments for articles or books written. In the personal income tax law promulgated in 1980, income from payments for articles or books written is included in remuneration for labor, with each earning of less than 4,000 yuan being provided an expense reduction of 800 yuan, each one over 4,000 yuan granted one of 20 percent, and the balance being taxable. But this amended personal income tax law excludes income from payments for articles or books written from remuneration for labor, listing it as an independent tax item. While all matters, such as tax collection criteria, expense-reduction amount, and tax rates remain unchanged, a provision is added on a 30-percent reduction of taxable income. -- It adds income from property transfers and chance to taxable items. As China's economic reform intensifies, with stock and real estate markets growing very rapidly, and transactions of all types of movable and real property, mainly stocks, bonds, and real estate, becoming increasingly brisk, some are earning increasing amounts of appreciation income. Meanwhile, all sorts of lottery-attached activities such as fundraising, savings, sales, and contests are increasing daily, with the chance income of lottery winners also growing steadily. In light of this, as the state should regulate through taxation this appreciation and chance income, the amended personal-income tax law lists these two incomes as taxable items. -- It practices markup taxation on income from remuneration for labor where one-time earnings are abnormally high. In our current income from remuneration for labor, the income gap is very high. Similarly in labor remuneration, some have very high one-time earnings, as high as tens of thousands of yuan, which easily sharpens the conflict of distribution injustice. As taxation is a macroeconomic regulation and control tool that should play a proper role in this area, the amended personal income tax law clearly provides that "for income from labor remuneration where one time earnings are abnormally high, markup taxation can be applied." This undoubtedly is particularly correct as to implementing the principle of distribution according to work and alleviating social distribution injustice. -- It clarifies the distinction between residents and nonresidents. According to international practice, taxpayers are distinguished as residents or nonresidents. Residents are liable for an unlimited tax payment committment. In other words, whether the income source is domestic or overseas, it is subject to tax payment in China. But nonresidents are liable for only a limited tax payment committment, or for paying taxes only on income earned in China. This amended personal income tax law uses the two criteria of whether or not there is a residence and length of residence to set the limits between residents and nonresidents, while the one promulgated in 1980 set only the one condition of whether or not there was a residence. According to the principles provided in general civil law rules, residents are Chinese citizens who live in China and have Chinese nationality or registered permanent residence, as well as foreigners who have lived a whole 365-day year in China and Chinese citizens without registered permanent residence. All who do not conform to these terms are nonresidents. According to the principle that residents are liable for an unlimited tax payment committment, residents should pay personal income taxes on all income earned both in or outside of China. This additional "residence" condition includes personnel who go abroad to work for public or other reasons as taxpayers, stopping up tax loopholes, as well as conforming to international practice. As the amended personal income tax law is very broad in scope, strong in policy, and closely tied to vital public interests, it needs widespread publicity and education, to raise taxpayer legal awareness and enhance tax payment conscientiousness. Every taxpayer should act in line with tax law provisions, by strictly observing the law, and fulfilling their tax payment committment to the country with their own real actions. Tax departments must also intensify their enforcement oversight and inspection by acting in accordance with the law, and when discovering tax evasion or avoidance, dealing with it strictly according to tax law provisions, and investigating and affixing legal liability for serious cases. The implementation of the amended personal income tax law will also require the support and coordination of concerned departments, with close and strong cooperation. Units responsible for withholding particularly need to perform their tax withholding functions strictly according to the provisions of the tax law. Moreover, certain measures interrelated with the personal income tax law also need to be correspondingly drawn up, for a complete application.
