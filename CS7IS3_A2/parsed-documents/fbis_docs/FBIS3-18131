The biggest of the candidates for privatization is the Deutsche Lufthansa AG in Cologne, where, in Waigel's view, the framework conditions for a withdrawal of the Federal Government are extremely favorable at the moment. In a few days he expects an expert clarification on the problem of Lufthansa's pension obligations. Upon Waigel's proposal, the Federal Cabinet came out in favor of further reducing the number of the Federal Government's company participations and real estate holdings. The latest participation report by the Federal Government shows a total number of 410 direct and indirect participations at the end of 1992. The cabinet stressed that the privatization policy, as the most important part of Bonn's action program for more growth and employment, has high economic priority. In the future, it must be an absolute exception to have tasks done by the state or to keep tasks within the state's sphere of responsibility if these tasks could be done just as well by private persons. The privatization policy, which has been pursued by Kohl's government since 1982, has yielded total revenues of about 11.6 billion German marks [DM] so far. The financial scope of future privatizations at the federal level (without real estate holdings) will, however, rather run into the "one-digit billions." Only by including the Federal Government's special assets -- Telekom, above all -- can a double-digit billion sum be expected in the medium term. Waigel appealed to the laender and communities to follow the example of the Federal Government on their own responsibility and to also privatize their comprehensive participations. The Federal Government will support this process by amending the budget principle law. Among the short-term privatization measures the Cabinet approved are, in addition to Lufthansa, the reduction of federal participations in the Rhein-Main-Donau AG, the Neckar AG, the Bundesanzeiger Verlagsgesellschaft mbH [publishing company], as well as the Gesellschaft fuer Nebenbetriebe der Bundesautobahnen mbH [company for subsidiary enterprises of the federal highways]. The list of short-term privatization measures or sales of participations also includes: Deutsche Aussenhandelsbank AG [German Foreign Trade Bank], Staatsbank Berlin [Berlin State Bank], Genossenschafts-Holding Berlin-DG Bank [Berlin-DG Bank Cooperative Holding], DFA Fertigungs- und Anlagenbau GmbH [DFA Assembly and Installation Construction Company], Gesellschaft fuer Lagereibetriebe mbH [Warehouse company], Heimbetriebsgesellschaft mbH [Homeworkers' company], Bayerische Lloyd AG, Osthavellaendische Eisenbahnen AG [eastern Havelland railroads], a recreation home in Davos owned by the Federal Government, as well as various participations in housing construction. The Federal Government is striving for medium-term privatization solutions for the future three share-holding companies Telekom, Postdienst, and Postbank. At the moment it cannot yet be decided which part of the privatization revenues from Telekom will go to the company itself because there is still a lack of "solid bases for economic assessment," Waigel said. In contrast, Federal Post Minister Wolfgang Boetsch (CSU) recently gave the impression that he had already come to an agreement with Waigel on this controversial issue of the second part of the postal reform. According to the federal finance minister, the sale of the Federal Government's east German real estate holdings has made good progress. So far, real estate property at a value of more than DM1.3 billion has been sold and property worth DM2.3 billion has been restituted to the original owners for free. In order to further accelerate the sale, a division of labor between the Federal Property Administration and the Trust Agency's Property Company (TLG) has been instituted since the end of 1993. While the Federal Property Administration clarifies the legal and real matters involving real estate property, the TLG takes over sales management.
