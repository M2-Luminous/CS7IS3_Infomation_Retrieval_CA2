This was stated at a briefing today by Grigoriy Karasin, director of the Russian Foreign Ministry's press and information department. "The special representative does not, in our view, have such powers. The Security Council has not empowered him to do this," the Russian diplomat said. Russia does not support any proposal to simplify the procedure whereby the United Nations requests "air support" from NATO, Grigoriy Karasin said. According to him, the Russian Foreign Ministry could not fail to notice an article published in THE NEW YORK TIMES on Wednesday which maintains that, by bypassing the Security Council, the United Nations has allegedly taken a decision, in essence, "to water down this procedure." "Judging by this report, an obvious attempt is in evidence to downgrade the adoption of such an important decision to the level of not simply Akashi, the UN secretary general's envoy, but even to refer it to the military - to General Bertrand de Lapresle, commander of the UN forces in former Yugoslavia," he remarked. If the NEW YORK TIMES's allegation is based on reality, then a situation is emerging as a result of which the UN secretary general's control over key decisions concerning the UN forces' activities in former Yugoslavia can be lost and the prestige of the Security Council and of the United Nations in general can be damaged, Grigoriy Karasin stressed. The NEW YORK TIMES report is causing serious worry in Russia and requires urgent clarifications by the UN Secretariat, the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
