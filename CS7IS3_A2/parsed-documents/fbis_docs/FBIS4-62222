He has left for Moscow, his secretary replied on the telephone. But to all appearances member of the Government, Minister N. Travkin, appointed on the eve of the holidays by Russian presidential edict, still does not have a working position in the capital. Just try finding a brand-new member of the government when you do not know what range of issues he has actually been put in charge of. Maybe, with his Hero of Socialist Labor medal, he is in charge of construction? Or maybe, knowing that he is closely associated with Stanislav Govorukhin, he is in charge of the fight against corruption? A polite tenor voice over the telephone from the president's press service passed me on to his government colleagues: "Travkin has been appointed one of their number, after all." There were no further explanations. At the government press service a surprised female voice replied: "What, has he actually been appointed?" On the off chance, I phoned around several more numbers of the service whose name anyway indicates absolutely clear tasks -- the public relations department. It is staggering that no one could tell me anything sensible. In my search for Minister N. Travkin in the vast "White House" labyrinths I resolved to perform an almost heroic act and phoned the office of Government Apparatus Leader V. Kvasov. His assistant promised to help me collect the necessary information. Alas, after exactly one hour I was handed on yet again -- to Sergey Surov, deputy section chief at the government press center. "It was not the government apparatus that prepared the edict. What is more, it says that Travkin has been appointed a member of the government but certainly not a minister. We have no comment to make," S. Surov replied. [Sizyy] "Is this appointment a surprise to you?" [Surov] "Let's say yes. But I do not believe that the matter is closed yet. I think that you could get some kind of explanation from the president's staff," S. Surov said, bidding me good-bye. People are now saying that Nikolay Travkin is the first minister without portfolio in modern Russian government history. And that his appointment has a direct connection with the Democratic Party of Russia leader's signing of the agreement on national accord. Meaning that the Russian Government is becoming a government of "those in accord."
