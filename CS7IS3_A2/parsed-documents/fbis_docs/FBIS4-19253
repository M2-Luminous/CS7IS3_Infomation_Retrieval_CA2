That is the concept Silvio Berlusconi hammers home in the interview granted to our newspaper. For the first time since his election victory, the Knight [Berlusconi nickname] responds to the attacks of LA REPUBBLICA editor Eugenio Scalfari: He needs an "o" to start drawing up lists of ministers [reference to virtual homonym with head of state Oscar Luigi Scalfaro], he said. "I want Marco Panella, [Pannella Reformers' List leader] in the government." "By the time they told me, the problem was already resolved. It is better that way. With so many institutional problems still unresolved...." Silvio Berlusconi smiled when I asked him to comment on the mass resignation first handed in then withdrawn by the three directors of the Fininvest TV news programs, Mentana, Fede, and Liguori, following an interview granted to LA STAMPA by the group's managing director, Mr. Franco Tato, in which he accused them of being a source of expense and trouble. In all probability, Berlusconi seems likely to have been informed immediately after emerging from his talks with President Scalfaro. I tried to probe further, saying: "That interview perfectly represents Tato: his character, his fiery nature, and also his good faith." Berlusconi smiled but refused to bite. The case is closed and he has other things on his mind. It was dusk on a gray day. The blinds let very little light into the drawing rooms of the Berlusconi residence near Rome's Piazza Navona. In the larger of the rooms, two white sofas and a chimney breast framed a broad table groaning under neat piles of books, candy, and Forza Italia brochures. A few 18th century hunting scenes adorned the walls. Next to the windows, a nice photo of his wife, Veronica Lario, rested on a shelf. "There is just one of me, guys, just one," he said, closing the door in the face of his elegant footmen, spokesman Antonio Tajano and personal assistant Niccolo Querci, who would like him to be all over the place at once. But at this juncture the Knight has three important things on his mind: the designation of the speakers for the two houses of parliament ("Who knows, we might just succeed in throwing off the shackles of narrow vision...?"); the probable assignation to him of the mandate to form a government; and his parliamentary debut. [Vespa] When was the last time you stepped inside Montecitorio [parliament]? What impression did it make on you? [Berlusconi] I recall a fine, austere building, something halfway between a national legend and the best show in the capital. [Vespa] Are you moved in any way by returning there as a member of parliament or the winning leader? Or is Montecitorio a palace just like any other, for a rich man? [Berlusconi] To represent the electorate is certainly a moving experience, almost like the first day at school. But my true riches, at any rate, are that I am still just a guy like every one else. My responsibilities may be greater, but my feelings are the same as those of the common people. [Vespa] The outgoing parliamentary speakers are Napolitano and Spadolini. Whether people like them or not, they are first class politicians. Will the new majority provide alternatives of an acceptable standard? [Berlusconi] Where the speakers are concerned, I am looking for a solid balance between renewal and republican solidity. I believe in government by the majority, leaving the opposition free and untarnished by any clubby temptations; but for that reason, precisely because I wish to implement this change at all levels, it is right that certain elements of institutional safeguard should stay in place. Naturally, all this within the framework of the direction expressed by the coalition which, in its entirety, won the elections. [Vespa] If Scalfaro were to ask you to form the government, how many days would it take you to accept [sciogliere la riserva]? [Berlusconi] As many days as it takes to put together a good program and a good team. [Vespa] If you form the government, will Pannella be part of it? [Berlusconi] As far as I am concerned, yes, I hope so. [Vespa] On that topic: Can you guarantee that the new team will be an improvement on the outgoing one? [Berlusconi] I must say, the dance going on right now is highly comical. The very people who as good as smashed the old ruling class and caused the old parliament to lose its legitimacy are now falling over themselves to describe the "new" guys as inexpert, unfit, and not up to the job. I guarantee that we can do better than in the past with all the men of the present. [Vespa] On that subject, Scalfari on Sunday said that you cannot be prime minister. Too many interests. You got your lawyer, Dr. Dotti, also elected under the Forza Italia flag, to answer him. I get the feeling you are not too worried. [Berlusconi] Scalfari needs an "o" on the end of his name to decide who is going to form the next government. [Vespa] [Fininvest President] Confalonieri claims that a group with revenue of 12 trillion lire and a staff of 40,000 cannot be sold off in a short time. One got the feeling he was trying to reassure the people in the firm as much as anything else. [Berlsuconi] Confalonieri is fulfilling his role as a great manager; I will fulfill mine, which is quite different. Nobody with any sense, whatever his job, can doubt for one moment that Fininvest is not a two-bit company to sell off to the highest bidder just to keep the ivory tower mystifiers happy. We are talking about tens of thousands of jobs, an asset, an ethos, and an entrepreneurial tradition which belong to the country. [Vespa] Who will do the negotiating to decide how many networks Fininvest should have and how many the RAI [Italian State Broadcasting Corporation] should have? Will you succeed in turning it into a personal matter [as published]? [Berlusconi] Of course I will. I have already explained how. By separating my political role from my assets in the clearest possible way, and by imbuing all decisions with the greatest transparency, under the collective control of the government and parliament. [Vespa] [Northern League Secretary] Bossi has said that he will agree to you becoming premier only if you present yourelf "naked," in other words after divesting yourself of your strong interests. [Berlusconi] Bossi wants me to catch a nasty cold. I presented myself to the electorate with my clothes on, by no means in the nude, and it put its trust in me. But the problem does exist. We are examining it, and only those in bad faith can deny a priori that, without any legal obligation to do so, I began to practice the distinction of roles the moment I resigned all my duties with Finivest. The rest will follow shortly, but compatibly with the problems of a group with a 12 trillion lire in revenue and a staff of 40,000. [Vespa] The other problem is federalism. If no concrete results are forthcoming within six months, your League ally has threatened to leave you in the lurch. What can be done in such a short time? [Berlusconi] Under the old system in six months you set up a comittee, with its good old chairman and his good old staff, and got through about 1,000 working lunches. I hope that under the new system six months will be enough for the work of any committee to be concluded, whatever the topic, and a vote to be taken on the results. Yes, yes, no, no: just like it says in the Gospel. [Vespa] What solution are you most convinced by? Greater powers to the present regional authorities, eight or 10 macroregions, [League ideologue] Miglio's three Italies? [Berlusconi] Federalism is not a topographical problem. The first republic was based on the distribution of power through centralized parties. In the future the distribution of weights and balances, starting with tax questions, will have to rest on the institutions of territorial self-government. [Vespa] The oppositions claim that parliament alone has no right to implement reforms of this nature. Do you envisage resorting to a referendum? If so, when? [Berlusconi] Parliament has every right to do what the Constitution allows. The will of the people is exercized through parliament within the framework of a Constitution which provides the conditions for its own modification. Added to which, in the case of sweeping changes, there is the tool of a referendum. [Vespa] You said: We will set up a centrist government. [National Alliance Coordinator] Fini objected: It will be a center-right government. [Berlusconi] Those are moldy old definitions with which I do not identify. I hope we will put together a good government on the basis of a majority which, in old-style geopolitical terms, is center-right, but with criteria and a program which also belong to other ethical and moral traditions. Is broadening civil rights a left-wing, right-wing, or centrist aim? Is increasing the work done by voluntary organizations left wing, right wing, or centrist? Are privatizing great lumbering concerns badly run by the old nomenklatura, or keeping the power to set rules applicable to the entire market in the hands of the public sector left-wing, right-wing, or centrist acts? [Vespa] Have you closed the door in the faces of the Popular Party [PPI] and the Segni Pact members? Have you spoken with Segni, [former PPI Secretary] Martinazzoli, [PPI Chairwoman] Jervolino, [PPI members] Formigoni, or Buttiglione since the elections? [Berlusconi] I talk with a lot of people, and I always welcome the advice and criticism of those in good faith. For everyone today is a time to distinguish between the roles of those who are going to govern and those who are going into opposition, but imbued with the spirit of cooperation and with our doors open to whoever shares our values and our program. [Vespa] You have been invited to take part in the 25 April [Liberation Day] antifascist march. Will you go? [Berlusconi] Ideally I will be attending all those celebrations, which I hope will be a mark of reconciliation. [Vespa] Is there any danger that Liberation Day will not be a calm holiday, despite the head of state's appeal? What is your position? [Berlusconi] I see no reason why we should await 25 April in such a doom-laden atmosphere. I would like to hope that this thirst for revenge is quenched in time. I repeat, it was not antifascism which lost the elections, it was the left-wing cartel. It would be as well not to get mixed up between the principles, which are everybody's, and the programs for the political struggle, which are partisan. Even [left-wing philosopher] Vittorio Foa made that clear. [Vespa] Unemployment is uppermost in people's minds right now. The day after the elections you told me: "I am already working on the economic program," and you reiterated your promise of one million jobs. Have you pursued that path any further? [Berlusconi] Of course. We are working to turn our election program into parliamentary and governmental initiatives. [Vespa] The Ciampi government has taken the credit for getting the recovery started. Was it right to do so? [Berlsuconi] Ciampi did what he could. He had neither a majority nor a true opposition. Added to that, some cross-party centers of power attempted, sometimes brutally, to influence his government's actions. [Vespa] How long will the next government last? Is it true that the next legislative term is going to be transitional? [Berlusconi] Five years of hard work, then the balance sheet and the verdict of the electorate. That is the aim I hold most dear and which I think the Italians deserve after the storms and turbulence of the past few years. The stock market is giving us encouraging signs in that direction. [Vespa] Is it true that at this juncture your mind is totally devoted to politics? Will you ever go back to being a businessman? [Berlusconi] The only interests that concern me at the moment are my country's. It was late when Berlusconi walked me to the elevator. "By the way, how are things with [Forza Italia deputy] Ms. Parenti?" The Knight answered with a smile. Downstairs, in Via dell'Anima, there was a small crowd of journalists waiting for the Knight. One of them cried out jokingly: "Did you go up to discuss taking over from Mentana as director of TG5 [TV news program]?" I answered: "He withdrew his resignation before I had time. Anyway, as you can see, I am not wearing a blue blazer, the standard Finivest uniform...."
