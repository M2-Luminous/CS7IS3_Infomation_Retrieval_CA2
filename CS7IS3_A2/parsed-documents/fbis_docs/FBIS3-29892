The cabinet repealed the regulations on establishment of the "Information Coordination Council," which provided the NSP with the right to meddle in politics. The council was established in 1981 to discuss judging and managing information and framing a national information policy, but has been criticized for its frequent intervention in politics. The council had already lost its legal grounds to exist on Jan. 5 this year when the law on the Agency for National Security Planning was revised.
