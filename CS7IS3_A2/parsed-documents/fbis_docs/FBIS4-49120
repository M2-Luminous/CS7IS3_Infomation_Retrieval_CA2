Sun Ming-hsien, chairman of the Council of Agriculture, said during an interpellation session at the Legislative Yuan that the report that prompted the rumor was "groundless." A newspaper reported last week that GATT contracting parties are permitted to protect a single industry in line with GATT provisions, and that the government had decided to favor the car industry at the expense of the rice industry because it employs 600,000 more people than the rice industry. In fact, GATT rules allow countries to protect their agricultural markets more than their industrial markets. To that end, Sun said, the government would continue in GATT negotiations to push for limited access to Taiwan's agricultural market. Economic Affairs Minister P. K. Chiang also refuted the rumors, saying the government will do everything it can to win extra adjustment time for the agricultural sector while pushing for entry into the Geneva-based world trade regulatory body. Taiwan applied for GATT membership in 1990 under the name of "the customs territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu," and has been involved in four GATT working-party meetings since then. The fifth is scheduled for May 16-19 in Geneva. Taiwan held talks with the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand and Japan last week on tariff reductions, and will meet with the United States next week.
