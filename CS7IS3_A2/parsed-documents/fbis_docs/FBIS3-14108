The letter said this would be an opportunity to benefit from the advance courses and meet with and be introduced to colleagues from Israel and other countries in the region, as well as an opportunity to visit Tel Aviv. The letter indicated that the organizing company is ready to arrange hotel reservations, receive participants at the airport, and have visas issued to those needing them. The letter said the organizers will be happy to arrange meetings with the Israeli food companies and urged participants not to hesitate to contact the organizers for further details. The letter is signed by Avi Gordon, general manager of Global Information Ltd. It has been learned that these letters reached Jordan via Norway. The Jordanian companies that received the letter expressed their surprise at and denunciation of this invitation, which they thought was an Israeli psychological maneuver aimed at breaking the Arab boycott even before concluding peace agreements.
