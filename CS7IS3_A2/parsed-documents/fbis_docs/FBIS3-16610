At a news conference, Egils Levits, Latvian Way faction deputy and justice minister, described the situation: [Begin Levits recording] I think it is a considerable achievement for Latvian diplomacy that in the given circumstances we have brought it about that by 31 August the Russian Army will withdraw from Latvia; that Russia has stuck firmly to this date in this way; that we are to be given back the two new buildings at the Skrunda radar station, which they have to vacate for us as soon as the treaty is signed; that we have kept up this pressure, and I could remind you that our southern neighbor, Lithuania, two years ago caved in and had to pay for it with the zero option -- so that all military personnel could stay in Lithuania. I do not see this as an achievement for the government, because it is not a government delegation, it is a Saeima delegation, and therefore, the co-authors of this achievement are also the LNNK [Latvian National Independence Movement] -- including Aleksandrs Kirsteins, the leader of the LNNK faction, who took part in these talks all the time. A co-author in this achievement is Deputy Juris Sinka of the Fatherland and Freedom, who took part in these talks all the time and in no sense deviated from the common standpoint of the delegation, and also in relation to our partner in the talks, Russia, subscribed to the common position, and therefore I do not ascribe this achievement only to the government, the Latvian Way, or the Peasants' Union, but I also congratulate the LNNK and the Fatherland and Freedom. [end recording] [Announcer] In his turn, Aleksandrs Kirsteins, the head of the LNNK faction, emphasized at a news conference that the Russian Army is being withdrawn from Latvia not because of agreements on paper but thanks to a whole complex of regulations and agreements with the United States, the G7, the European Union countries, the United Nations, and the CSCE. As Kirsteins said, as long ago as 1992, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev announced that at the end of 1994 the troops will be withdrawn from the Baltic countries if the issue of some strategic bases was resolved.
