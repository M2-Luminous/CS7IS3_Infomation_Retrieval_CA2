A teacher by profession, he had never worked in the party nomenklatura organs... Moreover, he wears a moustache and a beard. Who ever saw such a thing -- a council chairman with a beard! He was asked at the session of the council: "What do you plan to do about your beard?" Borys Petrovych replied: "If you want me to be chairman of the oblast council, I will do the job. But do not force me to get rid of my beard..." And, you know, the beard and moustache are very becoming to him. [Bereketa] Our conversation dealt with the elections and creating new governing structures. First and foremost, new local government organs. What does Borys Klimchuk think about this? [Klimchuk] I believe that there should be elections. This is one way of solving the crisis in which we find ourselves. We need new people in the local administrative organs. People whom the public trusts. Let us be frank: those currently in power have lost the people's trust. New people in the governing organs means new thinking in state building. [Bereketa] What do you think the new governing organs should be like? [Klimchuk] There has been much talk about local self-rule during the last two years. This sounds find in theory. In practice, however, we have never been very good at self-government. We continued functioning within the overall system of state administration based on the old model of the councils. We need a law on governing. To put in place a mechanism for removing the council chairman from office by the corps of deputies. To enable us to retire a council chairman from government service. How do we do this? So that officials serve the people and the state. So that there are no local princelings, who take good care of themselves and of higher officials. There needs to be a clear-cut chain of authority: from the Cabinet of Ministers to the village council chairman. We must learn to submit to controls, be willing to listen to the voice of the majority, take a long-range view of our work at the local level and a long-range view of the development of the Ukrainian state. In forming the new governing structures, we must ensure that there is a clear-cut division of powers and no double subordination. [Bereketa] What is your attitude to the institution of the presidential representative? [Klimchuk] I think that this innovation no longer serves a purpose. For a certain period of time, this was a good idea, but it was not as successful as it should have been. The presidential representatives in the oblasts and rayons became something in the nature of executive committees; they became involved in solving petty, everyday problems. But there were no structures to oversee and correct their activities. Obviously, we could create some sort of local bodies to oversee compliance with the law. Because, in all honesty, virtually no one is currently performing any supervisory functions. If an official has a conscience and a sense of responsibility, he does some good work. If he lacks these qualities, he does nothing. We have to admit that work in the state structures has become prestigious and provides some benefits. If it were up to me, I would establish a contract system for state officials. We should take everything we can from these people and then some. Our times require that kind of work. At all levels. I do not like it when people cite all sorts of circumstances which allegedly prevent them from doing their jobs. [Bereketa] There has lately been a great deal of discussion about what kind of state Ukraine should be... [Klimchuk] I support those who believe that Ukraine should be a unitary state. Only in a unitary state will we be able to conduct the necessary economic reforms. As far as I am concerned, we should throw the word "federalism" out of our vocabulary. Nor does it make sense to play incomprehensible games with certain regions, promising them greater powers. The regions of a single state must not be divided into sovereign principalities. We have our Ukraine, and we must all care for it in equal fashion. [Bereketa] How would you describe Volyn's contribution to the economic development of Ukraine? Can we do more than we are doing? [Klimchuk] Volyn is a unique kind of border oblast. I would even call it Ukraine's gateway to Europe. We have manpower resources. We are rich in lakes and forests. We have bread, meat... You know, just a few years ago, people used to ask indignantly: "Who ate our meat?" And now they ask: "Who will eat our meat?" We have a great deal to sell and trade. But the expansion of our external economic relations is being hampered by our ineffective system of currency regulation and the fact that our normative documents are flawed. That is why we place our hopes in the new government and in the new laws that will force our economy to work without all sorts of "isms." [Bereketa] Borys Petrovych, you recently agreed to run [again] for the office of chairman of the oblast council of people's deputies. I have in mind in the new elections. Are you not afraid? [Klimchuk] No. Generally speaking, we should not be afraid of elections. Nor of the new people who will come to the oblast council. The popular filter is effective and very fine. Of course, anything can happen. But I believe that the Volynians will elect worthy people. I myself am not very fearful by nature; I live for the future. I am already putting together a new team for the oblast council. You'll tell me that I'm way ahead of myself... Perhaps. But somebody will find use for my experience. [Bereketa] What, in your opinion, are the most important problems that need to be solved by local government in Volyn? [Klimchuk] This is not an easy question. But since you ask, let me say something about the problem of families with many children. Just imagine, our oblast has nearly 20,000 families with three to ten and more children. Last year, we closed down 10 kindergartens. We have 35 physicians per 10,000 residents. The situation with respect to medical care is especially critical in the rayons that have been contaminated with radiation. We are managing on our own somehow, but this is an issue of national significance. The birth rate in Polissya is falling. This is a dangerous situation. Yet those in the highest echelons of government do not seem to be concerned. That is why I believe that one of the main tasks facing local government organs is ensuring the largest possible tax base. Governing requires money. And families with many children are in great need of assistance. [Bereketa] Let us imagine that you have been elected chairman of the new oblast council. What kind of powers would you like to have? [Klimchuk] To be able to veto the decisions of lower-level governing organs. To have the decision of the council chairman accepted without further discussion. Unconditional execution. Less talk and more action. We have had more than enough collective irresponsibility; there is a need for personal accountability. The people have elected you, they trust you, then, by all means, be accountable to them and the state. [Bereketa] What would you like to wish the new members of the new local government structures? [Klimchuk] To believe in themselves and in our Ukraine.
