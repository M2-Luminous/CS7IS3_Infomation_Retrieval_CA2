FR941117-2-00081 FR941117-2-00054 ``Society *␣*␣* has found it necessary over the centuries to restrain those engaged in competition from undue destruction of competitors and oppression of consumers. *␣*␣* for competition, unless supervised, like Cronus, will devour its contending young. Cise & Lifland, Understanding Antitrust Laws, PLI, N.Y. 1991 at 4. This comment is being filed on behalf of the small computer companies who have been unlawfully excluded from both the hardware and software computer market by Microsoft's monopolization of the personal operating system software market. In this instance of voracious market manipulation the small vendors in the computer industry are Cronus' children. It is the opinion of this author, that although the consent decree in United States v. Microsoft was long needed, it has not gone far enough, for additional pernicious anticompetitive conduct survives, namely Microsoft's tying or bundling of the sale of MS-DOS to the purchase of hardware systems and attempting, through contract sale and purported licensure to restrict the resale of copies of MS-DOS. Microsoft's bundling restrictions have impacted four different segments of the economy; consumers of hardware, consumers of software, sellers of hardware and sellers of software. In addition because Microsoft's has attempted to impose restrictions upon downstream purchasers it has also and most severely affected resellers of computer software and hardware, already in a submissive market position. Microsoft's monopoly in operating systems has effectively precluded the market for other operating systems and accompanying applications programs. Consumers who wish to buy from small companies which sell hardware and or equip their customers with systems to operate their businesses must sell the tied accompanying hardware system to which the MS-DOS was originally bundled, effectively precluding the consumer from choosing the hardware systems. In addition, small computer companies are faced with insurmountable barriers to access to the market for the sale of hardware if they do not have licenses to sell DOS, the operating system product used by over 70% of the market and for which most application software on the market is written. The only thing a small computer seller or reseller can do in the current Microsoft regime is resell the goods tied or bundled as per Microsoft's purported licensure agreements. This form of restriction on alienation is an unlawful extension of federal copyright law's monopoly grant and constitutes an antitrust violation. The Copyright Act of 1976 grants copyright holders ``the exclusive right to distribute copies *␣*␣* of [a] copyrighted work to the public by `sale' or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease or lending.'' 17 U.S.C. 106(3). It expressly limits, however, this monopoly grant by prohibiting copyright holders from imposing any restraints on alienation subsequent to the first sale of a copy of a copyrighted work. The First Sale Doctrine, a codified exception to the Copyright Act's monopoly grant is based on the common law's aversion to the restraint of alienation, Sabastian International Inc. v. Consumer Contacts (PTY) Ltd., 847 F.2d 1093 (3rd Cir. 1988) and the principle that ownership of a material object or copy is distinct from ownership of a copyright or intangible, c.f. Mirage Editions, Inc. v. Albuquerque A.R.T. Co., 856 F.2d 1341 (9th Cir. 1988). The First Sale provision provides that where a copyright owner sells or parts with title to a particular copy of a copyrightable work, he divests himself of his exclusive right to vend that particular copy, 17 U.S.C. Section 109(a). Under the First Sale Doctrine, a first sale extinguishes the copyright holder's ability to control the course of copies placed into the stream of commerce. Microsoft seeks to avoid the operation of the First Sale Doctrine and unlawfully extend its copyright monopoly beyond what is permitted by law by characterizing the sale of copies of MS-DOS as licenses. Blanket misuse of the term ``license'' cannot veil the fact the distribution of the hard copies of MS-DOS at issue are sales. 1 Microsoft, illegally attempting to control the ultimate disposition of the over 70 Million copies of MS-DOS it has placed into the marketplace is succeeding in market place power semantics at the expense of Constitutional and Congressional copyright policy and law. 1 Cases under the Uniform Commercial Code have consistently found contracts between computer companies and vendors, drafted as if they were licenses constituted sales of goods within the meaning of UCC 2&hyph;102 and 2&hyph;105. A number of other courts have found that contracts for computer software cast in the form of licenses were contracts for the sale of goods within the definition of the Uniform Commercial Code.''
