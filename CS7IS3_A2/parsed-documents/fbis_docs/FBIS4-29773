Russian Vice Foreign Minister Alexandr Panov explained the government's position at the closed-door meeting, unprecedentedly attended by North Korean Ambassador to Moscow Son Song-pil. Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the foreign affairs committee, said Russia should cooperate closely with the United States on sanctions against North Korea, adding that it is unclear if Pyongyang plans to bargain for more favorable conditions or is simply playing for time, diplomatic sources said. Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Ministry officials support an inter-Korean summit in principle. They welcomed the possible continuation of dialogue as international sanctions against the communist state are being discussed in detail. But the current situation on the Korean peninsula has neither improved nor worsened, the officials added.
