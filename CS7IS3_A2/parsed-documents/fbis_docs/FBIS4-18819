The operation to evacuate 1,500 Belgian nationals from Rwanda was authorized by the government. The first Hercules C-130s took off this morning. For now, they mostly seem to be carrying equipment. We're joined from Melsbroek by Thierry Belfroi. Have more planes been taking off? [Melroi] Yes, four planes have taken off since 0715. Convoys have been arriving at the military airport here in Meulebroek throughout the night -- military equipment and jeeps. There have not yet been any troops. The latest news we have received from the Tielen barracks from where the paracommandos are expected to arrive at about 0930 this morning is that their departure from the barracks has been delayed by at least one or two hours. Journalists are being kept away from the barracks, and it is very difficult to get any information. There are stilll four C-130s on the apron ready to take off with equipment, and two Boeing 727s, which are waiting to take off with the troops which are expected. We're also expecting troops from Flawinne in the course of the afternoon.
