That is the view of experts in Liaoning, China's oldest industrial base which has made strenuous efforts since 1991 to renew its old facilities and enhance the quality of products. Between 1991 and 1993, the province, employing 33.36 billion yuan, fulfilled 1,800 projects of technology enhancement. At the beginning of the 1990s, only 32.5 percent of the installed equipment in this industrial region, formed as early as the 1950s, was up to satisfactory 1980s levels, lower than the country's average standard. That resulted in the poor quality of processed products and final products. The output value from the mining and raw material sectors accounts for over 41 percent of the province's industrial total. Focusing on 50 major products, Liaoning's improvement program has kept its eye both on domestic and overseas markets in the past three years. In the current market economy drive, enterprises in the province have used flexible means to raise funds. More than 60 percent of the total investment in the improvement project was self-raised. In just this way, Huludao Zinc Smeltery has successfully renovated itself into the world's largest smeltery in the nonferrous metal industry. Its annual capacity is expected to reach 400,000 tons, while three years ago it was 100,000 tons. By the end of 1993, technological progress achieved in Liaoning had enhanced the proportion of semi-finished products to final products from 8:2 to 7:3, and in exports, from 81:19 to 66:34. Medium and large-sized enterprises in the province have also gained competitive strength, with about 10 percent of them becoming well-known in markets at home and abroad.
