FR941130-2-00086 FR941130-2-00054 NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION [Notice 94&hyph;098] National Environmental Policy Act; Advanced Propulsion Technology Program AGENCY: National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). ACTION: Notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) and conduct scoping for the development and testing of liquid-fuel engines and components for the Advanced Propulsion Technology Program. SUMMARY: Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), as amended (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq. ), the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR Parts 1500&hyph;1508), and NASA policy and regulations (14 CFR 1216 Subpart 1216.3), NASA intends to prepare an EIS for its proposed Advanced Propulsion Technology Program (hereinafter referred to as the ``Program''). NASA is considering a wide variety of liquid-fuel engines to accommodate the propulsion requirements of a new space vehicle(s) that would be the focus of the Access to Space initiative. The proposed Program would consist of (1) testing new and advanced engines and components for possible use in developing the new space vehicle(s) and (2) modifying government-owned facilities to support the Program. Two of the sites being considered for the testing are Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in Huntsville, Alabama, and John C. Stennis Space Center (SSC) near Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. DATES: Interested parties are invited to submit comments on or before January 17, 1995, or January 15, 1995, whichever is later, to assure full consideration during the scoping process. ADDRESSES: Comments should be addressed to Dr. Rebecca C. McCaleb, Director, Environmental Engineering and Management Office, Code AE01, Marshall Space Flight Center, Alabama 35812. Information repositories will be maintained at the following locations: (a) NASA Headquarters, Library, Room 1J20, 300 E Street SW., Washington, DC 20546.
