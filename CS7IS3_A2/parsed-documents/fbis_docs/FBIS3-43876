It is now clear that ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] forces crossed the border from Liberia and caused havoc in carnage in the Macenta region leaving, according to one estimate, 100 people dead. They were apparently carrying out reprisals against people backing the anti-ULIMO Loma Defense Force. Yesterday Liberia's interim president, Amos Sawyer, apologized for the ULIMO incursion and today the Guinea authorities have responded. From Conakry, Fode Fofana telexed this report: The Guinean Government has finally broken its silence on the Macenta affair, deploring, and I quote, the clash on our territory by warring factions in Liberia. [no reference to end of quote as heard] The statement issued after a cabinet meeting said that the government is taking very strong measures to protect our people and their property and calm has now returned to Macenta. According to the statement an investigation into the deadly clash is continuing and the findings will be made known internationally. Meanwhile, in revenge for the attack on Macenta, a former member of parliament for Lofa County in Liberia, Musa Boney Camara, had his house and car burnt down in Bambala near the Liberian border. Camara is widely considered to be the ULIMO representative in the area. Another victim was Karamoko Modjenga, who is believed to be furnishing ULIMO fighters with traditional bulletproofs and other invincible charms in their battle against Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia. Karamoko Modjenga had his house razed to the ground and his personal mosque built inside the compound was also destroyed. Meanwhile, the people of Macenta, in solidarity with their Loma kith and kin in Liberia, have threatened to blow up the whole area if ULIMO is not completely driven out. A Guinean Loma elder in Conakry told me that they have been holding meetings here in Conakry and contributing generously toward this task.
