Yesterday afternoon, Sun Weiben, secretary of the provincial party committee, traveled to Harbin Engineering College to hold talks with several class masters with a doctor degree who have enjoyed great prestige internationally. First of all, Sun Weiben introduced to specialists the whole province's economic and social development situation of last year and the whole province's work arrangements of this year. The specialists expressed congratulations on the province's achievements in increasing the economy by five percent and ranking the province ninth in the national economic and social comprehensive index last year. They said: The great achievements which the province had made under a situation of heavy burdens showed that last year's work arrangements made by the provincial party committee and the provincial government were correct and that they had done their work with utmost efforts. They believed that as long as they continue to act in line with the established principles of the provincial party committee and the provinical government, persist in reform and opening up, uphold the plan of relying on science and technology to develop the economy, it will not take a long time to enable our province to become an economically strong province. They also offered their own views on the economy and science. Professor (Liu Yuntan), member of the China Academy of Sciences, said: The slogan of relying on science and technology to develop the economy has been chanted for many years. However, this issue has remained unresolved. This is caused not only by the unenthusiastic work style of scientific and technical workers and enterprises but also the structure. (Yang Shiqun), president of Harbin Engineering College, believed that this is mainly caused by concepts. Enterprises are more enthusiastic in making money than in using science and technology. Professor (Wang Menhu) said: Large and medium-sized enterprises are the burdens of Heilongjiang, but they are also the endowed advantages. It is very difficult to solve these burdens, however, if we realisticlly rely on science and technology to transform the traditional industries into high technology industries, Heilongjiang will surely become an economic giant. [passage omitted] The specialists also suggested that the provincial authorities should issue some preferential policies as quickly as possible, build a trans-city and trans-regional contingent of trained personnel, and enable top-notch personnel of about 35 years old to settle down at ease in Heilongjiang. Secretary Sun Weiben thanked the specialists for offering suggestions. He said: These suggestions will be very helpful to our province's future work. We should properly analyze the reasons behind the issues on transforming achievements and on trained personnel, and solve them one by one in an effort to enable the economy of Heilongjiang to realistically leap forward under the stimulation of our strong science and technology.
