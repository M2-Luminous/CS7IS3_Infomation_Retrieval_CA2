FBIS4-38171 "drnes125dd_94018" FBIS-NES-94-125 Daily Report 29 June 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Palestinian Affairs Reaction to Shamgar Commission Report Reported Reaction to Shamgar Commission Report Reported Editorials View Report Results TA2806194994 TA2806194994 BFN [Editorial Report] The East Jerusalem dailies AL-QUDS and AL-NAHAR and the weekly AL-MANAR on 27 June carry editorials on the Shamgar Commission report dealing with the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron. An editorial in Jerusalem AL-QUDS in Arabic on page 11 entitled "A Report That Contained Nothing New" notes: "It is not surprising that the Palestinians received the report, released yesterday, by the Shamgar Commission set up by Israel to investigate the circumstances of the bloody and horrifying massacre at the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque with condemnation and denunciation." The paper adds: "This commission ignored the fact that the horrible massacre came as a result of the policy of encouragement and tolerance pursued by the occupation authorities in dealing with the settlers, their crimes, and their attacks against defenseless Palestinians about which the Palestinian side had always warned. It also ignored the issue of the settlement and arming the settlers as a main cause for the massacre." The paper deems the commission's recommendation to restrict the introduction of weapons into the mosque as inadequate. It asks: "When there is more than one Goldstein among armed settlers, what guarantee is there that another armed settler will not commit another massacre in another place?" The editorial decries the fact that no Israeli official has been called to justice despite such a horrible massacre. It concludes: "At any rate, the above-mentioned commission report affirms the Palestinian conviction that, from the outset, the formation of this commission was aimed at exonerating Israel from its responsibility and absorbing the effects of the massacre, especially in the international arena. From this premise, the commission report was not surprising to us, nor did it add anything new to what we had been accustomed to in this regard." In an editorial on pages 3 and 7 entitled "The Shamgar Report and the Omitted Facts," Jerusalem AL-NAHAR in Arabic says that "the commission's report should have explained that in Hebron and Qiryat Arba' there is fertile ground for extremists and that more Goldsteins are waiting for an opportunity to commit similar massacres against the defenseless and innocent Palestinian people, as Rabin himself admitted yesterday. We hoped that the report would recommend the need to put an end to those bloodthirsty extremists." After noting that the report called on the Israeli Government to separate Muslims and Jews in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque, the paper asks: "Why did the commission not have the courage to sanction the separation of Muslims and Jews in the city by removing the Jews from there? "With all due respect to the commission members, the report was bland in color and content, as if the objective was not to point an accusing finger or offend the emotions of any party." In conclusion, the paper says the Palestinians had hoped that the commission report would be a verdict on the settler terrorism, "but it was disappointing and created bitterness and scorn among our people." Jerusalem AL-MANAR in Arabic on page 1 carries an editorial entitled "The Shamgar Report and Disregard of the Facts." This paper, too, says that the Shamgar Commission report was "disappointing" and "ignored many of the facts which this commission should have taken into account." The editorial notes that "the Israeli Government and all the political and security leaders welcomed this report because it did not hold any of them responsible. It placed the responsibility for this hideous crime on Barukh Goldstein alone." The paper accuses the Israeli Government of ignoring the Palestinians' complaints against the settlers and says that "settlements are time bombs that might explode at any moment, and the Shamgar Commission failed to mention these settlements in its report which filled more than 300 pages." After asserting that Goldstein alone did not commit the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, the editorial says: "While rejecting this report which has been welcomed by all the Israeli leadership, we emphasize that the causes which led Goldstein and his partners to commit their crime are still there."
