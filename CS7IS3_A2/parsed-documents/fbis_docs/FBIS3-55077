"In the near future we want to appeal with an initiative to the Liberal International, which unites parties from the whole world that have a liberal democratic orientation, to deprive the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia of its name, because being chauvinistic in content, this party has discredited the ideas of liberalism and democracy, said Volodymyr Klymchuk.
