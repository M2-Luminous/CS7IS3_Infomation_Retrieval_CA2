Retroactively as of 1 January, alternative national service will be extended from 10 to 11 months; one month of that can be served through exercises. If more than 3,000 conscripts apply for alternative national service from May to October, this service will last 12 months as of next year. In the future, the young men doing alternative national service will no longer get cash for food and clothes, so that their income will go down from so far up to 8,000 schillings per month to 3,000 schillings. In return, the monthly salary for men doing military service will be raised from 2,000 to 3,000 schillings. In addition, they are permitted to use public transport free of charge [when they are in uniform].
