FBIS4-48585 "drafr099_c_94026" FBIS-AFR-94-099 Daily Report 23 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 23 May South African Press Review for 23 May MB2305125394 MB2305125394 BFN [Editorial Report] THE STAR Pay Scale Recommendations -- "The issue of politicians' pay- packets in the new South Africa...will not go away. Nor should it." So begins an editorial in the Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 23 May on page 10. The editorial argues that it is wrong to justify the pay recommendations with comparisons to what previous government leaders or corporate executives or leaders of foreign countries are paid. It concludes by calling for President Mandela "to take the lead in suggesting that the Melamet proposals be scaled down -- not to the point of punitive austerity, but to be in line with South Africa's economic status in the world." BUSINESS DAY Credit Responsibilities -- An editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on page 10 on 23 May begins by noting that accepting the responsibilities "that will come with the granting of an international credit rating will be central to gaining access to international capital markets." It goes on to argue that South Africa must convince the credit rating agencies "that excessive government spending will not derail the economy and that the money we borrow will be used to generate the economic growth needed to underpin our capacity to service our domestic and foreign debt." Noting the importance of both the Reconstruction and Development Plan and the way it is to be financed, the editorial concludes: "Just as President Mandela will need to reassure the electorate that government's domestic responsibilities will not be shirked so, too, will he need to guarantee to the rest of the world that the country's international responsibilities will not be subordinated to domestic political expediency." Land Transfer -- An editorial in the Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on page 10 on 23 May examines the "surreptitious KwaZulu land transfer," which, it argues, "was a cynical attempt by the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] to secure and expand its power base and deny an ANC-dominated central government a sphere of influence in a major part of KwaZulu-Natal." The editorial characterizes the role of former President de Klerk in the deal as "somewhat inexplicable" and says that the motive of the IFP should have been obvious to him and should have caused him to balk on the deal. The editorial concludes: "A reversal of the transfer is an obvious option but not necessarily the correct or only one. We urge President Nelson Mandela to make a careful study of the situation and not be rushed into a response or decision." Affirmative Action -- The Cape Town CAPE TIMES in English carries an editorial on page 8 of its 18 May issue in which it addresses the need for an affirmative action program. It argues that "affirmative action should be enforceable by law" because leaving it to the discretion of employers would result in tokenism. On the other hand, it advises against "a blanket scheme with specific quotas." The editorial continues: "A comprehensive policy of training must be embarked on. The training must be from the bottom up, so that black employees are not promoted beyond their own levels of experience or qualifications....Nothing can be more damaging to the self-esteem of promising black employees than to find themselves in positions with which they cannot cope. Merit must be a major criterion, even if it is not the only one."
