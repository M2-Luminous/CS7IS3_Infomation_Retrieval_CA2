Here are the details. The 186th Ground Attack Instructor Regiment, based at Kakaydy Airfield in Uzbekistan at the junction of the Tajik, Afghan and Uzbek borders, is a component part of the Russian Federation Air Force Grouping. The regiment was formed on the basis of the Borisoglebsk Air Training Center and the backbone of its flight personnel are very experienced instructor pilots (hence the regiment's name). The appearance of instructor air regiments in the Air Force makeup is no accident. According to the new methodology of putting young pilots in formation, the main emphasis, in contrast to past times, is placed on air training centers in which pilots perfect flying skills obtained in schools and rehearse tactics of combat employment of equipment. The new level of flight personnel training demanded a new level of instructors: a combat pilot can be trained only by a mentor possessing combat experience. This was the basis for forming special instructor regiments. The 186th Ground Attack Instructor Regiment is armed with Su-25BM and Su-25UB attack aircraft. Before restationing to Kakaydy, the regiment was covering Russian troops in the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict zone. It was there that enormous depictions of the Russian flag appeared on the fins of many aircraft along with the red stars inherited from the USSR, which permitted distinguishing the regiment's aircraft at least in some way from Georgian Air Force Su-25's of the same type--the only aircraft being produced there in Tbilisi. The regiment rebased to Kakaydy on 24 July 1993 at the most critical moment on the border, after the death of 25 border guards in the 12th Border Outpost, when numerous well-armed detachments of rebels and Afghan mujahedin were proceeding over several crossings constructed across the Pyandzh into the interior of Tajikistan. In the first days the pilots flew several combat sorties each, dropping up to 80 tonnes of bombs a day. The standard combat payload consisted of six OFAB-250's and two R-60M air-to-air missiles for self-defense in a possible encounter with Afghan fighters, and also two suspended fuel tanks. The decisive actions of the ground attack pilots broke the course of events and permitted the border guard personnel and motorized riflemen to dig in firmly at the occupied positions. Together with a group of Moscow Military District Air Force staff officers headed by Lieutenant-General of Aviation Nikolay Antoshkin, which was making an inspection trip, your correspondent flew in to Kakaydy Air Base in a period of relative lull. Our Il-76MD also delivered another shift of pilots and technicians from Buturlinovka, the Borisoglebsk Air Training Center airfield. As already mentioned, by agreement with the government of Uzbekistan, the 186th Ground Attack Instructor Regiment is operating from its territory. Because of the absence of national cadres and the break in economic ties, the Republic Armed Forces are in an extremely difficult situation. Russian servicemen who arrived encountered a mass of problems: long-range and short-range navigation systems were not operating at the airfield. The Uzbek Air Force 115th Guards Fighter Regiment based at Kakaydy, previously regarded as one of the best, is experiencing a great shortage of technical flight personnel. Therefore along with conducting combat operations, personnel of the Russian Air Force regiment had to restore airfield equipment and guard the entrusted equipment and ammunition under very difficult conditions of Central Asian heat, sand storms, and a shortage of potable water and of adjusted everyday life--air conditioners are absent and the food ration is monotonous. High combat proficiency helps avoid losses in people and equipment while inflicting considerable damage on the enemy. The following fact attests to the pilots' proficiency and to the Su-25's combat capabilities: with one pass at the target, the positions of a DShK [Degtyarev and Shpagin heavy machinegun] antiaircraft battery, Major Vdovin destroyed three out of four machineguns with a bomb strike. In the last days of September it was learned that several pilots headed by regimental commander Colonel Aleksey Golovin, an Afghan War veteran, were recommended for state awards at the initiative of the ground troops command in Tajikistan. The majority of servicemen of the 186th Ground Attack Instructor Regiment believe that by covering the border on the Pyandzh River they are defending the borders of Russia and of Commonwealth countries. If they were to leave here, it is fully likely that in a short time interval they will have to fight the very same enemy, only several hundred kilometers to the north.
