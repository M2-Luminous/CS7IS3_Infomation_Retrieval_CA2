FBIS4-68018 "jptot018__l94002" JPRS-TOT-94-018-L JPRS Terrorism FOUO 2 May 1994 INTERNATIONAL Egyptian `Special' Unit Reportedly Returns From Training in Egyptian `Special' Unit Reportedly Returns From Training in U.S. JN0205135094 Paris AL-MUHARRIR in Arabic 2 May 94 p 20 JN0205135094 Paris AL-MUHARRIR Arabic BFN ["Exclusive" report by AL-MUHARRIR correspondent in Washington] [Text] A special Egyptian unit has returned to Cairo from the United States where it received training under the supervision of U.S. agencies on operations requiring more sophisticated training than could be provided by Egyptian security agencies. The units were trained at the expense of an oil-rich Arab country. Competent U.S. quarters did not deny that the units' future tasks would include the execution of operations outside Egyptian boundaries for the United States or the state that has financed the units' training. It has been rumored here that among the expected or scheduled operations may be one or more in Sudan against the ruling Islamic Front and some of its leaders. The expected operations in Sudan will particularly target Usamah Bin-Ladin, who has been accused by foreign and certain Arab quarters of financing and leading extremist fundamentalist movements. Usamah Bin-Ladin announced in Sudan that he has joined the Saudi opposition movement in London and that he supports its objectives. Bin-Ladin's announcement came in reaction to the Saudi authorities' withdrawal of his Saudi passport. Western circles believe that part of the al-Shaykh religious family in Saudi Arabia supports and finances the opposition.
