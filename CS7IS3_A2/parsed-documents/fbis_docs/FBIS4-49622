FBIS4-49622 "drchi089_u_94004" FBIS-CHI-94-089 Daily Report 21 Mar 1994 PRC MEDIA ON TAIWAN AFFAIRS Development of Relations With Taiwan Discussed Development of Relations With Taiwan Discussed HK0905053094 Beijing LIAOWANG in Chinese No 12, 21 Mar 94 p 47 HK0905053094 Beijing LIAOWANG Chinese BFN ["Letter From Beijing" by Bao Xin (7637 0207): "Maintain a Consensus, Push Forward the Development of Cross-Strait Relations"] [Text] My brothers, The fourth round of working talks between the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] and the Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF] is to be held in Beijing late this month. Much attention has been given to the talks on both sides of the Taiwan Straits, because the goal is to reach a mutually agreed- upon draft agreement, based on the consensus reached in Beijing early last month between the persons-in-charge of ARATS and SEF. These talks will play an important role of continuing the process already begun and paving the way for future development in pushing forward the growth of cross-strait ties. Whether the task shouldered by the fourth round of working talks can be smoothly carried out or not depends on the joint efforts of both sides. What is pleasant and encouraging is that both sides have given very high credence to the consensus reached in the Tang [Shubei]-Chiao [Jen-ho] talks in Beijing in early February, and both have taken an active and optimistic attitude towards translating such views into an agreed-upon text. Tang Shubei, executive vice chairman of ARATS, observed that in the February talks between Mr. Chiao Jen-ho and himself, three issues existing in the working talks had been settled in terms of overall direction, and the wording of a document had been informally put forward by both sides. Both sides have the willingness and confidence to fix, in the fourth talks, a draft agreement on the three issues. Koo Chen-fu, chairman of the board of SEF, commented that it was not easy to gain in five days the achievements of the third round of talks held in early February, proving the influence and importance of high-level dialogue. Chiao Jen-ho, vice-chairman and secretary general of SEF, hoped that the results of his talks with Tang Shubei would cause a consensus to be reached as swiftly as possible in the fourth round of working talks so that final preparation for signing an agreement could be completed. Admittedly, there will be difficulties in translating the consensus achieved into the concrete articles of the agreement, and disagreements do need to be overcome. However, with the consensus reached last time as the basis, it is presumed those problems will not be difficult to resolve. What needs to be mentioned in particular is that the first point of the 5-point consensus expressed in the joint press release is: "Both sides hold that in the working talks between ARATS and SEF, political issues should be avoided with an attitude of pragmatism." It is an important sign that progress has been made in the working talks between the two associations. People believe that as long as both sides make joint efforts and maintain and keep to the consensus, instead of damaging and diverging from the consensus, they will be able to overcome disagreements and finalize the drafting of the agreement articles. In the first point of the five-point consensus of the joint press release of the Tang-Chiao talks, it was stipulated that in the fourth round of working talks -- to be held in late March -- opinions would be exchanged or discussions conducted on several economic and scientific and technological issues cited in the "Joint Agreement of the Wang-Koo Talks". An important achievement of the Wang-Koo talks was that economic, scientific, and technological topics should be included on the agenda of the cross-strait working talks as soon as possible. Only because of the Taiwan side was that important topic not fixed until the February Tang-Chiao talks as one of the contents of the next talks. Although the wording in this paragraph was determined through modification just before the release of news of the talks and therefore economic, scientific, and technological topics were not formally included on the agenda, it does show, all the same, that both sides have reached a certain degree of consensus on this issue. As a matter of fact, it is in the interest of the people on both sides to strengthen cross-strait economic and trade exchange and cooperation, whether in terms of the current realities of the relationship between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits, or in terms of looking into the vast prospects of cross-strait economic and trade cooperation. In this respect, we should not avoid general problems that await both sides to settle through discussion and coordination, nor is it proper to procrastinate. As authorized nongovernmental bodies, ARATS and SEF should shoulder the task of promoting economic and scientific and technological exchange and cooperation between the two sides. At this moment, it is very difficult to soften and eliminate, in a short period of time, political disagreements formed because of the long-time estrangement between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits. Yet complementary and mutually beneficial economic and trade exchange and cooperation between the two sides can build closer cross-strait relations. The progress in cross-strait relations in recent years demonstrates that among nongovernmental contacts and exchanges between the two sides, the most dynamic factor is economic and trade cooperation and exchange, which not only plays a positive role in promoting the economic prosperity of the two sides, but also promotes the healthy, mutually driving development of cross-strait relations. It can be said that, with the two sides having more common economic interests, it will be beneficial in greatly increasing the mutual trust and consensus between both sides. The mainland side has made unceasing efforts to promote economic and trade exchange and cooperation between the two sides of the straits. Not long ago, the Law of the People's Republic of China on Protecting the Investments of Taiwan Compatriots was examined and approved during the Sixth Session of the Standing Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress. The law provides the highest level and fullest legal protection of investments in the mainland by Taiwan compatriots. Its promulgation and execution will certainly promote cross-strait economic and trade exchange and cooperation. Meanwhile, it will create the favorable conditions for ARATS and SEF to jointly discuss topics on cross-strait economic cooperation. May the fourth round of working talks between ARATS and SEF be a complete success! Sincerely, [Signed] Bao Xin [Dated] 13 March
