B. Yehoshu'a, stirred up quite a public outcry some months ago when he asserted that any of the settlers who want to stay in the territories under the Palestinian governing authority have to make that possible. Now, when it is obvious that the hard core of the settlers will steadfastly refuse to vacate their homes, and certainly will refuse to accept the new laws to be applied by the Palestinians, the question arises whether, and to what extent, the government must take responsibility for those who will not obey the law. "What this means," says Yehoshu'a, "is that two possibilities exist under a permanent agreement with the Palestinians. Either the settlers will prefer to receive compensation, leave their homes and come back inside the Green Line, or they will acquiesce to Palestinian jurisdiction and a Palestinian ID card." It is difficult to believe that the fanatic hard core will submit to Palestinian jurisdiction. After all, they do not even accept the laws of Israel. "They still recognize the state of Israel. We are talking about a Jewish minority facing a million Arabs after the agreement. None of them is so stupid that he won't accept Palestinian control when the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is gone." [Aylon] If they do not accept one of the two possibilities, will Israel still have to risk the lives of IDF soldiers to protect them? [Yehoshu'a] The IDF is leaving. It won't be there to protect anyone. There will be Palestinian policemen. They will deprive the settlers of their weapons, although only pursuant to the Oslo agreement, of course. So, the settlers will have only one of two options. There is no third alternative. The handful who will cause problems will have to be removed. It will be one man, maybe two. This is not going to become the Wild West. Just as there will be running water and electrical service, so there will be proper laws. And what can they do? If they do something, the Palestinian police will deal with them just the way the Palestinians will deal with any Jewish civilian who sneaks into territory under their authority. [Aylon] Do you think that the massacre that Goldstein perpetrated in the Cave of the Patriarchs will speed up the peace process? [Yehoshu'a] I hope it will. Recent events have far outpaced the government's rate of thinking and analysis. Nonetheless, Rabin, on the basis of what he has said, is confident that he is in control of things, that the negotiations are proceeding exactly in accordance with the a priori concept under which he entered negotiations with the Palestinians. He even promised during the election campaign to make peace within nine months. He just did not say what he meant by peace. But nine new moons are already behind us, the gestation period for delivery is receding into a vague horizon, and there still is no baby to kiss. Some will say that it is too early and that we need to let more time pass. Somehow, the politicians always say that it is too early to tell, too early to act. The only question is, when will real peace stop being too early? Perhaps when it is too late. Goldstein's wife, Miriam, told the press yesterday that her husband was not insane, he just wanted to halt the peace process. A single sentence loaded with so many signs of the new historical situation that is unfolding before our eyes. This is not something that began today or the day before. Nor last Friday, with Goldstein's death toll. It might have begun during the first days of the intifadah when, just as occurred elsewhere, a local seed of rebellion was planted. We are talking about global processes playing out in our own arena; you can feel them in such a tangible way that only obtuse fanatics cannot see what is happening to them right under their noses. Isn't it clear that the dominating idea of the next millennium will be the liberation of man and respect for him for what he is? If, until 50 years ago, no conquering state would ever have considered returning the land it had occupied, it will be almost unthinkable in the 21st century that occupied lands can remain in the hands of the conqueror. That happened in the Soviet Union, it happened in Europe, it is happening now in Bosnia, and it is happening here, in Israel. Here, however, it sometimes seems that the Middle Ages have not yet ended and that the Crusades are still in fashion. That, more or less, is what Goldstein did. And now he is in the earth, sanctified. He was not crazy, says his wife without realizing that she is insulting the insane. Statistically, every director of a hospital psychiatric ward will tell you, the mentally ill usually are not violent, and if they hurt someone, it usually is themselves. Barukh Goldstein was a normal man. Apparently, he planned his killing operation over the course of many months. He went about it as though it were a proper military mission. No one would have accepted the excuse of temporary insanity if he had been tried for his crime. Given that, Goldstein may have been an extremist although absolutely normal, and none of us can hide behind the supposition that he was deranged. Nor can anyone absolve us of the collective feelings of guilt submerged under the club of occupation for the last 27 years. Nevertheless, Goldstein will be unable, although that was his declared intention, to stop the peace process. For the peace process, even in the local sense, is not a process of coexistence and brotherhood but a process of self- and national-liberation, and no power on earth can stop it. If Rabin is still angry at [Nisim] Zvili for saying that a Palestinian state definitely will arise, it is only political-strategic anger, feigned merely so that the other side in the negotiations will not think that it already has all its freedom in its pocket. It also implies that we, not they, are the ones who will decide when, where and how freedom will be granted. So, if Goldstein is not plain nuts, nor someone who will succeed in stopping the peace process, he at most is one of the settler/terrorists, as the radical settlers are prepared to be. The act he did has caused a wave of identification among the extremists, some of whom had decided even before last Friday that the laws of the state are a Zionist farce not to be taken seriously. And so, while the government ponders who, if anyone, is to be prohibited arms, they are interviewed on television, announcing that they have no intention of giving anyone their weapons no matter what the government decides. Another wave, no less extreme, has already declared that it is joining the hard core of those who do not recognize the existence of the state of Israel. It is this group of radicals, those who have decided to embark on a suicidal crusade but not before taking others with them, that Goldstein has represented since last Friday. Now the question arises, what will the government do when the time comes--and that will be much sooner than people think--and a comprehensive settlement between Israel and the Palestinians is enforced to the hilt against the settlers, too?
