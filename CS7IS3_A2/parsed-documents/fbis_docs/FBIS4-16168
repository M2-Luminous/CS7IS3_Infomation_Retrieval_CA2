There have been no intensive combat actions in the Gorazde region for over 24 hours now, he continued. True, the Muslims did make two attempts to provoke the Serbian side into opening fire but the UN forces' observers cut short these attempts. I now have assurances from Radovan Karadzic that the Serbian forces do not intend to make any further attacks or to open fire on Gorazde, of course, on condition that the Muslim side does not provoke them. After my talks in Pale and Sarajevo I have come away with the conviction that the Serbian side does not intend to throw down a challenge to the international community. Its stance makes it possible to move the negotiating process forward, although resolute steps are needed on its part to move forward toward peace in Bosnia, and, consequently, toward the removal of the sanctions against Yugoslavia, that is how the Russian deputy foreign minister assessed the results of his meetings in Sarajevo with the leadership of the Bosnian sides, the command of the UN forces, Charles Redman, the special representative of the U.S. President, David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, the cochairmen of the Geneva peace conference, and also his latest conversation with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. I handed over to Milosevic and Karadzic our proposals that would facilitate the establishment of peace in Bosnia and progress on the question of sanctions; we will be awaiting their reply to them. V. Churkin refuted reports that representatives of the UN forces were arrested and detained by the Bosnian Serbs. It is just a matter of restricting their movements, which was a reaction to the air strikes by the NATO air forces, he said. Indeed, only vehicles of the Russian battalion of "blue helmets" are freely allowed through the Serbian part of Sarajevo. This reaction was also expressed in the refusal by the Serbian side to hold talks with the command of the UN forces. I, however, told the people I was talking to that to ignore the United Nations was not in their interests. But I have no grounds to insist that they change their stance after everything that has happened. The Russian diplomat said that he will remain in Belgrade for now.
