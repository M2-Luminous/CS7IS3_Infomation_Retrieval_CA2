(a) Actions normally requiring environmental impact statements. An environmental impact statement will normally be prepared for the following types of actions: (1) Administrative procedures that seek to establish broad-scale, significant, impact-generating strategies, methods, or techniques (e.g., treatment options of individual large-scale aerial application of chemicals) as the means of dealing with pervasive animal and plant health issues within the purview of APHIS. Examples of this category of actions include: (i) Contingency or ``emergency'' response strategies (comprehensive in scope)_the design of which is intended to provide solutions, generally on very short notice, thereby severely limiting subsequent consideration of alternatives by planners and decisionmakers_to widespread outbreaks of animal and plant diseases or similar exigencies, and (ii) Strategic or other long-range plans that purport to adopt for future application, in the context of extensive APHIS programs, a preferred course of action having the potential for significant environmental impact. (2) General administrative (programmatic) examination of APHIS strategies and options for dealing with issues that have important implications for the maintenance and enhancement of environmental quality. An example of this category of actions is: (1) An administrative proceeding undertaken to rationalize, prioritize, and streamline_particularly from the standpoint of competing policies (e.g., environmental policies and economic development)_essential activities related to program mission and functions.
