Belarus is insisting that the payment notes of the National Bank of the republic during the merger of the money systems should be exchanged for Russian rubles at a rate of one to one. Russia supports a rate of three Belarusian rubles to one Russian. The second issue is that Belarus is making efforts to ensure that Russia's domestic prices for energy sources and raw materials after the merger of the money systems will also apply to the territory of Belarus, while representatives of the Russian Government do not agree with this. It is thought that an attempt to overcome these differences will be made today at the working meeting in Moscow of S. Shushkevich, chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Belarus, with B. Yeltsin, president of the Russian Federation. Taking part in the talks on the Belarusian side are Vice Premier U. Zalamay and National Bank Board Chairman S. Bagdankevich.
