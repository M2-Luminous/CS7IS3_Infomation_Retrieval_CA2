What is making you drift to the right: the awakening desire for conservatism or the taste of power? [Szajer] The FIDESZ remains in the center and it is open in both directions; it has not denied its liberal values for a moment, and it has no desire whatsoever for conservatism. It is a fact, however, that the FIDESZ has refused to participate in the increasingly radical political polarization. We try to remain objective. Given that the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] is our main electoral rival, we are formulating our criticism of the MSZP more firmly. This also derives from our center position. [passage omitted] [Hajba] There is something behind the fact that you are now forced to explain yourself to a public that earlier sympathized with the FIDESZ. If the FIDESZ remained in its old position but the public thinks that it is drifting to the right, does this mean that many people's eyes have deteriorated simultaneously? [Szajer] No. The public probably senses a sham-movement. Political public opinion has moved, not we. The FIDESZ is sticking to the essence of its economic policy and ideology as formulated in 1990. However, the public did not acknowledge this at the time. They failed to analyze or discuss it, and the press also manifested some sort of reserved sympathy toward our party. It did not criticize us and did not ask questions. Most people saw the FIDESZ as a romantic, pure, and democratic human rights movement. However, a movement would not have been able to survive; thus, we had to transform into a professional party. This is one aspect involved. The other is that, at this year's election, no party is expected to get as many seats as the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] got earlier. Thus, we will probably have to think in terms of a coalition of various parties, and this automatically means compromise. This is natural for a party, but it is not necessarily welcome to people who still regard the FIDESZ as a group or movement of romantic guys opposing something. [Hajba] In my opinion, people have nothing against compromise; rather, they think that the future allies are not suitable for the FIDESZ. It seems that this country has had enough of bad political marriages. [Szajer] Several parties have declared their willingness to form a coalition with the FIDESZ, but we have not yet gone anywhere to ask for any girl's hand in marriage; we only cooperate with the other liberal party, the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]. Therefore, there is no basis whatsoever for any combination before the elections. [passage omitted] [Hajba] From the viewpoint of stability, it is difficult to envisage how the two coalition parties sticking to their ideas will be able to cooperate with the liberal SZDSZ and the FIDESZ, if these political organizations maintain their original image. [Szajer] I would not enjoy such a coalition either. However, it is impossible to exclude the possibility completely. I think that there is no longer any question that the current government coalition has to go. This is precisely the goal of the FIDESZ, namely to make sure that no such coalition can again be formed after the elections. [Hajba] Viktor Orban announced... [Szajer] That was not an announcement; it was only an idea... [Hajba] In other words, Orban's words probably caused surprise because of earlier statements. When Peter Boross spoke of a possible coalition with the FIDESZ in a foreign newspaper, Viktor Orban regarded his words as a political provocation. [Szajer] The FIDESZ did not sign a preliminary agreement with any coalition party. Viktor Orban answered a question and confirmed the party's position, namely that the FIDESZ is open in every direction and can envisage cooperation with all the democratic parties. [Hajba] In that case, you do not consider the MSZP to be a democratic party because, according to Viktor Orban's statement, the FIDESZ would not form a coalition with the MSZP. [Szajer] Among the members of the opposition roundtable, the FIDESZ was the first to declare that the MSZP cannot be excluded either. It is another matter whether the National Committee would accept a coalition in which the MSZP is the leading force. [Hajba] Would the National Committee accept this? [Szajer] Most probably not. [Hajba] What if the MDF were the strongest party in the future coalition? [Szajer] I think the National Committee would not accept that either; we would prefer to stay in opposition. Naturally, it is another situation if we have the chance for a coalition under a strong liberal dominance. Therefore, a lot depends on who asks whom for a coalition and what bargaining position we achieve at the elections. Until then, it is totally useless to say categorical and exclusive things.
