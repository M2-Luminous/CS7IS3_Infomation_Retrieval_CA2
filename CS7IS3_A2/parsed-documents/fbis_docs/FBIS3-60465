But diphtheria has now resurfaced and dragged democratic Russia back to the early fifties. St. Petersburg has surpassed Kaliningrad and Moscow to take the lead in the number of people infected with disease, a fact which is a cause of shame as we approach the end of the century. The number of diphtheria victims is tripling annually as is the number of deaths. How can this uninvited guest be removed? Mayor Sobchak's instructions -- demands along the lines of protect, register, and inoculate -- have proved ineffective to date. The main reasons are the population's low level of information about the imminent danger and about the need for compulsory inoculation, as well as the shortage of vaccine.
