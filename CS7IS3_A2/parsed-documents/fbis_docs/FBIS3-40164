It is the core of the modern economy. Putting our finances in order is like making the right move that wins the chess game." This statement points out succinctly the important role and function of finance in the construction of the socialist market economy. To promote the establishment of the socialist market economic system, the pertinent departments are actively studying and drawing up a financial reform program. Here, this author would like to discuss his views on the overall program and on the development of an agricultural financial system. In formulating the financial reform program, we must make theoretical preparations and also integrate the program with reality and pay attention to its manageability. The introduction of reform programs has been slow. There has been one problem after another, and one important reason for that is that we do not have a clear understanding or a good grasp of the grass-roots situation and therefore the programs have not been very manageable. The central bank is plagued by this problem, and so is the Agricultural Bank. As a result, the old system basically has been rejected, but the new system has yet to be formulated. The rank and file below are uncertain and often cannot carry out even their regular tasks. In view of this situation, we should pay special attention to the following two issues: One, the reform measures must be in close touch with reality. We must investigate and study and acquire a good understanding of the situation at the grass-roots level, and thereupon, we can formulate the reform program. At the same time, when the higher-ups formulate a reform program, the grass-roots level comrades should be asked to participate, and their suggestions should be heeded; we must avoid doing everything behind closed doors. We must pay close attention to the manageability of the measures. Only in this way can we start out from reality, seek truth from facts, shoot the arrow at the target--have a specific goal, and pour water off a steep roof--operating from a strategically advantageous position. Only then can we avoid unnecessary repetition and loss and the reform measures can be put into effect successfully. Two, we must be decisive in implementing financial reform and try to achieve our goals in one step where possible. After the reform measures are introduced, we must implement them with resolution. If the new system is not quickly established, the army's morale will be shaken and the troops will be unstable, and some organs may become shortsighted--behaving improperly from the ideological and organizational point of view, which will adversely affect their everyday tasks and in turn jeopardize the entire economic development. We must be decisive when decisions are called for; otherwise, we may incur huge losses. Agricultural Bank's profit is down this year. That has something to do with the slow pace of the restructuring of the economic system and our indecisiveness. The grass-roots organs have been too eager to get their freedom and find their own fortune and have not settled down to work. Some of the original measures have been suspended, and the grass-roots offices have lost their initiative and their enthusiasm. The second point is that we must try to achieve our reform goals in one step where possible. We might as well cut short the lingering pain and do what we set out to do as quickly as possible and then settle down to tackle our work. We must keep this principle in mind when installing organs and arranging systems and personnel-hiring mechanisms. We should treasure and seize the opportunity before us and do a good job with the reform of the financial institutions, give full play to the central role of finance in a modern economy, and promote the establishment of China's socialist market economic system and the economy's sustained, smooth, and speedy development. With regard to rural financial reform, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th Party Central Committee's decision pointed out that China's Agricultural Bank should be reorganized to take on clearly defined policy-oriented business and that rural cooperative banks and urban cooperative banks should be set up step by step where necessary. The Central Committee's decision was a correct one. The rural financial system should be put in the context of the overall situation. Specifically, I have the following suggestions: The idea of setting up agricultural policy-oriented banks is correct, but we must pay attention to their efficiency. In terms of the restructuring of the rural financial system as a whole, it is essential that we separate policy-oriented from business-oriented undertakings. This suits today's condition of rural economic reform and facilitates the restructuring of the rural economy and the financial system as a whole. If we fail to make the separation, specialized banks cannot emerge as commercial banks. As far as the rural financial system is concerned, it still has arduous agricultural aid, poverty relief, and economic development responsibilities. The separation can help to guarantee the fulfillment of those responsibilities. What are policy-oriented banks? It is difficult to define policy-oriented undertakings. The line between policy-oriented and business-oriented undertakings is often blurred. Does policy-orientation necessarily imply money-losing ventures? This is not necessarily true. One, what are policy-oriented banks? Policy-oriented banks or policy-oriented udertakings refer to supporting certain projects in accordance with the government's macro program or industrial policy or intention. This kind of support does not seek immediate profit, but in the long-run, it does produce economic benefits, although it takes a longer period of time. The principle behind fund utilization is profit maximization. Some of the large-scale policy-oriented projects the Agricultural Bank once supported, such as the Huanghuahai development and the Sanjiang basin development projects, were also profit-oriented. Our overall goal is to turn banks into bona fide banks. Policy-oriented banks are also banks. If they keep losing money, they will not be banks. This point should be made very clear. Two, policy-oriented banks' fund sources: One source is funds which the state used to appropriate but now lends out to banks. They are state funds. Another source is the central bank's basic currency (re-lending funds). This guarantees some low-cost funds. A third source is the citizens' savings deposits and enterprise deposits and so on which the policy-oriented banks themselves must work hard to attract. When they make loans, they can be business-oriented and should make sure that there is profit to be made, or at least they are not lending money at below cost. This is clearly different [as published] as commercial banks do business. Three, the installation of policy-oriented banks: We must consider fully the realities of rural economic development and install organs according to economic divisions, such as in agricultural development areas and old liberated, minority nationality, border, and remote areas; we should install fewer or no organ in the coastal and other economically well-developed regions. Policy-oriented banks can handle some commercial business, but commercial banks must not seek funds earmarked for policy-oriented undertakings. This is a necessary administrative intervention; otherwise it will dampen the enthusiasm of policy-oriented banks. These banks' organ installation, fund sources, and interest policy must give expression to the term "policy-oriented." They should be selective about certain reform-oriented undertakings; they can enhance their ability to tackle policy-oriented undertakings. Four, policy-oriented banks must assume diverse functions. The goal is to turn them into open, multipurpose, and modern banks. They should handle international businesses, including utilizing funds from the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and United Nations' Food and Agricultural Organization, but they must not bring in foreign commercial loans. In short, first and foremost, policy-oriented banks are banks. They are not government agencies nor institutions, nor are they the old, single-purpose Agricultural Bank. When we plan, organize, and operate policy-oriented banks, we must put them in the context of an international environment and the greater environment of the market economy. The installation of rural commercial banks must be within definite regional boundaries. China's rural areas have gone through more than a decade of reform, and the development of the market economic system has actually preceded that in the urban areas, and the rural economy, especially the market economy, has developed rapidly. It now requires the services of other compatible financial institutions. The rapid growth of all types of enterprises in the rural areas can provide fund sources for the commercial banks, and facilitated by the bank's services, they can further develop. A strong and well-developed rural economy can provide more tax revenues for the state. This creates a benign cycle. The installation of commercial banks require definite regional boundaries. Commercial banks should not be set up in poverty-striken regions; otherwise, they may draw funds away from the policy-oriented banks. In the economically well-developed regions, the Agricultural Bank should be reorganized into a commercial bank. Commercial banks should be set up according to international standards. We should smash all kinds of rigid conventions, so that many commercial financial institutions can exist in the same region, creating a competitive situation and promoting better services. It should be pointed out that setting up policy-oriented banks is not the wisest choice. We should say that it is but a transitional measure. Even after the policy-oriented banks are set up, we still need a state-policy to guide the commercial banks. For example, the state should have an incentive policy when commercial banks voluntarily grant policy-oriented loans. The general principle is to walk on two legs and make sure that the state's policy-oriented undertakings are accomplished. In this respect, we can learn from the successful experiences of France and Thailand and other nations. Reform of the rural credit organs should give expression to the principle of providing classified guidance and step by step implementation. When talking about reform of the rural cooperative financial institutions, it should be pointed out emphatically that they were created and developed at a time when the cooperative agricultural economy and the productive forces were underdeveloped, and therefore we must give full expression to the principle of classified guidance and step by step implementation: In regions where the market economy is well-developed, resources are regulated primarily by the market; the environment has changed, the management standards are higher, and they are financially stronger. People whom the cooperatives used to serve and who bought shares now own only nominal shares. Credit cooperatives exist in name only today; the cooperative economic base is gone. Therefore there is a need to reorganize them into agricultural cooperative banks. Promptly setting up urban cooperative banks is practical in the economically better-developed cities. In the poverty-striken regions, the commodity economy is underdeveloped; they still have a natural or semi-natural economy. Individual producers have limited financial strength; they need the services of credit cooperative-type organizations. Because this kind of regional credit cooperative is small in scale, they cannot be managed like cooperative banks. We must not use the same measures across the board or lump everything together; we must deal with different situations in different ways. The rise and fall of rural credit cooperatives throughout history should be a lesson to us.
