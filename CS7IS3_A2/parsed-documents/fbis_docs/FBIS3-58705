If they want to reinstate politics and win back their credibility, then they must first restore order themselves. Let us make this a priority for the coming months." Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, speaking yesterday at a CVP [Christian People's Party] New Year's reception in Ingelmunster, was referring tacitly but unmistakeably to the present atmosphere of scandal in parliament, following on from the Agusta case. "In the past, and far too frequently even today, all sorts of questions where wrongly settled on a party-political basis," he said. "They went from telephone connections through appointments to government contracts. This gave birth to the totally incorrect image that anything can be arranged on a party-political basis." It was an analysis of the antipolitical atmosphere currently overshadowing parliament that amounted to the following diagnosis: it is your own fault. "Politics must become far more humble," he said. "Politics neither can nor should pull everything toward it and want to decide everything. And in those matters that must be settled politically, a partisan approach must be excluded as far as possible, especially when the practical functioning of government is involved. To this end, decision-making procedures in a range of fields must be made legally and administratively objective. Obvious examples are recruitment and appointments in the civil service and magistracy. Fortunately, important steps recently have been taken in the right direction, but we must go farther." The prime minister then broached the theme of `rendering services.' "The mediatory role often expected of politicians by the population must be made increasingly official by appointing ombudsman positions," he said. "That is what has happened in state-owned companies. That is also the purpose of the government's draft bill to set up a general ombudsman position. Greater autonomy and responsibility must also be given to the departments concerned in awarding government contracts. The principle of seeking the best price-quality ratio must be made more general." "The practice of (indirect) economic compensation, which has cost us a lot of money but resulted in little, must also be stopped," he said. "The legislation on government contracts must be changed in this sense." This comment can be applied without modification to the Agusta case, where alleged compensation was decisive, with far-reaching consequences. The prime minister continued his thoughts in that direction, still without mentioning Agusta by name. "The financing of the political parties also continued for too long in a grey shadowy area which poses many questions," he said. "There is a need for clarity and transparency. The laws on the limitation of electoral campaigns and the financing of the political parties are steps in the right direction. However, they must be tightened up." There was a third recommendation which flows directly from the Agusta affair, namely the abuse of parliamentary immunity. "The parliamentary status gives rise to misunderstanding and even suspicion," Dehaene said. "Does parliamentary immunity really still belong to our time? In fact, the status offers no protection, but the contrary: Now MP's are judged twice." Once during the debate on lifting their immunity, and a second time if prosecution actually takes place. "The financial, social and fiscal status must also be clarified," Dehaene said. "There is no need for privileges or such things, but a proper social and financial status allowing MP's to work well, a status that also makes the position attractive again." "The St. Michael's agreement contains important elements of political renewal," Dehaene said, briefly interrupting his invisible Agusta thread at Ingelmunster, but soon picking it up again. "The renewal is too slow. We must go fasterr. Let us make that a priority for the coming months. But then it is necessary that clarity be quickly established in a number of areas. That is in the interest not only of those involved, but politics as a whole." That presupposes, the prime minister concluded, that "all instances respect the rules." This was understood as veiled criticism of the very regular breaches of confidentiality in the Agusta affair investigations. "Democracy is a delicate plant that must be nourished carefully," he said.
