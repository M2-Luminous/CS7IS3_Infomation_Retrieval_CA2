The government admits that as a whole public employees receive low salaries, as do most Brazilian earners of salaries. Aware of this situation, the government has been implementing economic and financial reforms that will soon allow the country to resume development and, above all, improve the standard of living of workers in general. Despite government efforts, however, some believe they can coerce the federal executive branch into granting special favors to certain sectors of public employees. Within this framework some sectors of the Federal Police, dissatisfied with their current salaries, began a strike many weeks ago. This strike has been hindering activities linked to public security, which are essential for normal national life, and have been generating violent actions against the public and against public assets. These sectors have been doing all this in an attempt to intimidate the federal government and exert pressure on it. The government will not allow public order to be threatened by those who have the duty to preserve it. It will not allow government assets to be unduly used or raided. It will not allow essential public services to be discontinued. Complying with the obligations that the Constitution and the laws impose on it, the executive branch will adopt all measures needed to maintain public order and preserve public security and peace.
