"With all the problems and all the terrible things that are happening and all the economic backsliding which has occurred, there is a lot of hope in Africa," Clinton said in a speech to a White House conference on Africa. The two-day white house conference on Africa, which began on Sunday [26 June], brought together 150 experts from government agencies, think tanks and universities to seek new approaches to dealing with Africa's problems. Clinton asked all participants "to help us to develop an American constituency for Africa that creates lasting links between our people and their people." The President said Americans' knowledge of Africa "is pretty low, except when something horrible happens and then it just cuts through our hearts and it seems so overwhelming that we can't do anything about it." "But I do know we need a new policy," Clinton said. "I do believe Africa matters to America." Clinton told the participants that the most important thing he could do in the aftermath of this conference is "to do whatever the president can do to develop that constituency, to explain to American people, of whatever race, region or background, why Africa matters to all of us and to our common future." "Let's build a constituency. Let's remind people there are things to hope about, as well as things to fear," he said.
