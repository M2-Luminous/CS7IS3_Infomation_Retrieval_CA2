Surprisingly, the meeting was held behind closed doors at a Febrerista Revolutionary Party office, after the meeting that should have been held at the Vice Presidency last week was canceled without explanation. Dr. Seifart said that the foreign minister had reminded Seifart that as vice president of the Republic, he could not receive the DPRK politician at the Vice Presidency because Paraguay does not have diplomatic relations with the DPRK. It has been rumored, however, that the U.S. and ROK Embassies had strongly opposed the meeting. "We want to be consistent with regard to our international policies. Until these two countries solve their unification problem we cannot risk harming the relations we have already established," Seifart explained. He thus tried to justify the position of the president of the Republic, who from the beginning said that his administration would not establish diplomatic relations "with any Communist country." Seifart pointed out, however, that despite not having diplomatic relations with the DPRK, the government would not oppose having trade relations with that country.
