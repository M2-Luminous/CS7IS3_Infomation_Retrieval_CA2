Unlike the last campaign in 1989 -- which reflected Mrs Thatcher's deep ambivalence to the whole European concept -- the manifesto seeks to balance Mr Major's commitment to place Britain at the heart of Europe with a pledge to hold back the centralising tendencies that have become more apparent in the intervening five years. Mr Douglas Hurd, the Foreign Secretary -- who was in Russia yesterday and missed the formal launch -- believes the 56-page manifesto. A strong Britain in a Strong Europe, sits comfortably with the views of 90 per cent of the parliamentary party. It emphasises: a. Prosperity, with jobs a priority; b. Decentralisation, with less interference from Brussels; c. Open trading, based on free markets and least bureaucracy; d. Competitiveness, to confront the Asian challenge; e. Expansion, to include former Eastern bloc countries; f. Keeping a veto to protect Britain's vital national interests. The manifesto reflects the Government's determination to focus the Conservative campaign on Europe and away from domestic issues. Mr Major said the elections were not "a trivial opinion poll" about Government popularity but an important opportunity for the country to send representatives to the European parliament who would halt the lurch to the Left and the development of what he called a "stagnant socialist swamp". In the foreword, Mr Major urges voters: "You will not be voting for Europe: Right or Wrong? You will be voting Europe: Right or Left? To the Right more jobs, more prosperity in a wider union of free nations. To the Left, more petty restrictions and longer dole queues." The document makes no mention of a referendum, though Mr Major said there would not be one on whether Britain should remain in Europe and he would be "astonished" if one would be needed after the inter-governmental conference in 1996 on the future shape of Europe. Among the specific issues addressed by the manifesto are: SOCIAL CHAPTER A reminder that the opt-out secured by Mr Major at Maastricht relieved British businesses of policies that would have harmed job prospects. These included a minimum wage, compulsory works councils, new union powers, a 35-hour week and higher corporate taxes. SINGLE MARKET The assertion that Conservatives in Europe have fought for the free movement of capital, freedom and choice in air and road transport, opening up public contracts and achieving common standards for professional qualifications. BUREAUCRACY The manifesto says the Tories will press for more deregulation in Europe by simplifying or scrapping about one quarter of all EC legislation. The Government would press the Commission to set up its own deregulation unit. PARLIAMENT The European parliament is more powerful as a result of the Maastricht treaty. It can veto single market, consumer protection and research and development legislation and block the choice of the next President of the Commission when M Jacques Delors steps down later this year. The Tories say a vote for the centre-Right would mean a majority against another Socialist president. AGRICULTURE Further reforms of the Common Agriculture Policy are seen as a priority. It must be "simplified, made more responsive to the market, less bureaucratic, its costs controlled and fraud curbed". ENVIRONMENT Anti-pollution directives from Brussels in recent years have cost billions of pounds which have or will be passed on to consumers in the form of higher water charges and energy costs. The manifesto says that while many environmental issues cross national boundaries, others should be for individual states to decide. The Tories would also press for a revision of existing water directives to allow improvements "at a pace people can afford." IMMIGRATION One of the big issues. The Tories say that while minimum checks should be required for movement within the EC, citizens of other countries should be subject to full immigration controls. Britain also seeks a common definition of asylum. DEFENCE NATO would remain the cornerstone of Europe's defence and collective security, under-pinned by a continuing American presence in Europe. THE FUTURE The manifesto proposes policies for a decentralised and open Europe that is more accessible to its 350 million people.
