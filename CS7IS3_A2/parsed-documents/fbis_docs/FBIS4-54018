The services will cover all information computerized by NTT in the areas of customer and employee data. NTT has already launched a joint study with ICL to review the adequacy of information management and, if necessary, plans to procure equipment and software to reinforce its information security systems. NTT currently stores and manages computerized data on individuals and clients for about 230,000 employees and 57.3 million circuits. The current review on the status of security management was initiated because advances in data processing and communications technology have increased the risk of illegal exploitation or theft of personal information. ICL was chosen for the consulting contract because of its participation as a principal player in the European Union's (EU) information safety management technology-enhancement project (commonly referred to as the SESAME Project), abundant knowledge of the subject matter and its extensive record providing information security services to the British Government and major European and U.S. businesses. ICL has already submitted its opinion paper on improving the security management technology of NTT's information systems and both firms are now undertaking a detailed review in response to that paper. It appears that the improvement actions being considered include restrictions on access to computer networks through the use of integrated circuit cards and protective technology which prevents illegal outside access to data bases. NTT is expanding its purchases of materials and equipment from overseas sources, but the EU has always been discontented with what it viewed as NTT's preference for U.S. sources. There is the potential that the current consulting agreement with ICL will lead to the procurement of security-related equipment and software from ICL. Fujitsu holds an 80-percent ownership position in ICL and will provide the latter with operational support.
