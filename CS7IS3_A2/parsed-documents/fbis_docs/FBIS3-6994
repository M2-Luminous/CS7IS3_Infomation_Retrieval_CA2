He, dining with stooges of a unit of the puppet Army on 19 March, raved that only power can preserve peace, that they should not slacken their vigilance even for a minute, and so forth. This can only be called an absurd trick of a civilian warmonger. The entire world knows that the puppets, under the sign board of peace, last year brought the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war by running amok in war exercises and military buildup aimed at a Northward invasion. Not long ago, puppet Kim Yong-sam has wandered South Korean military academies with the military chieftains, and enumerated bellicose outbursts, such as stressing the need to boost the combat capacity of the puppet Army to the greatest extent and on the ultra-modern weapons. Therefore, the peace the puppets are raving about is in fact a war. In this perspective, the rascal's trick that peace can only be preserved when there is peace is an open incitement of confrontation and agitation of war fever. The fact that the puppets deliberately ruptured the working-level contacts for the exchange of high-level special envoys speaks well of their bellicose nature. From the beginning, they refused to accept our proposal on exchanging special envoys. What is more, they, after having reluctantly come out to the working-level delegates contact due to the public sentiment at home and abroad, created an artificial barrier to dialogues and hindered them with every means possible. During the meeting they opposed our constructive and reasonable proposals without any reason and, behind the scene of dialogue, staged war exercises in the sky, on the ground, and on the sea almost every day. In doing so, they threw a cold blanket over the North-South talks and further aggravated North-South relations. In particular, the puppets held a so-called strategic meeting of high-level ministers concerned and decided to toughen its stand against us. They even made severe outbursts that they would resume Team Spirit war exercise, bring in Patriot missiles, and join in sanctions against us. It goes without saying that this is a declaration of refusal of the exchange of special envoys, a declaration of an all-out confrontation and war with us. The puppets are talking about peace, reunification, and so forth. However, in effect, they do not want either of them. The only intention they have is unleashing a new war by stepping up war preparations for a Northward invasion. If that is not the case, why would the Kim Yong-sam clique keep pushing for the military buildup and expedite the development of nuclear weapons by going against the world trend of arms reduction? In addition, why would they, in collaboration with the outside forces, take the road of war by shaking off the fellow countrymen's hands, and brutally suppress patriotic students who oppose war and strive for peace and reunification? Confrontation and peace cannot go together. Confrontation will eventually lead to a collision and a collision will escalate to a war. No matter how many times the Kim Yong-sam puppet ring makes a peace gibberish, it would not be able to hide the ugly color of civilian warmonger who heightened the tension on the Korean peninsula and cast a somber cloud of war. As long as the Kim Yong- sam clique remains intact, our nation will not be able to evade suffering from the ravages of war. The Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique, which is confronting the fellow countrymen's desire for peace and reunification and running amok in the North-South confrontation and maneuvers to unleash a war, would not be able to avoid the stern judgment of the history and the people.
