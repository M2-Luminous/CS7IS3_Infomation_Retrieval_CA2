FR940216-2-00042 FR940216-2-00026 3. Since all shares of a Fund will be redeemable at all times; since no class of shares will have any preference or priority over any other class in the Fund in that no class will have distribution or liquidation preferences regarding particular assets and no class will be protected by any reserve or other account; and since the similarities and differences of the shares will be disclosed fully in the prospectus for each class of the Fund, investors will not be given misleading impressions regarding the safety or risk of the shares, and the nature of the shares will not be rendered speculative. 4. Applicants request an exemption from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c), and 22(d) of the Act and rule 22c&hyph;1 thereunder, to the extent necessary to permit the Funds to assess a CDSL on certain redemptions of shares, and waive the CDSL in certain instances. 5. Applicants submit that the proposed CDSL arrangement is fair, consistent with the policy and provisions of the Act, and is in the best interests of the shareholders upon whom it will be imposed. The imposition of the CDSL will not prevent a redeeming shareholder from receiving its proportionate share of the current net assets of fund or class, but merely will defer the deduction of a sales charge and make it contingent upon an event which may never occur. Additionally, the deferral of the sales charge and its contingency upon the occurrence of an event which may not occur, does not change the basis nature of this charge, which is in every other respect a sales charge. Applicants' Conditions Applicants agree that the order of the Commission granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions. A. Multi-Class System 1. Each class of shares of a Fund representing interests in the same portfolio of investments of the Fund will be identical in all respects, except for the differences related to: (a) The designation of each class of shares of the Fund; (b) expenses assessed to a class pursuant to the Plans; (c) certain Class Expenses for each class of shares, which would be limited to: (i) transfer agent fees identified by the transfer agent as being attributable to a specific class of shares; (ii) printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses, and proxies to current shareholders of a specific class; (iii) blue sky registration fees incurred by a class of shares; (iv) SEC registration fees incurred by a class of shares; (v) the expenses of the Investment Company's administrator and other administrative personnel for services required to support the shareholders of a specific class; (vi) litigation or other legal expenses relating solely to a specific class of shares (vii) trustees' fees incurred as a result of issues relating to a specific class of shares; (viii) organizational expenses incurred to establish a specific class of shares; and (ix) independent accountants' fees related solely to a specific class of shares; (d) voting rights as to matters exclusively affecting the class except as provided in condition 15; (e) exchange privileges; and (f) the conversion features of certain classes of New Shares. Any additional incremental expenses not specifically identified above that are subsequently identified and determined to be properly allocated to one class of shares shall not be so allocated until approved by the SEC pursuant to an amended order. 2. The trustees of the Investment Company, including a majority of the trustees who are not interested persons of the Investment Company (``independent trustees''), will approve the Multi-Class System. The minutes of the meetings of the trustees regarding the deliberations of he trustees with respect to the approvals necessary to implement the Multi-Class System will reflect in detail the reasons for the Trustees' determination that the proposed Multi-Class System is in the best interests of the Investment Company, the Funds, and shareholders. 3. The initial determination of the Class Expenses, if any, that will be allocated to a particular class and any subsequent changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the board of trustees of the Investment Company, including a majority of the independent trustees. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies paid or payable by a Fund to meet Class Expenses shall provide to the board of trustees, and the trustees shall review, at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures were made. 4. On an ongoing basis, the trustees, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise, will monitor the Funds for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the various classes of shares. The trustees, including a majority of the independent trustees, shall take such action as is reasonably necessary to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. The investment adviser and distributor of the Investment Company will be responsible for reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the trustees. If a conflict arises, the investment adviser and the distributor, at their own cost, will remedy such conflict, up to and including establishing a new registered management investment company. 5. The Investment Company's distributor will adopt compliance standards as to when each class of shares may be sold to particular investors. Applicants will require all person selling shares of the Investment Company to agree to conform to such standards. 6. The Shareholder Administrative Plan will be adopted and operated in accordance with the Procedures set forth in rule 12b&hyph;1 (b) through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject to rule 12b&hyph;1, except that shareholders need not enjoy the voting rights specified in rule 12b&hyph;1.
