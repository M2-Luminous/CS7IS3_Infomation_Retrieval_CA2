When meeting with visiting U.S. Senator John F. Kerry, who is also a member of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, Rong noted that China and the United States have no conflicts of fundamental interests. Instead, he added, the improvement of bilateral relations is not only in the fundamental interests of the two peoples but is beneficial to world peace and development. More U.S. statesmen and entrepreneurs are welcome to visit China and make joint efforts with their Chinese counterparts to enhance mutual understanding and prompt exchanges and cooperation in the fields of trade and economy, science and technology, Rong told Kerry. "Given the different cultural and historical backgrounds as well as social traditions, it is normal that China and the United States hold different views on some issues," Rong said. "The differences should be resolved through equal consultations in the spirit of mutual respect and seeking common ground while preserving differences." Kerry said that during his current visit, he has witnessed the major progress China has made in many fields. Rong and Kerry exchanged views frankly on the renewal of China`s most-favoured-nation trading status. Zhu Liang, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chinese National People`s Congress, was among those who participated in the meeting.
