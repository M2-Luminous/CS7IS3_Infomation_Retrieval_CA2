The central topic of debate was the mechanisms used to certify the trustworthiness of the electoral registry. Here is a report by Francisco Rubio: [Begin recording] [Rubio] On one side was a PRD alternate representative, who aggressively made charges of alleged irregularities in the electoral registry, and on the other side was the RFE executive director, who one by one rebutted the attacks with answers backed by the figures that have already been released to the public. Samuel del Villar, alternate PRD representative to the IFE, said the irregularities detected by the PRD members in the electoral registry are the result of the connection between the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party], IFE, and Salinas de Gortari. [Del Villar] We began by confirming the Salinas-PRI-IFE-RFE connection with regard to the authority to grant voting cards and to make registrations in the list of voters. [Rubio] The response was not long in coming. Regarding charges about close links between former IFE officials and now state authorities, RFE Executive Director Carlos Almada said personal biographies were not the issue. [Almada] I categorically reject the conclusions and the analyses of Dr. del Villar this evening. They simply do not coincide with reality. [Rubio] Amid countless technical explanations that diverted viewers' attention for several moments, Carlos Almada reiterated that of the 50 million Mexicans [eligible to vote], 47 million are registered in the electoral registry. He said 44 million have voting cards that have their photographs. Therefore, they will appear in the voters' list. In other words, 95 percent of Mexicans [eligible to vote] can cast their vote. He ruled out that there are ghost voters. [Almada] The ghosts are of flesh and blood. We find them in Tabasco. We find them in the Federal District. We can go see them whenever you want. [Rubio] Nevertheless, there was no clear explanation by the RFE executive director about the high cost of the external audit of the electoral register by eight private companies, one of them the Mackinsey firm which, according to Samuel del Villar, is also linked to the PRI. [Almada] As for the sum for Mackinsey, the accountants will see to it and will resolve it. [Rubio] During the televised debate between Samuel del Villar and Carlos Almada, there were no winners or losers, only a society more informed about the environment that will prevail during the 21 August elections.
