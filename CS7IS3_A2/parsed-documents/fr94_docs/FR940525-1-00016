FR940525-1-00016 FR940525-1-00007 Currently, the term ``recourse'' is not explicitly defined in the Banking Agencies' risk-based capital guidelines. Instead, the guidelines use the term ``sale of assets with recourse,'' which is defined by reference to the Call Report instructions. See Call Report instructions, Glossary (entry for ``Sales of Assets''). Once a definition of recourse is adopted in the risk-based capital guidelines, the Banking Agencies would delete the cross-reference to the Call Report instructions and would recommend to the FFIEC that these instructions be revised to incorporate the risk-based capital definition of recourse. The OTS capital regulation currently provides a definition of the term ``recourse,'' which would also be replaced once a final definition of recourse is adopted. 2. Direct Credit Substitute The proposed definition of ``direct credit substitute'' is intended to mirror the definition of recourse. The term ``direct credit substitute'' would refer to any arrangement in which an institution assumes risk of loss from assets or other claims it has not transferred, if the risk of loss exceeds the institution's pro rata share of the assets or other claims. Currently, under the Banking Agencies' guidelines, this term covers guarantees and guarantee-type arrangements. As revised, it would also explicitly include items such as purchased subordinated interests and agreements to cover credit losses that arise from purchased loan servicing rights. 3. Risks Other Than Credit Risks These definitions cover arrangements that create exposure to all types of risk. However, a capital charge would be assessed only against arrangements that create exposure to credit or credit-related risks. This continues the Agencies' current practice and is consistent with the risk-based capital standards' current, primary focus on credit risk. 4. Implicit Recourse The definitions cover all arrangements that are recourse or direct credit substitutes, in form or in substance. This continues the Banking Agencies' current treatment of recourse under the Call Report instructions. 10 Recourse exists in substance, or implicitly, when an institution demonstrates a pattern of providing recourse even though it has no legal obligation to do so. For example, an institution that regularly buys back or replaces problem assets when it is not required to do so under the terms of the sale agreement may be providing recourse. The Agencies will continue their current practice of requiring institutions that demonstrate a pattern of providing implicit recourse to treat those transactions and all similar outstanding transactions as recourse for risk-based capital purposes. The Agencies will follow the same approach, as appropriate, for direct credit substitutes. Decisions concerning implicit recourse or implicit direct credit substitute arrangements will be made on a case-by-case basis. 10 See Call Report Instructions, Glossary_Sales of Assets: Interpretations and illustrations of the general rule Â¶1, A&hyph;49 (May 1989) (retention of risk depends on the substance of the transaction, not the form). 5. Subordinated Interests in Loans or Pools of Loans The definitions explicitly cover an institution's ownership of subordinated interests in loans or pools of loans. This continues the Banking Agencies' longstanding treatment of retained subordinated interests as recourse and recognizes that purchased subordinated interests can also function as credit enhancements. Subordinated interests generally absorb more than their pro rata share of losses (principal or interest) from the underlying assets in the event of default. 11 For example, a multi-class asset securitization may have several classes of subordinated securities, each of which provides credit enhancement for the more senior classes. Generally, the holder of any class that absorbs more than its pro rata share of losses from the total underlying assets is providing recourse or a direct credit substitute for all more senior classes. 12 11 A class of securities that receives payments of principal (and, in some cases, interest) only after another class or classes from the same issue is completely paid is generally not considered recourse or a credit substitute, provided that losses are shared on a pro rata basis in the event of default. 12 Current OTS risk-based capital guidelines exclude certain high-quality subordinated mortgage-related securities from treatment as recourse arrangements due to their credit quality. OTS is not proposing to change this treatment. 6. Second Mortgages Second mortgages or home equity loans would generally not be considered recourse or direct credit substitutes, unless they actually functioned as credit enhancements by facilitating the sale of the first mortgage. This is most likely to occur if a lender originates first and second mortgages contemporaneously on the same property and then sells the first mortgage and retains the second. In such a transaction, the second mortgage would function as a substitute for a recourse arrangement because it is intended that the second mortgage will absorb losses before the first mortgage does if the borrower fails to make all payments due on both loans. Under the proposal, a second mortgage that is originated at or about the same time as the first mortgage would be presumed to be a recourse arrangement or direct credit substitute unless the holder was able to demonstrate that the second mortgage was granted for some purpose other than providing credit enhancement for the first mortgage (e.g., home improvement loans). (Question 1) The Agencies specifically request comment on this proposed treatment and on whether additional factors should be considered in determining whether a second mortgage provides recourse or a direct credit substitute. 7. Representations and Warranties When a banking organization or thrift transfers assets, including servicing rights, it customarily makes representations and warranties concerning those assets. When a banking organization or thrift purchases loan servicing rights, it may also assume representations and warranties made by the seller or a prior servicer. These representations and warranties give certain rights to other parties and impose obligations upon the seller or servicer of the assets. The definitions would treat as recourse or direct credit substitutes any representations or warranties that create exposure to default risk or any other form of open-ended, credit-related risk from the assets that is not controllable by the seller or servicer. This reflects the Agencies' current practice with respect to recourse arising out of representations and warranties, and explicitly recognizes that a servicer with purchased loan servicing rights can also take on risk through servicer representations and warranties. The Agencies recognize, however, that the market requires asset transferors and servicers to make certain representations and warranties, and that most of these present only normal, operational risk. Currently, the Agencies have no formal standard for distinguishing between these types of representations and warranties and those that create recourse or direct credit substitutes. The proposal therefore defines the term ``standard representations and warranties'' and provides that seller or servicer representations or warranties that meet this definition would not be considered recourse or direct credit substitutes.
