The opening of the crossing points will last until 31 March. The Cambodian Government earlier announced a relaxation of the timber export ban for Thai loggers to transport their timber to Thailand before the 31 March deadline. The temporary opening of the border crossing points by the Interior Ministry is a great relief for Thai loggers because their timber has been inside Cambodia since 31 December 1992 when the Thai Government ordered the closure of the crossing points in compliance with UN resolutions. Some 100,000 to 200,000 cubic meters of timber worth several hundred million baht of Thai logging companies will be sent across the border to Thailand. Before the general election and formation of the Cambodian coalition government, the Thai logging companies were lobbying with the then Cambodian regime for permission to ship their timber out of the country to no avail.
