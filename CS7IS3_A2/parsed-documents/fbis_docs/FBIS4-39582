The point is that the majority of rank and file turbine and reactor operators, engineers, and even cleaners at the nine Russian AES's have already forgotten what regular wage statements look like, and do not intend "to put up with this appalling situation any longer." The ordinary nuclear power industry workers have no one left on whom they can depend: The many months of maneuvering by the "Rosenergoatom" president, his deputies, and the AES directors in Russia's vast corridors of power, the entreaties to the government, and the undisguised threats to abandon all work on improving the reactors' safety systems -- all this did not change the situation in the sector as a whole. The indebtedness of the main consumer of the electric power generated by the AES's, the "YeES Rossii" Russian joint-stock company, has doubled since the beginning of the year and stood at 650 billion rubles [R] 1 June. It's a long time since nuclear power workers gave a thought to profit: They would just like to survive and pay off their own debts (for fuel, new equipment, construction, and repairs -- amounting to R574 billion). So as to at least stay afloat, the AES directors have been forced to economize on everything, but even this is not saving them. Only a handful of fuel assemblies and spare parts for planned repairs remain, and at several power stations it is time to enlist psychotherapists en masse to calm down the seething work force. Just recently the union of nuclear power engineering and nuclear power industry workers had completely peaceful inclinations: There was the good-natured picket at the White House, the calm talks with the government and at the Duma, the not too insistent requests to the new deputies to be, to put it mildly, more attentive to the AES's -- the reactors, they said, don't burn wood. (The only exception was the Bilibino AES in Chukotka, where several power station workers staged a protest hunger strike and threatened, in contravention of the law on resolving labor conflicts, to go on strike.) However, after the latest high-level document -- on this occasion a report on the proceedings of a conference on normalizing the situation in the sector hosted by First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets -- proved not to be worth the paper it was printed on, the trade union decided to reject any form of subordination. Now for the most important question: Will the directors succeed in maintaining strict discipline at the power stations in the coming months? (And it is so surprising how, in a constantly nerve-racking situation, the AES's have managed to get through six months without any serious emergencies?) The union recently sent a letter to the State Duma containing a proposal to immediately appropriate R574 billion to cover AES debts or to reach a decision to close all the stations down, paying for all expenditure on the reactors' shutdown, cooling, and unloading, as well as on maintaining them in a safe condition for the next five years. (The nuclear power workers calculate that this will run up a bill of more than a trillion rubles). The nuclear power workers would, of course, like to avoid the latter option, as well, incidentally, as "vigorous actions" in the event their demands are ignored yet again. By law, nuclear power workers cannot strike at all, but Vladimir Koshkin, deputy chairman of the trade union's central committee, stated yesterday in a telephone interview for your NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA correspondent that AES workers are "prepared for any form of protest." So on this occasion it is possible that the situation will end not only in group hunger strikes -- and then the government will not get away with handing out crumbs.
