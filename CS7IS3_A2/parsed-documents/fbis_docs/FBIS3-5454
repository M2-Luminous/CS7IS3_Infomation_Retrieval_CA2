At the same time the United States is demanding that we reduce our automobile tariff rate. In the past, the United States has expressed satisfaction over the ROK's schedule for opening up. Therefore, it seems that a visible apprehensive element will not immediately appear at the upcoming ROK-U.S. trade negotiations. However, since the United States is continuously showing interest in our automobiles, communications, and intellectual property rights, and is even demanding the improvement of the ROK's system and business practices, a detailed countermeasure is necessary in this field. Looking at the ROK, the United States recognizes that we may become a second Japan. It is necessary to turn our attention to this view. We do not have elaborate organizations for domestic dealings, a distribution network like a spider's web, and business practices like Japan. Therefore, there is no reason for us to be unnecessarily misunderstood. The United States is demanding that we reduce the tariff rate of U.S. automobiles -- currently 10 percent -- to 2.5 percent. When we consider the fact that Europe imposes a 10 percent import tariff rate on foreign made cars, it is difficult to accept the U.S. demand. The United States is picking a quarrel on special excise and local taxes imposed according to the car's engine displacement. The tariff rate must be readjusted in some cases, but we cannot give special treatment to foreign goods by changing our domestic law. The U.S. intention is to increase the number of its cars in the ROK market. Even though we cannot accept all the conditions the United States is demanding, we must bear in mind the hidden message it is giving us. It is now inevitable for ROK businesses to be more exposed to competition with foreign businesses. We must realize that the arena for competition is even affecting our domestic market. In the process of economic development in the past 30 years, which was mainly centered on exports, ROK consumers were sort of forced to sacrifice themselves to assist export products. Consumers could not but endure high price and low-quality goods. Strengthening competitiveness is important in an international environment, but promoting the consumer's convenience is another important yardstick in judging competitiveness. We cannot face the demands for opening up through negotiations alone. We must accelerate competitiveness among domestic businesses to strengthen their structure. However, this is also a difficult matter. Furthermore, the people's demands to obtain high-quality goods at cheap prices are increasing. Even though we have opened up, import is a monopolistic structure and the distribution level is complicated, thus, the benefits of openness are not being spread equally. The government must bear this in mind. It is also necessary for the government to resolutely revise the domestic system related to imports. When considering the general trend, the attitude of domestic businesses is to be competitive with cheap and high-quality goods and services. Also, businesses must bear in mind that they can no longer expect nor can they receive more assistance from the government and the people.
