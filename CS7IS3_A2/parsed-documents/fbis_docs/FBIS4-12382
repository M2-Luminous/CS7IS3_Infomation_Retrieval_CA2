Hence the remarkable act of martyrdom effected by a Palestinian youth in 'Afula yesterday, 40 days after the Hebron carnage. The Palestinian people's struggle using all means at their disposal is a legitimate act sanctioned by all divine and temporal laws. It is an action undertaken to uphold stolen national rights and to retaliate for the massacres and horrendous crimes committed against the Palestinian people over decades. Yesterday's reprisal was, therefore, a legitimate act of jihad; the Palestinian blood spilled on a daily basis by the gunfire of the Israeli occupiers is not as cheap as the enemy imagines. Every drop of blood spilled on the land of Palestine will kindle the spirit of challenge and heroism and nurture the values of courage and martyrdom typical of this great people who have endured the ugliest injustice in the modern age. If the decline in Arab fortunes and the exceptional circumstances the Arab nation is going through are casting their shadow on the Palestinian cause, and have put the Arabs in an unenviable position in relation to the Israeli arrogance, the downturn is temporary, and may tempt some to think that statements of condemnation and denunciation are the only weapons we have. The truth, however, is that coercion, injustice, and humiliation are bound to erupt into an explosion. Our frustrations are something like a layer of ashes over a smoldering fire. Jordan has often enough warned about the risks involved in Israel's repressive and terroristic tactics in the occupied Arab territories and the brazen breaches of the human rights of the Palestinians under occupation. His majesty has also sounded a note of warning that violence only begets violence. The only way out of the tension gripping the region and the Palestinian territory in particular is the institution of a just, comprehensive, and enduring peace predicated on the land-for-peace formula and UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. Any agreements that foster injustice and do not meet these requirements have no chance. The 'Afula act of martyrdom should sound the alarm to the permanent members of the UN Security Council, in particular the United States, that they need to pressure Israel to show more responsiveness to UN resolutions if it is serious about peace.
