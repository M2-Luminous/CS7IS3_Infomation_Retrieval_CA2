The north was represented at the meeting, arranged by the UN secretary general's special envoy to Yemen Lakhdar Brahimi, by Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, planning and development minister in the Republic of Yemen, while the south was represented by Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, prime minister of the "Democratic Republic of Yemen." Al-Iryani and al-'Attas stressed to AL-HAYAH the importance of the meeting. Al-'Attas said that the meeting with al-Iryani and Brahimi "will [as published] be limited to discussing the cease-fire question, the mechanism of observing the implementation of the cease-fire, disengaging the forces, and determining a venue and a date for the negotiations." Al-'Attas described the meeting as "a start," saying it represents "a first step." He added: "But my conclusion is also that the brothers in Sanaa are procrastinating in order to waste time at the Security Council." Al-'Attas did not rule out another meeting with al-Iryani, saying that this depends on Brahimi's "efforts." He stressed that the meeting "discussed the cease-fire issue and a monitoring mechanism to consolidate it." He also said: "We could not complete" the discussions because "Dr. al-Iryani says he is not authorized to discuss details" of the points concerning "setting a time for the cease-fire, the observers team, and the monitoring mechanism." Al-'Attas was eager not to describe the meeting as a failure, emphasizing that it is regarded as "a start." Dr. al-Iryani said that the meeting with al-'Attas and Brahimi "was not a failure. However, I say that there is an attempt to exploit legitimate actions for illegitimate ends." He denied that he said at the meeting that he is not authorized to discuss a cease-fire mechanism. He said: "Of course I am authorized to discuss the cease-fire mechanism, and this is what we discussed. We agreed on the general aspects but disagreed over some details." He went on: "As for the question of setting a new time for the cease-fire, I do not have the authority. It is to be decided by Sanaa and field commanders." He disclosed that Brahimi asked him during the meeting to set a new time for the cease-fire, but al-Iryani told him that he would inform Sanaa that a new time is required. However, he added, "it was I who requested monitoring to determine who is violating the cease-fire. I requested that the monitoring process be supervised by the French and U.S. military attaches, and Haydar (al-'Attas) proposed the inclusion of the Russian attache. I said I would convey this proposal to Sanaa." Al-Iryani stressed that holding another meeting with al-'Attas "is left" to Brahimi. He said that he is, "of course, authorized to discuss the Security Council resolution." As for setting a new time for the cease-fire, it is up to Sanaa, "and what is required is to halt the war machine." [passage omitted]
