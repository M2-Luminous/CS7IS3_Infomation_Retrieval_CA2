Representatives of such organizations and politicians of Alliance 90/Greens called on Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free Democratic Party of Germany) in Bonn on Wednesday [30 March] to exert pressure on Ankara to come to a political solution. After their return from Turkey, observers of the local elections last weekend and other eyewitnesses reported again in Bonn that, in contrast to its assurances, Ankara is using German weapons against Kurdish civilians. A Franciscan monk said that he observed a "massive presence" of BTR-60 armored personnel carriers in the battle area, took photographs of the vehicles, and passed the pictures on to the German Embassy in Ankara. Bonn had delivered 300 of these vehicles of the National People's Army (NVA) to the NATO partner. Despite the many pieces of information, the Foreign Ministry insisted that it has no proof that German weapons are used against Kurds in violation of the previous agreement. If there are no photographs, "we have a different situation," Foreign Ministry spokesman Michael Gerdts said. If the accusations prove to be true, Bonn will "react immediately." Responding to repeated admonitions by Kinkel, the Turkish Government assured that it will use the delivered weapons only within the framework of the NATO treaty, that is only for defense in case of an attack from the outside. In October 1993 a picture that showed a Kurd being dragged behind a BTR-60 armored vehicle had caused international excitement. However, since 10 BTR-60's in Turkey came from Russia, it was not possible to clarify the origin of this one vehicle without any doubt. Tilman Zuelch, chairman of the "Society for Threatened Peoples," also accused the Foreign Ministry of always brushing off information that German weapons are used against Kurds. "We no longer take the Foreign Ministry's behavior seriously," Zuelch told SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG on Wednesday: "A dialogue is completely pointless." Since 1990 alone Bonn provided Ankara with armament materiel worth more than 1 billion German marks. Among other things, 240 Leopard tanks and 13 Phantom combat planes came from western Germany; in addition to the 300 armored personnel carriers and 60 million rounds of appropriate ammunition, materiel from the NVA stocks includes 256,000 Kalashnikovs with 100 million rounds of ammunition, 5,000 machine guns, as well as more than 100,000 antitank guns. The GSG-9 trained 3,000 men of the Turkish special unit "Black Bugs." German election monitors claim that they came into contact with this special unit in the Kurdish area in southeastern Anatolia last week. In a response to an inquiry by Alliance 90/Greens, the Federal Government now admitted that it knows about the exports by a grenade-producing facility from Germany via the Netherlands to Turkey. Bonn approved the export of the entire facility from Lower Saxony to the Netherlands. Now the government stated that the application by the Dutch "included the indication that a `temporary loan' of the facility to a Turkish company is being considered." The Federal Government has "no official knowledge" of the fact that German experts are now erecting the facility in Turkey. [passage omitted]
