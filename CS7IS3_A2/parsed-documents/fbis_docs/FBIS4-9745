Kouri rejected Gen. Ordonez' comments and noted the quick answer from Ecuadoran Foreign Minister Diego Paredes, who said the general's reaction "is part of the pressure from some Ecuadoran political groups seeking to gain support for the upcoming partial renewal of the Ecuadoran Congress." "There is no territorial problem with Ecuador," said Kouri, who pointed out that any debate on this issue should be made based on the Rio Protocol, which in 1942 established the borders between the two countries after a war in 1941. Ordonez' declarations "do not deserve an answer," said Kouri, who added that now Ecuador does not recognize the Rio Protocol, saying that it is not "applicable." Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori said on 30 March that Peru should welcome Ecuadoran Presidnt Sixto Duran Ballen "with open arms." In relation to the new postponement of Duran Ballen's visit, President Fujimori, who is in Pucallpa in Peru's central jungle region, said: "I presume there are reasons preventing him from coming and we understand it." "He, Sixto Duran, will find the most appropriate date; let us wait for him with open arms," reiterated Fujimori, who added that relations between the two countries are at the highest level. The comments by the Ecuadoran general also were criticized by another congressman, Manuel Moreyra, of the opposition Solidarity and Democracy, who said the Peruvian Government has handled its relations with Ecuador badly. He said the government made the mistake of making Ecuadorans believe "the country can give up part of its territory. We are now paying the consequences of the bad management of our foreign relations." "What should have been said from the beginning is that Peru will not give up a single centimeter of its territory," said Moreyra, thus agreeing with Kouri that Ordonez' comments do not deserve an answer. Foreign Relations Committee President Oswaldo Sandoval, from the government alliance Change 90-New Majority, said the new postponement of President Duran Ballen's visit to Peru is the result of internal political problems in Ecuador. "It is not a final postponement," said Sandoval, who expressed his hope that the Ecuadoran president will visit Peru before the end of 1994 in answer to the three visits made by Fujimori to Ecuador. He also added that Duran Ballen's visit to Peru is important to strengthen the links between the two countries.
