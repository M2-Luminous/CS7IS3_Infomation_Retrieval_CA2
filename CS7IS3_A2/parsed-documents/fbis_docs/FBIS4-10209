Rothschild Francois has a report: [Begin recording] [Francois] What is certain is that the day appears extremely decisive for the Coordinating Committee for National Mobilization, which is seeking installation of a new power in Haiti. The fate of this resolution bill submitted to parliament will perhaps be known today. As a matter of fact, the members of the committee that groups FRAPH [Revolutionary Front for the Promotion and Progress of Haiti], MDN [Mobilization for National Development], CARENA [Action Committee for National Reconciliation] and other political formations are due to be received by the conference of presidents in the Chamber of Deputies. For MDN leader Hubert de Ronceray, the meeting represenets a step forward within the framework of actions taken by the Coordinating Comittee. [DeRonceray] We think this is an important step and we hope that something encouraging for the country comes out of this meeting. [Francois] Do you support application of Article 149 of the Constitution? [DeRonceray] Yes. Naturally, for us, all the conditions are fufilled right now, so that Article 149 of the Constitution is applicable. It is therefore up to our lawmakers to assume their responsibilities, fulfill their duties, and respond to the expectations and aspirations of the majority. [Francois] Article 149 meaning Judge Nerette, or the president of the Court of Cassation, Attorney Jonassaint? [DeRonceray] We think that the constitutional principle must prevail. There are two interpretations of Article 149: an interpretation favoring the president of the Court of Cassation, and another favoring the 8 October 1991 government, which would mean Judge Nerette. For us in MDN, what is important is for constitutional principle to triumph. Whichever interpretation prevails, we will accept it because what is important for us is that the country be endowed with a government capable of restoring order to this country's life and of finally endowing Haiti with a stable government capable of promoting development, progress, and peace. [Francois] Asked about the attitude of the international community regarding this anti-Aristide initiative, Hubert de Ronceray thinks that it is more than time for Haitians to take responsibility by emerging from this stalemate. He also points out that the international community is aware of its mistakes in managing Haiti. That is why, according to DeRonceray, it is important to move in the right direction. [DeRonceray] It is certain that during the early days, the international community will not be enthusiastic. As soon as the new government shows discipline, competence, and seriousness, however, there is no doubt that the international community will be sensitive to such demonstrations and will tend to change their attitude toward us.
