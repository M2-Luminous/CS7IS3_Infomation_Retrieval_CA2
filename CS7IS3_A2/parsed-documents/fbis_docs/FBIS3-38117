Their comments followed reports from Belfast that the IRA was considering declaring a brief truce to try to wring concessions on the Downing Street declaration on Northern Ireland. A REUTERS news agency report quoted republican sources in Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic as saying a three-month halt to attacks on British troops and police in the province was under consideration at a series of secret IRA meetings. The sources said the ceasefire was being floated to put pressure on Britain to take a more active role in uniting Ulster with the republic, according to REUTERS. But Mr Adams told the Irish Republic's RTE broadcasting network that he doubted there was any validity in the ceasefire report. Mr Reynolds, commenting after a meeting of his Fianna Fail party in County Mayo, said the vast majority of people were anxious that there should be an end to the violence. But he stressed that a temporary ceasefire would not bring about a renegotiation of the December 15 joint Anglo-Irish statement. Mr Reynolds said the peace declaration could be authoritatively explained by either the British or Irish Government. But, in an apparent signal of growing Dublin impatience with the failure of hard-line republicans to respond to the initiative, he warned it would be unrealistic and unacceptable to suggest the political issues could be resolved in bilateral talks between anonymous British Government representatives and Sinn Fein. In the latest of a series of comments on the peace initiative, Mr Reynolds claimed "fairly comprehensive clarification" had now been given in a series of speeches and public statements by him and Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew. He added: "I would ask everyone to address themselves to that clarification and to the document itself -- so that we do not keep going round and round discussing points that have already been dealt with." The fundamental problems of Northern Ireland had to be resolved democratically around a table between all the parties and the two governments, he said, adding: "We would all soon like to move on to that stage." The end of terrorist violence would produce a large peace dividend that would have a major impact on prosperity throughout Ireland. Meanwhile, Mr Adams tonight spoke of his ambition to "bring an end to the IRA and take the gun out of Irish politics." But he insisted that the Downing Street peace declaration had fudged the issue of Irish self-determination. Mr Adams, on RTE television, claimed there were several "matters of text" in the declaration that required clarification. The document first addressed the self- determination issue, then went on to fudge it, he said. The Sinn Fein president's 20-minute interview was recorded shortly before it was broadcast. It was shown in line with official guidelines circulated earlier this month when the Dublin government dropped a ban on TV and radio interviews with members of the IRA, Sinn Fein and other groups with paramilitary connections. Mr Adams said: "I am totally committed to moving out of the conflict situation into a peaceful situation. What I want to do -- and this is a judgment from me -- is to bring an end to the Irish Republican Army, be part of taking the gun totally out of Irish politics now." He added: "It is a long time since a republican was ... interviewed in an RTE studio. With 20 years of disinformation to catch up on, I can tell you now that I am absolutely confident that this generation of republicans will be part of bringing about a lasting peace. "This Sinn Fein leadership is totally committed to bringing that about ... The opportunity for peace will not be squandered by republicans and we will not let the British Government squander it." In Londonderry tonight, another Sinn Fein leader insisted the republican movement wanted "a permanent peace, a peace built on justice and equality and on democratic rights, including our right as a nation to self-determination." Tom Hartley called on the British Government to withdraw the Unionist veto to political change if it wanted a solution. "Unionists must be persuaded that their real strength lies not in threats and vetoes, but in their place as a substantial minority on the island of Ireland," he told a rally. The Government had created the Unionist veto and had the power to remove it. The veto had "promoted intransigence and an absolute unwillingness to consider any proposal for political progress."
