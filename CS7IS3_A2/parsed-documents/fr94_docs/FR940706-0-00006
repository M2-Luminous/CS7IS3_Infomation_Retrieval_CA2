FR940706-0-00006 FR940706-0-00001 Comment: The Department received one comment on this provision. The commenter suggested that rather than making an oral hearing an option for the State agency, the Department should make this a standard element in the process which the State must request be omitted if the State wishes an appeal to be decided without oral hearing. The commenter argued that this change would avoid any misunderstanding on the part of the State agency or the Department as to whether the State intended to request an oral hearing. Response: The Department has considered this comment and has decided not to adopt the suggestion. Section 603 of the HPA provides that determinations regarding a QC claim shall be made on the record after an opportunity for an agency hearing. In addition, section 13951(c)(4) of the Leland Act requires that, on the request of the Secretary or the State agency, the ALJ shall hold an evidentiary hearing. The Department is retaining the provisions of the NPRM which require that the State agency notify the Hearing Clerk in its appeal petition if the State agency desires an oral hearing. The Department wishes to emphasize that a State agency that waives an oral hearing would not generally be permitted to later request that an oral hearing be conducted. The Department will amend §283.4(g)(3) to cross-reference §283.15(a) to clarify those circumstances under which it would be possible for a State agency to receive an oral hearing if it had not initially requested the oral hearing in its appeal petition. In addition, the Department has added §283.4(i) to provide that if no hearing had been requested, the appeal would proceed in accordance with the procedures set forth under subpart C (Summary Procedure for Appeals of QC Claims of Less than $50,000). In the event that the appeal is pursued under subpart C, procedures exist under §283.26(a) to provide the State agency with an opportunity to request an oral hearing if the State agency does not believe that the summary procedure is adequate for handling the appeal and that an oral hearing is necessary. Section 283.6: Answer This section of the NPRM contains the procedures that FNS is to follow in responding to the State agency's appeal petition. Filling and service: In §283.6(a) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that FNS would be allowed 30 days from the date of service of the State agency's appeal petition to file its answer to that petition. Comment: The Department received one comment recommending that FNS be given 60 days in which to file an answer to the State agency's appeal petition. The commenter also agreed with the provision that failure to file a timely answer would be considered, for purposes of the appeal, an admission of the State agency's allegations. Response: The Department has revised the deadline for FNS to file an answer to the State agency's appeal petition from 30 days to 60 days. Section 13951(c)(4) of the Leland Act requires that not later than 60 days after a State agency submits evidence in support of the appeal, the Secretary shall submit responsive evidence to the ALJ and provides that the ALJ shall extend the 60-day deadline for cause shown. As previously discussed, §283.22(f) of the final rule requires the Secretary to file a written request for the extension prior to the due date for the submission with a showing of cause for the request. Section 283.8: Amendment of Appeal or Answer This section of the NPRM contains the provision allowing either party to amend the appeal or answer at any time prior to the other party filing a motion for a hearing. Comment: The Department received one comment on this provision. The commenter noted that the preamble and the regulations do not contain a timeline in which the motion for a hearing is to be filed. The commenter suggested that it would be difficult to conclude that both parties would be knowledgeable if a motion for a hearing was filed with the appeal petition or the answer to the appeal petition.
