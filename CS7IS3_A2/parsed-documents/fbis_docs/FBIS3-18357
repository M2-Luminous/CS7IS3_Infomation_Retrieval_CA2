Lambeck commentary: "NATO's Response"] [Text] By downing four Serb combat aircraft, the Western alliance addressed the right signal to the Serbs. The intruders had been asked several times to turn away from the no-fly zone. They did, however, not take the combat planes seriously, just as the Western alliance has often been ridiculed over the past weeks. This might have changed since yesterday's downings: The Bosnian Serbs know now that NATO means business. The fact that in this first NATO air strike on Bosnia, the AWACS planes had German crew members on board has answered all questions as to what would happen if German staff were on board radar reconnaissance planes in a similar case. They helped enforce UN Resolution 816 in a NATO military strike. Thus, there is hope that all warring parties in Bosnia have realized that the international community will no longer watch the killing and blocking of aid without taking action. What will have to follow is an active policy of humanitarian aid on the part of the United Nations. The time has now come to get aid convoys for the starving population on their way. And they will have to be forced through, if necessary. This is the only way the international community and NATO can take the initiative in hand. And this would be the first step on the way to achieving tangible results.
