"They just cannot be other than a priority for us," he stressed. Kravchuk expressed confidence that "no matter who will become president of Ukraine, he will have to proceed from the assumption that relations with Russia should have a special status, taking into consideration the past and the future of our two countries. If we forget about it, we shall put in a difficult situation both Ukraine and Russia." "I shall be very glad if my words are met with understanding by the Russian leaders. If we learn to speak about each other in this way, to respect each other, I am sure 70 per cent of problems we are facing today will be removed. This is the most important, the central problem of our policy," he said. "The problem of the Chernobyl power plant is extremely important not only for Ukraine, but also for the whole world. This is why we welcome the decision of the summit session of the council of the European Union to allocate 500 million ECU on the implementation of plans of a complete shutdown of the power plant, but the sum should be calculated once again," Kravchuk said, commenting on the decision of the EU council. The Ukrainian leader told ITAR-TASS that "the first problem to be resolved is that of the future of the city, of the people who live there... We still do not know how much money is needed for resolving the problem of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant."
