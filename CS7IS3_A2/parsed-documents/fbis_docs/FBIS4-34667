FRAPH, which stood for the Revolutionary Front for the Promotion and Progress of Haiti, has become the Armed Revolutionary Front of the Haitian People and has called for a general strike for 24 June. FRAPH leader Emmanuel Constant, in tiger-striped pants, a black t-shirt, with a gun around his waist, asked the head of the provisional government, Attorney Emile Jonassaint, who is not recognized by the international community, to close the doors of his ministries to protest the actions of first U.S. citizen, Mr. Clinton; the 16 December president, Dr. Aristide; new U.S. charge d'affaires in the Haitian crisis, Mr. William Gray; and the deaths of the 143,000 children who have already died. These deaths are part of the negative results of the unfair, criminal international embargo imposed on the Haitian people. This statement was made by Emmanuel Constant during a news conference on 21 June at about 1500. [passage omitted] A few days after Clinton's executive order, Louis Jodel Chambelain, founder of the party, said it is a serious time and the leaders of all political parties, all sectors of national life must break their silence. The Front, which shares the opinion of President Jonassaint, who said that only elections can solve the country's problems, is wondering if the elections will be held. Meanwhile, the national coordinator of the party, Louis Jodel Chambelain, who was wearing a grey suit, appeared in public for the first time since his last statement, asking the international community to ensure his safety. [passage omitted] Chambelain congratulates the foreigners who continue living in Haiti despite the country's hard times and tells them there is no problem; they are safe. Chambelain also took the opportunity to severely criticize certain ministers who are part of the 11 May government, which most parliamentarians have accused of abusing authority. He took the opportunity to denounce the administrative mess prevailing in public offices, which a small group continues to enjoy even though they never work. For his part, Constant said [quote] the Fatherland is in danger and a state of emergency has been ordered by the 11 May president. As previously announced, we have gone into action today, not to create a parallel body, but to (?work under the supervision) of the Haitian Armed Forces [FADH]. For the time being, we are first aid workers whose mission is to protect the national territory. We are working 24 hours a day. Unquote. [Begin Constant recording] We have decided to become the Armed Revolutionary Front of the Haitian People, as we have been saying since 17 August. This does not mean we want to create a parallel body, on the contrary, we want to put ourselves in the service of the FADH, or at least with the colors and the institutions in charge of preserving the sovereignty of the territory. First, we have become first aid workers. First, we have become first aid workers [repeats] because of the state of emergency. Second, we are always ready, 24 hours a day, to protect the Haitian territory and to protect the people who wish to leave on boats, who will even set out for Guantanamo; to prepare our traditional arms, not firearms, but traditional arms, which will be used throughout the country in case of invasion because it is (?easy) to land in Haiti by dropping bombs....[end recording] [Luckenson] Journalists reminded Constant that the government issued a communique saying that only the FADH are authorized to carry weapons on national territory. Constant replied that in case of an intervention, the Haitian Army will be obliged to accept all citizens who come to help it defend the national territory as Haitians. The FRAPH secretary general called on journalists to seize the opportunity to get images and pictures of the FRAPH members because this would be their last news conference. After this, there would be no one in the offices because they were going to withdraw to strategic areas to make traditional weapons such as pikes, magic potions, hammocks, and other materials to be used in case of foreign intervention. Constant pointed out that foreigners must respect President Jonassaint's latest communique concerning strategic areas. He believes that as noted in the communique, the Jonassaint government will not agree to planes being used for propaganda.
