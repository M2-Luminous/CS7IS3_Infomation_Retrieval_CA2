Thus on the eve of the first official visit to Moscow by the U.S. President, the list of "portfolios" which Talbott has already held for eight months -- special envoy and special adviser to the secretary of state on new independent states -- has been supplemented by a new portfolio: He has become Christopher's "alter ego." The State Department chief commented as follows on the new appointment of his envoy: "He is the most suitable man for the job. I am convinced of Talbott's capabilities, his knowledge of international relations, and his human qualities. I can certainly say that Strobe will make a unique and long-term contribution to the formulation and implementation of U.S. foreign policy...." [passage omitted] "I have known and respected S. Talbott for over 25 years and have always regarded him as a man of enormous potential, intellect, and insight," Bill Clinton stressed in turn. "Strobe is coping admirably with his present duties as special envoy to the former Soviet republics. I am absolutely convinced that he will be just as successful in his new post at the State Department." This new appointment of Strobe Talbott's is viewed by analysts on THE WASHINGTON POST as one aspect of Secretary of State Warren Christopher's wider efforts to put right at least two weaknesses for which he has been criticized. The first is the not particularly inspiring manner of his public statements, and the second is his inability to anticipate potential crises before they occur. Christopher's entourage also believes that Talbott will continue to carry out his principal task -- dealing with relations with Russia and the other republics of the former USSR. However, he is now allowed to make public comments on foreign policy problems. The State Department's number two has already availed himself of this opportunity. Speaking at the National Press Club in Washington, he stated that "Russia is on course for reforms, and the international community should do everything in its power to encourage movement in this direction." At the same time S. Talbott stressed: "When we say that we support the reforms course in Russia, we mean the following. First, we support political leaders who are committed to the principles of democracy and reserve for the people the final say on who should rule the country and what the country's policy should be. This is why we so doggedly support Boris Yeltsin, because over the last two years he has on several occasions resolved complex situations to the satisfaction of the Russian people. Second, we support economic reforms. And third, we support a reform of foreign policy direction, which is a major component of our policy." Within the next few days we will see how this aim will be put into practice when the U.S. President comes to Moscow.
