Thomas Goppel, current Bavarian European affairs minister and future environment minister, called on the Federal Government to block the decision on additional financial sources of the EU, which is to be adopted by the Council of Ministers in Brussels at the beginning of March, until, first, the current membership negotiations with Austria, Sweden, Norway, and Finland have been successfully concluded and, second, agreement on the "reduction of the German financial burden" has been reached. Responding to Goppel's demand, the FRG Finance Ministry said that one wants indeed to use all possibilities to reduce the German burden, but one does not want to call into question the political decision of the Edinburgh summit about the financing of the EU for the rest of the decade. Germany's net burden at the EU, that is, the surplus of Bonn's financial contribution over the benefits from the EU, is clearly soaring. For 1990, the year of reunification, the Bundesbank registered 11.6 billion marks [DM]. The Finance Ministry puts the net balance of the current year at DM31.2 billion. Goppel thinks that the pending "decision on independent means" of the Council of Ministers is the last opportunity in this decade to come to "a fairer burden-sharing in the EU." Obviously, it is impossible to achieve this goal via Brussels' payments to eastern Germany (DM28 billion until 1999). The Council of Ministers' decision is to put the decision that the EU budget can be gradually expanded from currently about DM140 billion to more than DM200 billion by 1999 into the form of a law. The German gross contribution would then rise from the current DM45.4 billion to approximately DM70 billion. Goppel's advance, which was coordinated with Bavarian Minister-President Edmund Stoiber but probably not with Christian Social Union [CSU] Chairman Theo Waigel, is undoubtedly part of the election campaign, during which the CSU critics want to deal with European integration. Nevertheless, Bavaria is also forced to act now, both because of the dates for decisionmaking in Brussels and because of the membership negotiations. "Many member states are vitally interested in raising the financial ceiling," Goppel said. This desire for raising the EU's financial means primarily applies to the southern members. During the current "hot" period of the membership negotiations they are causing difficulties, because they fear that the accession by the rich EFTA [European Free Trade Association] countries will lead to a majority of "net payers" in the Council of Ministers, which would oppose them. By practically taking the decision on the EU's financial means hostage, the Germans could force the south to agree to the expansion. The Bonn Finance Ministry and the politicians in Munich partly agree on the question of how the burden on Germany could be eased. In both places it is insisted that the future net payments of the new members must not be used for additional expenditures by Brussels, as the south wants, but must be used to save money for the old members. While Goppel also suggests that Germany could either be exempt from participating in financing the British budget discount or could ask for a temporary discount itself because of the burdens it has to bear in eastern Germany, the politicians in Bonn state that, in the longer term they are striving for negotiations about London's discount. In the EU it is criticized that the Germans are destroying the membership negotiations, which they want to save, by trying to hold parallel negotiations about easing the financial burden. Peter Schmidhuber, the EU commissioner for finances, who is also Bavarian, sees the solution to the EU's exploding budget in a real EU tax, which would be levied by the European Parliament. Differing opinions of the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] and the CSU on the goal of European policy once again became clear in Stoiber's criticism of the demand for a federal system in Europe, which is contained in the new CDU basic program. On Bavarian radio the CSU politician said that such a demand can never be implemented with his party. Sine there is an agreement between the two sister parties that the CDU can never outvote the CSU, the smaller partner, in federal issues, the CDU just has this demand written on paper. He does not believe that the CDU will put the cohesion of the CDU/CSU at stake because of this issue.
