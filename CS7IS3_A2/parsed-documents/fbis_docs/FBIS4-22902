Nokomonova, V.V. Gorn, V.V. Vlasov, Therapy Institute at the Siberian Department of Russia's Academy of Sciences and Bioorganic Chemistry Institute at the Siberian Department of Russia's Academy of Sciences, Novosibirsk; UDC 577.217.3/113.4] [Abstract] Successful applications of antisense oligonucleotides and their derivatives for specifically inhibiting the gene expression in various eucaryotic systems prompted a research effort aimed at identifying segments of the tick-borne encephalitis virus RNA sequence which are most sensitive to the effect of oligonucleotides in order to develop effective virus reproduction. To this end, mRNA-E', mRNA-N3S, mRNA-2BNS3, and mRNA-NS34A4B' which encode the tick-borne encephalitis virus (VKE) proteins were used while genetically engineered analogues of tick-borne encephalitis virus proteins were obtained from the Bioorganic Chemistry Institute at the Siberian Department of Russia's Academy of Sciences in Novosibirsk. The experimental procedure is outlined. To select RNA segments most accessible to oligonucleotide binding and to compare the oligonucleotide efficiency, the matrix structure was assessed using the computational methods described by Solovyev and Kel. The study reveals that an oligonucleotide complementary to such a protein segment at a 2.5 ï¿½M concentration suppresses biosynthesis of the full-scale protein almost completely and leads to generation of a shorter product. The in vitro study demonstrates that the most effective inhibition is probably due to the fact that the 40S ribosome subunit cannot destroy stable duplexes in the 5'-nontranslated mRNA area, as a result of which the translation initiation is disrupted. The findings open up the possibility of developing derivatives for suppressing the tick-borne encephalitis virus reproduction in mammal cells. The authors are grateful to K.V. Pugachev and V.V. Solovyev for providing plasmids and helping with secondary RNA structure analyses. Figures 8; tables 1; references 15: 4 Russian, 11 Western.
