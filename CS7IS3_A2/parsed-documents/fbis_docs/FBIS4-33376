Without stating it was all a farce but suggesting that the group, allegedly linked to Peru's "Shining Path," was perhaps formed by members of state security, the Ecuadoran press reported today on the ceremony without commenting on or addressing the issue in its editorials. "Many doubts emerged following the surprising surrender of weapons, which seemed to have been withdrawn from the armory, for they don't have scratches or stains. Everything has taken place so quickly that there are doubts about the veracity of the ceremony and the true involvement of `Red Sun' leaders in acts of war," the newspaper EXPRESO said. "Red Sun: debut and farewell," was the headline of the newspaper "HOY," while "EL UNIVERSO" recalled that the group "appeared on the national scene three years ago with various acts of urban violence without any repercussion." The only actions staged by the group have been the hurling of dynamite explosives at public buildings and some parties offices, causing minor damage and no casualties. In addition, they painted slogans on walls calling for the elimination of popular organizations' leaders, whom they accused of treason, and others, stating: "Be patriotic, kill an Indian." During the ceremony, "Red Sun" Secretary General Ramiro Celi congratulated the Armed Forces' military investigative work that defeated his group, denied responsibility for the attacks or the slogans on walls, and thanked among others, Socialist Deputy Diego Delgado for his contribution to the peace process. Hours before the ceremony and at the request of relatives of "Red Sun" members, Delgado denounced before the press the arrest and disappearance of these members. Nevertheless, the deputy stated today that "the whole thing seems very strange, a real trick to give the impression that supposedly an alleged political-military organization had repented without ever firing a single shot, not meaning that it would have been better otherwise." "All of this calls for deep reflection, and personally I am not convinced. Their social and political origin, their ideological and practical beliefs, and a host of other aspects are completely foreign to guerrilla movements that have existed elsewhere," Delgado repeated. Delgado then asked: "Does `Red Sun' exist or did it ever exist as an organization of such a size, which certain media presented in order to project a peaceful image by other interests?" An "Ecuavisa" commentator agreed with Delgado and was also of the opinion that "there are questions that remain in the air that raise doubts whether in fact the group really existed."
