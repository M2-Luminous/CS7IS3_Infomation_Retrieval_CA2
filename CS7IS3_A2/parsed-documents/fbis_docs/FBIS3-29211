[Miyazawa] Yes, it has been. [Tahara] You had been in a position to view the nation from a broader point of view. First of all, I want to ask your opinion about the economy. If the present situation continues as it is, Japan's business conditions will become worse than the serious Heisei depression [as published], and some people are even afraid that the Japanese economy might collapse. People used to say that "Miyazawa is the economic expert." What is your opinion about the current economic situation? [Miyazawa] I understand the situation is so serious as to require government intervention. In the spring of 1993, when I was prime minister, I was expecting that a sign of the business recovery might be seen around the beginning of fall, when the inventory adjustment would be completed. To my regret, however, the situation did not change for the better as I had expected. Besides, although I myself was involved, there was unexpected political confusion. Although I thought that the confusion would not have so much influence on the economy, it turned out that the new government that was born to deal with the confusion was a cabinet which places importance on political reform. The new cabinet was not necessarily good with economic matters. That is why the problem of the economy tends to be neglected. [Tahara] Do you mean that the Hosokawa government is not concerned about the economic problems? [Miyazawa] As far as results are concerned, we should say that the economic problems are being neglected. Because so many different parties are allied together, it is natural that the economy cannot be managed effectively. Besides, although we experienced the cold summer and the strong-yen situation last year, the government could not, after all, deal with the situation effectively. In my opinion, this fact has created distrust, which further created the violent fluctuations in the stock market. I still believe in the persevering strength of the Japanese economy. Honestly speaking, however, as far as the present situation is concerned, it is not possible for me to foresee when the situation will take a turn for the better. [Tahara] I think I myself should be held responsible in that the new government has given primary attention to political reform. What measures do you think should have been taken? [Miyazawa] Originally, it should have been possible to carry out political reform and to grapple with the economic problems at the same time. If there were indications that cold-weather damage is likely to occur, the government should have taken prompt action to meet the situation by preparing for the disbursement of mutual aid funds and by making available low-interest loans, etc. As to the strong-yen situation, although there will be no quick remedy, the government at least should have demonstrated its positive attitude in dealing with the situation. [Tahara] Speaking concretely, what do you think should be done? [Miyazawa] One of the measures that the government should take now is drastic reduction of the income tax. The government should by all means reduce the income tax, whether by 6 trillion yen or 10 trillion yen. However, it is wrong to try to cover the reduction with a consumption tax. The change in tax revenues depends on the state of the economy. After the Plaza Accord was reached in September 1985, because of the sharp rise of the yen, Japan's economy encountered never-before-experienced difficulties. This situation occurred soon after I became finance minister, and I thought the only way [to escape the difficulties] was to first effect a tax cut, and then to cover the decrease in revenue by issuing deficit-covering bonds. It took me two months to persuade the executive officials of the Ministry of Finance, and it also took another two months for the executive officials to obtain the preliminary informal consent from within and outside of the Ministry of Finance. Opposition against my idea was so strong that we had to spend great amounts of time in persuading persons. Consequently, there was a natural increase in tax revenue -- 51 trillion yen -- in the six-year period from the second year of the Plaza Accord to 1991, which means that economy had been normalized to that extent. In other words, if the economy starts to run well with a tax cut, this enables corporations to go into the black and to pay corporate taxes. Income taxes withheld at the source also will increase because of the increase in hours worked and the resulting increase in overtime pay. If the stock market becomes active, then securities transaction taxes will increase. This is the natural course. It is too hasty an idea to think that the consumption tax should be increased by this many trillion yen because the income tax was reduced by this many trillion yen. While this should be an easy type of logic for an expert to understand, it may be difficult for a person in a responsible post to make a practical decision about. What Should Be Done With the Bad Bank Loans? [Tahara] As you noted before, Hajime Funada, then director general of the Economic Planning Agency, expressed his personal belief in the spring of last year that "from now on [business conditions] will show an upturn". Does this mean that you also thought the same thing? [Miyazawa] Yes. To my regret, however, there was no business recovery, although we had taken urgent economic measures in the amounts of 10 billion yen and 13 billion yen. [Tahara] I understand that the urgent measures were taken in the form of public investment. As to the depression that we are presently experiencing, not only the government but also many economists and executives have expressed incorrect predictions again and again. Why do you think they have been wrong? [Miyazawa] I think the major reason is that they did not fully recognize the influence that the bubble economy had on business enterprises, and particularly its influence on financial institutions. [Tahara] Do you mean that they underestimated the consequences of the bubble economy? [Miyazawa] Yes. [Tahara] If that is the case, I should ask you what on earth the bubble economy was. You were the finance minister when the bubble economy began. [Miyazawa] That was at the initial stage of the bubble economy. [Tahara] There are some indiscreet people who say that Miyazawa is to blame for creating the bubble economy. What on earth was the cause of the bubble economy? [Miyazawa] When the Plaza Accord was concluded in September 1985, one dollar was equivalent to 240 yen. The exchange rate rose to 200 yen at the end of the same year, and further rose to 150 yen in the summer of the next year when I assumed the post of finance minister. It was really a sharp rise. [Tahara] The exchange rate rose by 90 yen in less than one year. [Miyazawa] People thought this rate was by all means unbearable to Japanese companies, so I effected urgent economic measures, including the tax cut. I also had the official discount rate reduced. Also, to moderate the strong-yen tendency to the extent possible, I even bought dollars on the open market at the rate of $1 billion per day. To buy dollars means to sell yen, which means that so much amount of yen is supplied to the public. In other words, with the supply of yen becoming excessive, enterprises gradually became accustomed to the strong-yen trend, and the surplus purchasing power created under this situation was used to purchase stocks and land. Such behavior seems to have brought about the unfavorable results. I still wonder whether there was no better way to absorb the surplus purchasing power. I suppose the Bank of Japan was also trying to decide when to raise the official discount rate. First of all, however, the anxiety that the strong-yen trend caused to enterprises and the people was too serious. At that time, the business world was in an extremely confused state, with there being 10 job seekers for every two job openings. Because the most important duty of politics is not to cause the people anxiety, I believe that I should have applied a brake to the situation. But, I still cannot clearly see what the best point would have been [to apply a brake]. [Tahara] There is an opinion that [the authorities concerned] may have become excessively eager to control the bubble economy and, as a result, may have destroyed the economy itself, thus creating the present depression. In short, people are thinking that [the authorities concerned] have frozen the flow of money by making land transactions virtually impossible or by unreasonably raising the official rate. [Miyazawa] In the present situation wherein the Japanese economy has become large and the people now realize how the economy works, it seems difficult for the government and the Bank of Japan alone to change the direction of the economy. In such a situation, the authorities concerned are supposed to be taking drastic measures to direct the economy. Although it may be desirable if moderate measures can be found, it does not seem so easy for this to be done. [Tahara] Supposing you again became finance minister or prime minister at the time when the bubble economy collapsed, do not you think you could find a better way to manage the economy? [Miyazawa] I was asked the same question at the Diet, too, and I asked myself that question again and again. To my regret, however, I cannot think of any better policy which I might have adopted in a certain situation. This might be a limit of my ability. [Tahara] At the beginning of this interview, you mentioned that "risk management" would be necessary. At that point, there was an idea of establishing a public organization to purchase the unsalable lands held by banks as mortgaged properties. What has become of that idea? [Miyazawa] It was in August 1992 [that the idea was proposed by the government]. At that time, with the slump in stocks, I believed that if the situation worsened, the government should then carry out risk management; I felt that something should be done to avert the crisis, even if this meant the stock market's being closed for one day. I consulted with some of the officials concerned about my idea, including the idea you just referred to.... I expressed my opinion that the government may be officially involved in dealing with the bad loans held by banks, that the banks may be allowed to write off part of their bad loans as tax deductions, and that a special loan may be made to the purchasing organization. I thought that the government's intervention to that extent might be necessary to protect the financial system itself. [Tahara] Did you carry out your plan? [Miyazawa] No, my idea was not realized as I intended. There was strong opposition which claimed that the plan was intended to save the banks. [Tahara] Was there opposition? [Miyazawa] The industrial circles asked, "Why should the government help the banks to such an extent?" Also, as for financial institutions, there were certain banks with less exposure and certain banks with serious exposure. The banks with less exposure felt that "While we can solve the problem ourselves, it is regrettable to receive so much criticism from the public", or "The government's policy is to save that and that bank, and not to save us. It is ridiculous." It turned out after all that the financial institutions improved the situation by themselves. [Tahara] I see. [Miyazawa] This problem has not been solved yet. The problem of bad loans held by financial institutions remains a big problem at the base of the current depression. I still think that public aid to a certain degree may be necessary to normalize the present situation, which is excessively constrained. There are examples of this in the advanced countries. [Tahara] There is an opinion that the current depression might be pressing Japan to change its economic structure. Drastic deregulation is considered necessary to establish an economic structure guaranteeing free competition. Although I am afraid I may be preaching Buddhism to Buddha, most of the industries in which 50 million workers out of the 60 million workers in Japan are employed are not related to exports and are more or less affected by regulation. People think that while the yen remains strong, domestic commodity prices remain excessively high because regulations on these enterprises have not been removed. Also, it is considered necessary to convert the so-called Japanese-type management to the U.S.-type management. There is a strong opinion that under Japanese-type management, business enterprises are holding onto too many unprofitable divisions and unnecessary workers, which should be totally slashed. Voices are increasing that the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] may also be held partly responsible in this respect. What is your opinion on this point? [Miyazawa] It is really a problem of the Japanese distribution system that consumers do not benefit from the strong-yen trend. It is also true that the natural operation of an economy based on the supply-and-demand relationship is being disturbed by the delay in removing the regulations. I think the present cabinet was correct in grappling with the problem by setting up the Hiraiwa Commission, although I do not think that this has produced an immediate effect. It is also true that the economic situation in the United States has been improved by what we in Japan call restructuring or by what they call downsizing in the United States -- that is, by carrying out a drastic cutback in employees. In his recent book titled "The Postcapitalist Society," Peter F. Drucker expresses the opinion that the future society will be a thoroughly knowledge-oriented society and that those elements other than knowledge should be excluded from enterprises. He means that the excluded corporate units should be used in medium-sized and small enterprises which specialize in such fields. In fact, downsizing is rapidly being carried out in the United States in line with his philosophy. [Tahara] Japanese capitalism has been a capitalism based on the production of goods. There are prevailing opinions that such a type of capitalism is outdated and therefore should be changed to a structure aiming at knowledge-intensive industries. Furthermore, there is an opinion that Japanese-type management, meaning the lifetime-employment system, is merely an illusion and that the original capitalism means slashing unnecessary workers, just as we slash unnecessary things. [Miyazawa] We should note, however, that Drucker himself is of the opinion that what is meant by "a drastic intellectual society" is still unknown. I think it means "human beings." [Tahara] You think intelligence is symbolized by human beings. [Miyazawa] In the case of our country, the lifetime-employment system makes it possible to give advanced training to employees. It is not worthwhile to spend money on them if they move to other enterprises. [Tahara] Then your opinion is that although the terms "lifetime employment" and "seniority" may sound old-fashioned today, what they really mean is that "human being should be respected," is that not it? [Miyazawa] That is right. [Tahara] Under U.S.-type management, although capable persons are promoted to responsible posts, incapable persons are not promoted and tend to fall behind. Do you think that is a wrong system? [Miyazawa] No, I do not think so. Each country has its own tradition. Perhaps it would be impossible for Americans to live in Japanese society, where the rule of seniority and the lifetime-employment system apply. In the United States, a success story is created by a capable person making a sudden rise from obscurity and earning a high salary while moving freely from company to company. However, the same principle does not apply in our country. For Japanese enterprises, teamwork has been supposed to be the best way to operate in the business world, and, in the case of Japan, I suppose it will also be the best way in the future. Participation in the United Nations Force Is Also Not Permissible [Tahara] Let me change the subject. If there were things you left undone as prime minister, what would they be? [Miyazawa] Though I am afraid my reply may sound haughty, I am very confident that, except for political reform, I was, in general, able to show ideal guidelines in carrying out domestic and foreign affairs. First, it was my philosophy that Japan should not become a military superpower. Also, I made it a fundamental policy in carrying out internal affairs that an affluent community and a quality-of-life superpower should be created before the aging society emerges. My fundamental policy in carrying out diplomatic relations was to make contributions to the extent possible in order to build up a new order of peace after the Cold War. [Tahara] Let me ask a question on this point. What type of country are you thinking of when you talk about a military superpower? [Miyazawa] ... [ellipses as published] [Tahara] For instance, in his book titled "A Plan To Rebuild Japan [Nihon Kaizo Ron]" Ichiro Ozawa says that "Japan should become an ordinary country." Perhaps, by the expression `an ordinary country' Ozawa must be referring to the United Kingdom and France, and not the United States. In case the order of world peace is disturbed somewhere, Japan should contribute to restoring order. It seems to be his idea that, if the existing Self-Defense Forces are not to be mobilized, it may be necessary to organize a United Nations Force and to have the Self-Defense Forces join it. Do you think this is a military superpower? [Miyazawa] In my opinion, the only thing Japan should not do is to use military power outside the country. [Tahara] Do you mean Japan should not participate in the United Nations Force? [Miyazawa] My fundamental philosophy is that, under any circumstances, and even if requested by the United Nations, Japan should not exercise its military power abroad. [Tahara] If, for instance, an incident similar to the Persian Gulf crisis takes place, the world might again request that "Japan contribute not only with money, but also shed blood." Do you still think Japan should not participate in the United Nations Force in such a situation? [Miyazawa] No, that is not permissible. I also discussed the matter with UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali in February last year, and he expressed his opinion that "the role of the United Nations is not only to maintain peace which, as was the case in Cambodia, has already been secured, but it should also create peace through intervention in the area where disputes are taking place." To his opinion, I replied that "in the past, Japan committed errors under the flag of absolute justice. It will require considerable time before we are convinced that all the judgments made by the United Nations are correct." Later, the Somalian incident took place. Though the action of the United Nations might have been based on good intentions, it turned out that, after all, the United Nations became the enemy of all the Somalian people. The U.S. forces also have to withdraw in March. An even more severe situation is being created in Yugoslavia. I feel, therefore, that the people are beginning to realize that they should not easily agree with the opinion that Japan may also take part in such an activity so long as it is carried out under the UN flag. [Tahara] Yet, is it not possible that, as was the case in the Persian Gulf war, Japan may be despised by the world, or treated as an outsider, for not taking part in the UN activities? [Miyazawa] It is true the Japanese people are beginning to regret that Japan only contributed money without shedding blood. It was under such a situation that the PKO [Peacekeeping Operations] Law was enacted to show the limit of Japan's contribution. Though I sincerely feel sorry that two Japanese people died in Cambodia, I take pride in myself that, by playing Japan's role to its limit, I clearly showed that Japan could not go beyond this limit. We have our own way of thinking, and we have our own philosophy contained in the Constitution. I do not want to let the United Nations make decisions for us. [Tahara] The call for Japan to carry out concrete operations to help maintain international order, even if it means revising the Constitution, is growing louder. However, you are opposed to this, and perhaps Gotoda is also of the same opinion. Why are you so strongly opposed to the idea? [Miyazawa] In the past, we exercised military power abroad in the name of humanity. The people also believed it. Today, however, the reason for our action seems doubtful. There is even a prime minister who says we should apologize for our action as it was an act of invasion. In such a situation it is not easy to determine whether or not our action can be justified. The United Nations made the same mistake in Somalia, did it not? Secretary General Butrus-Ghali himself has virtually admitted "it was a mistake." [Tahara] In short, were you against the Persian Gulf war? [Miyazawa] No, I think the war was justifiable in itself. [Tahara] If you admit that the war was justifiable in itself, does it not mean that it was alright for other countries to take part in the war, but that Japan did not want to be involved in it? [Miyazawa] In the case of the Persian Gulf war, it was apparent that Iraq invaded Kuwait, and the war was ended at an early stage because of the decisive difference between the powers involved. However, the disputes in Yugoslavia and Somalia that took place later have not been, despite the United Nations trying to help the situation. Therefore, we should realize that it is not so easy to help other countries. [Tahara] Then, suppose a second Persian Gulf war breaks out, what do you think Japan should do? [Miyazawa] That will be the very opportunity for us to take action within the limit we are allowed under existing laws. [Tahara] Yet, when the Persian Gulf war broke out, the Cold War structure was in its last stage, with the United States and the USSR playing the role of world police. Therefore, it was possible to repel Iraq under the leadership of the United States. However, if such a situation takes place in the future, which country do you think can take the responsibility in the post-Cold War world? Are we to totally leave [that country] in the lurch? [Miyazawa] As you mentioned, it is very clear that the United Nations is not able to fully deal with the disputes which are frequently taking place here and there throughout the world. If your question is about what should be done in such situations, I say that the only way for us is to help the United Nations grow to be an organization capable of dealing with such situations. [Tahara] The disputes you are referring to -- the situations in Somalia and Yugoslavia -- are what we may call civil wars. However, if an apparent act of invasion takes place, as was the case when Iraq occupied Kuwait, by which country and in what form do you think the situation should be dealt with? [Miyazawa] The ideal form is for the United Nations to be equipped with its own military forces to suppress disputes. That seems to be the fundamental way of dealing with disputes. [Tahara] How do you think Japan should take part in such UN activities? [Miyazawa] I think it is quite alright for the Japanese people to voluntarily take part in UN activities as international public officers. In such a case, they should, by all means, work as international public officers, and their activities should not be regarded as use of force by Japan. [Tahara] Is it not permissible to take part in UN activities by forming an organization separate from the Self-Defense Forces? [Miyazawa] I do not think it is permissible, since such activities bring about the same responsibility to the nation. [Tahara] During the Cold War era, both the West and the East were respectively conscious they had a strong enemy in the other side. Such an age has come to an end, and we should establish a new world order after the Cold War. What kind of a vision do you think the world should have? I think a more concrete vision might have been presented if the Miyazawa government continued for a slightly longer period. [Miyazawa] It may be that the whole world is in agony without knowing which direction to take. Basically, it is important for every country in the world to be convinced that it should not resort to war to benefit itself. Also, it is important that, based on the interpretation of the respective countries, each country places importance on democracy, a commonly shared sense of value, on human rights, and on freedom. It is desirable to exert ourselves to take such a direction. Comments on "A Plan To Rebuild Japan" Written by Ichiro Ozawa [Tahara] By the way, referring to the LDP, I think that in the past Japanese politics was carried out in the form of a sumo match between the LDP as a grown-up man and the nongovernment parties as a child. Whether it was the consumption tax or the PKO issue, the nongovernment parties opposed everything, and the LDP steered Japan by coaxing, persuading and intimidating them. However, it seems the LDP has become a child the moment it left power. Looking at the discussions involving the election system reform, we do not quite understand what the LDP wants to say. The party seems just like a fretful child. It is not very clear what kind of an identity the LDP is going to create, and what action the party is going to take. [Miyazawa] I think the existing coalition cabinet is the cabinet to realize political reform. To attain this purpose, each party has shelved its own fundamental policies and public promises, claiming that, as long as important matters are concerned, it is going to succeed LDP policies. Though it is important to carry out political reform, there are many other things assigned to everyday politics. Therefore, should everyday politics be neglected, problems tend to take place such as the problem involving Nakanishi, ex-director-general of the Defense Agency, and the confusion concerning the liberalization of rice, and it seems natural that the people criticize the government for totally neglecting the economic problems. In this situation, it seems the duty of our party, as a nongovernment party, to meet the needs of the people by pointing out [the problems of the government]. Though, in certain cases, it is inevitable for us to criticize the government parties, I believe it is our duty to do so. [Tahara] When I interviewed you while you were in the post of prime minister, you referred to the 15 May incident [a coup that took place on 15 May 1932 with young radical Navy officers taking the initiative], and said that it was not a desirable phenomenon for the country that such an incident should take place. I vividly remember your comment. In the world today, there is an increasing number of people who are beginning to feel that the economic situation is not good; that the political situation is unstable; and that the world situation surrounding Japan is unstable; and that, under these circumstances, Japan is going to enter a dark age similar to that of the beginning of Showa [from the mid-1920's]. What is your opinion on this point? [Miyazawa] It may be partly because I am an optimist by nature, but I think it an important factor for social stability that freedom is being guaranteed. It is also important that the standard of living and the level of income do not differ so much. As such fundamental conditions are being satisfied in Japan today, it is not likely that a furious social anger will explode, taking the form of the 15 May incident. [Tahara] Yet, reading "A Plan to Rebuild Japan" written by Ichiro Ozawa, we realize that he is concerned about Japan. Ozawa repeatedly emphasizes the significance of leadership. He believes that stronger leadership should be exercised in making decisions. What do you think of Ozawa's patriotism? [Miyazawa] I think his is also a free opinion. In short, he is warning that Japan is not an "ordinary nation". [Tahara] We may call it his irritation. [Miyazawa] Yes, I agree. In my case, as I have lived a little longer, the period of 50 years does not appear to be so long a period. I rather strongly feel that we should not make the same mistake again. Reischauer is of the opinion that the country named Japan tends to be led in the wrong direction whenever a leader with strong power emerges. In a world with developed mass media such as we see today, it will be relatively easy to control the people through the media if there is someone who intends to do so. I feel it is dangerous to create such a situation as the Japanese nation is, in a sense, very uniform. It is true that, 50 years from now, an opinion similar to that of Ozawa may be considered sensible. As for me, however, I would like to say that, in the case of Germany, the country has committed the same mistake twice. NNNN
