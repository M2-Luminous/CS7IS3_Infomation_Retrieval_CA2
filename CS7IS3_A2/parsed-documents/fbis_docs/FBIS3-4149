Senator Max Baucus told reporters that issues of human rights and trade should not be linked because revoking China's MFN status would cause great harm to both the United States and China. The linkage policy by the Clinton administration "is fraught with confrontation and has achieved minimal success," Baucus said. "No other country uses this blunderbuss approach," he added. A clear majority in the Senate now supports severing link between China's human rights and trade and renewing China's MFN trade status, Baucus added.
