FR940622-1-00043 FR940622-1-00011 Example 5 _(i) Facts_ (A) Corporation Y is a domestic corporation with only common stock outstanding. On January 1, 1995, Y issues 100 shares of its 10% preferred stock to an unrelated holder. The issue price of the preferred stock is $100 per share. The preferred stock is_ ( 1 ) Callable at the option of Y on or before January 1, 2000, at a price of $105 per share plus any accrued but unpaid dividends; and ( 2 ) Mandatorily redeemable on January 1, 2005, at a price of $100 per share plus any accrued but unpaid dividends. (B) The preferred stock provides that if Y fails to exercise its option to call the preferred stock on or before January 1, 2000, the holder will be entitled to appoint a majority of Y's directors. It is reasonably anticipated that Y will have available funds sufficient to exercise the right to redeem. (ii) Analysis. Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, paragraph (b)(1) of this section applies because, by virtue of the change of control provision and the absence of any contrary facts, it is more likely than not that Y will exercise its option to call the preferred stock on or before January 1, 2000. The safe harbor rule of paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section does not apply because the provision that failure to call will cause the holder to gain control of the corporation is an arrangement that effectively requires Y to redeem the preferred stock. Under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the constructive distribution occurs over the period ending on January 1, 2000. Redemption is most likely to occur on that date, because that is the date on which the corporation minimizes the rate of return to the holder but yet prevents the holder from gaining control. The de minimis exception of paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not apply because the $5 per share difference between the redemption price and the issue price exceeds the amount determined under the principles of section 1273(a)(3) (5 × .0025 × $105 = $1.31). Accordingly, $5 per share, the difference between the redemption price and the issue price, is treated as a constructive distribution received by the holder on an economic accrual basis over the five year period ending on January 1, 2000, under principles similar to the principles of section 1272(a). * * * * * Example 7_ (i) Facts_ (A) Corporation Z is a domestic corporation with only common stock outstanding. On January 1, 1995, Z issues 100 shares of its 10% preferred stock to C, an unrelated individual. The issue price of the preferred stock is $100 per share. The preferred stock is_ ( 1 ) Not callable for a period of 5 years from the issue date; ( 2 ) Callable at the option of Z on January 1, 2000, at a price of $110 per share plus any accrued but unpaid dividends; ( 3 ) Callable at the option of Z on July 1, 2001, at a price of $120 per share plus any accrued but unpaid dividends; and ( 4 ) Mandatorily redeemable on January 1, 2003, at a price of $150 per share plus any accrued but unpaid dividends. (B) There are no other arrangements between Z and C concerning redemption of the stock. (ii) Analysis. Under paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (b)(4) of this section, paragraph (b)(1) of this section applies because, absent any other facts indicating a contrary result, the fact that redemption on January 1, 2000, would reduce the yield of the stock and produce the lowest yield indicates that exercise of the option to call on that date is more likely than not to occur. The safe harbor rule of paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section does not apply to the option to call on January 1, 2000, because the call would reduce the yield of the stock. The de minimis exception of paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not apply because the $10 per share difference between the redemption price payable in 2000 and the issue price exceeds the amount determined under the principles of section 1273(a)(3) (5 × .0025 × $110 = $1.38). Accordingly, $10 per share, the difference between the redemption price and the issue price, is treated as a constructive distribution received by the holder on an economic accrual basis over the five year period ending January 1, 2000, under principles similar to the principles of section 1272(a). (iii) Coordination rules_ (A) If Z does not exercise its option to call the preferred stock on January 1, 2000, paragraph (b)(4) of this section provides that the principles of paragraph (b) of this section must be applied to determine if any remaining constructive distribution occurs. Under paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (b)(4) of this section, paragraph (b)(1) of this section applies because, absent any other facts indicating a contrary result, the fact that redemption on July 1, 2001, would produce the lowest yield indicates that exercise of the option to call on that date is more likely than not to occur. The safe harbor rule of paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section does not apply to the option to call on July 1, 2001, because, as of the first call date, a call by Z on July 1, 2001, for $120 would reduce the yield of the stock. The de minimis exception of paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not apply because the $10 per share difference between the redemption price and the issue price (revised as of the missed call date) exceeds the amount determined under the principles of section 1273(a)(3) (1 × .0025 × $120 = $.30). Accordingly, the $10 per share of additional redemption premium that is payable on July 1, 2001, is treated as a constructive distribution received by the holder on an economic accrual basis over the period between January 1, 2000, and July 1, 2001, under principles similar to the principles of section 1272(a). (B) If Z does not exercise its second option to call the preferred stock on July 1, 2001, then the $30 additional redemption premium that is payable on January 1, 2003, is treated as a constructive distribution under paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(1) of this section. The de minimis exception of paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not apply because the $30 per share difference between the redemption price and the issue price (revised as of the second missed call date) exceeds the amount determined under the principles of section 1273(a)(3) (1 × .0025 × $150 = $.38). The holder is treated as receiving the constructive distribution on an economic accrual basis over the period between July 1, 2001, and January 1, 2003, under principles similar to the principles of section 1272(a).
