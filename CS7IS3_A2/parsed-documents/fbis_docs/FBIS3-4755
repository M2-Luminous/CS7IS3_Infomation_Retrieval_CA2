A congratulatory message from the minister of state for external affairs of India to the seminar was conveyed, and a congratulatory speech made by ex-Indian President Giani Zail Singh. In his speech, he said the chuche idea founded by the great leader his excellency President Kim Il-song is an idea brightly illumining the road ahead of the progressive people in the era of independence. Korea is advancing triumphantly without any vacillation even when some socialist countries have collapsed and the imperialist pressure and blockade are intensifying, he said, adding: this is entirely because it is advancing under the banner of the chuche idea, the banner of self-reliance. A reporter and speakers at the seminar said it is thanks to the sagacious guidance of the dear leader his excellency Kim Chong-il that the programme of modelling the whole society on the chuche idea is being carried out with success and the anthropocentric Korean- style socialism firmly defended in Korea. Noting that the chuche idea is the basic idea of mass media in the era of independence, they evinced their resolve to more briskly conduct media activities to establish a new international information and communication order. A letter to Comrade Kim Chong-il was adopted at the seminar.
