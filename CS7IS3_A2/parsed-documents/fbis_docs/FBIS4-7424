FBIS4-7424 "dreas083_m_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-083 Daily Report 27 Apr 1994 Thailand Enforcement of UN 1982 `Law of the Sea' Urged Enforcement of UN 1982 `Law of the Sea' Urged BK2804141994 Bangkok Voice of Free Asia in Thai 1030 GMT 27 Apr 94 BK2804141994 Bangkok Voice of Free Asia Thai BFN ["Statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Thailand"] [Text] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has observed that many countries have promulgated laws and regulations, which, de facto or de jure, have led to the seizure of foreign fishing trawlers or the imprisonment of foreign fishermen on charges of violating the laws and regulations on fishing in their exclusive economic zones. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs therefore wishes to give general notification of the Thai Government's position in this regard as follows: The seizure of fishing trawlers and the imprisonment of fishermen are blatant violations, both in letter and in spirit, of Clause 72, paragraphs two and three, of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea of 1982. All countries concerned are obliged to faithfully abide by the convention as signatories to the legislation or as countries which have given their ratification of the convention. In particular, the said UN convention is to become effective from 16 May 1994. Therefore, the Thai Government has to lodge a strong protest through the UN secretary general, in his capacity as the custodian of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea of 1982, over the said seizure of trawlers and imprisonment of fishermen. Thailand hopes that those countries will amend their laws and regulations in compliance with the obligations enshrined in the said convention, which they have already accepted.
