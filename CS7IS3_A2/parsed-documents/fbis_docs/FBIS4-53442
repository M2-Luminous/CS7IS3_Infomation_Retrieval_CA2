House of Representatives member Shokei Arai told a news conference he visited Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai at the premier's official residence and handed him a copy of a petition signed by 508 Japanese legislators. The letter calls for the "immediate and unconditional release" of Myanmar's opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and all political prisoners in Myanmar as well as a "swift and complete implementation of a transition to civilian rule." While noting that Tokyo has been demanding the release of the Nobel Peace prize laureate, Kumagai reportedly vowed greater efforts to make Myanmar become a democratic nation. Arai, a member of the new party Jiyuto (Liberals) headed by Foreign Minister Koji Kaikzawa, said he and his associates plan to send the petition to U.N. Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, if possible by late July, when Suu Kyi was originally expected to be released from house arrest. It will be the second such letter by Japanese politicians to the U.N. chief, following one by 374 Diet members sent to Butrus-Ghali in March 1993. Last April, 422 Diet members urged the government to put pressure on Myanmar to release Suu Kyi. A founder of the National League for Democracy (NLD) which won the 1990 general election by a landslide, Suu Kyi has been under house arrest since July 1989. She was expected to be freed July 19 this year from her five-year detention, the maximum period allowed under law. But in February the ruling junta, which refused to hand over power five years ago, said it regards the first year of her detention as an "arrest period" and full detention was not imposed until July 1990. She is now expected to be freed in July 1995.
