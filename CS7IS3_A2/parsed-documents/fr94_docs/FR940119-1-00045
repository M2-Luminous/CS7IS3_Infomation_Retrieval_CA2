However, as stated earlier, the RSPA is also soliciting comments and ideas from the nonregulated public including State agencies, trade associations, and environmental organizations. The following 2 questions are directed to these members of the public. Question 18: The RSPA is attempting to determine which critical locations should be protected from hazardous liquid pipeline releases by the installation of EFRDs. From the locations listed below, please provide a ranking by probability with a ranking of ``1'' representing the location which poses the greatest probability of combined safety and environmental risk to the public. (Questions 18.10&hyph;18.12 are left blank for the commenter to specify locations of risk not listed in questions 18.1&hyph;18.9.) 18.1␣Locations where valves are required to be placed by 49 CFR 195.260 (e) and (f) on hazardous liquid pipelines in order to protect water? 16 XXXX 16 See footnote # 10. 18.2␣Locations where it would take more than two hours to reach and close a block valve once the location of a release is identified? XXXX 18.3␣Locations of possible ground movement including areas of: known seismic risk, slope instability, landslide, and mine subsidence? XXXX 18.4␣Schools? XXXX 18.5␣Hospitals? XXXX 18.6␣Closely spaced individual dwellings (defined as areas similar to class 2 locations as defined in 49 CFR 192.5(c)?) 17 XXXX 17 See footnote # 14. 18.7␣Shopping malls and similar locations?
