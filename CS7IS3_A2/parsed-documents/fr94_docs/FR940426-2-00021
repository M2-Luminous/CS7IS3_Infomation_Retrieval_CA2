ACTION: Notice of noncompetitive financial assistance award. SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), pursuant to the DOE Financial Assistance Rules, 10 CFR 600.7, is announcing its intention to award a cooperative agreement to Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. for the continuation of development and marketing of novel active-transport membranes for separation of industrial gasses. ADDRESSES: Questions regarding this announcement may be addressed to the U.S. Department of Energy, Golden Field Office, 1617 Cole Blvd., Golden, Colorado 80401, Attention: M.A. Barron, Contract Specialist, (303) 275&hyph;4787. The Contracting Officer is John W. Meeker. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The proposed effort will complete the activity started under Cooperative Agreement No. DE&hyph;FC02&hyph;89ID12779 for the development of active transport membranes for gas separation. Under the previous agreement, Air Products developed Active Transport Membranes (ATM) to the point that commercialization appears to be feasible. Air Products is now proposing to develop commercial prototypes and begin commercializing ATM's by placing them in industrial settings for field evaluation. The last stage of development involving commercial demonstration on a full scale basis has also been added in order to ensure commercial usage. DOE has performed a review in accordance with 10 CFR 600.7, and has determined that the activity to be funded is necessary to the satisfactory completion of, and is a continuation of an activity presently being funded by DOE, and for which competition for support would have a significant adverse effect on continuity and satisfactory completion of the activity. DOE intends to restrict eligibility to Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. for this activity in accordance with 10 CFR Part 600.7(b)(2)(i) (A) and (D). The total estimated cost to complete the project is $15,249,800. The proposed cost share for Air Products is $6,261,000 (41%) and $8,988,800 (59%) for DOE over a 5 year project period.
