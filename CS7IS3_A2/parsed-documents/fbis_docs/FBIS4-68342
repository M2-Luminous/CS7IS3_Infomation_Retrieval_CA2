FBIS4-68342 "jpusr047___94004" FBIS-USR-94-047 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 15 April 1994 RUSSIA POLITICAL AFFAIRS Presidential Mailbag: Letters to, Answers From Yeltsin Presidential Mailbag: Letters to, Answers From Yeltsin 944F0584A Moscow ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI in Russian 15 Apr 94 p 2 944F0584A Moscow ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI Russian CSO [Letters to and replies from President Yeltsin under the heading "From the President's Mail"] [Text] Dear President of Russia: I am the wife of Captain 1st Rank A.G. Ushakov, commander of the nuclear submarine cruiser Kasatka. You visited this nuclear cruiser, dear Mr. President, in Severodvinsk in April 1992, and presented my husband with the personal watch of the first president of Russia for achievements in utilization of new technology; my husband was also presented with a video film of your visit to the nuclear submarine, in which my husband accompanies you. This is a tremendous treasure and souvenir for our entire family: parents, children, future grandchildren and great-grandchildren. We will remain grateful to you for the rest of our lives, and I have always been proud of my husband--for he was the one to be granted the honor of playing host to the first president of Russia. Forgive me for taking time, dear Boris Nikolayevich, from your state affairs, but I am compelled to appeal to you personally, since for three years already my husband has been unable to resolve the problem of continuing his military career--meaning our life as well--through the proper channels. Here is the substance of the matter. My husband--the commander of submarine cruiser Kasatka, Captain 1st Rank Aleksandr Grigoryevich Ushakov, is 42 years old; of these, he has served 25 years in the Russian Armed Forces. He graduated with honors from the Imeni Leninskogo Komsomola Higher Navy School; has been given government awards; has served all his conscious life on nuclear submarines in the Northern and Pacific Fleets; is the only submarine commander in Russia who has received an award personally from the president; has glowing character references for the next career transfer from Rear Admiral Salnikov, commander of the Belomorsk Navy Base, and Rear Admiral Motsak, chief of staff of the Northern Fleet nuclear submarine group. My husband's submarine also was personally inspected by the Pacific Fleet commander, Admiral Gurinov, and this inspection resulted in an article-review in the fleet newspaper, which I enclose. For 1993, my husband received a commendation from the Pacific Fleet submarine group commander, Vice Admiral Komaritsyn. For three years already my husband has been unable to get a career transfer to a training center. The training center commander, Rear Admiral Yamkov, has all the aforementioned references given to my husband by his immediate superiors, but nevertheless does not want to resolve the matter in our favor. As a civilian, I do not understand why. Especially considering that we are not being given the reasons for the rejection. Who then is worthy of teaching submariners? I think my husband has earned this with his 25-year impeccable service to our Fatherland. Boris Nikolayevich! I apologize once again and appeal to you as a godfather of our family. Not everyone in this life happens to come upon such happiness and trust. Please help us, and I will pray to God for you, Boris Nikolayevich, for the rest of my life. I would like to hope for a positive and quick resolution of our problem. With my deep respect for you, [Signed] Nadezhda Vasilyevna Ushakova Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy 8 February 1994 Dear Nadezhda Vasilyevna: Your letter unwittingly reminded me of the time I spent in the city of Severodvinsk, and the unforgettable meeting with our Navy personnel, including your husband. They are courageous, brave people of great fortitude! They have been and will provide steadfast support of our Fatherland. It is our duty to do everything possible so that their daily difficult, demanding service always receives the proper appreciation of the state, whose borders they protect. Now about your request. There are certain procedures for transfers and promotions in the Army and Navy. Since we are building a law-based state, no one has the right to violate these procedures. Including the president of Russia. Therefore I advise your husband to once again petition the appropriate competent organs on the subject of a transfer to Obninsk to continue his service there. I hope you will understand me properly. [Signed] B. Yeltsin Boris Nikolayevich, when you come home from work and sit down with your family, please read these lines. On 29 January we, a group of elderly women who survived the blockade, decided to gather for a home party. We baked pirozhki, made salads, and quickly had the table filled. We remembered the war, the blockade, cried a little, sang wartime sings. Life is not all that bad here--you see, we found enough food and many kind words, and most importantly, we still have hope and are waiting for better life. On 27 January I was at a concert in October Hall. I came back very impressed, wrote these lines and read them to my blockade comrades. They told me to send them to you, with the hope that you will read them. I was at the concert in October Hall the day the president visited our city. First he visited Piskarevskoye cemetery, and in the evening came to October Hall. He sat in the stalls. During the intermission he left, and everyone who stood by the aisle tried to tell him something. When he approached them, I decided to shake his hand and said a few words, too: "We believe in you, Boris Nikolayevich, so protect our Russian people, just as we defended and held against the enemy our home city of Leningrad during the grim days of the blockade." As I was saying these words I had a vision: There was a fairytale mighty warrior standing there, I reached out, and he shook my hand. And in this handshake I felt the mighty force, and the pure, Russian soul. You carry such a burden, our people's president! So many dark clouds have gathered over your head! So rise to your full height, straighten your shoulders, and blow with your mighty force, disperse these clouds and open the way to warm, life-giving sunlight for us. Squeeze in your mighty fist all the darkness--and with such force that when you open your fist there would be only purity left there, and hope, and faith in the light and happiness. Maybe not for us, but at least for our children--open a clear, light road for them. I am a native Leningrader, I lived through the blockade, and I have worked for 45 years; I now am raising my granddaughter, instilling in her all the goodness, honesty, and love for people and the motherland. I am sending you my poem: WAR It knocked on our doors, Not even knocked but broke in, Broke in as an uninvited guest, Bringing all the horrors with it. It was then when I saw through a child's eyes All the horrors of war, And hunger, and exploding shells, And I heard the cry Of my own land, Pleading: Do not let, my people, Do not let the fascists trample me. And the people rose then And defended you, our land. So let us honor those Who are now buried in it And those who lived. [Signed] Vera Ivanovna Amelina, St. Petersburg Dear Vera Ivanovna: I sincerely thank you for the letter filled with your noble feelings for Russia, its leadership, and the policy it conducts. Your heartfelt letter is especially touching because it is written by a woman who survived the blockade and the horrors of wartime hardship. They are eloquent confirmation of the fact that the course of socioeconomic reforms being implemented in the country finds support among broad population strata, despite the temporary difficulties many Russians are encountering. This support lets us look to the future with optimism, and prompts us to double, triple the efforts of rebuilding society in the name of the well-being of the Fatherland and all its citizens. I wish you and all your loved one health and success, dear Vera Ivanovna. [Signed] B. Yeltsin To President of the Russian Federation B.N. Yeltsin. Dear Boris Nikolayevich: Almost two months have passed since the day of the elections to the Federal Assembly and adoption of the Constitution of the Russian Federation--enough time to have conducted a deep analysis and drawn correct conclusions from this extraordinary event. In this letter, addressed personally to you, I want to touch on just one issue, which in my opinion is of great importance both for the past and future elections, which are not too far away; we have to start preparing for them now, today, or maybe we should have begun yesterday. What I have in mind is a voters committee, without which no elections are possible; both the practical experience and your high praise of the fruitful activities of the Volgograd Voters Committee last year tell us this. The Volgograd Voters Committee, whose goal was to assist citizens in carrying out their constitutional right to participate in the management of state and public affairs through an effective democratic electoral mechanism, was officially registered in November 1992, although its practical work in our city and oblast began much earlier. Over this time the voters committee has accomplished a lot in forming a high political culture of voters, as called for by the modern democratic process in our country; it coordinated the work of its component groups and units and integrated their activities with the activities of other public organizations and structures; monitored compliance with the Law on Elections, observance of electoral procedures and suppression of their violations; developed recommendations for an improvement of electoral system on the basis of analysis of public opinion; conducted information and propaganda events which facilitated the realization of voters' rights; and increased the numbers and political activism of voters. In addition, the Volgograd Voters Committee conducted a broad propaganda campaign in labor collectives and at voters' places of residence aimed at bringing them into socially useful political activities; in helping labor collectives, public organizations, and citizens to conduct the entire range of election campaigning, it actively used in its activities information and propaganda flyers and posters, methodological materials, and created its own mass media--and quite effective at that. It should also be noted that the Volgograd Voters Committee supported in every way the voters' initiative aimed at improving the electoral system; helped ensure voters' direct influence on the direction and nature of activities of elected bodies, and promoted glasnost in the work of electoral commissions, making public the relevant administrative instructions and statutes on election matters; fought to ensure equal opportunities in the conduct of the electoral campaign for all candidates to elected bodies of authority, and observance of legal and ethical norms of political competition; and ensured public control over setting the necessary organizational conditions for voters to recall and re-elect elected representatives. Over the time of its operation the Volgograd Voters Committee became an authoritative organization, to which residents of Volgograd and the oblast turned with all sorts of questions: legal, social, economic, political, ecological, pedagogical, cultural, and so on; it was especially true during the election campaign, when it was arranged to have someone on duty at all times, including on weekends. The reasons people came to us varied: questions, consultations, complaints, concerns, petitions, requests for concrete practical assistance, and so on. There were also different categories of people who turned to the voters committee. Employed and unemployed, housewives, pensioners, farmers, Cossacks, and single mothers--especially those who had been abandoned by their husbands, leaving the children without alimony. Unwed mothers at least get some help from the state; women, however, who have been legally married and then abandoned by irresponsible husbands do not get any assistance for their children either from the state or from the former husbands, since it is practically impossible to extract alimony from them. There are a great many such women, and they ask you to issue a special edict on protection of their rights and the rights of their children. Unfortunately, too few young people came to the voters committee. Now it is clear why young people were so unwilling to participate in the election campaign. We have many political parties, and all of them first and foremost want power, while no one works seriously with the youth, or takes their interests into account. This is a very sad but real fact. In the past each residential building in the city was assigned to an agitator from some or other organization; now this is longer the case, and voters sometimes do not know who to vote for, where to vote, how to vote, and even when to vote. All this, and many other things, negatively affect the course, and especially the results, of elections. All this and a lot of other work could be done by a permanently functioning voters committee with a staff of several people. There is no money, however, in the city and oblast to support such a committee, and nobody wants to try to find any. The Volgograd Voters Committee is not functioning now for one and only one reason: There is no money. Both state and public organizations in the city do not deny the importance of the voters committee, but nobody will undertake financial support of it; as a result, the voters suffer. In the past, when we had soviets, sometimes people could get help there from the commissions for protection of citizens' rights. Now there are no soviets and no commissions either. As they say, they threw the baby out with the bath water. Some time in the future analogous commissions will undoubtedly emerge in the dumas, but so far they have not, and the voters committee could be of great help to the people during this important and difficult period. Based on the above, I ask you to take personal part in aiding the Volgograd Voters Committee, and perhaps also voters committees in other regions in Russia--first and foremost those that have already shown themselves well during the recent elections to the central and local bodies of authority. The issue at hand is maintenance of just several staff persons; it is not a great expense, and it pays off many times over; you know this very well, since last year you personally congratulated the Volgograd Voters Committee on its successful work in the conduct of the election campaign. If you now provide the needed help to our voters committee, it will certainly do everything to make the upcoming elections a success; the future fate of Russia is predicated on this, the fate of its long-suffering people, who expect from you more changes toward a better life. [Signed] Labor Veteran B. Orlov Volgograd Dear B.S. Orlov: I value very highly the work of the Volgograd Voters Committee, which you described in your letter. I see the creation and functioning of such independent public organizations both as a form of manifestation of true democracy and as one of the methods of developing it, aimed at assisting all citizens in the realization of their constitutional rights and developing high political culture among the voters. Unfortunately, the state is currently unable to financially assist voters committees, which, along with Volgograd, exist in other cities of Russia as well. The national leadership is counting on their activities being carried out on a volunteer basis, while the lack of material incentives is more than compensated for by moral dividends--the knowledge that you are a direct part of realization of a high goal: the restoration of Great Russia. I wish you success in this difficult endeavor. [Signed] B. Yeltsin To the President of the Russian Federation Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin Dear Boris Nikolayevich: We, veterans of the Great Patriotic War, armed forces veterans, and wartime labor veterans of St. Petersburg, are writing to you with a very important request and some proposals. Boris Nikolayevich, the people who bring this plea to you have gone through severe trials in combat and battles for the Motherland, the Fatherland, trials that have befallen internationalist soldiers, and wartime labor veterans. The people who bring this plea to you have gone through the harsh school of serving in the military, former privates and commanders of companies and battalions, regiments and divisions, people who commanded corps and armies, military schools, institutes, and academies, former heads of organizations, production facilities, factories, and plants, former public figures, and scientists--from a candidate of science to academicians of the Russian Academy of Science. This entire preamble serves the sole purpose, dear Boris Nikolayevich, of letting you know that we are not unthinking people; together with our country we have gone through trials and tribulations--as have you--and we have one and same goal: Through the modest efforts of those who still work, and by our advice and proposals, to try to help the common cause of the well-being of the Fatherland and to the extent possible make easier the life of the older generation, first and foremost war veterans. Bear with us; hear our voice--it is a cry from the heart and soul; hear us out as the president, who is guaranteed to remain in this position of authority until 1996; as the supreme commander in chief; and simply as a human being. Less than a year and a half remains until the historic date--the 50-year anniversary of the Great Victory of the Soviet people in the Patriotic War. We ask you, Boris Nikolayevich, to issue an edict on preparations for this remarkable date no later than the first half of 1994. And to take into consideration in this edict our requests and proposals, namely: 1. To set up a committee (commission) for the preparation and direction of the celebration of the 50-year anniversary of the Great Victory under the chairmanship of the minister of defense or one of his deputies, and with the mandatory participation of war veterans, armed forces veterans, and wartime labor veterans. As well as local subcommissions (subcommittees) under the leadership of military district commanders. All work should be done on a volunteer basis without additional remuneration. 2. To have under the president and the chairman of the Russian Federation Government and heads of administrations of Russian Federation components representatives for war and armed forces veterans' affairs. These representatives should not be members of any party or bloc. It would be best to appoint them from armed forces veterans. The duties of representatives of war and armed forces veterans' affairs should include: --taking care of veterans' everyday problems and needs locally; --leading veteran organizations; organizing patriotic upbringing of the young generation in schools, technical schools, vocational schools, and institutes. 3. To instruct the minister of defense, military district commanders, and military commissioners at the local level to more actively and fruitfully care for war and armed forces veterans. 4. Keeping in mind that increasingly fewer war veterans will still be alive by the time of the 50-year Victory anniversary, to assign the status of category II disability, with all attendant benefits, to all participants (precisely--participants, not persons equivalent in status) in the war, who have been given awards for participation in combat and battles. 5. To study the possibility of our state materially rewarding the remaining participants in the Great Patriotic War on the occasion of the anniversary. Keeping in mind that there has never been a war in the history of humanity comparable to this one in the scale of cruelty on the aggressor side and the mass heroism and uncompromising stance on our side. It was we who won in this cruel battle--we Russians, who made a decisive contribution to the victory in the entire World War II. 6. To canonize in a secular manner the great troop leader, defender of the Fatherland Georgiy Konstantinovch Zhukov, whose services to our Fatherland have been no lesser than those of our great forebears: Aleksandr Nevskiy, Suvorov, Kutuzov, Bogdan Khmelnitskiy, Ushakov, and Nakhimov, in whose honor the highest orders have been established. To establish a "Zhukov Order" and a "Zhukov Medal" and award it to all surviving war veterans in our Fatherland, the CIS, and particularly distinguished World War II veterans in the United States, England, and France, regardless of rank and title. We have no doubt that such a decision, Boris Nikolayevich, will be truly appreciated not only by the peoples of Russia and the CIS but also by the world community. To erect monuments to G.K. Zhukov at Poklonnaya Mountain in Moscow and at the sites of decisive battles: in St. Petersburg, at Kursk Bulge (the site of the historic tank battle), and a number of other places. Dear Boris Nikolayevich, you approved this proposal of ours during your visit to the former front line in the vicinity of Leningrad, around Maryino village, on 27 January 1994, for which we are sincerely grateful to you and hope that it will be implemented in a timely manner. With respect and hope, on behalf of veterans, we sign this letter: [Signed] Chairman of the Committee of the Leningrad Organization of Brother War and Armed Forces Veterans, Hero of the Soviet Union, Colonel General V.N. Kubarev cochairmen of the Club of Aleksandr Nevskiy Order Recipients, Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences N.A. Moiseyenko and Artillery Major General, Doctor of Technical Sciences V.M. Kislov St. Petersburg Dear Vasiliy Nikolayevich, Vasiliy Mironovich, and Nikolay Andreyevich: I thank you for your letter. Many of the wishes expressed in it are within the mainstream of the policy conducted by the national leadership and whose main directions were formulated in the recent Message to the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation. The task now is to combine the efforts of the entire society towards this in order to energetically overcome the socioeconomic crisis and its negative consequences. In this work we also count on the support and help of your heroic generation--the generation that defended the independence of the Fatherland. I wish you health, happiness, and wellness, dear veterans. [Signed] B. Yeltsin
