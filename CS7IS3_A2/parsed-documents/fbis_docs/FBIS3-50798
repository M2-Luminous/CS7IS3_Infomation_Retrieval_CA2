This will not modify the general timetable, however. The PNC transfer and deployment plans will be completed by October 1994. Our intention now is to transfer those units being discharged from the PN to other places requiring a greater security force presence." This plan will have other consequences in San Salvador, such as the reorganization of the city's layout. President Cristiani said that this will be done gradually, as the PNC is deployed throughout the city. The president explained this as follows: [Cristiani] "Instead of the nine or 11 sectors into which the city was divided before, we will now have 45 sectors in the metropolitan area. We have evaluated the city's physical structure--meaning streets, neighborhoods, municipal limits and other aspects of the terrain--and reached this distribution. Each sector will have a person who will be responsible for the sector's public security. He or she will be at least an officer or a deputy commissioner, which the PNC will explain later in greater detail, regarding Soyapango and Ilopango. Each sector will have at least 50 public security units. If we can do this, we will have more than the initial 2,000 units we had with both public force institutions." This again leads to another important question: When will the PNC be completely deployed in San Salvador? The president apparently has a set timetable that he presented during the news conference. [Unidentified reporter] "Mr. President, under this new direction of the public security plans, when will the PNC be deployed to all these areas you have described?" [Cristiani] "The deployment plan is a gradual one. The next two municipalities are not yet defined. These next two will be determined in January, basically because there are several variables that must be considered. These elements include terrain extension, the number of criminal cases, the graduation rate at the public security school, the reenlistment of PN personnel, and so on. We have completed this study for Soyapango and Ilopango, and we are making further evaluations to determine which municipality will follow. We believe that the PNC will be deployed in the metropolitan area in approximately four or five months." That is basically what President Cristiani said today about completing the PNC deployment in San Salvador. One might ask why Soyapango and Ilopango were selected for deployment. The government reports that 339 crimes are reported here in Soyapango. A majority of 57 cases are car thefts, while 53 percent are muggings.
