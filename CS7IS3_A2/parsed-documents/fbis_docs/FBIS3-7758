The air raid was carried out in three sweeps, causing great material damage. After dropping their load, the chetnik bombers flew off in the direction of Donji Vakuf. Since 1745 last night the chetnik artillery has been pounding the residential areas of Bugojno, and this was repeated early this morning during the chetnik air raid. All the defense lines of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army fighters from Operative Group West are firm and alert. As for the Gornji Vakuf front, the cease-fire is largely holding, at least as far as the artillery is concerned. Snipers are still active, and something should be done about these criminals, as that is in the interest of both sides.
