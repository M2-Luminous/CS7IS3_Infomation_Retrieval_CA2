FBIS4-38268 "drnes125dd_94013" FBIS-NES-94-125 Daily Report 26 Jun 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Palestinian Affairs `Source' Denies 'Abbas Intention To Quit Fatah `Source' Denies 'Abbas Intention To Quit Fatah PM2806115894 London AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT in Arabic 26 Jun 94 p 5 PM2806115894 London AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT Arabic BFN [Unattributed report: "Source Close to Abu-Mazin Denies He Intends To Resign From Fatah"] [Text] Tunis, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- While it has been confirmed that Muhammad Ghunaym (Abu-Mahir) has submitted his resignation from the Mobilization and Organization Department in Fatah and from his other political and movement duties, Fatah sources have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that Mahmud 'Abbas (Abu-Mazin) is in severe disagreement with Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat because of his hesitation over returning to Gaza and Jericho and offering guarantees to the World Bank and the donor states to facilitate the provision of grants and aid -- which prompted some people to talk about the possibility of Abu-Mazin's resigning his posts. But an authoritative source in the office of Abu-Mazin, head of the PLO Pan-Arab and International Relations, has stressed to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that "there is no truth in recent reports of Abu-Mazin's intention to quit political and organization action or to resign from Fatah." The source added that Abu-Mazin's explaining the reasons that prompted Abu-Mahir to resign and to quit political and movement action does not mean "a similarity in their positions." The source vehemently denied that there is any coordination between Abu-Mahir and Abu-Mazin with regard to the resignation issue. AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that Abu-Mazin and Faruq Qaddumi (Abu-al-Lutf) [head of the PLO Political Department] succeeded the day before yesterday in persuading Abu-Mahir to abandon his seclusion and resume his daily work in his office. Cadres from the Mobilization and Organization Department have contacted Abu-Mahir at his home, urging him to abandon his resignation "because he is needed in order not to perpetuate autocracy in the movement." Elsewhere, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that a misunderstanding arose yesterday between 'Arafat and Abu-al-Lutf in front of European Union ambassadors over the current balance of the Scandinavian states' aid fund for the Palestinian people -- the fund named after the late Norwegian Foreign Minister (Jorgen) Holst. Reports say that 'Arafat put the figure at $53 million, while Abu-al-Lutf put it at $60 million. This conflict in the figures aroused the European ambassadors' suspicions about the fate of the $7 million, the difference between the two figures.
