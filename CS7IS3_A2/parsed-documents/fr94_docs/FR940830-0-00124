(g) The claimant/owner may also maintain a declining deposit account with the State Office of the BLM where the mining claims and sites are recorded for the payment of service charges, maintenance fees, and location fees.

The assessment years covered by the Act of August 10, 1993, begin at 12 o'clock noon on September 1, 1994, and end at 12 o'clock noon on September 1, 1999.

If such claims or sites are located prior to an August 31, and the notice of location is properly filed within the FLPMA time frame but after August 31, then the $100 fee that was due on August 31 for the succeeding assessment year shall be paid at the time of filing the location notice along with the initial $100 fee. (2) The initial maintenance fee described in paragraph (1) is not subject to the waiver provisions contained in §§3833.1&hyph;6 and 3833.1&hyph;7. (b) Under the Act of August 10, 1993, a nonrefundable maintenance fee of $100.00 for each mining claim, mill site, or tunnel site shall be paid annually on or before August 31 for the subsequent assessment year beginning at 12 o'clock noon on September 1 of that year.

At the time of payment, the claimant/owner shall submit a list of claim names and BLM serial numbers assigned to each mining claim or site for which the maintenance fee is being paid.

(e) The owner of an oil shale placer claim shall pay the required $550 annual rental fee to the proper BLM State Office on or before each December 31. (f) The payment of the required maintenance fee for a mining claim, mill site, or tunnel site satisfies the requirement to file an affidavit of assessment work or a notice of intention to hold pursuant to §3833.2. (g) If a waived mining claim or site is transferred in total or in part to a party not qualified for a waiver, the waiver is forfeited for the mining claim or site or portion of interest therein transferred to the unqualified party. The maintenance fee for the previously waived claim or site will be paid for the assessment year in which the transfer was effective under State law pursuant to §3833.3. The applicable deadline is the August 31 on or immediately after which the transfer is effective under State law. (h) The Secretary will adjust the location and maintenance fees every 5 years, based upon the Consumer Price Index (CPI) as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Department of Labor. The Secretary may adjust the location and maintenance fees sooner, if he deems it reasonable, based upon changes in the CPI. (1) Public notice of any adjustment of maintenance or location fees will be provided by July 1 of the assessment year prior to the assessment year to which the adjustment becomes effective. (2) Any such adjustment of maintenance or location fees to reflect changes in the CPI will be payable no later than the second August 31 following the July 1 by which the notice of the adjustment was given.
