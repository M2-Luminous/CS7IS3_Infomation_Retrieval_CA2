Tom Hubbard, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for Asian and Pacific affairs, and Ho Chong, deputy chief of the North Korean mission to the United Nations, met at UN headquarters in New York Tuesday shortly after North Korea's acceptance of inspections was announced. Their discussion focused mainly on possible suspension of "Team Spirit," the annual South Korea-U.S. joint military exercise, and holding the third round of high-level talks, but details of their talks were not immediately known. Diplomatic sources here said that North Korea notified the United States of its willingness to cooperate in allowing access to an IAEA inspection team, and that Pyongyang urged Washington to suspend Team Spirit and push ahead with the third round of high-level talks. Washington clarified that it would suspend this year's Team Spirit and hold further talks with Pyongyang on condition that inter-Korean dialogue on exchanging special envoys be resumed, according to the sources. Meanwhile, U.S. State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said at a regular briefing on Tuesday that the third round of high-level talks between the United States and North Korea would be held if satisfactory IAEA inspections were completed and if inter-Korean dialogue on denuclearization of the Korean peninsula was resumed at an early date. He added that it is impossible to say exactly what caused North Korea to change its stance on nuclear inspections.
