Can you identify the political sectors involved and what are your views on this issue? [De Leon] Unfortunately, Guatemalan history contains numerous incidents such as these which someday, I believe, we will overcome precisely by strengthening the democratic system; we will forget that the word coup d'etat exists, but we are still a long way from that. Indeed, I find it embarrassing for civilians and for myself as president and as a civilian, that civilian politicians knocked at the headquarters doors, and that it was the military officers who turned them away, so to speak. Unfortunately, as the defense minister said, we do not have sufficient evidence to take them to court for this action which, of course, constitutes a crime. Knocking at the doors is a phrase that does not apply exactly to this topic, but it is true that there have been rumors to the effect that certain politicians attempted to take advantage of the circumstances. Fortunately, as I said recently, the officers of the Guatemalan Army are professionals who are fully convinced of their role within the democratic system. Therefore, I repeat, today more than ever in Guatemalan history, there is absolutely no possibility of a disruption of institutional order. This proves the position held by the constitutional Army which recently, on 25 May for example, gave tangible proof of its adherence to the mandates and decisions of the Constitutionality Court. The Army, the same as other sectors of Guatemalan society, strengthened the democratic process. The circumstances prevail today; that is why I said today that I am devoted to governability, economic and social issues, a broad-based national agreement, and basic issues because institutionality has been saved. We have managed to strengthen institutionality over the past seven or eight months since the events of 25 May, which also strengthens the democratic system, but we must strengthen it even more. That is one of the goals of the broad-based national agreement but, I reiterate with regret, there are Guatemalans who still believe they can resort to coups d'etat but, fortunately, the Armed Forces clearly understand the role it must play in a democratic system. Therefore, I am dismissing the possibility of a coup. The people would not tolerate such a thing and just imagine the international isolation we would suffer. Therefore, I have totally dismissed the possibility of such an action. This does preclude the possibility that individuals who were dismissed from the Army may have made certain remarks and started these rumors, and that civilians supported them in the hope of succeeding. Fortunately, however, things never got past the rumor stage, and things are going to remain this way because at this time there is no room for coups, at least in Guatemala. [Reporter] Who were the persons involved? [De Leon] If I knew that they would be standing trial right now. [Reporter] You have spoken of politicians; can you speak of the involvement of any political parties? [De Leon] No. There have been references to politicians [words indistinct] civilians. [laughs] That description would be the traditional [words indistinct] for them but they are politicians after all. [Reporter] [Question indistinct] [De Leon] Yes. If we knew who they were they would be standing trial. [Reporter] [Question indistinct] [De Leon] No, no, no. Rumors were spread and because of the atmosphere that prevailed certain politicians tried to take advantage of them. [Words indistinct] at present we do not have any (?evidence). If we did you could rest assured that those individuals would be standing trial for the crimes allegedly perpetrated. No, no, I believe you should erase the term coup d'etat from your minds. There is no room here for coups and the people behind the rumors have probably had their last hurrah. [passage omitted]
