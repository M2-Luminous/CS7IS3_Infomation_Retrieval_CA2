There are now growing calls for adding about 100 trillion yen -- for the purpose of expanding domestic demand -- to the existing plan to invest 430 trillion yen in public works projects in the 10-year period to 2000. The Ministry of Finance [MOF] at present is wary about this idea of revising the plan at a time when a conclusion is yet to be reached on the question of taxation system reform, and insists "it would be irresponsible to make a pledge on expanded investments when there is no hope of securing financial resources." But still there is a growing possibility that this will become a key point in the market liberalization plans to be finalized by the government soon. Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii in a news conference on 9 March showed he was cool toward an early revision of the plan, by declaring, "discussions on the expansion of the basic plan, including those on financial resources, are only beginning now, and there is no need to change our pace." But demands for discussing the basic plan are growing now that the possibility of the United States applying the Super 301 provision (definition of unfair trade practices and nations engaged in such practices, and sanctions against them) of the Omnibus Trade Act is closer to reality after the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks broke down over the question of setting numerical targets. The minister of transport and the director-general of the Economic Planning Agency have demanded the revision of the plan in informal cabinet meetings, and the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations [Keidanren] and the Japan Association of Corporate Executives [Keizai Doyukai] separately on 7 March submitted emergency proposals [to the government] on adding more than 100 trillion yen to the plan. Despite these voices, the MOF is not about to agree to a revision of the plan at the present time. An official of the ministry Budget Bureau said: "Even the final report of the Hiraiwa Commission said public investment should not be expanded without finding means of financial resources to back it up." The Hiraiwa Commission's final report said, "a revision of the basic plan on allocation of funds as well as expansion should be considered only on condition that appropriate financial resources are secured so that no burdens are left into the next generation." As such, the MOF's view is that expansion should be possible only on the premise that taxes will be raised in the future. The ministry also insists that if, for instance, a choice of issuing large amounts of construction bonds is made, it will result not only in increasing government burdens in paying for principal and interest therefrom, but also in raising the overall bank interest rates as issuance of the bonds will suck in funds from the private sector. As such, it will in fact only impede recovery of the economy, the ministry argues. But within the government there are also those who want to find a breakthrough in the economic framework talks by presenting to the United States the concept for expanding public investment. Apparently there is "internal strife" among the government offices. The MOF argues vehemently against the demands for expansion, contending, "The United States has not once asked for expansion of the public investment in the framework talks. Some people are misreading the interests of that country."
