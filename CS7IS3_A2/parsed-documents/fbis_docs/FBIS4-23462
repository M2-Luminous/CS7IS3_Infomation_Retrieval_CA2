FBIS4-23462 "drafr109_e_94004" FBIS-AFR-94-109 Daily Report 6 Jun 1994 WEST AFRICA Nigeria Fourth Senator Arrested After Challenging Junta Fourth Senator Arrested After Challenging Junta AB0606164594 Paris AFP in English 1538 GMT 6 Jun 94 AB0606164594 Paris AFP English BFN [Text] Lagos, June 6 (AFP) -- Nigerian police have arrested a fourth member of the country's dissolved Senate, which threw down a gauntlet to the junta last week by declaring itself in session, a senator told AFP on Monday [6 June]. The security forces on Sunday detained Abu Ibrahim of the northern Katsina State, said ex-Senator Bola Tinubu, who was himself still being sought by police after the Senate declared the military regime illegal. Speaking by cellular telephone from his hideaway after the arrests began at the weekend, Tinubu said that police officers had visited his Lagos home several times, demanding that he report to police headquarters. Two other former senators, Polycarp Nwite and Okoroafor, were arrested and detained Saturday, respectively in Lagos and Abeokuta. Tinubu is a founder member of the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO), a broad-based nationwide grouping of pro-democracy activists and rights movements which has called on General Sani Abacha's regime to stand down. Another leading NADECO member, former Ogun State governor Segun Obosa, was arrested on Friday. Several members of the National Assembly, which was also dissolved by Abacha after he seized power last November, pledged Sunday to show "solidarity" for the detained former speaker of the Senate, Ameh Ebute, whenever he is brought to court for trial. "He is our leader and he deserves our moral support in his moment of travail," four of the ex-legislators told AFP in a telephone interview. They did not disclose what form the support would take but said it would be demonstrated around the court premises. Detained ex-Senator Nwite, who spoke to AFP Sunday from his detention room on his cellular phone, alleged that the conditions under which he was being held were harsh. He complained that he had not been given food, water or a bed to sleep on. Like the Senate, the National Assembly has called on Abacha to quit to pave the way for the installation of Moshood Abiola, the winner on unofficial results of last June's presidential election, which was annulled by the military junta of the time. The government has described their action as "illegal, criminal and very dangerous." The Senate, in a meeting in defiance of a ban on political activity, has for its part labelled the junta "illegal." The military regime plans to stage a constitutional conference over four months from June 27, which it describes as a key aspect of its own plans to restore power to elected civilians. Pro-democracy activists have called for a boycott of the conference.
