I believe that these negotiations could reach agreement over some points, but not all of them during this round. Discussions revolve around the issue of the crossings, the Jericho area, and the settlements in Gaza. There is some slow and simple progress in these points. We are now working on finding a joint formula on the things we have managed to agree on. There are still some difficulties. I believe that if all points are not addressed during this round, we could discuss them in Cairo to finalize our agreement. ['Awn] Mr. Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, on what level will discussions in Cairo take place? On President 'Arafat's level? ['Abd-Rabbuh] I do not think so. Before we reach discussions on the level of President 'Arafat and Prime Minister Rabin, we need to be very close to finalizing the agreement in its broad outlines and even its essential details. Therefore, what we agree on now will form a part of the agreement that we must finalize at a later date. ['Awn] Mr. Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, thank you. ['Abd-Rabbuh] I thank you.
