Britain will call for political backing for a new approach at the European Union's Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels this afternoon. And Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind will discuss the Prime Minister's plans with the United Nations military chief Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose in Bosnia today. He will report back to the Prime Minister tonight. John Major believes that action in the wake of the atrocity in Sarajevo market place on Saturday [5 February] which killed 68 people cannot wait for an overall settlement of the civil war in the former Yugoslavia. He has accused all three parties, the Serbs, the Croats and the Muslims, of "dragging their feet" in negotiations. The Prime Minister's call for a new, tougher approach comes after UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali asked NATO to prepare for possible air strikes against artillery positions in and around Sarajevo. Representatives of NATO's 16 members are set to meet in Brussels on Wednesday to discuss the request. Downing Street officials said Mr Major thinks it is now essential for the UN and NATO to take "immediate and effective action." He believes the UN should draw up a plan to halt attacks on Sarajevo and to deploy UN forces so they cannot resume. "This is likely to require more muscular action than hitherto by the United Nations. Its purpose must be not merely to punish or retaliate but to improve the situation in Sarajevo," said one official. Both Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and Mr Rifkind today warned that an air strikes policy carried risks. [passage omitted] Mr Major will hold urgent talks on the Bosnian crisis with Mr Hurd, Mr Rifkind and other key Ministers at Downing Street tomorrow. It was being stressed today that the Prime Minister realises that it would be "folly" to ignore the advice of the military on the ground before launching any reprisals. But it has been noted that General Rose has already adopted a far tougher line than his predecessors in Bosnia. Downing Street kept in touch with the White House over the weekend and Mr Hurd spoke three times to Warren Christopher, the U.S. Secretary of State. The Prime Minister was also in regular contact with Mr Hurd and Mr Rifkind.
