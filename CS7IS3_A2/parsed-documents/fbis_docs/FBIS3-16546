According to him, the Army today cannot be provided with new military equipment as needed because defense enterprises are in a catastrophic state, i.e, in a state of forced conversion. The Ministry of Defense owes them a huge sum of money. However, Pavel Grachev stated publicly for the first time that the Army is being financed at such a low level that there would be a complete breakdown if it is any lower. [Grachev] That is what the budget which, unfortunately, the Ministry of Finance is offering us, could lead to; the Ministry of Finance, which, you see, knows all about how to maintain the army and on what budget. As to the problem of the Black Sea Fleet, Pavel Grachev believes it should be settled in accordance with the Massandra Agreement between Ukraine and Russia, according to which the Ukrainian part of the fleet, after an appropriate inventory, would be passed over to Russia. [Grachev] Russia will pay suitably for leasing this part of the fleet, and the fleet stays unified and indivisible, as at present. But this is being done with a lot of difficulties. Pavel Grachev read the journalists a message from Admiral Baltin which reports continuing acts of the Ukrainian powers that use special purpose troops and OMON [Special Purpose Militia Detachment] forces with the aim of forcing the personnel of the fleet to take the oath of allegiance to Ukraine.
