Portal, concluding a tour in Paris that took him to Norway, Great Britain, Holland, and France, has said Cuba ranks 29th in security for investments, placing it ahead of most Latin American countries. Although he did not downplay the negative effects of the U.S. blockade against Cuba, Portal said the Cuban Government's economic strategy does not depend on the lifting of this measure imposed by Washington more than 30 years ago.
