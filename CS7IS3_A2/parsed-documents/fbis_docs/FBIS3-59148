The main shareholder in DDP/ADN, Bolko Hoffmann, told the press in Berlin on Wednesday [27 January] that the shares in the business are to be transferred to all DDP/ADN workers on the model of the workers' shares in the Hamburg news magazine DER SPIEGEL. This should ensure the long-term existence of the company with its 250 or so full and part-time jobs. Hoffmann made it clear he had planned originally to time this step differently. However, the latest offer of a three-year contract from the Federal Press Office (BPA) seriously disadvantaged DDP/ADN in comparison with other competitors on the news market. He did not want to sign this contract "because it would have long-term effects of over a decade or longer." Whereas no other agencies had to accept any cuts in their subsidies, payments to DDP/ADN were to be reduced by almost 20 percent both in 1995 and 1996. This meant DDP/ADN was standing "at a crossroads." Hoffmann said, "the editor in chief and the editors will have to fight the necessary battle with the Federal Press Office without me." However, at the same time he stressed that he will "quite clearly continue to be available to the agency." The main shareholder sharply criticized the fact that the Federal Press Office did not open news services to public tender, even though the law expressly demanded this. The entire foreign budget of DM [German marks] 11.25 million was awarded to the Deutsche Presse-Agentur (DPA), in spite of the Federal Audit Office's strictures that this involved payment for services not provided. The Federal Press Office had paid DPA fees of DM17 million, which enabled it to offer discounts of up to 75 percent in eastern Germany. The effects of this persisted, particularly since drastic discounts were still being offered. This dumping was a clear violation of competition, Hoffmann said. This meant DPA was able to conduct a "devastating price war" against its competitors. Hoffmann also pointed out that the news agency AFP, which already received an unlawful 48 percent subsidy from the French state, had received an additional Federal Press Office grant for 1993 at the expense of DDP/ADN. He had to "say with a degree of bitterness" this "is evidently a fresh example of how the Kohl government envisages the `Upswing East' in the long term," Hoffmann said. He said the company had been "modestly in the black" during 1992 and 1993 and was "absolutely healthy." The company's nominal capital amounted to DM1 million and had at its disposal over DM1.2 million in liquid funds. The decisions to be taken now, therefore, concern not the year 1994 but the future of the agency and its staff. Hoffmann, majority shareholder in Effecten-Spiegel AG, Duesseldorf, acquired the former GDR state agency ADN from the Treuhand privatization agency in May 1992. In December 1993 he merged it with Deutscher Depeschen Dienst (DDP), which he took over in 1983.
