The crackdown is code named the "Fishing Season '94" operation, and it involves mobilization of the Border Patrol, local government authorities in the Far East, Russian Navy's Pacific Fleet, and even reconnaissance satellites. Several Japanese fishing boats have recently been captured in waters off the northern territories, and the Russian crackdown is obviously targeting these Japanese fishermen. On 19 April, Border Patrol Commander Nikolayev stated as follows in Kamchatka: "As an economic major power, Russia has to protect its own economic interests. Our neighbors should not forget about it. Russia intends to establish `civilized' border lines -- this means the border exists to secure national interests." The crackdown on poachers will be continued until October.
