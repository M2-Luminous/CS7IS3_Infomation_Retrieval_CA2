These charges and warnings are contained in a presidential address to the people of Moldova, published here today. "The unconstitutional authorities of the so-called Dniester Republic have blocked the implementation of the Moscow agreement on the peaceful settlement of the conflict, signed on August 21, 1992," Snegur stressed. "This is evidenced by the deployment of Dniester armed forces within the zone of security, which was envisaged by the Moscow agreement, and their remaining fortifications there. The local population was actually shut up in a reservation by the special regime clamped down on the left-hand bank territory by the Tiraspol leaders," the Moldovan president claims. "Posts have been set up on roads and vehicles and citizens are being searched in a most humiliatory manner. Pressure is being exerted on villagers refusing to support the Tiraspol leaders. People are not allowed to set up voting stations for the upcoming parliamentary elections in Moldova." Vice-president of unrecognised Dniester Republic Aleksandr Karaman stated today that Snegur's public warning against possible provocations prove that such acts are quite possible. "Definite forces in Moldova would like to put the blame for them on the Dniester Moldovan Republic, especially in the presence of foreign observers," Karaman stated. "However, it would be logical for us to keep very quiet and mild in such a situation," he added.
