According to a joint communique issued by the UP and the Colombian Communist Party, Abella, a Bogota municipal official and Senate candidate, has "received serious threats against her life and had to travel abroad urgently." The communique added the leftist leader will use her trip to report to the UN Human Rights Commission meeting in Geneva "the systematic violation of human rights in Colombia under President Cesar Gaviria's government." The communique added Abella "will go to Amnesty International and other human rights organizations to reveal the fraudulent conditions in which the government prepares the 13 March elections." Furthermore, the UP complained the Prosecutor General's Office had arrested Jose Antonio Lopez, the UP candidate to the Chamber of Representatives for the northeastern Department of Antioquia, and Nelson Campos, the mayor of the banana-producing community of Apartado and a UP member as well. The Prosecutor General's Office had ordered their arrest in relation to its investigation of the massacre of 35 people in an impoverished Apartado neighborhood on 23 January.
