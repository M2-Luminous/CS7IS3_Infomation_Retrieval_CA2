The establishment of a socialist market economic structure will inevitably create more historic opportunities for Qinghai's development. Only by seizing the opportunity and taking advantage of the resource superiority can the people of all nationalities in Qinghai rapidly develop Qinghai's economy. Yin Kesheng, secretary of the Qinghai provincial CPC committee, explained the fundamental way to develop Qinghai's economy during an interview with reporters soon after the Chinese New Year. "Qinghai, with a vast area indeed, has attractive natural resources for people to exploit." On Qinghai's resources, Yin Kesheng, who did petroleum prospecting work in the Qaidam desert for a long time, showed a great deal of emotion. He said: Qinghai has such resources as lake salt, hydroelectric power, petroleum, natural gas, non-ferrous metals and asbestos, and the confirmed deposits of them have a potential value of 8 trillion yuan. More than 10 of its mineral deposits, such as sodium, potassium, lithium, iodine, bromine, boron and asbestos rank first in quantity among all provinces in China. The upper reaches of the Huanghe in Qinghai are rich in hydroelectric power resources which are scarce in other parts of China. Qinghai's petroleum gas, non-ferrous metal, and gold resources are also abundant. The confirmed natural gas deposit is now 50 billion cubic meters, while it was less than 10 billion cubic meters in the late 1970's. Since the start of reform and opening up, Qinghai has made great efforts to exploit its resources and achieve prosperity, and it has found the road to success. Now, potash fertilizer in Chaerhan, the lead and zinc mine at Xitieshan, and asbestos at Mangya have become large state construction projects. In recent years, state-run enterprises, collectives, and individuals in various localities in the province were busily engaged in exploitation of resources. Baima County in Golog Zang Autonomous Prefecture used to be a "national-class" poor county. In recent years, the county has discovered gold deposits and greatly improved its financial situation. Qilian County in Haibei Zang Autonomous Prefecture has rapidly achieved financial self-sufficiency by relying on mining asbestos, coal, lead and zinc, copper and gold. Many counties, towns, and salt enterprises in Qaidam Basin have developed themselves by exploitation of natural resources. Now, there are some 100 state-run mining enterprises and nearly 300 collectively- run and private mining enterprises in the province, and the output value of the mining industry accounts for one-sixth of the province's total industrial output value. On future tasks, Yin Kesheng said: The progress of the nation's modernization and the gradual widening of the gap between eastern and western regions have further enhanced the sense of urgency and crisis among the cadres and people in Qinghai. At the same time, the daily increasing demand of coastal and interior regions for energy and raw and processed materials has provided a huge market for Qinghai's large-scale exploitation of resources. In order to achieve a rapid economic development, Qinghai must continue to exploit its natural resources. He expressed the following views: First, we should further emancipate our mind and have new ideas. In order to open the door of the province, we must first open the door of our mind and must not fear that others might come to take advantage of our resources. Second, we should have confidence and fear no hardship. Third, we should boldly use technology, capital, and specialized personnel from the outside world and other parts of our country. Fourth, we should make scientific exploitation of resources and avoid working blindly and recklessly. Repeated feasibility appraisal should be done to planned projects. In economic development, we should consider economic benefit, social benefit, environmental protection, and resource preservation simultaneously. Fifth, we should pay attention to the timely solution of problems and difficulties during the exploitation of resources. Qinghai is a province where ethnic minority people live in compact communities. The people of Tibetan, Hui, Tu, Salar, Mongol and other minority nationalities account for 42 percent of the total population, and most natural resources are located in regions of ethnic minority people. Yin Kesheng said: During the course of natural resource exploitation, we must fully consider the interests of local ethnic minority people. All resource exploitation projects of the state, the province, autonomous prefectures, prefectures, and counties should help the development of local economy of minority nationalities and play a promoting and radiating role. We should take the road of common prosperity for all nationalities. Of course, the ethnic minority regions should also contribute to the overall interest of the state. Yin Kesheng firmly believes that Qinghai will certainly take a greater step in resource exploitation, and its development will be full of promise if the people of all nationalities are united, continue to display the hard-working plateau spirit, and work under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
