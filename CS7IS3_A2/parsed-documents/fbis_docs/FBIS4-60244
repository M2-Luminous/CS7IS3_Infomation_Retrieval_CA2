A tape of his address contains remarks in which he says that the fate of the agreement signed with Israel will be similar to that of the agreement Prophet Muhammad signed with the Quiraish Tribe. Professor Moshe Sharon, an expert on the history of Islam, explains that Muhammad signed a nonbelligerency agreement with the tribe which was in control of Mecca. But two years later he violated the agreement, conquered Mecca, and killed the leaders of the tribe. The segment of the tape was given to our correspondent Gil Litman. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1005 GMT on 22 May carries a similar report by Gil Litman that includes the following recorded passage in English from the address by 'Arafat: "And I am sure, sooner or later, we will pray in Jerusalem together. This agreement, I am not considering it more than the agreement which had been signed between our Prophet Muhammad and Quiraish." Prof. Sharon says in the report that "this set a legal Muslim precedent, according to which you sign an agreement with the enemy when it suits you, and you violate it when you can. That is to say: Any agreement between Muslims and non-Muslims can be violated when it is convenient for the Muslim party." [Quoting further from the recording, Litman says that 'Arafat made the following remark: "There is no permanent state named Israel."]
