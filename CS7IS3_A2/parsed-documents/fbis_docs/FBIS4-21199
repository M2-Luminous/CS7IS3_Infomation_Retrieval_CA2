He also said ``the charges against Panama are unfair.'' Carles acknowledged ``money laundering is taking place in Panama more so now than during the past regime.'' According to Carles ``this activity belittles the country's image throughout the world.'' According to Carles ``President Guillermo Endara's administration has ample means to defend itself from the attacks imposed by U.S. policies.'' Carles said ``we Panamanians cannot accept the U.S. charges, but we must condemn the performance of certain court officials, judges, district attorneys, the Prosecutor's Office, and certain institutions responsible for curbing drug trafficking.'' Regarding the discrediting of certain Panamanian organizations involved in the struggle against money laundering and drug trafficking, Carles said ``we must improve the tarnished image of official institutions by implementing measures aimed at ensuring officials' performance so as to prevent them from submitting to this illegal activity.''
