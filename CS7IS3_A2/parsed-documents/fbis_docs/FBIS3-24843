However, his "attack on the police for being `part of the problem' merely skirts the issue of current legitimacy and the ability of the force to deal with crime. Couched in electioneering rhetoric, Mandela's call for a more efficient force was short on both detail and consistency." "Granted, the police force needs to be transformed into one serving all sections of society fairly and equally. But its task is made more difficult when it is being vilified by important leaders such as Mandela." BUSINESS DAY Criticism of ANC Resisting Double Ballot--"The ANC's rationale for resisting a double ballot is facile," declares a page-6 editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 2 February. Its leaders say "it is based on the experience of a few voter education exercises which showed that about 30 percent of people voted for their second preference party in the second ballot. Some believe the ANC fears losing regional votes to smaller parties. This shows a paternalistic disrespect for either voters' freedom of choice or their intelligence." "The ANC's hard line on this issue negates many of the statesmanlike concessions made on other issues. Unless it yields, the ANC will rue its folly." BEELD Gaborone Meeting Marks Country's Acceptance--Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 28 January notes in a page-8 editorial: "The meeting in Gaborone between President F.W. de Klerk and President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe completed a remarkable diplomatic circle. The moment when South Africa's formerly hostile neighbor extended his hand to President de Klerk it finally signalled South Africa's complete reacceptance into the international community. The fact that it was Mr. de Klerk who shook Mr. Mugabe's hand says a lot. After all, it was a National Party government which took South Africa into the political wilderness." "The Gaborone meeting ought to sound the death knell for the so-called Frontline States" and "lead to a new line, with South Africa at the head, forming a front against stagnation, economic collapse, and political violence." "South Africans can indeed look forward to exciting times ahead, provided no one forgets how easy it is to destroy everything through faulty politics." Right Wing Needs To Promote Cause--In his "Political BEELD" column on page 8, Willie Kuhn points out: "Two reports this week confirm how dramatically South Africa has changed in the last few years. First, the ANC and the Orange Free State Agricultural Union held a meeting," and later the union's spokesman Mr. Pieter Gous said they "could not ignore the fact that the ANC is an important factor in the province, and that the two major forces in the province had spoken with one another. Second, Transvaal Agricultural Union Chairman Dries Bruwer, who is also a Conservative Party [CP] MP said the farmers and the ANC had almost reached agreement on a homeland." "The right-wingers are in fact following in the steps of the National Party [NP]. The NP's first meetings with the ANC were also initially through moderates like Mr. Thabo Mbeki, but eventually they met face to face with the Joe Slovos and Joe Modises, and thus began the negotiations. So now it is only the Afrikaner Resistance Movement, and those to the right of them, who refuse to talk with the ANC. But then the resistance movement have always been a moth eaten lot." "Once the various forces in the country identify, recognize and respect one another, negotiations begin to take on a live-and-let-live approach. That is what happened to the NP, and what is now happening to the CP and the right-wing agricultural unions." Kuhn concludes: "If the right wing could drop their racism, prejudices, and fears like the NP did, they could become part of a larger group of participants sharing the same principles. By becoming a full part of the negotiations and election process, they could, with credibility, legitimacy, as well as a larger platform, begin to promote the cause of an Afrikaner homeland." Right Wing Wants War, Not Settlement--An editorial on page 8 of Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 31 January notes that: "While South Africa is involved in a heated election campaign, it is also in the midst of a potential war situation. The latter was confirmed by the obstinacy of the right-wingers who gathered in Pretoria at the weekend to establish a `transitional assembly' and a `transitional parliament.' A large part of the `assembly' viewed continued negotiations as treason. In the process General Constand Viljoen was humiliated, and lumped together with the National Party which opted for the path of negotiation. Yesterday's hero can quickly become today's political traitor in a movement which treats issues so emotionally. It is difficult to see how Gen. Viljoen can continue his prominent role within the Afrikaner National Front. He, the militarist, suffered strategic defeat at the hands of politicians and their followers." BEELD continues: "We have long felt that the foremost political leaders on the right are not interested in a settlement, only in war. They viewed Gen. Viljoen as a vehicle, and when it seemed he would not storm blindly ahead, he had to be sacrificed in public."
