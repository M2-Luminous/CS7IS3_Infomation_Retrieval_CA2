Delegations from the three countries, which in March proposed sending observers under a so-called Temporary International Presence in Hebron [TIPH], are continuing preparations to send 90 Norwegians, 35 Danes and 35 Italians in the Israeli-occupied city where tensions have been escalating ever since a Jewish settler opened fire on dozens of Palestinians as they prayed in the Hebron mosque on February 25. The diplomats told ANSA that the two high-ranking Carabinieri police officers and Rome Foreign Ministry officials who visited Hebron on April 11 have been shuttling between the Palestinian city, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem with their counterparts from Norway and Denmark in an effort to resolve a series of practical problems, such as deciding where the observers will reside. The TIPH members will be carrying only light weapons for self-defense and hope to ease tensions between Israeli settlers and the armed forces and local residents. A memorandum officially getting the mission under way should be signed in Copenhagen some time at the end of next week and unless new obstacles are raised, deployment may begin as early as the end of the month, the diplomats said.
