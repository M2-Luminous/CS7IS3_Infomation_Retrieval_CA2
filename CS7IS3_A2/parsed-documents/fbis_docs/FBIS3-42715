In particular, in answering the question as to what he thinks about the recent elimination of the State National Security Administration of Armenia and fundamental reorganization of the special services, Vano Siragedyan said that overall this is a positive development and emphasized that as a result of such a reorganization perhaps a serious investigation will be opened into the case of the murder last year of the former chairman of the Armenian KGB, General Marius Yuzbashyan, and of a number of crimes committed in similar style. Vano Siragedyan did not rule out that General Yuzbashyan had been eliminated by specialists of the former USSR KGB, since this crime was organized very professionally. For instance, the general was killed with one shot, but several spent cartridges were left at the scene of the crime in order to confuse the real picture of the crime. According to Siragedyan, Yuzbashyan knew quite a bit about the period when the processes that eventually led to the current situation around Nagorno-Karabakh were still at the inception stage. He knew who was acting and how, and for this reason alone could become an undesirable and stand in the way of certain forces in Moscow. In addition, the Armenian minister of internal affairs dwelled on the accusations leveled against him by a well-known Moscow businessman, Serzh Dzhilavyan. Let us recall that Dzhilavyan recently accused Vano Siragedyan of allegedly wanting to organize his assassination. Siragedyan, in turn, remarked that he has no intention of responding to such accusations, because doing so would mean making a sort of political figure out of a complete nonentity, which is what, in the minister's opinion, the Moscow businessman is. At the same time, Siragedyan said: "By making these sort of statements and accusations the Moscow businessman has committed a very serious mistake. Sooner or later he will be killed, either by creditors or by mafiosi which make up this man's circle. Nobody in Russia, however, will look for them or investigate the matter," said the minister, "because Dzhilavyan himself has already pointed in the direction of the so-called Armenian trail. After that, it is unlikely that anybody would seriously look into his case when Dzhilavyan is indeed killed by mafiosi."
