The question arises following his remarks yesterday when he seemed to be saying that the breakdown of Sino-British talks on political reform did not mean a termination of discussion on economic matters. We would be churlish not to acknowledge the minister's statement because, when the talks finally collapsed, EASTERN EXPRESS was of the view that China had a historic opportunity to seize victory from the jaws of defeat by publicly stating that a lack of progress on the political front did not have to mean the end of cooperation on economic matters. The only reason we are guarded in offering a welcome to Qian's statement is that Chinese officials are forever issuing contradictory statements. One minute there are dire warnings of the impact on economic matters should Britain and China fail to resolve political matters. Then, but less often, come statements, like that issued yesterday, which present a very different view. If we were totally cynical, we would say that the hard and soft approach is a matter of deliberate policy, designed to keep Britain and Hong Kong people guessing about China's real intentions. We suspect that this is not the case. It is far more likely that the discrepancies in these statements reflect the lack of coordination among China's Hong Kong policy makers. Indeed, all current policymaking in China is rather confused, as the vultures gather in anticipation of the demise of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. No one wants to stick their neck out too far, no one is confident enough to take the initiative for a new policy, and no one wants to be seen taking a line which contradicts, or even appears to contradict, the Gospel according to Deng. All this notwithstanding it is easy to see how China's best interests are served by furthering economic cooperation. Britain will be long gone by the time the benefits of major projects such as the airport are realised. Yet we should never underestimate the extent to which political considerations can override logical thinking, especially when it comes to China's policy towards Hong Kong. The baggage of history weighs heavy. The humiliation of losing a part of the motherland and, worse still, failing to recover it, festers. Any suggestion that China should have something less than full sovereignty over its restored domain is met with an aggrieved response. In reality China's sovereign rights are not in question. Nor is anyone seriously arguing that the Chinese Government does not have the right to bring Hong Kong back to the fold. It is the process by which the return to Chinese rule is achieved which is causing the problems. Whatever the disagreements between China and Britain, and the perhaps more profound differences between many Hong Kong people and the Chinese Government, there is no reason to leave the future of the territory in a state of suspension. It is downright irresponsible to play cat and mouse with issues of economic confidence. China says it is forced into this posture by Britain. Maybe so, but even if this is the case, why do China's leaders feel obliged to behave in precisely the manner in which Britain is accused of behaving? If Qian Qichen's remarks represent a move towards a more consistent and constructive policy towards Hong Kong's economic affairs, they are to be welcomed with open arms. He is, after all, supposed to be supervising the work of the Preparatory Working Committee and his ministry has prime responsibility for dealing with Britain in negotiations over Hong Kong. Let us hope this moment of optimism is not a prelude to what that old Russian Communist V. I. Lenin used to describe as another round of two steps backwards and one step forwards.
