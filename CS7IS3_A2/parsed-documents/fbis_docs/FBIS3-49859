A letter from Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to the Security Council obtained by AFP said he had ordered his special envoy Yasushi Akashi to draft contingency plans for the besieged cities of Tuzla and Srebrenica. "It was clear that other military assets would also be required, as the use of air power, or the threat of its use, could not alone achieve the desired objectives," Butrus-Ghali said in the letter. "I have instructed Mr. Akashi to prepare forthwith detailed plans for military operations, with the use of air power as required" to reopen the airport in Tuzla and ensure a Canadian troop contingent in Srebrenica can be relieved. However in the same letter, Butrus-Ghali said he had received a letter from Russia which repeated its position that no military action be taken in the former Yugoslavia without consultations with the Security Council. Russia as a permenant member of the Security Council has the right of veto. Akashi said in a report to the secretary general that use of air power -- as suggested at last week's NATO conference -- would be inadequate if not accompanied by a stronger presence on the ground. UN officials in Geneva said the Bosnian Serbs had already agreed to the replacement of some 180 Canadian troops stranded for six months in Srebrenica, making military action unnecessary. Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, quoted by the Yugoslav TANJUG news agency, said his self-styled parliament had decided the Dutch could take the Canadians' place "as of tomorrow" provided they were "the same number and with the same weapons." But Therese Gastaut, spokeswoman for Butrus-Ghali, said the rotation would not take place before the second half of February. There was no immediate explanation for the delay. In refusing to allow the reopening of Tuzla Airport, closed since May 1992 by Serb shelling from the surrounding hills, Karadzic said the facility "would only be used to rearm the Moslems." Karadzic said all of Bosnia's airports should be reopened "but in no case before signing a peace treaty."
