Our correspondent Haluk Koc reports from Switzerland that Demirel, who is there to attend the World Economic Forum meeting, held a news conference last night. Demirel pointed out that the Turkish economy is a growing, developing, and productive one and that the state's current problems are the result of borrowing. He stated that the extraordinary situation observed in the money market recently is the result of a failure to establish a good balance between the rate of exchange, rate of interest, and inflation. The president stressed that these developments are temporary, but should not be taken lightly. He said: When you are in such a crisis or extraordinary situation, it is not only logic that is at work; psychological factors are also extremely important. It is important to have an atmosphere of trust. Those who take measures will create an atmosphere of trust. They will deal with the developments vigorously. If there is anything that has not been done, they will do it. This is a war. Demirel pointed out that Turkey has difficulties in promoting itself in the world. Certain countries, he said, still fail to see the struggle Turkey is waging against a murderous gang. The president said that Western countries recently began to support the struggle being waged against terrorism. He added, however, that the developed world took a stand against terrorism in order to protect its own interests and not to support Turkey. One reason is that terrorism disrupts public order in those countries. The second reason is the drug traffic that is involved in financing terrorism. These countries realize that if they do not take a stand against terrorism, their people will continue to be poisoned. These are the reasons why these countries took the steps they did against the terrorist organization, Demirel added. The president pointed out that the chilly relations between Ankara and Bern can be improved through dialogue and that there should not be any ill-feeling between states. Demirel also received the members of the coordination council of the Turkish Federations. He was briefed on the problems of Turks living in Switzerland. He said that the 12 million Turks living in Europe constitute a bridge between Turkey and Europe and that the problems they face should not daunt them.
