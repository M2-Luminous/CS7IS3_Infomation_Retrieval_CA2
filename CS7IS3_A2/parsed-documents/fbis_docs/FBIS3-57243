Kyrgyzstan "sees no imperial ambitions in Russian actions and does not feel any pressure from Moscow", he told a press conference after meeting Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev on Tuesday and added that he intends to use every effort to strengthen the provisions fixed in the Russian-Kyrgyz friendship treaty. Akayev also stressed that he would do everything possible so that nealy a million of Russian ethnics living in Kyrgyzstan "do not feel any inconveniences" and that the Central Asian republic "remains good motherland for all citizens of the country, including Russians". Kozyrev, in his turn, said the Russian leadership supports democratic Kyrgyzstan and will render any necessary assistance to President Akayev. The minister added that the protection of the rights of Russians in CIS countries has nothing in common with imperial ambitions. Human rights protection has nothing in common with "imperial policy as Russia respected and respects sovereign rights of its equal partners", Kozyrev said. He handed over to Akayev a message from Boris Yeltsin in which the Russian president pledged support to market reforms and democratic transformations of Kyrgyz authorities. Akayev and Kozyrev signed a consular convention and a protocol on the exchange of ratification credentials to the treaty "on legal assistance and legal relations in civil, family and criminal cases". Kozyrev, who is accompanied by Deputy Defence Minister Boris Gromov, left for the city of Blagoveshchensk on the border with China from where he will proceed for a visit to the neighbouring country.
