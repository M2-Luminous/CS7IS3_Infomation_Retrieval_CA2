The author of the commentary says: The refueling is an inevitable consequence of the breakup of the DPRK-U.S. talks by the United States and nobody can decry it in view of technical safety. Our starting of the replacement of fuel rods in the absence of inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] is entirely an inevitable result of the unreasonable acts of the United States and the IAEA Secretariat. Declaring that the United States and the Secretariat of the agency have no justification to decry our refueling, the analyst further says: The Secretariat of the agency, before slandering us, must reflect on its acts in avoiding its obligation to guarantee the normal nuclear activities of the member nation. It is an unavoidable duty of the agency to come to the spot, verify things and take necessary measures when an abnormal situation is created in the nuclear activities of a member nation. Though we requested the agency to immediately take appropriate measures including a quick removal of the seal under unavoidable circumstances, the Secretariat of the agency avoided presence in the replacement of fuel rods for the reason that we refused to meet their unilateral demand for being allowed to choose and keep some of the replaced fuel rods. And it is now raising quite a row, informing the member nations of the Board of Governors of the agency and the United Nations Security Council that we unsealed the facilities and violated the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. This is obviously a mean, conscienceless act unbecoming to an international organization. The U.S. act is none the better. If the United States had responded to the talks with the DPRK and brought a package deal to a success as demanded by the DPRK, such complicated problems would have not been raised. But the United States avoided the third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks, ignoring our proposals and persisting in unreasonable preconditions. And now it is making a case of our replacement of fuel rods. This reminds us of a thief turning on the master with a club. Some quarters of the United States are now spreading the rumor that we are replacing fuel rods to extract plutonium enough for the manufacture of four or five nuclear bombs. It is ridiculous, indeed. Though we have started the replacement of fuel rods without the presence of the agency under unavoidable circumstances, this work is now going on under the strict observation of the inspection cameras installed by the agency and as soon as fuel rods are taken out, they are kept under the containment and surveillance devices of the agency. We are replacing fuel rods in such a manner as to fully preserve the possibilities of measuring all the replaced fuel rods when the nuclear issue is resolved in a package deal and the partiality of the agency removed. This matter can be solved through negotiations between the DPRK and the IAEA. Nevertheless, some forces of the United States are now linking the refueling in a far-fetched way with "nuclear arms development." This is a despicable trick to find a pretext for "sanctions" against the DPRK by intentionally rendering the situation strained. An attempt to justify one's unreasonable logic with speculation and supposition does not work now. The nuclear issue, too, requires a fair solution based on a proper judgement of the reality. The United States and the Secretariat of the agency must no longer make mistakes in the solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula but take a proper position for honestly solving the issue.
