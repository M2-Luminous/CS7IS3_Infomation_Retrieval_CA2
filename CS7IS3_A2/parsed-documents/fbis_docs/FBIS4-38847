Since this country imposed the visa regime, the St. Petersburg-Lvov train, which transits Lithuania, has been empty in both directions. The Ukrainian Administration of Railroads asked the October Railroad to resolve with the Republic of Lithuania the question of repealing the transit visa requirement. There is a precedent: Passengers on the St. Petersburg-Kaliningrad train do not need such visas. The management of the Ukrainian Administration of Railroads suggested that the October Railroad stop selling tickets for this train until the problem with Lithuania is settled.
