Deng said that it was mainly the leadership exercised and the part played by the collective comprising the party Central Committee, the Standing Committee, and the Political Bureau that made possible the rapid economic growth of the last two years (1992 and 1993). My opinions, including my office's opinions, are for reference of the central authorities and the departments concerned only, he said, adding that while those opinions which are correct, reasonable, and positive could be seen as good suggestions, those which are not on the right track, do not fit in with China's actual conditions, and are unpracticable, should be shelved, and those which are incorrect should be criticized. He told them not to treat his opinions as directives. Only the resolutions adopted by the central authorities can be regarded as directives, he said. "I am a member of the party, so I must unconditionally submit myself to the party central committee in words and deeds," he stated. Deng Hopes Veteran Cadres Will Continue to Display Party Spirit Deng continued: "I consider it important for a party member, especially leading party and government leaders, to display party spirit and observe party discipline. If local party and government leaders are not pure in party spirit and not strict in discipline, they can achieve nothing even if the line and policies are correct. This is a common occurrence, so it is necessary to guard against it. When meeting with a number of veteran cadres in Shanghai in early February, Deng said: "We have gone into retirement now, but we must not indulge in seeking ease and comfort. We should do something solid for the party including propagating its policies. We must not go too far in our words and deeds and must see to it that our family members and relatives behave well, because this is what the party expects of its members. We must not earn extra money by obtaining nominal positions or titles everywhere and attending ceremonies. The present party leadership holds us in high esteem simply because we have made contributions in the past. We must treasure our past and all the more respect and support the incumbent leadership. I hope you will set strict demands on yourselves, conduct yourselves with dignity, and continue displaying party spirit. Macrocontrol Is Not an Expedient Measure When speaking about central macrocontrol in Shanghai, Deng said: "Strengthening central macrocontrol is a long-term policy adopted by the central authorities. It is not a personal decision, nor an expedient measure. Some local cadres thought themselves clever in claiming that it is an expedient policy. This shows they are not pure in party spirit and lack a sense of organization and discipline. In this way they tend to make big mistakes. The central authorities should criticize such cadres. They should dismiss and punish those cadres who incur losses producing great undesirable impact, because such cadres must not sit on the leading body any more. If they violate the law, they must be punished according to law. Otherwise, the central policies and decisions will not be implemented in full and the authority of the central authorities will suffer.
