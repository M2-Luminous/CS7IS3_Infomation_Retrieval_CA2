Sergey Sidorenko, chief of the regional administration for combating organized crime, pointed out that when business and private entrepreneurship reemerged in Russia in the mid-1980's, structures feeding on it began to grow and develop; as a result, extortion, debt repayment "enforcement," kidnapping, and contract murders have become ordinary events. Sergey Sidorenko noted that currently only state law enforcement organs can realistically help entrepreneurs. According to the data he quoted, of 120 private security companies registered in Petersburg, about 40 live by openly criminal notions. Organized crime structures also are attempting to penetrate banks with the purpose of using them for their needs. Sergey Sidorenko told the journalists the names of four Petersburg banks in which, in his opinion, the possibility of the presence of organized crime structures is absolutely precluded. They are: Promstroybank [State Bank for Industrial Development], Sberbank [State Savings Bank], Sankt Peterburg bank, and Petrovskiy bank. Foreign entrepreneurs also encounter Russian bandits in Petersburg. About 20 percent of all joint companies and Western enterprises actively cooperate with our mafia. For instance, some Finnish enterprises pay bandits 100,000 Finnish markka a month. The only advice he could give to entrepreneurs in the current situation is not to be afraid to turn to law enforcement organs for help, because even setting up their own security services does not solve the problem for businessmen and entrepreneurs. Only the militia can realistically help them.
