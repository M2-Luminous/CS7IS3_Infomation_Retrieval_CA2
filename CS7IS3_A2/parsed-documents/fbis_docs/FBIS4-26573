Since the two sides signed a memorandum of understanding on the protection of trade in strategic commodities -- such as computers that can be used for military purposes -- and technical data in 1990, they have held regular meetings. The ROC, in the spirit of the memorandum, has mapped out regulations governing the export and import of high-tech products. One of these requirements is that domestic manufacturers must receive approval from the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) before importing such products. A BOFT official said that the idea of controlling hi-tech products first came from the international Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Control, whose original aim was to keep high-tech products from falling into the hands of communist countries. With the collapse of communism, however, its focus has shifted to keeping such products out of the hands of terrorists. The official said that the government is now preparing a list of high-tech products subject to export control, and it is expected that certain information and machinery products would be affected.
