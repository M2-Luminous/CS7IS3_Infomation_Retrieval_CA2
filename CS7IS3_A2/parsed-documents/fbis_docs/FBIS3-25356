Our colleague, Braimah Camara, who is back from town after an on-the-spot assessment, reports. [Camara] High school and university students have indeed ransacked some areas of the capital. Groups of students attacked basic education Minister Adama Samassekou's residence and the external wall was partially broken down. In Lafiabougou, the residence of our colleague Daouda Tekete, technical adviser to the basic education minister, was completely ransacked and burned down together with the furniture and equipment inside it. Still in Lafiabougou, Mrs. Tekete's private clinic was ransacked. The villa where the clinic is located was seriously damaged and working instruments carried away. Tension was very high this morning at the ADEMA [Alliance for Democracy in Mali] headquarters in Bamako III. Here ADEMA youth met spontaneously at the party headquarters and some articles were broken. The ECHO newspaper building was visited by a handful of students who were forced to give up in the face of the workers' determination to preserve their equipment. According to evidence we managed to gather there, some students tried again to attack the Cheick Anta Diop High School owned by Professor Cheikna Modi Cissoko and here they ran into a contingent of security forces. This is what we were able to observe this morning in the capital.
