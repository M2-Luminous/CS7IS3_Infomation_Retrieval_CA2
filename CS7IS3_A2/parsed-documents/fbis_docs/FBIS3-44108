The Federal Parliament met in Berlin on 20 January and approved a proposal by the United Greens Party 90 requesting political asylum for slightly more than 600 Angolan citizens who had sought refuge in the FRG. Only a few days ago, it looked unlikely that they would obtain such permission because of differences among the country's authorities. The stance adopted by the Federal Parliament in Berlin has done much to resolve the problems of Angolan refugees in that country. It comes in the wake of a tug of war between the senator for home affairs in Berlin and (?15) Angolans who had sought refuge with Catholic and Protestant churches. Human rights organizations across the world have praised the stand adopted by the Federal Parliament in Berlin, adding that it has greatly lessened the dangers faced by those Angolans because of the Luanda regime's policy of tribal genocide and extermination of all people who do not fall in with its political views.
