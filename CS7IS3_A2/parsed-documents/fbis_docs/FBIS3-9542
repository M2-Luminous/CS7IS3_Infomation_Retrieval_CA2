Union officials who signed the agreement last month say they have little faith in its idealistic tenets and can no longer trust a government that continues to deceive them. "The social tension is going to grow, and we won't be able to stop the strikes. That's what we're warning the government," said Jifi Tejkal, vice president of the Czech-Moravian Chamber of Trade Unions, which represents 3.5 million workers at 40 unions throughout the country. Meanwhile, business representatives say the deal fails to address the issues of most importance: wages and productivity. The general agreement "means nothing," said Jaroslav Hosek, personnel and administration manager at the Prague-based heating supply company Prazska Teplarenska. He said the negotiators "wasted their time." And the government, which acted as the honest broker during the negotiations leading up to the agreement, would prefer to walk away from any lingering disputes. "If they have some objections about something they signed, it's their bloody problem," said Otakar Veverka, spokesman for the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs. The general agreement, which was first drawn up in 1991 and has been amended every year since, aims to preserve social peace in the period of transition from a state-controlled economy to a market system. The agreement specifies obligations regarding collective bargaining, employment, wages, and social and legal security. The conditions are binding on all levels. Representatives from unions, the Ministries of Finance, Labor and Economy and the Union of Employers, a 55-member organization that represents the management interests of the country's largest employers, all take an active role in forming a new agreement each year. After two months of negotiations, consensus on this year's agreement was finally reached and the deal was signed Jan. 21. But labor, which had talked about rejecting the agreement for a month, supported it by the narrowest possible margin: 16 to 14. Tejkal voted against the agreement after deciding there was nothing concrete backing it up. "The general agreement is less binding now than it was in 1992 or 1993," he said. Labor does appear to be losing ground. Last year the agreement promised a "real increase in nominal wages...in comparison with the same period last year." But in this year's agreement, the clause simply says that management and labor will find a mutually acceptable wage-settlement without "unreasonable pressures on wages." Worse still, Tejkal believes the government bargains in bad faith. After agreeing to wage increases last year, the government overruled the general agreement by passing separate wage-control legislation, he said. "If we cannot force [the government] to follow these articles, we cannot force them to do anything," he said. In addition, the government is considering legislation that will ban civil servants from organizing unions and restructuring pension laws to drastically reduce benefits. "I'm very critical of what's happening to our rights," he said. "It's a very sad thing to realize we are fighting the same battles that our grandfathers fought 100 years ago." Jan Uhlif, president of Kovo, the 800,000-member metal workers' federation--who voted for the agreement--conceded that he also has qualms about it. "We don't trust the government too much. But we admit it is also bad to close the door. It's best to push the partners to be more serious," he said, adding that he's "not the type to stand on the barricades." Business representatives appear to be less concerned. Hosek said he isn't considering the general agreement during ongoing collective bargaining with the two unions that represent Prazska Teplarenska's 2,200 employees. The unions are pushing for a shorter work-week and a 25-percent wage increase. "It's unacceptable to our company because we're regulated by the state," Hosek said, referring to last year's wage-control legislation. "If there was only the collective agreement, I wouldn't be against it. I don't like the goals of the general agreement. It's like central planning by the state." Milan Smutny, a spokesman for automaker Skoda, supports the general agreement's social aims but adds that, in the future, more emphasis should be placed on productivity. "If you see [the 1993 statistics for Czech industry], salaries went up but productivity went down," he said. Many companies continue to give unions everything they want, he said. "It is economic nonsense leading to loans for salaries and wages." Officials within the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs respond that management and labor's complaints regarding the agreement amount simply to political posturing. The government had no choice but to impose wage controls last year because wages were simply rising too quickly, said Pavel Michal, head of the ministry's collective-bargaining services. Ministry spokesman Veverka said, "The government had to allow itself an avenue out in case wages continued to rise this year." Michal and Veverka scoffed at labor's claims that the government had acted in bad faith. The government would always be a strong social partner interested in keeping the peace, Michal said. But both officials said that the government's role in negotiations may change drastically soon. "In the future, [the general agreement] should be a creation of social partners alone. It doesn't mean, of course, that the government won't be listening," Michal said. Michal added that some unionists are complaining about change because they miss the luxuries they enjoyed under communism. "Of course, they want to have it back. The person who wants a return to the old system--I feel sorry for him." George Kopejtko, head of the ministry's territorial section, added, "We can only hope there won't be too many [unions] around"--a comment that could help explain some of labor's fears about the conservative Klaus government.
