The sources said that next week Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata will announce the government's intention on bilateral assistance to Macedonia, along with additional medical and food assistance through United Nations organizations. They said the government will dispatch a five-to-six member survey mission to Macedonia in the spring to study what kind of technical assistance Japan should render. Japan will send experts on business management and revitalization of small and medium-sized enterprises to Macedonia and receive two or three Macedonian Government officials in Tokyo, they said. The sources said the government will also continue studying whether to contribute personnel to the former Yugoslavia under the country's law on cooperation with UN peacekeeping operations. Shunji Yanai, a senior Foreign Ministry official and head of a Japanese survey team that recently visited the region to look into the matter, told a press conference last week that Macedonia asked for economic assistance and cooperation to solve its debt problem. Macedonia, which is the poorest and the most economically troubled of the former Yugoslav states, is presently untouched by the conflict that has spread through the region.
