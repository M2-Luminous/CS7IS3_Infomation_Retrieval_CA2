FBIS3-52535 "drnes004dd_94010" FBIS-NES-94-004 Document Type:Daily Report 6 Jan 1994 Palestinian Affairs PLO Leadership Accepts `Some Demands' of Palestinians NC0501164994 Paris AFP in English 1623 GMT 5 Jan 94 NC0501164994 Paris AFP Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Tunis, Jan 5 (AFP)--The PLO executive committee has accepted some of the demands put forward by a delegation of leading Palestinians towards making the organisation more democratic, Palestinian sources here said Wednesday [5 January]. Delegation head Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi has been given full powers to organize a broad dialogue grouping all factions with the aim of uniting the Palestinians, the sources said. 'Abd-al-Shafi, who led bilateral negotiations with Israel before the signing in September of an autonomy accord by the PLO and the Jewish state, has headed the seven-member delegation holding talks with PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat and close associates here since Sunday. The delegation called for the adoption of nine points included in a memorandum signed by 120 prominent Palestinian personalities from the occupied territories and the diaspora last month. The memorandum calls for more democracy in running PLO affairs and demands a change in the conduct of negotiations with Israel over limited autonomy in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho. 'Arafat, who has been accused of being autocratic, is yet to comment on the proposals. The Palestinian source said two of the demands presented to 'Arafat and the executive committee have been rejected, while all the others were likely to be adopted by the organisation. These two were the proposal to create a high consultative committee of experts with a parallel status to that of the executive committee and the call for forming a supreme authority to guide, direct and follow up the autonomy negotiations with Israel. Nabil 'Amr, an adviser of the PLO leader, said Tuesday he expected some opposition to the proposal calling for the creation of a consultative standing committee made up of experts that would have similar authority to that of the executive committee. The question is not in the abundance of new structures, a participant in the executive committee meetings told AFP Wednesday. "Our aim is to democratise and to make those already existing more efficient and productive," he said. According to executive committee member 'Ali Ishaq, the body chaired by 'Arafat has approved the reactivation of the PLO Council of Planning which has been crippled for some time by a financial crisis hitting the organisation since the end of the 1991 Gulf War. Officials close to the PLO leader doubt that any result would come out from the democracy debate as they consider the move itself a struggle for power only, rather than a call for real sharing in the decision-making process.
