The group--which includes 120 members of the PLO, the Fatah Movement's Revolutionary Council, and the Palestine National Council--has demanded the rejection of the suspicious calls to change the venue of the negotiations or to resume them before the settlements are removed. This is said in a statement issued and signed by this group, a copy of which was sent to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat. Zuhdi al-Tarazi, the Palestinian president's adviser; Abu-Ja'far, director of the PLO's Political Department; and a number of Palestinian writers and journalists were among the signatories. The statement denounces the massacre and says that the Israeli enemy, which is backed by world imperialism under U.S. leadership, will not be satisfied with anything less than the liquidation of the innocent owners of the land and the seizure of their lands and possessions. The statement adds that Israel's involvement in reconciliation and negotiations is merely a maneuver to give them a better chance to minimize their losses and avoid blame.
