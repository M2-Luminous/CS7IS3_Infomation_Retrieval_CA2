Former Prime Minister Marc Bazin has chosen the U.S. newspaper THE MIAMI HERALD to voice his support for holding such a national conference. The idea of a national conference is nothing new. It has already been conducted in many countries, and the results are positive,, writes the leader for the Movement For the Establishment of Democracy, Marc Bazin. He states in his article that there is no other peaceful and reasonable alternative than the national conference. The return to guerrilla techniques would be devastating and would only facilitate the return to dictatorship. On the other hand, to use and manipulate the tragedy of the boat people in order to take power would be completely inexcusable, inhumane and reprehensible. We are quoting some excerpts from Marc Bazin's article in THE MIAMI HERALD of 16 January. The former prime minister concludes, quote: A national conference should be, above all, an invitation to a realistic, fair and practical compromise, unquote.
