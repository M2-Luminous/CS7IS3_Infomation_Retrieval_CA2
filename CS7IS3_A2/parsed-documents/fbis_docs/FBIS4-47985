One couldn't have asked for a more perfect day to welcome the international guests to sunny South Africa. Several dignitaries have arrived already but the man everybody was waiting for has finally arrived, the leader of the Palestinian Liberation Organization, Mr. Yasir 'Arafat. Mr. Yasir 'Arafat caught us from behind -- he sneaked up from behind. Cameras were ready and we caught him for his first address on South African soil. ['Arafat] Good morning. I am very happy to have...to be here this morning on this historical...[pause] events -- historical day, and I am very happy also that I will be able to convey to His Excellency, my brother, my friend, President Mandela, all the greetings and good wishes from our people, from the Palestinian people, from all his old friends and the PLO, and I also would like to convey to his deputy, Mr. de Klerk, best wishes and best regards. [Roux] Mr. 'Arafat apparently organized eight of his own cars and own drivers to transport his delegation. Mr. 'Arafat is definitely a highlight of the arrivals today, but several other very interesting and very exciting dignitaries arrived, among them Mrs. Benazir Bhutto, the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Mr. Douglas Hurd of the United Kingdom, and the former president of Tanzania, Mr. Julius Nyerere. We caught up with them earlier this morning. [Bhutto] Hello international press. How are you. I'm supposed to say hello to you, I'm told. OK, alright. It's a wonderful moment, not just for South Africa but for the whole world, and I'm here on behalf of Pakistan to show that we all join in this moment of victory, victory for mankind. [Hurd] What can I say. It's a huge...a huge event, a huge pleasure to be here, and to congratulate on everything that has been achieved and to just give our support, promise our support for what has to be achieved in the future. [Unidentified speaker] The former president of Tanzania. [Unidentified correspondent] Can we have a statement? [Nyerere] Well, what statement. I'm glad to be here. I certainly wanted to come to a free South Africa. I never believed it was going to come in my lifetime, but here it is. Thank you. [Roux] Well it's definitely a very exciting day here at Jan Smuts Airport. We are now awaiting the arrival of Mr. Fidel Castro, from Cuba. As soon as we have him we'll bring that to you, otherwise the next arrival is the first lady of America, Mrs. Hillary Clinton, together with Vice President Al Gore. And with that, back to the studio.
