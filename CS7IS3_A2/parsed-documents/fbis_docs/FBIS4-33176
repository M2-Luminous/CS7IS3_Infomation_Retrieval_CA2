Preliminary data shows that 8,700 caballerias have been planted; this represents a lag of over 5,000 caballerias, according to May projections. The excessive, continuous rains in the eastern provinces and the ensuing floods are among the causes for the delay. We must keep in mind that the sugarcane planting program is of national significance in Camaguey, Holguin, Las Tunas, Granma, and Santiago de Cuba Provinces. It is expected that the lost time will be recovered in June through tremendous planting efforts. Everything will mainly depend, however, upon the amount of land prepared to receive the seed.
