The proposals arose out of two days of discussions between a South African Government delegation and emissaries from King Goodwill Zwelithini and a delegation from the IFP. A statement issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs late on Thursday night said "he (Mr Buthelezi) said he was in favour of further urgent talks on the aforesaid proposals". Ministry spokesman Niel du Bois said Mr Buthelezi's acceptance of the proposals as a basis for further urgent discussions on the issue was a "breakthrough" which "laid the foundation for further urgent talks which could open the door for the participation of the IFP in the election". The constitutional talks ended provisionally on Thursday afternoon at an undisclosed venue outside Cape Town to allow the parties to report back to their principals. Minister of Home Affairs Danie Schutte, who also headed the government delegation at the talks, said he had spoken to Mr Buthelezi late on Thursday night when the kwaZulu chief minister had said he was indeed in favour of further urgent talks on the aforesaid proposals. The proposals which resulted from the two-day meeting between the government, the emmissaries and the IFP were put to King Goodwill and Mr Buthelezi who faxed his reply to Mr Schutte late on Thursday night. Mr du Bois said in a statement that further talks on the position of the king in a future dispensation as well related matters would have to take place on Friday, February 25, "before the finalisation of amendments to the constitution by the joint committee of Parliament on constitutional matters which sits today (Friday)." Mr du Bois told SAPA plans were being devised to see "how it can be practically possible to get the negotiators together" to further discuss the issues. The discussions between the government, emmissaries from King Goodwill and the IFP delegation were the result of a meeting between the king and State President F. W. de Klerk in Pretoria on Tuesday.
