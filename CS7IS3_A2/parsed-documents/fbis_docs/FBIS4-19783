Our correspondent in Washington Mirella Kalostipi reported that the two leaders will discuss the situation in the Balkans, the problem between Athens and Skopje, the Bosnian crisis, the Cyprus issue, the tension in Greek-Turkish and Greek-Albanian relations and also the further improvement of relations between Greece and United States. It should be noted that while addressing Prime Minister Papandreou last night at the reception in his honor, the U.S. President appeared particularly warm toward Greece and Papandreou, and expressed the certainty that their talks would be successful.
