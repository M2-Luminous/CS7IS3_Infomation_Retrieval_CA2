Mr. Chavarria revealed some very important things. Breathing oxygen from two cylinders next to his bed, he said: As Jaime Paz Zamora's stalwart and loyal man, I cooperated with the political campaign of the Movement of the Revolutionary Left, MIR, in 1989, and I also helped guarantee Paz Zamora's physical safety. He meant that he was a bodyguard. He stated that rumors that the MIR leadership had received money from drug trafficking are false. He reaffirmed that there is no link between the MIR and the money obtained from drug trafficking. He pointed out that he did not supply any money, but rather his small airplane, and the physical safety that is worth more than $100 million [sentence as heard]. He added: I protected a man who had been in a plane crash, and it was my job to help him arrive at his destination alive. He said: It is completely unfair to hold me in this prison. He pointed out that he was a victim of a political plot to harm important personalities. About a picture of Paz Zamora and Chavarria, known as the narcophoto, and which was published during the former Nationalist Revolutionary Movement's administration, Chavarria said: On that occasion I stood beside him to open the door of the plane. This is a long interview, of which only some of the most important points were excerpted. Chavarria insisted that he wants to confront Meco Dominguez to refute his charges, especially against the MIR leaders.
