FR940627-1-00014 FR940627-1-00009 Previous Federal Action Federal action on this species began as a result of section 12 of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq. ), which directed the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution to prepare a report on plants considered to be endangered, threatened, or extinct. This report, designated as House Document No. 94&hyph;51, was presented to Congress on January 9, 1975. On July 1, 1975, the Service published a notice in the Federal Register (40 FR 27823) accepting the report as a petition within the context of section 4(c)(2) (now section 4(b)(3)(A)) of the Act, and giving notice of its intention to review the status of the plant taxa named therein. In this and subsequent notices, D. undulata var. undulata was included as extinct, and D. undulata var. argutidenta was included as endangered. As a result of this review, on June 16, 1976, the Service published a proposed rule in the Federal Register (41 FR 24523) to determine approximately 1,700 vascular plant species, including D. undulata , endangered pursuant to section 4 of the Act. In 1978, amendments to the Act required that all proposals over 2 years old be withdrawn. A 1-year grace period was given to proposals already over 2 years old. On December 10, 1979, the Service published a notice in the Federal Register (44 FR 70796) of the withdrawal of that portion of the June 16, 1976, proposal that had not been made final, along with four other proposals that had expired. The Service published an updated Notice of Review for plants on December 15, 1980 (45 FR 82480), including D. undulata as a category 1 candidate, meaning that the Service had substantial information indicating that a listing proposal was appropriate. In the updated Notice of Review for plants on September 27, 1985 (50 FR 39525), and February 21, 1990 (55 FR 6183), D. undulata was included as a Category 1* candidate, meaning that the Service had substantial information indicating that this taxon was vulnerable in the recent past but may already have become extinct. Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the 1982 amendments to the Act, requires the Secretary to make findings on certain pending petitions within 12 months of their receipt. Section 2(b)(1) of the 1982 amendments further requires that all petitions pending on October 13, 1982, be treated as having been newly submitted on that date. The latter was the case for D. undulata because the Service had accepted the 1975 Smithsonian report as a petition. On October 13, 1983, the Service found that the listing of the species was warranted but precluded by other pending listing actions, in accordance with section 4(b)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act. Notification of this finding was published on January 20, 1984 (49 FR 2485). Such a finding requires the petition to be recycled, pursuant to section 4(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Act. The finding was reviewed in October of 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, and 1992. Publication of the present proposal constitutes the final 1-year finding. Summary of Factors Affecting the Species Section 4 of the Act and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act set forth the procedures for adding species to the Federal lists. A species may be determined to be an endangered or threatened species due to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to Delissea undulata Gaud. (No Common Name) are as follows: A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range The habitat of Delissea undulata has undergone extreme alteration because of past and present land management practices, including deliberate and accidental alien mammal and plant introductions and agricultural development. Natural disturbances such as the collapse of lava tubes also destroy habitat and can have a significant effect on small populations of plants. Competition with alien plants as well as destruction of individuals and modification of habitat by introduced animals are the primary threats facing this species. Beginning with Captain James Cook in 1792, early European explorers introduced livestock, which became feral, increased in number and range, and caused significant changes to the natural environment of Hawaii. The 1848 provision for land sales to individuals allowed large-scale agricultural and ranching ventures to begin. Land was cleared for these enterprises to such a great extent that climatic conditions began to change and the amount and distribution of rainfall were altered (Wenkam 1969). Past and present impacts of introduced alien animals are the primary factor in altering and degrading vegetation and habitats on the island of Hawaii as well as on Kauai and Maui, where populations of D. undulata previously existed. Feral ungulates trample and eat native vegetation and disturb open areas. This causes erosion and allows the invasion of alien plant species (Cuddihy and Stone, 1990, Wagner et al. 1990). Delissea undulata is threatened by habitat degradation resulting from introduced ungulates (e.g., cattle, goats, sheep, and pigs). Habitat degradation by these ungulates threatens the only known individual plant, any potential natural germination of seedlings, as well as potential suitable habitat occurring throughout the historic range of the species.
