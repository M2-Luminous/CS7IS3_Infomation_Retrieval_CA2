He grew up in this house as the son of a domestic worker and truck driver, herding cattle and walking 14 miles a day to and from his farm school. [Begin Lekota recording] Although, of course, as early as time, especially the late 50's, I began to notice the relations between black and white and the whippings that took place of farm workers -- and things like that began to make an impression me. [end recording] He was unable to finish his social science degree at the University of the North after being expelled for his involvement in the SRC [Students Representative Council]. At this stage Lekota was heavily influenced by his tutor, Steve Biko, and involved in the Black Consciousness Movement -- but meeting the then banned Beyers Naude left a great impression. [Begin Lekota recording] I was really moved by the fact that there was indeed a white man who was giving the rest of his life fighting this thing. He had become a reject among his people. It didn't change me immediately, but it was something that stayed with me. I faced tremendous problems the following years in terms of moving me from black consciousness to nonracial politics. [end recording] Although Terror was arrested under the Terrorism Act in 1974 and sentenced to 10 years on Robben Island, he valued his experience there. [Begin Lekota recording] One of the most important events for me was meeting the leadership of the ANC for the first time on Robben Island. I had come from a background in which their names had featured significantly but never really in a situatio in which one could learn intensively. [end recording] But there were bad times in Robben Island as well. [Begin Lekota recording] I think that is was the most difficult blow for me -- was when I lost my brother when I was in jail and I was unable to come out and come and bury him. I thought really at that time that I deserved to be released to bury him, I was only on trial after all. I was not a serving prisoner and also I must say that in 1975 I got married in Pretoria Prison. Again you know at that time I thought the state could have released me. [end recording] By the time Terror was released eight years later he was to play a prominent role in the UDF [United Democratic Front], leading towards his arrest and conviction in the Delmas Treason Trial. When the appeal court quashed all convictions he returned to work in t!?? UDF [United Democratic Front], and later the ANC. [Begin Lekota recording] Well, if it is not some physical exercise one way or the other, I love to play scrabble. I like to watch soccer, boxing, rugby, and more recently cricket. [end recording] Terror, who helped launch and rebuild the ANC in the Orange Free State, is the party's candidate for premier in that region.
