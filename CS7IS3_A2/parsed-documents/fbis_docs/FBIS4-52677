Minister Jie Qihua said in a speech to Buddhists here that China supports solution of the North Korean nuclear problem through inter-Korean dialogue and through talks between Pyongyang and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). "China supports South and North Korea and North Korea and the IAEA solving the nuclear problem patiently within the framework of bilateral dialogue," he said at a ceremony marking the second anniversary of the inauguration of the Buddhist Council for Peaceful Unification. "China will fulfill its constructive role for peaceful settlement of the nuclear problem," he said. However, he declined to comment on those North Koreans who have recently escaped from Siberian logging camps. "It is difficult for me to comment on the issue because it is related to the difficult situation of the North Korean authorities." Meanwhile, he emphasized that South Korea and China should further strengthen bilateral relations as partners in the Asia-Pacific era in the 21st century. "The two nations have rapidly developed their bilateral relations since they formed diplomatic ties on Aug. 24, 1992. But they still have to strengthen bilateral cooperation in many fields, including the economy," he added.
