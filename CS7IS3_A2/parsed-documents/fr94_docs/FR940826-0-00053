FR940826-0-00053 FR940826-0-00014 Sections 12.951 through 12.953 set forth the procedures for monitoring and reporting on the recipient's financial and program performance and the necessary standard reporting forms. They also set forth record retention requirements. ยง12.951 Monitoring and reporting program performance. (a) Recipients are responsible for managing and monitoring each project, program, subaward, function, or activity supported by the award. Recipients shall monitor subawards to ensure that subrecipients have met the audit requirements in Section 12.926. (b) The Federal awarding agency shall prescribe the frequency of submission for performance reports. Except as provided in ยง12.951(f), performance reports will not be required more frequently than quarterly or less frequently than annually. Annual reports shall be due 90 calendar days after the end of the grant year; quarterly or semi-annual reports shall be due 30 days after the end of the reporting period. The Federal awarding agency may require annual reports before the anniversary dates of multiple year awards in lieu of these requirements. Final performance reports are due 90 calendar days after the expiration or termination of the award. (c) A final technical or performance report shall be required after completion of the project only if the awarding agency determines this to be appropriate. (d) When required, performance reports shall generally contain, for each award, brief information on each of the following: (1) A comparison of actual accomplishments with the goals and objectives established for the period, the findings of the investigator, or both. Whenever appropriate and the output of programs or projects can be readily quantified, such quantitative data should be related to cost data for computation of unit costs. (2) Reasons why established goals were not met, if appropriate. (3) Other pertinent information including, when appropriate, analysis and explanation of cost overruns or high unit costs. (e) Recipients shall not be required to submit more than the original and two copies of performance reports. (f) Recipients shall immediately notify the Federal awarding agency of developments that have a significant impact on the award-supported activities. Also, notification shall be given in the case of problems, delays, or adverse conditions that materially impair the ability to meet the objectives of the award. This notification shall include a statement of the action taken or contemplated, and any assistance needed to resolve the situation. (g) Federal awarding agencies may make site visits, as needed. (h) Federal awarding agencies shall comply with clearance requirements of 5 CFR part 1320 when requesting performance data from recipients. ยง12.952 Financial reporting. (a) The following forms or such other forms as may be approved by OMB are authorized for obtaining financial information from recipients. (1) SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A, Financial Status Report. (i) Each Federal awarding agency will require recipients to use either the SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A to report the status of funds for all nonconstruction projects or programs. A Federal awarding agency may, however, have the option of not requiring the SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A when the SF&hyph;270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement, or SF&hyph;272, Report of Federal Cash Transactions, is determined to provide adequate information to meet its needs, except that a final SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A shall be required at the completion of the project when the SF&hyph;270 is used only for advances. (ii) The Federal awarding agency shall prescribe whether the report shall be on a cash or accrual basis. If the Federal awarding agency requires accrual information and the recipient's accounting records are not normally kept on an accrual basis, the recipient shall not be required to convert its accounting system, but shall develop accrual information through best estimates based upon an analysis of the documentation on hand. (iii) The Federal awarding agency shall determine the frequency of the Financial Status Report for each project or program, considering the size and complexity of the particular project or program. However, the report shall not be required more frequently than quarterly or less frequently than annually. A final report shall be required at the completion of the agreement.
