And not only is it profound blackmail, given the history of the European Union, it is also another demonstrative example of our European partners' one-sided and offensive attitude toward our country. With this decision, the EU Commission automatically becomes an untrustworthy mediator of the problem between Greece and Skopje. The EU Commission's decision is blackmail and a transgression against Greek feelings and every principle of international and EU law, because it does not recognize Greece's right to react with countermeasures to Skopje's intransigence, while Skopje continues falsifying history, using Greek historic symbols, and spreading offensive propaganda. The EU Commission's decision is blackmail and a provocation because on the one hand it refers Greece to the European Court of Justine with a seven-day deadline for lifting the embargo, and on the other hand it politely calls on Skopje to "reexamine its position on the issues regarding its constitution and flag within the framework of finding solutions to all issues, including the state's name." The EU Commission's decision is blackmail and a provocation for Greece because it encourages [FYROM President Kiro] Gligorov to continue his intransigent stance and not make any concessions. Greece has no reason to be afraid, and it will fight at the European Court for inalienable rights and its own rights. And it is a battle that Greece will win. However, beyond the legal and political issue, there is also a huge issue of EU solidarity, which in practice has been proven not to exist because it is superseded by various interests and ambitions.
