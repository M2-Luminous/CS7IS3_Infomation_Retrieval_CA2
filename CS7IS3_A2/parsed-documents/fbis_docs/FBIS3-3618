Ltd. Chu made the remarks upon returning from a visit to Tokyo Monday [21 March] to finalize plans for the Taiwan trade center. Chu said the trade center will be housed in a 3,600 square meter building located in downtown Tokyo and aims to gather the strength of Taiwan businessmen in Japan. The building was purchased last October by the Kuomintang Business Management Committee for US$113 million. Space in the building will be rented to Taiwan enterprises at lower than market prices, Chu explained. The center will replace the Far East Trade Center, which is the current meeting place for Taiwan businessmen in Japan but is too small, Chu added. So far, a group of Taiwan enterprises have rented offices in the nine-floor Taiwan Trade Center, including Kokuei, UMC, China Airlines, and Eva Airways.
