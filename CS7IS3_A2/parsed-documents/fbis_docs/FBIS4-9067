The massacre could be avoided and the local mix commission as well as the group of the Albanian and Serbian experts observed that the victims carried with themselves no weapon or any other defensive means. These very grave acts follow other earlier acts committed against Albanian citizens and run counter to the most elementary human norms included the respective international documents and acts. These crimes are part of constant provocations and brutal behaviour of the Serbian authorities against the Albanians in general and those who live in their own territories in Kosova and Montenegro. They intend to increase tension in the border between the two countries and in the Balkan region. We do not consider the latest event as a sporadic border incident, but a deliberate and coordinated act, taking into account the April 10, 1994 event in Peshkepi of Gjirokaster. These monstrous acts, in such coordination, aim at extending the flames of war in former Yugoslavia further in the south. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Albania energetically protested this tragic event through a note sent to the Embassy of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Serbia and Montenegro, in Tirana", the spokesman of the Albanian Foreign Ministry concludes.
