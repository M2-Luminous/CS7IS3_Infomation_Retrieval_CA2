He described the talks he had in Kazakhstan as fruitful and mutually useful not only for Kazakh-American relations, but for strengthening regional and international security, too. Gore said that the signing of a framework agreement on dismantling intercontinental ballistic missiles silo launchers in Kazakhstan proved the desire of both sides to develop mutually equitable relations. Moreover, an agreement was reached on bilateral cooperation in liquidating the consequences of accidents and establishing an intergovernmental communication line. It is worth noting that the Kazakh parliament ratified the nuclear weapons Non-Proliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear state on the day of the Kazakh-American negotiations. An important step was made towards expanding economic relations. For instance, the sides have signed a protocol on the exchange of ratification instruments of an agreement to encourage and mutually protect capital investments. An agreement on cooperation in science and technology was ratified for the time being. According to Gore, it will be signed during Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev's visit to the United States on February 14, 1994. The sides have discussed the possibility of cooperating in the exploitation of the Baykonur cosmodrome, protecting the environment in regions adjoining the Aral sea and the former Semipalatinsk nuclear testing ground. Gore said that the United States was ready to render Kazakhstan concrete assistance in organising the regional management of water resources. The sides also had a frank exchange of views on the situation in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). The views of the two sides were very close or identical.
