Social Democratic Party [SDP] Chairman Tomiichi Murayama, speaking at a meeting with a pro-SDP group of labor leaders, said the Japanese people do not want to see a political vacuum emerge during a severe economic slump. Murayama said the seven-party coalition led by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa should first compile and enact a third supplementary budget for fiscal 1993, ending March 31, and the fiscal 1994 budget, both of which have yet to be submitted to the Diet. The House of Councillors last week rejected a package of four government-sponsored political reform bills which passed the House of Representatives in November. Hosokawa has vowed to "take political responsibility" if his Cabinet fails to achieve political reform during the current Diet session ending January 29, implying that he and his Cabinet will resign en masse. Some of the ruling parties have called for dissolving the lower house for an election if the bills are killed.
