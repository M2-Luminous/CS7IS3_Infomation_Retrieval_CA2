Originally, SMB cooperatives were organized to promote the common interests of small and medium businesses by pooling their efforts. Naturally, their members are primarily small and medium businesses. No one can categorically say that the interests of SMB cooperatives and those of large corporations are always in conflict with each other. But depending on the circumstances, SMB cooperatives occasionally have to take a position diametrically opposite to that of large corporations. Despite the primary characteristics of SMB cooperatives, cases of large corporations joining SMB cooperatives as their members have increased steadily for the past several years. As a matter of principle, large corporations can become SMB members only with the approval of the SMB cooperatives concerned. Large corporations are admitted into SMB cooperatives when small and medium businesses need them and vice versa for mutual cooperation and interests. But according to cooperatives, there are some side effects. As of the end of this March an additional seven large corporations joined five SMB cooperatives so far this year: Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. joined Korea Electrical Manufacturers Cooperative; Korea Tungsten Mining Co., Hannong Co., and Koyang Furnace Industry joined the Korea Industrial Furnace Cooperative; and Hankuk Glass Industry Co. joined the Korea Glassware Industry Cooperative; Iljin Corp. joined the Korea Geographic Information Cooperative; and Koryo Industry Co. became a new member of the Korea Corrugated Cardboard Producers Cooperative. Last year 21 large corporations joined 15 SMB cooperatives. For instance, Anam Electric Industrial Co., Tongyang Precision Co., and Korea Xerox joined the Korea Electronic Industry Cooperative; Samsung Electronics Co. joined the Korea Electrical Manufacturers Cooperative; and Hyundai Electronics Ind. Co. joined the Korea Communications Cooperative. In 1992 as many as seven large cooperations joined the Korea Electronic Industry Cooperative. They are: Goldstar Communications, Samsung Electron Devices Co., Hyundai Electronics Indus. Co., Goldstar Information Communication Co., Daewoo Communications, Tongyang Nylon Co., and Koryo Systems. In addition, the Lotte Machine Manufacturing Co. and the Mando Machinery Corp. joined the Inchon-Kyonggi Machine Manufacturers Cooperative. In all, 15 large corporations joined eight SMB cooperatives in 1992. Of the total 588 SMB cooperatives, 94 have large corporations among their members. The combined membership of SMB cooperatives totals 46,500, of which 307 are large corporations, accounting for 0.66 percent. The Samsung Electronics Co. and Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. are among the largest corporations in our country. Most of the largest corporations in the country are among the members of SMB cooperatives, which are primarily for small and medium business firms. The case of Korea Electronic Industry Cooperative is most conspicuous, with 20 large corporations accounting for 4.6 percent of its total membership of 434 firms. In the case of the Korea Pharmaceutical Production Industry Cooperative, eight of its 173 member firms are large corporations, accounting for 4.6 percent of the total membership. The percentage is 3.8 percent in the Korea Communications Cooperative, and 3.5 percent in the Korea Electrical Manufacturers Cooperative. A large corporation can apply for membership in a SMB cooperative with the recommendation of five member firms when its admittance is deemed necessary for subcontract transactions, business alignment, technology transfers, the procurement of raw materials and parts, and other purposes for the development of small and medium businesses. When the cooperative's board of directors approves the application, the applicant can become a member of the cooperative. However, the number of large cooperations in any single cooperative cannot exceed 5 percent of its total membership. In admitting large corporations, the SMB cooperative concerned has a decisive voice inasmuch as membership applications are subject to the approval of the co-op's board of directors. The purpose of large corporations in joining SMB cooperatives is to maximize the mutual interests of large corporations and cooperatives. First of all, the admittance of large corporations into SMB cooperatives has some positive facets in securing cooperation between large corporations and SMB cooperatives in areas such as technology transfer, subcontract transactions, and information on overseas markets. In addition, large corporations and SMB cooperatives can promote their common interests by jointly participating in free group contracts. When an SMB cooperative cannot fulfill by itself the obligation to supply a certain amount of goods assigned to it under a free group contract, it can do so by admitting large corporations as its members. For their part large corporations can secure an outlet for their products by participating in free group contracts. Large corporations cannot account for more than 20 percent of the total amount of goods supplied by SMB cooperatives under a free group contract. In reality, survey shows that the amount of goods actually supplied by large corporations under free group contracts is slightly over 5 percent of the total contract volume. According to Korea Federation of Small Business, large cooperations accounted for 5.7 percent of the total amount of goods supplied by SMB cooperatives in the first half of 1993 under free group contracts. The percentage allocated to large corporations in the total volume of supplies provided by SMB cooperatives under free group contracts slightly decreased from 7.6 percent in 1990 to 6.5 percent in 1991. Still, the portion of goods supplied by large corporations is not small. Large corporate members of SMB cooperatives participate in free group contracts of SMB cooperatives only where small and medium firms alone cannot fulfill their contract obligations. Another reason large corporations are admitted into SMB cooperatives is that their admittance enables SMB cooperatives to seek common interests through joint purchases and other means. With the participation of large corporations in joint purchases, the unit cost can be lowered through a larger purchase volume. Large corporations for their part can enjoy the benefit of purchasing necessary raw materials and parts at lower prices. For small and medium enterprises admittance of large corporations into SMB cooperatives can have the effect of preventing competition with large corporations in competitive bidding, according to concerned officials of SMB cooperatives. They say that by admitting large corporations as their members, SMB cooperatives in some cases can avoid competitive bidding with large corporations and succeed in signing free contracts on their initiative. It is also pointed out that admittance of large corporations into SMB cooperatives has other positive aspects in promoting cooperation between large corporations and small and medium business in areas, such as information on overseas markets, technology transfers, and subcontract transactions. However, it is noted that admittance of large corporations has some negative side also. For instance, depending on circumstances, large corporations for their own interests may have a greater voice in the management of SMB cooperatives. In some cases small and medium enterprises may find their voices drowned out by the louder voices of large corporate members when it is necessary to make a decision contradictory to the interests of the large corporations. In reality, in some cases large corporations join SMB cooperatives as an expedient way of staving off the opposition of small and medium enterprises. Wishing to enter the lunch-box business, a certain company M attempted to join the relevant SMB cooperative, but it failed because of the deep-rooted antagonism between it and small and medium member firms of the cooperative. Admittance of large corporations into SMB cooperative has both positive and negative sides. Concerned officials of cooperatives say that in the final analysis it is important to bring masterly management skills into play in order to maximize the mutual interests.
