This session of the theoretical study class will mainly study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. More than 40 leading cadres from the democratic parties' central committees, vice chairmen of the ACFIC, and nonparty figures who hold leading positions in various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government, as well as leading nonparty figures from various ministries, commissions, and bureaus directly under the State Council, participated in the study class. Hu Jintao, who is a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and also a member of the CPC Secretariat and president of the Central Party School, extended his warm congratulations on the opening of the study class. He said: The theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics put forward by Comrade Deng Xiaoping constitutes contemporary Marxism in China. It is also the spiritual pillar and scientific guidance that guide us on our continuing triumphant march forward and the theoretical foundation of the CPC basic line in the new period. Only if we have a deep understanding and a good command of the theory can we comprehensively and correctly understand and implement the party's basic line, and only by constantly consolidating the theoretical firmness can we constantly heighten our consciousness toward implementing the basic line. Hu Jintao said: The nineties is an important historical period for our national development and national rejuvenation. Currently, the overall situation in our country is good, being characterized by economic development, political stability, national unity, and social progress. The international situation is also relatively favorable for us to further deepen the reform, open wider to the outside world, and concentrate our efforts to further improve our economy. We are facing a rare historic opportunity for reform and development. The key to deepening reform lies in seizing opportunities to accelerate the reform. The "Decisions on Some Issues Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic System" adopted at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee symbolizes the fact that our economic restructuring has embarked upon a new stage that combines pushing forward as a whole with making breakthroughs in key areas. The current year will witness our making the biggest strides in reform since it was introduced over a decade ago. It may also be considered an extremely crucial year in the process of China's reform and development; and the task is extremely arduous and heavy. In the course of our moving forward, we will inevitably encounter many complicated situations and problems that we have never encountered before. Only if we have a good command of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, a grasp of the essence of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts, as well as a grasp of the scientific attitudes and creative spirit as demonstrated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping in his application of the Marxist stand, concept, and method to study new situations and to solve new problems, will we be able to unify our thought, have a correct grasp of the relationship between stability, reform, and development; be able to deal properly with the various social conflicts, to prevent one-sidedness and to avoid making blunders; and only then can we enhance our ability and level for taking control of the overall situation and the socialist market economy, as well as can we guarantee the smooth progress of reform, opening to the outside world, and the modernization drive. Hu Jintao said: The multiparty cooperation under the leadership of the CPC and political consultation system is our country's basic political system; it represents one of the principal bases of socialist democracy and constitutes an important component of socialism with Chinese characteristics. This political system which is created and developed in light of China's national situation, after having been subjected to trials in all types of weather, has manifested its tremendous vitality. Practice has proved that the various democratic parties participating in political affairs in sincere cooperation with the CPC are close comrades in arms of the CPC who have gone through thick and thin together in the same boat over a long period of time. They constitute a formidable force in our patriotic united front; it is also an important force in safeguarding stability and unity in our country, in promoting socialist modernization, and in pushing forward the great undertaking of reunification of the motherland in accordance with the principle of "peaceful reunification and one country, two systems." He said: A common undertaking, a common goal, and a common task call for a common ideological foundation. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is not only a crystallization of the collective wisdom of the CPC but also is a crystallization of the collective wisdom of the people of all nationalities in our country, including those from the various democratic parties, the ACFIC, and figures without party affiliation. It constitutes not only the most valuable spiritual wealth of the CPC, but also the most valuable spiritual wealth of the people of all nationalities in China, including members of the various democratic parties and the ACFIC and nonparty figures. It represents a source of strength for stimulating not only the unremitting struggle of the CPC but also the avowed struggle of the people of all nationalities in the country, including members of the various democratic parties and the ACFIC and nonparty figures. In the new historical period, only if we study well Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and form a consensus and enhance unity on the basis of a new ideology can we better uphold and perfect the multiparty cooperation under the leadership of the CPC and the political consultation system, fortify and expand the patriotic united front, and unswervingly implement the basic principle of "long-term coexistence, mutual supervision, showing utter devotion to each other, and the sharing of weal and woe" on a common political foundation, as well as fully bring into play and enhance the democratic party's role in political consultation and democratic supervision, thereby pushing forward the building of a socialist democracy. Hu Jintao said: In the main, this study class will study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, and at the same time it will closely combine the study of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics with the study and appreciation of the "decisions" made by the Third Plenary of the 14th CPC Central Committee. I suggest that in the course of your study, all of you should earnestly study the original work, strive to grasp its spiritual essence, carry forward the fine style of correlating theory with practice, and put into practice what you have learned, as well as strive to earnestly organize study, integrating independent thinking with drawing on collective wisdom and absorbing all useful ideas, and freely speak out and express your own views, consult with one another on an equal footing, and learn from each other's strong points to make up one's deficiencies, thereby raising the overall standard of study and discussions. Lei Jieqiong, chairperson of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, spoke on behalf of the central committees of the various democratic parties and the ACFIC. She said: Conducting this theoretical study class for the leading cadres of the democratic parties, the ACFIC, and nonparty figures constitutes an important measure for enhancing the self-improvement of the democratic parties and is of great significance to giving impetus to members of the various democratic parties and the ACFIC, as well as nonparty figures, to further study and master Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and to strengthening the ideological and theoretical building among the democratic parties and the ACFIC. It will also have a far-reaching impact on efforts to meet the needs of the current situation and the needs of the united front work, as well as on efforts to further uphold and perfect the multiparty cooperation under the leadership of the CPC and the political consultation system. She said that through the present study, participants will certainly further improve their theoretical standards and leadership ability and do a better job. Wang Zhaoguo, vice chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and head of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, also spoke at the opening ceremony. Also present at the opening ceremony of the study class were: Fei Xiaotong, chairman of the China Democratic League Central Committee; nonparty figure Cheng Siyuan; Lu Jiaxi, chairman of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party Central Committee; Li Peiyao, chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang Central Committee; Wu Jieping, chairman of the Jiusan (3 September) Society Central Committee; Cai Zimin, chairman of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government Central Committee; Wan Guoquan, executive vice chairman of the China Democratic National Construction Central Committee; Yang Jike, executive vice chairman of the China Zhi Gong Dang (Party for the Public Interest) Central Committee; Jing Shuping, vice chairman of the ACFIC; as well as leading comrades including Zheng Bijian, Zhao Zongnai, Wang Jialiu, Jiang Minkuan, Liu Yandong, and Liu Shengyu from the Organization Department, the Propaganda Department, the United Front Work Department, and the Party School of the CPC Central Committee.
