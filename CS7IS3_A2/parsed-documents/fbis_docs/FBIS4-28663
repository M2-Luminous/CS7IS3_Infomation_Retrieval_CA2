In a speech to senior officials of Komeito's prefectural chapters from across the country, Ichikawa rejected calls within the SDP for prime minister Tsutomu Hata's cabinet to voluntarily quit. But Ichikawa praised the second largest opposition party for exploring the possibility of its returning to the coalition, which it bolted in April over the abrupt formation of "Kaishin (Innovation)" by other coalition partners, including Hata's Shinseito, Komeito and the Democratic Socialist Party. The Komeito official criticized the Liberal Democratic Party for hinting at introducing a no-confidence motion against the Hata administration and cautioned the SDP against going along with the LDP on the matter.
