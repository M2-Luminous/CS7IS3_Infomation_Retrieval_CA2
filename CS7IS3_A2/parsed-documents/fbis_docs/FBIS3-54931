Piling one on top of another and mixing together, they form something like the impenetrable porridge that fills Moscow's streets. The edicts revoke or suspend laws and introduce new juridical norms instead; the edicts rip entire chunks out of the body of existing legislation. What about the new Constitution? No recollection of it. By error, apparently, Article 90 of the Constitution stated: "Edicts and directives of the Russian Federation president must not contradict the Russian Federation Constitution and federal laws." What? The president constrained by laws? We can't have that! But Edict No. 2270 of 22 December 1993 clears up the "misunderstanding": "It is to be laid down that Russian Federation laws...do not apply when they contradict the present edict." Now that's better! But even then the recent edict "On Measures To Bring Russian Federation Legislation Into Line With the Russian Federation Constitution" stands out like a sore thumb. I do not want to go on about the fact that "bringing legislation into line" is the job of the legislative branch, and not of the president at all. If there are people who have not yet realized that anything goes as far as the president is concerned, they are presumably about to be put right. But even in these conditions there are things that cause embarrassment, to put it mildly. Top of the list is Yeltsin's cancelation of his own 21 September 1993 Edict No. 1400 "On Stage-by-Stage Constitutional Reform in the Russian Federation." Yes indeed, the very edict that overthrew the Constitution, declared the dissolution of the Congress of People's Deputies and Supreme Soviet, and suspended the activities of the Constitutional Court. The edict, which caused an acute political crisis in the country, led to the firing on parliament and the enormous loss of life. When he addressed the people, Yeltsin promised that the edict would be submitted for examination by the new parliament. He was entrusting the assessment of his actions to the new parliament, elected in the new conditions -- either to approve or to condemn them. Now he has reneged on his promise. The president has changed his mind. There was an equally unceremonious edict on existing legislation. Amid all the "bringing into line" the government and the president are hastily getting rid of some of the legal norms that get in their way. The law "On Personal Privatization Accounts and Deposits," which fell foul of Chubays' voucher privatization, has been repealed. The law "On State Protection for the Supreme Representative Organs of Power" has been repealed, evidently as a sensible precaution for the future. Yeltsin also thought it was a convenient moment to dispense with the duty of presenting an annual report on state policy in the sphere of protection of citizens' health and the state of the Russian population's health. No wonder in the three years of his rule the health of the population has reached crisis point (figures and facts on this subject were cited in SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA recently). So what you have to do is close the subject to discussion! A little further on yet another "minor masterpiece" of the "constitutional renaissance" era is eliminated -- the edict "On Legal Regulation During the Period of Stage-by-Stage Constitutional Reform in the Russian Federation." But hang on, wasn't this the very edict that served as the basis for the executive's massive incursion into the sphere of legislation, taxes, and the budget? Is it a case of "the Moor has done his job, the Moor may go"? At the end of the edict, which casts a shroud of silence over the blood-spattered remnants of the legal system, we encounter the familiar phrase: "This edict is to be submitted to the Federal Assembly for it to examine..." What, more promises? Is there any limit to the hypocrisy? Cult of Law or Cult of Force? When assessing the results of the president's and government's "fruitful activity" in the sphere of legislation, it is hard to avoid the feeling that an experienced hand is directing the breakup of the Russian state and legal system. This breakup began three years ago, when the provision on Russian laws taking precedence over union laws was enshrined in the declaration on state sovereignty of the RSFSR, adopted by the Congress. The results had a rapid impact. Union enterprises soon began to be drawn into "Russian jurisdiction," and the Union government was put on "maintenance" -- a single-channel system of taxes. The article on Russian laws taking precedence was an excellent cover for a ruthless power struggle which resulted in the destruction of the single Union state. Then came the decision to institute the post of president, which gave rise to confrontation between the authorities and a dangerous concentration of power in one pair of hands. Now we can see that the system of "democratic checks and balances," which is in an embryonic state, could not prevent the slide toward dictatorship. The next stage in the breakup was the decision on extra powers, which entitled the president to adopt edicts which had the force of law. The two locomotives headed toward one another were bound to crash. And they did. The result was disintegration, instability, anomalies in legislation, and Russia's declining authority both as a business partner and as a state in which laws are respected. The next step was the so-called "constitutional crisis," caused in fact by the president's reluctance to live and work in accordance with the Constitution under which he was elected and to which, incidentally, he swore loyalty in his presidential oath. Cries of "patched-up Constitution!" and "It is impossible to live by it!" disorientated a section of society, unfortunately. As a result, the old Constitution was destroyed while the new one...the new one is giving rise to more questions than it is answering. Taking advantage of the events of 21 September-4 October, the president and his entourage effected the total breakup of representative authority from top to bottom. Tne Federal Treaty, which had been passed off as a most important guarantee of the country's unity and integrity in the new conditions, was removed from the Constitution. On the pretext of concern for local self-government its autonomy was effectively eliminated. The facts indicate that Russia is being led toward the final phase of the breakup of the legal system. The old Constitution has been destroyed and the new one has been adopted with serious violations having taken place. Immediately after the Constitution was published it began to be discredited, and in various areas moreover. In the first place, it is discredited by the numerous examples of violation of the law during its adoption. Second, by the arrogant attitude toward it on the part of the president and the executive, which are as disdainful of the new Constitution as they were of the old one. Third, the Constititon is undermined by regions' legislative acts, which contradict it at every step. You have, for example, the constitutions of Tatarstan and Bashkortostan and the constitution of the Ural Republic, which was adopted but immediately rescinded. And you cannot really blame the republics: Before giving Chechnya, Tatarstan, or Bashkiria membership of the Russian Federation the consent of the members of the Federation should certainly be sought. And what do you have now: The old Constitution is no more, the new one has not been agreed with them and approval was not obtained in the referendum on their territory. A completely free hand! In short, every effort has been made to ensure that in the event of an acute political crisis none of the sides can rely on the authority of the law, of the Constitution. To ensure that the sole authority on the territory of Russia is the Kalashnikov rifle and the special militia's stick. The Stick and Presidential Rule A new contender appears to have joined the competition for the best political spectacle of the year -- the Federal Assembly session. The newly elected parliament has not yet started its work, but there is no end of gloomy forecasts and predictions: "They will split," "they will fight," "they will disintegrate".... Actually, there are grounds for the gloomy predictions: Indeed, Messrs. Sheynis, Bezrukov, and Mityukov are in charge of preparatios for the first sittings, and the other day they were joined by Mr. Filatov. The mood of diappointment and pessimism is encouraged by the fact that the Federal Assembly has been in an absurd and humiliating position from the very outset. By an edict of the president it was deprived of its official home -- the House of Soviets on Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment. All service components -- vehicle pool, accounting -- were cut back to the bone. Now you have to go to the president's office for every little thing. The edict approved the Federal Assembly apparatus and appointed its leader, Mr. Podoprigora. The leaders of the apparatus are preparing for the opening of the first Federal Assembly session, but in a very peculiar way. Experienced staffers of the former Supreme Soviet are being swiftly dismissed and replaced by "certified cadres." For instance, a large part of the organizational department, which used to handle the practical preparations for sittings and maintained links with the regions, was eliminated. Dozens, hundreds of specialists have received dismissal notices. And this a few days before the session opens... The draft Standing Orders of the State Duma and Federation Council are already being prepared in the bowels of the president's office. One constant desire can be discerned amid the pages and pages of documents, like the moon peeping through the clouds: To make the future parliament a talking shop rather than a working body. For example, monitoring functions have been removed completely from the standing orders: debate the laws by all means, but monitor their execution -- no way! Instead of a presidium a body called a "conference," implying no obligation for anyone, is being instituted -- in it the chairmen of factions (party structures) will each have several dozen votes, while the chairmen of committees (the structural components of parliament) will only have a voice but no vote. The purpose of these novelties is clear and simple -- to turn the future parliament into a political debating society. The obvious intention is to create as many contradictions as possible within parliament and cause clashes between Federation Council deputies and State Duma deputies. The trigger for such a conflict is not just simple, but very simple: All you need to do is create a marked difference in salaries, living conditions, and transport and office premises and facilities provision, and emphasize your warm attitude toward one lot and cooler attitude toward the other.... Now the ground is prepared for growing the poisonous mushrooms of personal ambition and mutual discontent. The current authorities have a wealth of experience in this respect. Suffice it to say that the deputies representing the opposition are still unable to obtain the basics -- to get the telephones that were cut off during the election campaign reconnected. Let them go around begging and swearing. It is as easy as anything then to portray them as troublemakers concerned only with their own "deputies' privileges." There is yet another problem that is arousing a great deal of emotion. It is the former USSR and Russian Federation people's deputies still living in official apartments. Some of them have settled in Moscow, others have simply nowhere else to go to. This brought on a fit of administrative rage: "You have 24 hours to move out!" But this is precisely a case where administrative interference is harmful. If you throw onto the street people whose only crime was to carry out their civic duty and not seek handouts, we will not attract any deputies in the future. The question is: Do we actually need deputies in Russia? Who wants to face the abuse and scorn of the press, feel impotent in the face of an official's disdainful smile, be held responsible for something you are unabler to change? Perhaps we should immediately place power in the hands of those who know how to make money out of it and no longer bother with competitive elections? That is way things are going, it appears. The fuss over the work of the Federal Assembly before it has begun reveals a hidden goal, which is to discredit the very idea of people's representation in the people's eyes: No, they say, we are not mature enough for a parliament.... The stick and presidential rule -- that is what Russia needs.
