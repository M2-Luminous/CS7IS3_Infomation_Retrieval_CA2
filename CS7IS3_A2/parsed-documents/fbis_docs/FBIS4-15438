The view of the Lithuanian Government on the decree of Russian President Boris Yeltsin was explained to the ambassador. He was told that such unilateral actions by Russia are unacceptable to Lithuania. The attention of the ambassador was drawn during the meeting to the fact that the Russian stand, disseminated by the Russian diplomatic missions, attempting to disclaim the annexation of the Baltic states in 1940, has no historical or legal foundations. Such a stand is contrary to the Lithuanian-Russian agreement of 29 July 1991 on the foundations of interstate relations, where Russia acknowledged that in 1940 the USSR annexed Lithuania. In discussing the return of the Lithuanian Embassy building in Paris, Albinas Januska expressed his concern that Russia has so far failed to solve this issue.
