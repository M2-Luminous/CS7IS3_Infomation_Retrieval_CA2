The sources said Castro is not scheduled to attend the meeting between the Cuban Government and Cubans living abroad that begins on Friday, but they added that he will attend the next National Assembly of the People's Government meeting scheduled for 1 May. Although Fidel Castro has not been seen in public since 2 April, when he met with Chinese Deputy Planning Minister Hao Jianxiu, other sources said the Cuban president presided, as usual, at Monday's Council of Ministers meeting.
