FR940831-0-00076 FR940831-0-00028 ␣ 1Current 1New Diethylene glycol butyl ether acetate Poly(2-8)alkylene glycol monoalkyl(C1-C6) ether acetate. 2-Ethoxyethanol Ethylene glycol monoalkyl ethers. Ethylene glycol ethyl ether Ethylene glycol monoalkyl ethers. Ethylene glycol isopropyl ether Ethylene glycol monoalkyl ethers. Ethylene glycol methyl ether Ethylene glycol monoalkyl ethers. (b) The IMO has revised the Pol. Cat. of a number of entries by ``upgrading'' the category from ``III'' to ``D''. These entries are listed below: (1) Diethanolamine (2) Diethylene glycol (3) Diethylene glycol ethyl ether (under the entry poly(2-8)alkylene glycol monoalkyl(C1-C6) ether) (4) Polypropylene glycol methyl ether (under the entry poly(2-8)alkylene glycol monoalkyl(C1-C6) ether) (5) Sulfolane (6) Triethylene glycol butyl ether (under the entry poly(2-8)alkylene glycol monoalkyl(C1-C6) ether) These entries will be added to the list in §151.47. (c) The IMO has also revised the Pol. Cat. of a number of entries included in the list in §151.47 by ``upgrading'' each from ``D'' to a higher category. These entries are listed below: (1) sec-Butyl acetate (2) Ethylene glycol methyl ether acetate (3) Octyl acetate (4) Sodium silicate solution These entries will be removed from the list in §151.47. (d) The IMO has also revised the Pol. Cat. of two entries in §151.49(a), the list of category C oil-like NLSs. They are, diethylbenzene and ethylbenzene. These entries will be removed from § 151.49(a). Because the United States is a party to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 as modified by the protocol of 1978 relating thereto (MARPOL 73/78), these amendments are required to ensure that the Coast Guard regulations are consistent with revisions to IMO's chemical codes, which took effect July 1, 1994. Accordingly, the Coast Guard finds that good cause exists under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) to publish this rule without opportunity for comment. The public was notified of the upgrades to be made by this final rule in an appendix to the Bulk Hazardous Materials NPRM (58 FR 29937) published on May 20, 1993. Regulatory Evaluation This rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this final rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures is unnecessary. This rulemaking is administrative in nature and merely updates NLS lists by adding cargoes recently authorized by the Coast Guard or added to the IMO Chemical Codes and by making other non-substantive editorial changes and corrections. Small Entities Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ), the Coast Guard must consider the economic impact on small entities of a rule for which a general notice of proposed rulemaking is required. ``Small entities'' may include (1) small businesses and not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields and (2) governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000. This rule does not require a general notice of proposed rulemaking and, therefore, is exempt from the requirements of the Act. Although this rule is exempt, the Coast Guard has reviewed it for potential impact on small entities. This final rule is merely administrative in nature. This final rule will result in no additional costs to industry. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ) that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Collection of Information This final rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ). Federalism The Coast Guard has analyzed this rulemaking in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that this rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Because this rulemaking is largely administrative in nature and will merely update current lists in Coast Guard regulations, there should be no Federalism implications. However, the authority to implement the requirements of this rule has been committed to the Coast Guard by Federal statutes and the importance of uniform requirements in the carriage of bulk hazardous cargo aboard ships moving from port to port requires that the Coast Guard preempt conflicting State and local requirements in the same subject area. Environment The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this rulemaking and concluded that, under section 2.B.2 of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this final rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. This rulemaking is an administrative update of current lists to add chemicals already approved under Coast Guard regulation or international law and clearly will have no impact on the environment. A Categorical Exclusion Determination is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under ADDRESSES. List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 151 Administrative practice and procedure, Oil pollution, Penalties, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Water pollution control. For the reasons set out in the preamble, the Coast Guard amends 33 CFR part 151 as follows: PART 151_VESSELS CARRYING OIL, NOXIOUS LIQUID SUBSTANCES, GARBAGE AND MUNICIPAL OR COMMERCIAL WASTE 1. The authority citation for part 151 continues to read as follows: Authority: 33 U.S.C. 1321(j)(1)(C) and 1903(b); E.O. 11735, 3 CFR, 1971&hyph;1975 Comp., p. 793; 49 CFR 1.46. §151.47 [Amended] 2. In § 151.47, remove the following entries: a. sec-Butyl acetate. b. Ethylene glycol methyl ether acetate. c. Octyl acetate.
