The move came in response to an unofficial request from the United Nations to send personnel and assist Canadian peacekeepers in charge of logistics in the Middle East, the officials said. The delegation, consisting of five officials from the Defense Agency and one from the Foreign Ministry, will return home on June 10 or 11 after meeting with Canadian Government officials, they said. The government will study the possibility of Japan sending peacekeepers to the Golan Heights upon receiving a report from the team, the officials said. The Golan Heights has been occupied by Israel since it seized the territory from Syria in 1967. A total of 1,036 troops of the U.N. Disengagement Observer Force monitor the cease-fire between Israel and Syria in an area determined by a May 1974 accord on disengagement. The U.N. force comprises 464 peacekeepers from Austria, 215 from Canada and 357 from Poland.
