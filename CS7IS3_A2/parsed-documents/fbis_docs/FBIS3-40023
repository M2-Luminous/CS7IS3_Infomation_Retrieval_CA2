Finding that out was the main reason for the official visit carried out yesterday by Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos, who had left the borders of Angola for the first time since the contested elections held in September 1992, which resulted in the resumption of the armed conflict. According to UN statistics, which cannot be checked but do indicate its order of magnitude, the civil war in Angola "is responsible for more than 1,000 deaths per day" and has uprooted approximately 3 million people, nearly one-third of the population. Under these circumstances, and although laborious peace talks have been under way since last November, could the French Government be planning to lift the military embargo? "A priori, no," replied an official French source yesterday, while adding: "Unless a political decision is made at the highest level..." The Angolan request is dividing the government according to a variable political geometry: The president is against "anything that might risk appearing to send a bad signal while a peaceful solution is being sought." The prime minister's office is also "somewhat embarrassed by the bad timing," whereas the Ministry of Defense is "totally against" the idea, which is causing Francois Leotard's entourage of being suspected, in the words of one Angolan diplomat, of "supplying arms to the UNITA [National Union for Angolan Independence]," the rebel movement led by Jonas Savimbi. On the other hand, the Ministry of Cooperation stated that it was "in favor, with no qualms," while the Interior Ministry is so enthusiastic that the UNITA, in turn, suspects Charles Pasqua of having "profited from several unlisted cargoes of oil." There too, it is an accusation based on strictly no evidence, but which puts its finger on the raw spot of the war: Angolan oil, extracted by foreign companies and "pawned" -- up to the year 2000 -- by the government so that it could finance the purchase of arms. Tomorrow afternoon, with a half-hour gap between them, Eduardo dos Santos will receive the new managing director of Elf Aquitaine, Philippe Jaffre, and the CEO of Aerospatiale, Louis Gallois. In simplified terms the situation can be summed up as follows: The oil will have to finance the weapons... However, Elf complains that it "is not earning any money in Angola," due to a "punishing and intolerable tax system." Hence the idea of making a deal that would benefit everyone, with the notable exception of the Angolan population. In exchange for renegotiating its contracts, the French company would prove "understanding" in the context of requests made by the government in Luanda, all this with the blessing of the French authorities, which not only want to sell arms and oil installations, but also offer some opposition to the major U.S. companies which have firmly established themselves on the Angolan platforms. Will Edouard Balladur opt in favor of this "strategic view" while at the same time assuring himself of the tacit support of Francois Mitterrand? It is not clear. For France would then be accused of an ill-founded approach in the context of UN efforts at pacification, and would expose itself to reproaches of cynically putting its financial interests first. All the more so since the Luandan regime, despite emerging victorious in the election, is not distinguishing itself by an administration of exemplary integrity. In the diplomatic dispatches from the French Embassy, too, it is effectively made clear how those close to -- sometimes even related to -- President dos Santos are profiting from a war economy, especially by importing arms, setting up so-called intermediate companies to which the state addresses its orders and which, in the course of transactions, take juicy commissions. "To spell it out clearly," sums up one French source, "the war is yielding fat profits, whereas peace would be dangerous." Today, more than 80 percent of the income of the Angolan state -- mainly its revenue through oil -- is spent on the war effort. Admittedly, this war was "imposed" on the government by the UNITA when, the day after its election defeat, the rebels took up their arms again. However, since then, the warmongering by the men in power has gained momentum, progressing from the "massacre of la Toussaint" in 1992, when the supporters of Jonas Savimbi were beaten to death in cold blood in Luanda, via the terrible pogroms in January 1993 against the Bakongo, people originating from around the border shared with Zaire, to the acts of violence orchestrated last December against Lebanese, Senegalese, and Mauritanian traders. The Angolan authorities have taken every opportunity to unload their responsibility onto scapegoats, at the cost of thousands of deaths. However, the misery is caused not only by the war, but -- as one official from the World Bank put it -- also by the government's incompetence, which "is aggravating the difficulties facing the Angolan people." Today, these "difficulties" are such that in some areas of Luanda, into which 3 million inhabitants are now crammed, people are dying of hunger in the streets. According to the price index drawn up by the highly official National Institute of Statistics, inflation in the capital reached a level of nearly 700 percent in 1993. Meanwhile, the state, remaining impervious to the suffering of the poorest citizens and open to all forms of trade, is self-sufficient. For instance, the government presented a new Audi car as a "gift" to each deputy of the National Assembly, now dubbed the "auditorium." Moreover, the "national" character of the Parliament is becoming the subject of increasing caution, for UNITA controls -- or rather, is rendering unsafe -- 70 percent of Angolan territory, ranging from the south east to the north, via the central plateau. Like the government with its oil wealth, largely invested offshore, the rebels led by Jonas Savimbi are financing the pursuit of the war thanks to diamonds excavated by Zaire, where they have their home base. However, there too, what suffices for the purchase of arms is in no way enough to enable them to administer the "liberated areas." In Huambo, which has been the site of UNITA headquarters since last March, the number of children afflicted by vitamin deficiency is legion. In several provinces, according to humanitarian sources, the level of acute malnutrition is higher than 20 percent. And yet today, like never before, the civil population is being held hostage and humanitarian aid is being hijacked and used for blackmailing purposes. In Luanda, in preparation for the visit to France by the Angolan president, Michel Roussin, the minister of development cooperation had stated that this aid had become "an instrument of pressure." Like the call for arms?
