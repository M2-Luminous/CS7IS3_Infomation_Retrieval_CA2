FR940418-2-00130 FR940418-2-00073 To address the foregoing concerns, the Amex has entered into a surveillance sharing agreement with the HKSE that provides for the exchange of information relating to the trading of Index options on the Exchange and trading in the component securities of the Index on the HKSE. 26 The agreement, among other things, provides for the sharing of time and sales information, clearing data, and the identity of persons who have bought or sold securities. This agreement obligates the Amex and the HKSE to compile and transmit all relevant market surveillance information and to resolve in ``good faith'' any disagreements regarding requests for information in response thereto. In addition, the Amex has represented that if information pursuant to the surveillance sharing agreement is not promptly forthcoming from the HKSE, options based on the Index will be removed from trading on the Amex. 27 26 See letter from William Floyd-Jones, Jr., Assistant General Counsel, Legal & Regulatory Policy Division, Amex to Richard Zack, Branch Chief, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, dated August 27, 1993. See also letter from Claire P. McGrath, Managing Director and Special Counsel, Derivative Securities, Amex to Michael Walinskas, Branch Chief, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, dated March 31, 1994. 27 Should the HKSE deny a request for assistance pursuant to the surveillance sharing agreement and the failure to provide assistance is material to the Amex's self-regulatory effort, the Amex will immediately attempt to implement alternative arrangements for sharing surveillance information with other appropriate self-regulatory and/or governmental authorities. If, despite these efforts, the Amex still is unable to implement such alternative arrangements and determines that it is unable to obtain specific surveillance information pursuant to its agreement with the HKSE which is necessary to carry out its regulatory functions, it will consult with the SEC regarding appropriate regulatory responses. Appropriate regulatory responses in this situation could include the ``winding-down'' of trading in any options where an information sharing agreement with the HKSE is necessary to ensure the integrity of the market and the SEC advises the Exchange in writing that the public interest and the protection of investors requires the ``winding-down'' of trading. Such ``winding-down'' process would involve the cessation of listing any new series, and the delisting of any series where there is no open interest. See letter from William Floyd-Jones, Jr., dated August 27, 1993, supra note 26; and letter from Claire P. McGrath, dated March 31, 1994, supra note 26. The Commission believes that the surveillance sharing agreement entered into between the Amex and HKSE adequately addresses its concerns relating to the ability of the Amex to detect and deter manipulation of the Index through the use of the Index component stocks. 28 28 As an additional surveillance related safeguard to the Index, the Amex requires that the primary trading market for all Index component stocks be located in a country with which the Amex has an effective and comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement. See letter from William Floyd-Jones, Jr., dated August 27, 1993, supra note 26.
