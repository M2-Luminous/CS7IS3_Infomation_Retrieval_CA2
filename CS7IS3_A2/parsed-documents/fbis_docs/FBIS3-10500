"I do not believe we have to anticipate so much," Chamorro said when asked about her Costa Rican colleague's statements over the past weekend. Calderon said he disagreed with Nicaraguan Deputy Foreign Minister Jose Pallais' arguments for charging a $5.00 fee for every tourist coming from Costa Rica on the San Juan River. "We will wait and see what happens" with Costa Rican President Jose Maria Figueres Olsen, who will be sworn in on 8 May, Chamorro said in brief statements to the media after inaugurating a seminar on juveniles in prison. Nicaraguan Deputy Foreign Minister Pallais said Calderon Fournier's statements were "exaggerated" and considered it unnecessary to go to The Hague to solve their differences regarding the San Juan River. Nicaragua "is free to take the measures it considers appropriate in its territory, and Costa Rica must respect our decisions," Pallais told reporters when he referred to the immigration controls implemented by the Nicaraguan Government at the river, which is the border between both countries. Last week Pallais asserted that the "Canas-Jerez" treaty signed in the last century "only" gives Costa Rica the right to navigate freely on the river for commercial purposes, not for tourism.
