The development of enterprises, particularly the large and medium-sized ones, directly affect the growth of our overall economy and the realization of the "four modernization" program. Therefore, how to invigorate large and medium-sized enterprises is a major event of universal concern in the whole country. With regard to this issue, we carry out some investigation and studies in some prefectures and cities such as Hefei, Chuzhou, Wuhu and Xuancheng from April to May this year. We called on the leading comrades of the Anhui provincial committee on economic affairs and trading and the aforementioned prefectural and city committees in this connection, visited a number of factories and enterprises, tried to understand the situation in the development and analyze the existing problems of 11 plants and companies including the Chang Jiang Electric Appliance Group Corporation and the Hefei Fork Lift Plant, and held discussion meetings with relevant plant directors and managers. We now summarize the situation as follows: I. Some Enterprises' Good Experience in Developing Themselves 1. They attach importance to the role of science and technology in developing themselves. Anhui is originally fairly backward economically and technologically. The scientific and technological standards of most of the factories and enterprises in Anhui are much lower than the world advanced level. Even compared with China's other provinces and coastal areas, Anhui also lags behind in the field of science and technology. This kind of situation has seriously hampered the development of some enterprises. After carrying out reform and opening up the country to the outside world, some enterprises in Anhui have realized the significant role of science and technology in developing themselves. In order to rapidly narrow the gap between their scientific and technological level and that of China's other provinces and the world, they have adopted the following measures: a. They have imported and purchased a large number of suitable advanced technological equipment. According to a rough estimate of the resources of the 11 plants and enterprises, they have imported or purchased most of their technological equipment in China or from abroad. They imported 41 percent of such equipment from abroad, purchased about 38 percent of such equipment from domestic sources, and developed and manufactured about 20 percent of such equipment themselves. Naturally the import of technological equipment costs the enterprises a great deal, but it saves money in doing research and development. More important is the fact that it would save the enterprises the time in doing their own research and development and help them raise their technical and production standards within a short period of time. For example, the Hefei Fork Lift Truck Plant was built in 1958. It began to manufacture fork lift trucks from 1963. Up to 1982, the annual output of fork lift trucks was still approximately 100, the production quality was low, and there were not many varieties. In 1985, this plant and the Baoji Fork Lift Truck Manufacturing Company joined efforts to import the technology in manufacturing Japan's TCMI-10T balanced diesel-engine fork lift trucks. After six years of hard work to assimilate foreign technology and develop painstaking technical innovations, the production technology of the plant had reached the world level of the 1980's, and its annual output of such trucks rose to 3,400. Right now, the plant has maintained the highest record in history in terms of production value, output, total volume of sales, taxes and profits, earnings in foreign exchange and other norms in the manufacture of fork lift trucks. It ranks top among all fork lift truck producing plants in the country. Another example is the Chang Jiang Electric Appliances Group Company (formerly the Chang Jiang Refrigerator Plant). During the period of the Sixth 5-year Plan, its name was changed to the Chang Jiang Electric Appliance Group Company. It had developed on the foundation of an outmoded iron and steel plant in 1984. At that time, its technology was backward, and it was short of funds at all times. Later, the company to import a refrigerator manufacturing technology from Italy with a loan of US$3 million. By importing and assimilating such technology, it had improved most of its manufacturing technology to the standards of the late 1980's. It had also added one more production line by improving the imported technology and relying on their own efforts. Right now, about 10 percent of its products are medium and high-level technology-intensive, while 35 percent of its products are medium-level technology-intensive. It has also continuously raised its production efficiency. In 1992, its total output value reached 552.7 million yuan with a per-capita output value of 105,600 yuan. It turned over 36.08 million yuan of taxes and profits to the state during that year. b. They have paid full attention to developing technical innovations. Prior to reform and opening-up, the technological equipment of some of the enterprises in China remained outmoded in general, and their productivity low. Anhui was of no exception. In order to improve productivity of the existing enterprises, Anhui instilled new vitality into those old plants by encouraging "technical innovations." Let us take the Chang Jiang Electric Appliance Company as an example. Dissatisfied with the technical standard of the original production line for refrigerators, the company relied on its own technical forces to develop technical innovations on its existing production line, and trial-produced many new equipment such as the side panel production line, computerized thermometer production line, the bubbling production line and the painting production line. It modernized all its production facilities. Another example is the Tongling Film Plant. It had paid full attention to technical innovations since 1983. It imported a total of seven sophisticated production lines from Japan, Germany, Britain, Italy and other countries such as the induction foil production line, the inductionless foil production line, the metallization production line and the AC capacitor production line, and became the only enterprise in China's electronics industry, which produces "thin film--metallic film--thin film capacitor" by linking production, processing and marketing to form an integrated whole. Its advanced equipment and technology greatly helped improve production quality and productivity. Seven of its products won provincial prizes, while five of them won ministerial citations. One of its products won a national silver medal. It was rated as one the nation's Second Grade Enterprises in 1990. This old enterprise has many new features. c. They have imported technology in the form of joint ventures. By importing technology in the form of joint ventures, they have not only solved the problems of funds and technology, but also whipped up the enthusiasm of both sides of joint ventures which share profits as well as risks. Thus, production quality and economic performances of such joint ventures have been improved. For example, three companies including the Hefei Fork Lift Truck Plant and Japan's TCM Company established the Andong Casting Company Limited in 1990. It has gone into operation now. Its production quality accords with the demands of the Japanese market. Its products are popular in Japan, thus changing the situation whereas fork lift trucks were only being exported to markets in the third world. Let us take the Chang Jiang Electric Appliance Group Company as an example again. In recent years, it made use of its land, factory buildings, public utility facilities, the abundant local natural resources and cheap labor to attract foreign investments and set up more than 10 Sino-foreign joint ventures and helped the advanced technology and equipment from foreign countries quickly play their role in increasing production and improving work efficiency. 2. They improve management and efficiency by relying on scientific management. Strengthening management with a scientific approach involves all the departments in production and management. For example, the import, installation and testing of technological equipment and the opening of the market need management. It is necessary to manage personnel and financial affairs as well as material resources. Efforts must be made to control production quality and the distribution of profits. In short, only by managing the various activities of an enterprise with a scientific approach, will it be possible to help an enterprise develop itself and improve its production efficiency. All these enterprises which we had surveyed paid full attention to their work in doing scientific management through which they had improved their work efficiency to varying degrees. Their typical methods used are as follows: The methods used by the Anhui Tire Plant are: A) Reform the management system and run the plant in a modern way; B) Improve its operating mechanism and its system of performance appraisal and clearly define the limits of the authority of the plant and each of its department and office; C) Improve its system of quality control and implement a system of veto power in this connection; D) Facilitate the flow of information for technology in production and for marketing, continuously develop new products and stop producing products that are technologically obsolete. The best way used by the Anhui Technology Import and Export Corporation in strengthening its management with a scientific approach is to link its efficiency with the benefits of its workers. As a result, it has whipped up the enthusiasm of all its workers and truly permitted its workers to participate in its management work. The best way used by the Anhui Fork Lift Truck in carrying out scientific management is reflected in assimilating imported technology and improving upon it. A) It carefully studies the technologies to be imported, make good selections, and carry out its work well in negotiating and signing contracts. B) It also tries to get price quotations from different suppliers and ensures that the technology to be imported is not only suited to China's national conditions but also comparatively lower in price. In assimilating imported technologies, it has ensured the supply of funds and strengthened administrative work in this purpose. (This plant has set up an office led by the plant director for assimilating imported technologies and developing technical innovations.) C) It vigorously strengthens its work in improving imported technologies and introducing new ideas, and pays full attention to users' feedback on its products. It also tries its best to improve those parts and accessories which fail to satisfy the needs of the users. In the course of assimilating imported technologies, it has actively developed new products. During the past six years in which foreign technologies were imported, the plant had marketed 34 new varieties of fork lift trucks. Methods used by the Quanjiao Diesel Engine Plant are as follows: A) It builds its workshops with a standardized scientific design. B) In allocating its building funds, it gives higher priority to workshops and lower priority to office buildings. (The construction of its office buildings was postponed three times, because the funds earmarked for the building of office buildings were used to build workshops. C) In production management, it follows a path of diversification, and continuously develops new products. 3. They attach importance to the role of the market. Although the market belongs to the sphere of commodity circulation, it plays a significant role in promoting production. Enterprises must obtain their new technologies and equipment from the market. They must also attract scientific and technical personnel from the market. They must test on the market their new products which they developed with the new technologies. The value of their products must be determined by the market, while the consumers also use the market to send in their feedback to the enterprises. In short, enterprises cannot separate themselves from the market. All the enterprises in Anhui which are well developed scientifically and technically take the market as a guiding factor and pay attention to the role of the market. Let us take the Hefei Fork Lift Truck Plant as an example. On the basis of the needs on the domestic and international markets, it has imported the necessary technologies and equipment, and assimilated and improved upon them. Within a short period of few years, it has developed more than 30 new models of fork lift trucks which are readily marketable. Its export market has been diverted from the low-priced markets in the Third World to the medium and high-priced markets in Western Europe, North America and Southeast Asia. The number of fork lift trucks exported to Western Europe alone accounted for 78 percent of its total amount of exports in 1992. In order to consolidate and expand its markets of sales, it has maintained ties with 16 companies in 11 countries abroad and set up steady sales channels. It is also making preparations to set up assembly plants and sales and service centers abroad. On the one hand, this is aimed at establishing a channel for export on a long term basis. On the other hand, it is also aimed at sending the information on foreign markets back to China and continuously producing readily marketable products. Again let us take the Chang Jiang Electric Appliance Group Company as an example. It has established an import and export department and set up offices in Hong Kong and other localities in charge of importing technologies and doing export work. All its products are market-oriented. It closely follows the needs of the market to change its models in order to satisfy the market demands. For example, the Anhui Tire Plant closely watches the famous brands on the domestic and foreign markets. It relies on its technologies to rapidly change the varieties of its products. Thus it is able to expand its market and continuously improve its efficiency. The total output value of the aforementioned three enterprises reached 1.15 billion yuan; and paid taxes and turned their profits to the state totalling 170 million yuan in 1992. 4. They pay attention to the role of professionally trained people Men play a major role in the development of social activities and productive forces. They are indispensable in developing science and technology, managing enterprises with a scientific approach and opening up the market. Competitions in science and technology and in market are, after all, competitions for professionally trained people. Some enterprises in Anhui used favorable terms to attract professionally trained people; spend a great deal of money to train them; and respected, cherished and put them in various important positions. As a result, these enterprises have attained notable economic results and drawn benefits from their practice in cherishing professionally trained people. For example, the Hefei Washing Machine Plant was founded in 1984. At that time, it had only a handful of professionally trained people and poor production equipment. Its business was not so good. In 1986, it started to import technologies and equipment from Japan. However, it is necessary to rely on professionally trained people to make full use of advanced technologies and equipment. Only by doing so will it be possible to accomplish good economic results. Lack of professionally trained people means lack of technology. Thus, this plant made use of various favorable terms to attract professionally trained people and encourage them to work for the plant. The plant clearly spelled out the following favorable terms: 1) Housing will be provided to any college graduate during the first year when he or she is hired. His or her wage will be two grades higher than that offered by other plants. 2) The bonus issued to technical personnel is 20 percent higher than that to ordinary workers. These favorable terms had attracted a large number of professionally trained people. Right now, this plant has 211 technicians including 11 high-ranking technical personnel and 200 medium-ranking technical personnel, accounting for 0.5 percent and 10 percent respectively of the total number of workers in the plant. The total output value of this plant reached 230 million yuan and its per-capita output value totalled 140,000 yuan in 1992. It delivered profits and paid taxes to the state totalling 41 million yuan in 1992. The Hefei Fork Lift Truck Plant pays full attention to the training of qualified professionals. It sent out more than 100 people to Japan for training. When its cadres returned home from abroad, they brought back tools and reference materials instead of major home appliances. Another experience of the plant is that the training of qualified professionals must be three to four years ahead of schedule. Only by doing so, will it be possible to maintain a predominant position in technical management. Advanced technological equipment must be operated and handled by well trained technical personnel. Only by doing so, will it be possible to turn advanced technological equipment into actual productive forces and ensure the fine quality of the products. II. Existing Problems in Developing Enterprises The aforementioned plants have different ways in developing themselves, while they too have their own problems. These problems are even more outstanding in other backward enterprises in Anhui. A. There exist problems and difficulties in enterprises 1. There is a shortage of engineers and technicians, seriously affecting the technical developments in various enterprises. The aforementioned 11 plants are enterprises with a comparatively large number of scientific and technical personnel in Anhui. However, the number of their scientific and technical personnel only totals 2,165, accounting for 7.9 percent of the total number of workers. The percentage of high-technological personnel is even smaller -- only 0.77 percent. This percentage is far below the requirement for a modernized enterprise. It is understood that the percentage of technical personnel in the total amount of workers is even smaller in other enterprises in Anhui. The shortage of scientific and technical personnel has made enterprises even more difficult to develop new technology, change new models, improve production quality and raise the added value of their products. 2. There are not enough investments in doing research and development work. This has seriously affected the enterprises' reserve strength for development. In recent years, the aforementioned 11 enterprises spent 14.224 million yuan each year on research and development, a mere 0.53 percent of their total output value and 4.28 percent of the amount of their profits and taxes paid to the state. As compared with some enterprises in the developed countries, they spend much less on research and development. Right now, the more technically advanced enterprise, the greater attention it pays to research and development. This kind of enterprise believes that investments on machinery and equipment only affect its immediate interests, but research and development will affect its future. If our enterprises pay little attention to research and development, they would have little reserve strength for future development. 3. There is a great shortage of professionals in foreign trade. This hampers the enterprises in dealing with the world market. China has implemented the reform and opening-up policy, delegated power to do foreign trade to the lower-level organizations, and encouraged enterprises to do business on the world market. However, there is a serious shortage of professionals in developing economic relations and trade with foreign countries. There are not many professionals who know foreign language, foreign trade and rules and regulations involving foreign countries. Let us take intellectual property rights as an example. Some enterprises ignore the need to legally protect their own patents and trademarks when they sign contracts on importing and exporting patented technologies. When they try to open up the international market, they lack information. They only seek to achieve the goal of pushing their products out of China and lower their prices to compete with others without paying attention to economic results. This practice has prevented them from advancing toward the international market. 4. The enterprises are under poor management. The main symptoms are: a) The enterprise's business targets are not so clear. A considerably number of enterprises still regard the fulfillment of production tasks as their goal without giving top priority to the enterprises' economic efficiency and long-term and short-term profits. With regard to imported technologies and equipment, they are unable to assimilate them and make them yield economic results. Some of the equipment and facilities are left unused for a long time after they have been imported. Investments are high, but the output is low. b) Workers' responsibility, authority and benefit are not clearly defined. The system of everybody eating from the same big pot still exists, and the enthusiasm of workers including technical personnel has not been fully aroused. c) In some enterprises, there are a large number of workers, but the amount of profits and taxes turned to the state remains low. The enterprises even suffer losses for several years running. This runs counter to what the market economy demands. Market economy demands that enterprises change the way they operate, become market-oriented, pay attention to economic performances and give full play to the role of science and technology, manpower, material and financial resources. B. The external environment affects the development of enterprises. There are many external environmental factors which would affect enterprise development, but the major ones with direct impact on enterprise development are as follows: 1. The procedure in importing technologies is too complicated. Enterprises demand that they be given more power to manage their own affairs in importing technologies and that the government organization in charge of the import of technologies perform more actual deeds and help enterprises solve specific problems in importing technologies. 2. Imports of technologies have often been duplicated or carried out blindly, wasting a great deal of foreign exchange. 3. Enterprises have not been truly given the power to manage their own affairs. The main symptoms are: a) Some of large and medium-sized enterprises do not have the authority to handle exports even now. They can only export their products through companies doing foreign trade. They do not understand the market abroad. Nor are they allowed to open up their market abroad. b) Even those enterprises with the authority to handle export business cannot take the initiative to export their products in accordance with the situation on the international market. If an enterprise fails to fulfill the task in exporting its products assigned by the higher authority, its authority to do export business will be revoked. c) There are too many restrictions for sending personnel to foreign countries. The procedure for examination and approval is too complicated, and its takes too long to go through this procedure. Restrictions on the use of funds approved are so strict that it is hard for the enterprises to adopt appropriate measures to keep up with the changes on the market. As a result, they often lose the chance of winning contracts. 4. The state fails to provide enterprises with a good environment for fair competition. For example, a) the Sino-Foreign joint ventures and cooperative and exclusively foreign-funded enterprises receive far more preferential treatments than ordinary enterprises. b) There are significant differences between the preferential treatments given to enterprises inside the development zone and those outside the development zone. c) The state treats enterprises which are included in the list of enterprises for technical renovations differently as compared with those not included in the list. Enterprises included in the list not only may obtain loans with preferential terms, but also may reduce or remit taxes. Those not included in the list not only cannot procure loans with preferential terms, but also must pay customs duties when they import machinery and production equipment. d) The dual price system is also an important factor leading to unfair competition among enterprises. 5. The rate of exchange for the yuan is too low, affecting the import of equipment from abroad. Although the lower rate of exchange for the yuan is conducive to expanding China's exports, it however increases the costs of imports and the enterprises' burdens in importing technological equipment. III. Several Suggestions to Relevant Government Departments 1. It is necessary to give enterprises greater authority to manage their export business; allow enterprises with favorable conditions to directly compete with others on the international market; and help them understand the world market and timely adjust their products and marketing and management tactics. Efforts must be made to ensure that enterprises with authority to handle exports truly have such power to export their products. Enterprises must have the power to decide whether they should export or not, what kind of products to export and the amount of their exports in accordance with the market situation. 2. It is essential to abolish the restriction on the minimum amount of goods that an enterprise must export. The practice of the government in giving enterprises assignments to export their products is actually a method of planned economy. It prevents enterprises from carrying out production and doing exports based on the principle of economic results. In order to fulfill their export targets, some enterprises have to export their products even at a loss, while others use yuan to purchase foreign exchange at a higher price so as to show the government that they have fulfilled their export targets. In order to guard against "poor business" in the next year, some enterprises deliberately kept their export figures low so that they might include these figures in the report when they really had some "bad years." In doing so, they would not likely lose their license to do export business because of their poor export business. Apparently, the aforementioned practice of some of the enterprises are erroneous. However, this is mainly because of the government decision to set export targets for the enterprises. Therefore, we must abolish the system of assigning a minimum quota for each enterprise to export its products, and truly permit enterprises to produce and sell their products according to the market situation. 3. It is necessary to simplify the procedure in importing technologies and that in examining and approving enterprises staff members's applications to visit foreign countries. The government department in charge of importing technologies must help enterprises do solid work and solve problems in importing technologies; and improve its services to the enterprises. 4. It is imperative to stabilize the exchange rate in order to maintain China's imports at the proper level. China is a developing nation with comparative low standards in science and technology. To moderately import advanced technological equipment to expand its scale in production is necessary in order to raise China's productivity and developing its economy. The yuan's rate of exchange with foreign currencies has a direct impact on the costs of imported goods. Therefore, only by stabilizing the yuan rate of exchange will it be possible to help enterprises import the right amount of technological equipment for themselves. 5. The government must create an environment for fair competition among enterprises. To develop a socialist market economy, we must do things according to market economic laws. Under no circumstances should we divide different areas and different enterprises into different groups, and work out different policies in dealing with each group. Efforts must be made to abolish the dual price system and fundamentally plug the loopholes with which some enterprises or individuals use to undermine the policies of the state. 6. It is necessary to improve measures in importing and exporting technologies. The import of technological equipment is conducive to helping enterprises develop their production. Efforts must be made to give preferential treatments to enterprises in terms of import duties and loans. The export of technological equipment is aimed at optimizing the product mix and raising the added value of China's exports. Preferential treatments should be given to enterprises which may retain a portion of foreign exchange for their own use and wish to procure loans in order to encourage exports.
