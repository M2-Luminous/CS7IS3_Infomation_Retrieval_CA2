The Iraqi official did not mention the name of the Lebanese diplomat. It should be noted that only one diplomat was serving at the Lebanese Embassy in Baghdad. He is Charge d'Affaires Sa'd Dakhya, who was summoned to Beirut on the second day of the crime and before the Council of Ministers made its decision to break off diplomatic relations with Baghdad. The Foreign Ministry has stated that there are no Lebanese diplomats in Iraq at present. Commenting on the Iraqi report, Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz said a short while ago: I have been informed of the report, but we have no Lebanese diplomats in Iraq. Minister Buwayz then left his office at the Foreign Ministry for B'abda Palace for a meeting with President Ilyas al-Hirawi and Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri. It should be noted that there are five locally hired Lebanese citizens at the Lebanese Embassy in Baghdad who have no diplomatic status. They carry special identity cards from the Iraqi Foreign Ministry.
