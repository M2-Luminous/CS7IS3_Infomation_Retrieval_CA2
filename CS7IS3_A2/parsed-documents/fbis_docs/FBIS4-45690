Brazilian legislation has loopholes that permit the entry of such substances. But the mobilization of ecologists resulted in England for the first time being forced to receive return shipments of toxic elements sent to a factory in Sao Paulo. Environmental engineers from 26 countries approved a recommendation to the governments of the Latin American nations urging them to prohibit the export of toxic and hazardous waste to Latin America, including waste that could theoretically be recycled. This proposal was one of the main conclusions of the Meeting on the Cross-Border Movement of Garbage and Toxic and Hazardous Waste organized in Santiago de Chile in November by the Economic Commission for Latin America (CEPAL), an agency linked to the UN, and by the Secretariat of the Basel Convention. The meeting was also attended by representatives from environmental defense agencies such as Greenpeace and the Caribbean Conservation Association. Laws preventing the importing of toxic waste have been passed in 103 countries of the Third World. In Latin America, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, El Salvador, Peru, and Panama have legislation restricting toxic cargo traffic. The Organization of African Unity approved the Bamako Convention in 1991 prohibiting the importing of toxic garbage to the African signatory countries along with the sale of substances whose use is prohibited in the producing countries. In the meantime, the great difficulty confronted by the nations of the Third World in preventing this "dealing in death" is the failure of the government to supervise the cargo normally shipped by Western European countries and the United States. According to Alfredo Gastal of the Environmental Department of CEPAL, in addition to passing restrictive laws, the countries of the Third World need to strengthen the organizational structure of institutions responsible for the environmental area and they must also train officials so that domestic legislation and international treaties may be complied with completely. Brazil is not a member of the group of nations that prohibit the entry of toxic waste of any kind in its territory. Regulatory Decree 138 of the Brazilian Environmental Institute of Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) has some loopholes that permit the entry into Brazil of waste-containing metals such as zinc, lead, copper, chrome, among others, plus used batteries for "recycling" and waste coming from steel production. The current standard forbids the importing of used tires, plastics, and chlorinated solvents. A company that wishes to buy waste from abroad must be registered with the IBAMA and submit an expert report from a government environmental agency establishing that it is capable of handling the products. Brazilian legislation on importing toxic garbage can be improved with the help of the new regulation being analyzed by IBAMA and as a result of the passage of the bill on this topic introduced by Federal Deputy Sidney de Miguel (PV-RJ [Green Party--Rio de Janeiro]). The IBAMA standards will have to be spelled out during the first half of this year and it is probable that they will prohibit "any importing of waste except when there is a proven need," according to Biologist Leda Famer, who is in charge of the solid waste management program of that institute. The criterion for spelling out the rules will be "exclusively environmental," according to Leda. Thanks to the exceptions provided for in the rules currently in force, IBAMA in 1993 approved the importing of 12,000 t of lead from the United States, Great Britain, Peru, and Puerto Rico. The lead waste is used by battery, fuse, and metal ingot manufacturers. The agency also authorized the entry of 35,000 t of scrap paper into the country. Brazil is self-sufficient in shredded paper production so that it was not necessary to import this waste, said Leda Famer. In spite of the organizational problems relating to the inspection of toxic cargo shipped to Brazil, IBAMA managed to reduce the volume of imported aluminum scrap to 600 t by August 1993. In 1991, the total exported to Brazil came to 6,254 t and the next year the figure was 3,380. The waste is processed in Brazil for the manufacture of radiators and aluminum alloys. Sidney de Miguel's bill prohibits the importing and exporting--by Brazilian enterprises--of toxic waste "of any kind, even for recycling." According to the explanation, Brazil still allows the entry of toxic substances for reprocessing purposes, thus becoming "one of the last possible target countries for unscrupulous trafficking in toxic waste." According to the bill, companies that would like to manage hazardous waste will have to prove that they have the technical capacity to do so before they can go ahead. They will have to be registered with the National Register of Hazardous Waste Operators to be monitored by environmental agencies, and they will have to submit a management plan to the government authorities. They will also annually have to inform the environmental agencies as to the quantity and nature of waste handled, its final destination, and any possible accidents. The bill defines the handling of hazardous waste without legal authorization or in an inadequate manner as a crime against the environment and public health; it calls for penalties ranging from six months to two years imprisonment for those responsible. The representative of the Green Party in the Federal Chamber cited cases of damage caused by the irresponsible handling of toxic substances such as contamination--with mercury and lead--of at least 50 children in Vila dos Pescadores, in Cubatao (SP [Sao Paulo]) and secret dumps of HBC, known as drill dust in Cidade de Meninos, Caxias (RJ). Due to current flaws in legislation and monitoring difficulties, the participation of the environmental defense society and agencies becomes fundamental in stopping this kind of traffic to the underdeveloped countries. The Brazilian section of Greenpeace at the end of 1993 prevented a load of 200 t of waste containing heavy metals (arsenic, cadmium, mercury, lead, among others) from being "recycled" by the Produquimica Enterprise based in Suzano (SP) for the production of fertilizer. The waste was not biodegradable, and if it had been used in agriculture, it could contaminate workers and consumers. The Sao Paulo enterprise purchased a load from the British metallurgical firm of Beaver Metals located in Birmingham in the form of "micronutrient for fertilizer production." Alerted by Greenpeace, which analyzed the waste in Great Britain, the State Basic Sanitation Technology Company (CETESB) seized the cargo of 10 containers in the port of Santos to check the product's makeup. Days later, a new lot of nine containers holding the same cargo arrived at the terminal in Sao Paulo. CETESB proved that the products were toxic. Although it was toxic material, the cargo could have legally entered the country if Produquimica had been registered with IBAMA. Because the importing company did not take care of this legal obligation, CETESB had a tool for demanding the return of the cargo to England, a transaction that was completed in January. According to company owner Gerard Walter Schultz, importing micronutrients does not have to be authorized by environmental agencies because those nutrients are not characterized as toxic waste, something that was denied by the analysis done by CETESB. The Sao Paulo enterprise was fined more than 20 times by CETESB for irregular dumping of waste in flowing waters, soil contamination due to improper storage of toxic material, exaggerated emission of particles into the atmosphere, and use of equipment without installation license issued by CETESB. Produquimica has until 30 June to transfer the Suzano factory located in a watershed protection area.
