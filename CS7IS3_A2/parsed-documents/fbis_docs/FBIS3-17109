Enterprises are closing down one after the other. Tens of thousands of workers are out of a job, and more still have been forced to take unpaid leave. The budget deficit has hit 100 billion karbovantsy. The budget planned by the government for this year does not even have sufficient funds to pay miners' wages. Because of the total bankruptcy of the city coffers, the socioeconomic program, which requires, according to the most modest calculations, 4.5 trillion karbovantsy, has been ruined. Thus the city deemed the world's most flourishing young industrial center by UNESCO 20 years ago is falling into decline. Now the sole hope left to the Donbass is for implementation of the president's edict granting economic autonomy to the four oblasts of southeast Ukraine, which will open the way to revive links with Russia and cut contributions to the state budget. But for now, unfortunately, owing to existing laws restricting self-management in the localities, the oblast administrations are unable to make use of the edict. And Kiev's legislators have no particular wish to modify the laws. So Oblast Soviet deputies decided during the parliamentary elections to conduct a consultative poll of the population asking the questions: "Do you support a federative-regional structure for Ukraine?" and "Are you in favor of Ukraine joining the CIS as a full member?" Although the poll has no legal force, it will serve as another reminder to the authorities of the view of the inhabitants of the most industrialized region. Moreover even today, to judge from sociological polls, it is clear that 90 percent will respond to these questions in the affirmative. And there is nothing surprising in this. If the industrial Donbass were offered full autonomy in the quest for markets and raw material suppliers, if it were to be rid of at least part of the excessive yoke of customs duties, then it would, experts believe, succeed quite quickly in stabilizing its economy, which would ultimately have a beneficial effect on Ukraine as a whole. One more vital question for voters is included: "Do you agree that Ukraine should have a second state language -- Russian?" All oblasts in the southeast of the republic, without exception, favor bilingualism. And they are awaiting an appropriate amendment from the new parliament on this issue.
