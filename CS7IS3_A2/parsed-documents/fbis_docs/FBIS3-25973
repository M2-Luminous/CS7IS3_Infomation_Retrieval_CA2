In early spring, about 130 Spanish economic figures came with their Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, who was the first foreign government leader to visit China in the year. Then, within several months, more entrepreneurs came with the Singaporean prime minister, Philippine president, Malaysian prime minister and Thai prime minister. A 50-member economic delegation accompanied Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin on his China tour, and many leaders of world- renowned corporations came in the company of German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Delegations with the prime ministers from Austria and New Zealand and the president of Mexico were also well stocked with people from their economic circles. Observers noted here that so many economic delegations came to visit China along with the top leaders of their countries was a new development in recent years, last year in particular. The development, they said, indicated that the economic circles of foreign countries attached greater importance to the Chinese market, and that Sino-foreign exchanges are becoming more pragmatic. During their visit, foreign entrepreneurs saw for themselves the achievements China has made in the reform and opening drive, and this helped enhance their interest in investing in China. They made extensive contacts with people from the Chinese economic circles, and signed many documents of cooperation. Several cooperative agreements were reached between China and Spain; with the Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia, China signed nine, ten and 30 agreements, respectively; over 20 Sino-German agreements were signed last year, worth 2.8 billion U.S. dollars. More important, the visits indicated that China's trade partners, such as Thailand and Malaysia, the Western developed countries and the Latin-American countries are attaching great importance to developing bilateral trade and economic ties with China. Their governments also encouraged their economic circles to invest in China. Almost all leaders expressed such intention during their stay in China. Prime Minister Gonzalez told Chinese and Spanish entrepreneurs that investors should choose regions where long-term economic growth could be maintained, and China is such a region. "The Spanish Government is aware of it, and will support investment in China," he said. According to Goh Chok Tong, Singaporean prime minister, his government encourages its people to invest abroad, and China is the place to which "they should give priority". Fidel Ramos, president of the Philippines, said that his government wants every Philippine businessman to see China personally and get to know China's economic achievements of recent years. Chancellor Kohl also said that Germany is "very interested" in developing relations, especially economic and trade cooperation, with China. On the other hand, the entrepreneurs got pledges from the Chinese Government that the country will stick to its reform and opening policy. Premier Li Peng told visiting Spanish entrepreneurs that China will open wider to Western countries, including opening markets previously restricted in China. When meeting with German economic figures, Premier Li Peng said that the socialist market economy should be connected with the world economy, and he expressed his hope that foreign investors would put their investments into construction in the fields of infrastructure, such as transportation, energy and telecommunications. Observers said that the visits by such a large number of entrepreneurs with heads of state or government showed that Sino-foreign economic and trade cooperation will develop further in the years to come, and such cooperation will be of mutual benefit.
