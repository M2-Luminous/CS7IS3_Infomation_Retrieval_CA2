The majority of the journalists' questions referred to the cease-fire agreement -- an agreement which the Croatian side had put forward -- and the status of Neum. We are singling out as particularly important remarks made by the Croatian president regarding the results and conclusions of the NATO summit in Brussels: [Begin Croatian President Franjo Tudjman recording] It was with great expectations that the world awaited the NATO conclusions. As far as we are concerned, we can be pleased with those points referring to the crisis in former Yugoslavia, particularly the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. These conclusions for the first time show a higher level of resolve to apply force, air strikes not only against those who are strangling Sarajevo, but also against those who are preventing the passage of humanitarian aid, and also against those who are threatening certain areas by their offensive combat operations. This is very important for us, as this directly refers to the current Muslim offensive in central Bosnia. From that point of view, it seems that these conclusions will also contribute to speeding up and concluding negotiations on restoring peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. [end recording]
