Life continued as normal in the neighboring nation, whose inhabitants seem more interested in resolving the issue of sustenance -- cut off to a great extent by the harsh sanctions imposed against the military authorities -- than alarmed by the threat of a foreign invasion. It was not until early this morning when, in a significant move, Jonassaint, who is not recognized worldwide, urged fellow countrymen via radio and television to unite and resist in light of the possibility of the eventual use of force to restore ousted Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power. Although he did not specify the measures involved in the imposed state of emergency, Jonassaint ordered the urgent preparation of troops. This is taking place shortly after the tightening of restrictions by U.S. President Bill Clinton, who seeks the removal of coupist General Raoul Cedras and his supporters through the suspension of commercial flights and the elimination of financial operations. Despite this step, Clinton has not entirely rejected the military option. A cold U.S. reaction followed the announcement in Port-au- Prince. This reaction came about when William Gray, Clinton's representative for Haitian affairs, doubted that Jonassaint's declaration will have any effect. In the first official statement by the White House, Gray refused to refer to the possibility of military intervention in Haiti, but conceded that it is one of the options available to the U.S. President.
