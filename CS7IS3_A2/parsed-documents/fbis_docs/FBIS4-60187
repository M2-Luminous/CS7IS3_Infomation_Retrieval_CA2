The movement called the move high treason against God, the homeland, and the people. In a statement it issued today, the Renaissance Movement emphasized that it supports the legal leadership as it defends Yemen's unity, and urged the unionists inside the YSP -- the top and lower echelons alike -- to speak out against this step and join a national effort to thwart that evil plan.
