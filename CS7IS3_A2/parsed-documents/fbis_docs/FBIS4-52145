The accord was reached when Japanese International Trade and Industry Minister Hata met with Brown during an east-west conference of trade ministers that was held in Warsaw for two days until Saturday. Hata told a news conference that he and Brown shared the view that an early resumption of the framework talks would meet expectations not only of both countries but of the global community. But he said he has clarified anew to Brown Tokyo's stance against numerical targets as a tool to measure foreign access to Japanese markets. Hata said the meeting with Brown did not touch on specifics of three U.S. demands presented to Tokyo earlier as conditions to resume the framework talks. But both parties agreed that accords on the conditions should be struck before the July summit of the seven leading economic powers in Naples, Hata said. During the April meeting between then Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, now prime minister, and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor in Marrakech, Morocco, Washington demanded that Japan offer new proposals on a macroeconomic policy, overall goals of the framework talks and "objective criteria" to gauge openness of Japan's markets. On the recent controversial remarks by former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano over the 1937 Nanjing massacre, the trade minister said the cabinet of Prime Minister Hata has been "damaged greatly." Japan should "deepen its regret" over wartime conducts toward the next year's 50th anniversary of the end of World War II, Hata said. Nagano said in an interview with a newspaper that the Nanjing massacre was a fabrication, a remark sparking global criticism and forcing his resignation as justice minister.
