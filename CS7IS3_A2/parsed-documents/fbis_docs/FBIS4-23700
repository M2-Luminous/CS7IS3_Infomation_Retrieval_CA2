A common theme in creating the new towns, however, is that emphasis has firmly been placed on socio-economic and demographic considerations. The new municipal areas have to be economically viable and represent a fair population mix of both rich and poor, thereby equally distributing the burden of reconstruction, according to sources within the Central Witwatersrand Metropolitan Chamber negotiating forum. A transitional metropolitan council (TMC) for the central Witwatersrand area is due to be in place within weeks to oversee the creation of non-racial town councils in the area and prepare for local government elections next year. Johannesburg and Soweto are one of several major urban areas which will have a metropolitan council to assist in the integration and co-ordination of urban economies. It will legislate over the town councils in its metropolitical jurisdiction. The Metropolitan Chamber negotiating forum is busy drawing up the internal and external boundaries of the TMC, which will legislate for the present areas of Greater Johannesburg and Soweto. In the next few weeks there will be intense debate on the proposals handed in by the city and town councils, and on the proposals to be handed in next week by the ANC and its alliance of civic organisations. There are two major points of departure that have to be ironed out before a final constitution for the TMC and its metropolitan substructures (municipalities) is mapped out. One is the power to be vested in the metropolitan authority, including who gets to redistribute the revenue generated in the region, and the other is the size of the new municipalities. The statutory side have proposed that the present racially fragmented system of local government in the province be rationalised by establishing eight local councils on the basis of redrawn boundaries. The approximate size of each new municipality would be 400,000 people per local council, although they would differ in size. Dr Harry Formanek, who represents several Randburg ratepayer and resident federations and sits on the Metropolitan Chamber committee responsible for investigating new boundaries, warns that the maps being released now are merely scenarios and will still change significantly. "There are maps floating around all over the place and everyone has a different idea. These are proposals based on economic reality and boundary reality," he says. The city and town councils also want future local councils to control their own budgets, subject to the obligation to deliver the minimum standards of service set out by the metropolitan government; separate administrative infrastructure for the metropolitan government and the local councils to perform the powers and functions allocated to them; and a single metropolitan-wide property valuation roll. It is known that the non-statutory bodies on the Metropolitan Chamber believe that all revenue generated by the new municipal areas should be given to the TMC on the basis of one municipality, one tax base, to redistribute the money where needed. The ANC and its alliance partners in the Metropolitan Chamber are expected to table the creation of more than 12 new municipalities under the Witwatersrand metropolitan council, each with about 200,000 people within their boundaries. They also want "all powers currently exercised by apartheid local authorities and bodies to the immediately transferred to the TMC". The ANC and its partners also believe that attacking poverty and deprivation will be the first priority of the TMC. The statutory side also propose that "administrator bodies" be appointed for the existing local authorities to oversee the transfer of assets, rights and obligations to the TMC and relevant local councils, oversee budgets and ensure the continuation of services while the existing segregated councils are being dissolved. It has also been proposed that a reconstruction and development programme be agreed on for immediate implementation and a strategic management team be appointed to look after the metropolitan change-management process. Once the transitional metropolitan and municipal structures are in place in the Witwatersrand area -- hopefully before the end of the year -- the boundaries will be finalised and preparation for elections will begin. The holding of elections and the setting up of final structures is expected to take place in the second half of next year. The statutory bodies propose that 30 members be nominated by the Central Witwatersrand Metropolitan Chamber negotiating forum for each local council in the transitional phase and 60 members nominated for the TMC, with 10 elected for the TMC executive committee. Formanek urges all community organisations to get themselves involved now by attending the Metropolitan Chamber subcommittees on boundaries. "We need meaningful input and there is a distinct lack of community-based organisations on these forums. We need people to become involved now."
