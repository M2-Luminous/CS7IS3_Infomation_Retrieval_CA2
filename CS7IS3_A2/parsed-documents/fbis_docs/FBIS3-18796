The inflexible attitude by Spain and Britain toward Norway calls the already concluded agreements with Austria, Finland, and Sweden into question again, Deputy SPD Chairwoman Heidi Wieczorek-Zeul said in Bonn on Wednesday. The negotiations in Brussels have shown how necessary a reform of the Europan institutions is "at the head and at the limbs," if an expanded European Union wants to remain capable of acting.
