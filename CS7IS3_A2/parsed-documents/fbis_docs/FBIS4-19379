What has Turkey done after the latest Gorazde incident? What is the latest situation at the United Nations? [Batu] The Serbs have been attacking Gorazde for the past 17 days. We believe that these attacks can be stopped only by resorting to force. We have been explaining our position to our friends insistently. We have activated the Islamic Conference Organization [ICO] contact group. We took several steps. I believe that the two air raids were finally carried out thanks to the ICO representations led by Turkey. These were insufficient, however. In fact, they were so insufficient and weak that the aggressor became even more daring. We are concerned, very concerned. We are sad because the UN Security Council which merely watched the developments reach the present situation continued to be disorganized and helpless today as well. I have been calling the term president of the Security Council since this morning. So has the Bosnia-Herzegovina representative. The term president does not even answer the calls. There is no action on the part of the five big powers. I repeat: Gorazde is a so-called secure region. Who is supposed to make it secure? The United Nations. What kind of security is this? [Kiraz] Thank you, sir. [Batu] I thank you.
