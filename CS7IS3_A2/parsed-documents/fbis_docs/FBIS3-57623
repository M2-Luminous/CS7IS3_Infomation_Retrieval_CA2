First, it "provides our politicians with important, sometimes unique...analytical materials warning of the potential dangers being encountered" by Russia. Second, U.S. intelligence is "continuing to keep track of the location and condition of about 27,000 Russian nuclear warheads." The third area of its work pertaining to Russia continues to be the "monitoring of the state of the Russian Federation general-purpose Armed Forces," James Woolsey said. The fourth major area is the "analysis of Russia'a policy vis-a-vis its neighbors."
