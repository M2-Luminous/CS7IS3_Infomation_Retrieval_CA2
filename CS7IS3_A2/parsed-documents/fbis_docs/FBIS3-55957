The enemy launched several futile attacks against our positions in Fizulinskiy and Terterskiy rayons through the day on 10 January and the morning of 11 January. Our troops bravely halted the attacks and inflicted crushing blows on the enemy. According to information obtained from the occupied lands, the Armenian troops are abandoning their positions in panic and are fleeing toward Armenia. Clashes are taking place between those fleeing in disarray and fighters coming from Armenia. It appears that Armenia's military command has been left with no choice but to institute punishment measures to prevent the mass desertions.
