This crisis began last week when 15 MP's (almost a third of the parliament) had left the parliament hall signifying their protest against the signing of the Bishkek Protocol. This action of the MPs has deprived the parliament of quorum without which the parliament can not fulfil its work. Yesterday, the parliament appealed to the President Aliyev and requested him to reduce the quorum from 34 to 26 voices. A proper draft law was presented to the president. "It is the most acceptable measure to find a way from the crisis,' the parliaments speaker said. There were other proposals of the MP's, e.g. to appeal to the "rebellios" MPs and make a request for cooperation. According to the premier Surat Guseynov, it is necessary to do "for the sake of national accord." There also was a radical proposal to dismiss the parliament and delegate its powers to the president.
