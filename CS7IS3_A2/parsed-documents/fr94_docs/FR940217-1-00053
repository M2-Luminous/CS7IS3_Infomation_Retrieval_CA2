FR940217-1-00053 FR940217-1-00013 The salamander was first observed at Sunken Garden Springs on January 12, 1993 (TPWD 1993). Five or fewer individuals have been sighted on any given visit to this outlet (Chippindale, pers. comm., 1993). Biologists had speculated that the salamander occurred at Sunken Garden Springs; however, no salamanders were observed during previous surveys conducted at this location between 1987 and 1992. Low water levels and the presence of large rocks and sediment in the pool reportedly make searching for salamanders difficult at this location (TPWD 1993). The extent to which the salamander occurs in the aquifer is unknown. However, there is currently no evidence indicating that the species' range extends beyond the immediate vicinity of Barton Springs. Surveys of other spring outlets (including the spring outlet immediately above Barton Springs Pool) in the Barton Springs segment and other portions of the Edwards Aquifer have failed to locate additional populations (Chippindale et al. 1993; William Russell, speleologist; Hillis; Price; Sweet; pers. comms., 1993). No other species of Eurycea is known to occur in this portion of the aquifer. The Barton Springs salamander's diet is believed to consist almost entirely of amphipods (Chippindale et al. 1993). Primary predators are believed to be fish and crayfish (Chippindale, Hillis, Price, pers. comm., 1993). Observations of larvae and females with eggs (Chippindale et al. 1993) indicate successful breeding is occurring. The species may breed year-round (Chippindale, pers. comm., 1993). The water that discharges at Barton Springs originates from the Barton Springs segment of the Edwards Aquifer (hereafter referred to as the ``Barton Springs segment''). The Barton Springs segment covers roughly 400 square kilometers (155 square miles) from southern Travis County to northern Hays County, Texas. The approximate boundaries are the ``bad water'' line to the east (where dissolved solids are less than 1,000 milligrams/l (mg/l) (1,000 parts per million) in the aquifer, but greater than this to the east); the Colorado River to the north; the geologic divide between contiguous Edwards limestones overlying the aquifer and the Glen Rose limestones to the west; and a groundwater divide occurring roughly between the Onion Creek and Blanco River watersheds to the south. The area south of the southern boundary is known as the San Antonio segment of the Edwards Aquifer and drains toward San Marcos Springs. Groundwater movement from the San Antonio segment northward to the Barton Springs segment is believed to occur only during extreme drought conditions. North of the southern boundary, the water in the aquifer moves toward Barton Springs (Slade et al. 1986). Barton Springs drains about 391 square kilometers (151 square miles) of the Barton Springs segment. The remaining 10 square kilometers (4 square miles) discharge at Cold and Deep Eddy Springs and are believed to be hydrologically distinct from the area discharging to Barton Springs. Cold and Deep Eddy Springs are recharged by Dry Creek and a portion of Barton Creek. About 96 percent of all springflow from the aquifer discharges through Barton Springs. The remaining 4 percent exits through intermittent springs, most of which are located in Barton Creek between Loop 360 and Barton Springs. These springs flow only about 30 percent of the time and discharge up to 170 liters per second (l/s) (6 cubic feet per second (cfs)). The long-term mean discharge from Barton Springs is about 1,400 l/s (50 cfs), ranging from 283 l/s (10 cfs) to 4,700 l/s (166 cfs) (Slade et al. 1986). The mean water temperature is 20 ○C (68 ○F) (Martyn-Baker et al. 1992). The Barton Springs segment is divided into two major zones, the recharge zone and artesian zone. The recharge zone is that portion of the aquifer where Edwards limestones are exposed at the surface, and covers the western 79 percent (about 233 square kilometers (90 square miles)) of the aquifer. The artesian zone is confined by an impermeable layer of Del Rio clay and covers the eastern 21 percent of the aquifer. About 85 percent of all recharge is through sinkholes, fractures, and other openings in the beds of six major creeks that cross the recharge zone, including (from north to south) Barton, Williamson, Slaughter, Bear, Little Bear, and Onion creeks. The remaining 15 percent of recharge is through tributaries and direct infiltration between the creeks (Slade et al. 1986).
