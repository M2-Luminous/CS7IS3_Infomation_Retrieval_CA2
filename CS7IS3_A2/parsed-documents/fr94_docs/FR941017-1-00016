Submission of Comments in Electronic Format The comment process will be improved if each comment is identified with the document title, section heading, and paragraph number addressed. Commenters are encouraged to submit, in addition to the original paper copy, a copy of the letter in electronic format on 5.25 or 3.5 inch computer diskette; IBM PC/DOS or MS/DOS format. Data files should be provided in one of the following formats: WordPerfect, IBM Document Content Architecture/Revisable-Form-Text (DCA/RFT), or unformatted ASCII code. The format and version should be identified on the diskette's external label. X. Questions In addition to soliciting comments on all aspects of this rulemaking, the Commission specifically requests comments on the following questions. A. Nonseismic Criteria 1. Should the dose acceptance criteria be modified from 25 rem whole body and 300 rem to the thyroid to utilize the concept of total effective dose equivalent (TEDE), and if so, what TEDE value should be adopted? 2. Assuming that a dose acceptance criterion of 25 rem total effective dose equivalent (TEDE) is adopted, should an organ limitation or ``capping'' dose be included, and if so, what should such a limit be? XI. Finding of No Significant Environmental Impact: Availability The Commission has determined under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in Subpart A of 10 CFR Part 51, that this proposed regulation, if adopted, would not be a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment and therefore an environmental impact statement is not required. The revisions associated with the reactor siting criteria in 10 CFR part 100 and the relocation of the plant design requirements from 10 CFR part 100 to 10 CFR Part 50 have been evaluated against the current requirements. The Commission has concluded that relocating the requirement for a dose calculation to Part 50 and adding more specific site criteria to part 100 does not decrease the protection of the public health and safety over the current regulations. The proposed amendments do not affect nonradiological plant effluents and have no other environmental impact. The addition of ยง100.23 to 10 CFR part 100, and the addition of appendix S to 10 CFR part 50, will not change the radiological environmental impact offsite. Onsite occupational radiation exposure associated with inspection and maintenance will not change. These activities are principally associated with base line inspections of structures, equipment, and piping, and with maintenance of seismic instrumentation. Base line inspections are needed to differentiate between pre-existing conditions at the nuclear power plant and earthquake related damage. The structures, equipment and piping selected for these inspections are those routinely examined by plant operators during normal plant walkdowns and inspections. Routine maintenance of seismic instrumentation ensures its operability during earthquakes. The location of the seismic instrumentation is similar to that in the existing nuclear power plants. The proposed amendments do not affect nonradiological plant effluents and have no other environmental impact. The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact on which this determination is based are available for inspection at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC. Single copies of the environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact are available from Mr. Leonard Soffer, Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, telephone (301) 415&hyph;6574, or Dr. Andrew Murphy, Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, telephone (301) 415&hyph;6010. XII. Paperwork Reduction Act Statement This proposed regulation amends information collection requirements that are subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ). This proposed regulation has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review and approval of the paperwork requirements. There is no public reporting burden related to the nonseismic siting criteria. Public reporting burden for the collection of information related to the seismic and earthquake engineering criteria is estimated to average 800,000 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to the Information and Records Management Branch (T&hyph;6 F33), U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555; and to the Desk Officer, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, NEOB&hyph;10202, (3150&hyph;0011 and 3150&hyph;0093), Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503. XIII. Regulatory Analysis The Commission has prepared a draft regulatory analysis on this proposed regulation. The analysis examines the costs and benefits of the alternatives considered by the Commission. The draft analysis is available for inspection in the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC. Single copies of the analysis are available from Mr. Leonard Soffer, Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, telephone (301) 415&hyph;6574, or Dr. Andrew J. Murphy, Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, telephone (301) 415&hyph;6010.
