The percentages attributable to logging injuries are particularly large in relation to the total employment in the industries represented. Using employment rates for 1985&hyph;1989 for the private sector and for the logging industry, OSHA observes that the percentage of accidents recorded on the FRSI for logging for each year far exceeded the percentage of employees in logging compared with the private sector. Whereas, logging employment constituted one tenth of one percent of total private sector employment, the reports of serious accidents in logging averaged about two percent of the total accidents. Table 18 lists these employment rates as they appear in the BLS annual reports entitled, Occupational Injuries and Illnesses in the United States by Industry, (followed by the year of the data). (See section A above.)
