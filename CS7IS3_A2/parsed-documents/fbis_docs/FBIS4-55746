It was very important for LE FIGARO to interview you before you arrived in Paris, to discuss a number of topical issues with you. I am very impressed that you have accepted -- which to my mind is a sign of confidence -- that this interview should take place in the form of a conversation, which will be more interesting for our readers than mere answers often formulated in formal and dull words. So, once more, I feel very honored and, at the same time, also much indebted to you. Of course, I would like to ask you some questions. I think that they have already sent you a list of them. My first question refers to a question that crops up in the heads of the French people, who saw the Romanian revolution from a great distance and got a tragic impression, and who today wonder whether it was actually a real revolution and not merely a case of certain people changing offices. I will entrust you with a personal experience: I have not been to Romania since 1986; yesterday I had the occasion to meet with some fellow journalists and I have to tell you that the image that I gained about the freedom of press here, to my mind, represents the sign of a genuine democracy; that is what it all boils down to. However, it is also true that, in the eyes of the French, Romania to a certain extent continues to be an enigma. Has a revolution taken place? Could the former communist leaders really become today's democrats? [Iliescu] What is revolution? It means a radical change in social life. Here we should not advance subjective judgments, but rather look at the facts as they are and make an objective analysis of the real facts. I believe that there are two fundamental elements that determine whether or not a movement is a revolution. First, the participation of the population in bringing about the change. In Romania, it was a genuine popular movement, it was a popular explosion. Of course, one can discuss the violent nature of the Romanian revolution as compared with all the changes that occurred in the other countries in Eastern Europe. What was the origin of its violent nature? This was determined by the very nature of the regime, of the old system, which made it impossible to discuss even a few possible changes, as was the case in the Soviet Union under Gorbachev and his "perestroyka." To what extent "perestroyka" really led to changes is a different matter. But many changes occurred all over Europe and even in the Soviet Union. However, those were changes confined to the system. In Hungary they begin to prepare the changes while still under the Soviet occupation. During the Kadar regime there was an opening toward a market economy. In Czechoslovakia there was an inner process for a generally more balanced society, because that was one of the most developed countries in that part of Europe and, before the war, anywhere in Europe. This was so because Czechia used to be the industrial center of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire and between the two world wars in terms of its general economic and industrial level Czechoslovakia was ahead of France, Belgium, and Germany. This conferred a certain kind of balance to its development even under the communist regime, and it also led to the Czechoslovak revolution, defined as the "velvet revolution." In Romania such a thing was not possible. There used to be an extremely rigid system, which made any changes from the inside impossible, and which accumulated very grave tensions in the economy, social life, and in one's ability to express oneself. You said that you last visited Romania in 1986. You know very well that the people used to be suffocated. There was no way in which they could freely express themselves. What a pity, because in the 1960's Romania had been among the vanguard. The first step came in 1958 with the pullout of the Soviet troops. I believe that it was a success of the then political leadership of Romania, which in subsequent years created the alteration in the political orientation of the country. In the years of 1963-1964 the well known dispute took place between Romania and the Soviet Union in connection with Khrushchev's plan to integrate the economies of the satellite countries within the economy of the USSR. In 1964 an official declaration was issued against such dominating tendencies of the USSR. Thus, all these things contributed to certain alterations in the political thinking and, generally speaking, in the political climate in our country. During this period the release of all political prisoners took place, as well as an intellectual and cultural opening up, an opening up toward Western Europe, and an opening up in technology, achieved through numerous accords and acts of scientific, technological, and industrial cooperation. They began with Renault, then with Citroen, and then the helicopters. There was a certain kind of penetration of modern technology and numerous attempts were made to modernize the economy. In 1967 a discussion even took place related to the need for our orientation toward the market economy within the framework of a "socialist-type" economy, as they used to term it in those days. But a fundamental discussion did take place in connection with this issue. At that time it was solely the Romanians and the Czechs who were openly discussing the objective need for changing the way in which the national economy was being run. There were discussions on issues connected with modern management. In economics and social life a special school was set up to train management. Informatics was being promoted, Romania being among the vanguard in that trend. Cooperation was initiated with the French for the production of Romanian-made Felix-type computers, the first of this type of computer, and for the assimilation, in general terms, of this kind of technology. All this means that there was an opening up in the 1960's, which Ceausescu managed to crush after 1971 and especially in the 1980's. Thus, it was the harsh nature of this regime that determined the change in Romania, with its violent popular explosion as a consequence of the very grave internal tensions within society, to which one can add the influence of the movements that had already begun in neighboring countries. This is one of the distinctive features. Here is the second: A popular movement could have taken place, it is true, without bringing about any changes whatsoever, as you said. A few individuals could have taken over the leadership of the country and everything would have stayed the same. But is this the case here? An objective analysis, rather than a subjective one, has to be done of what has happened in Romania over the past four years. One can also assess these things by relating to the manifesto of the Romanian revolution, to the 10 points of the Proclamation that I read out on television in front of the entire society, and which found unanimous support. One would find that all those points have been put into practice and have been included in the new Constitution of the country. In everyday life, as you said, there is total liberation, freedom of expression, organization, and assembly, new parties have emerged, and there is the idea of the multi-party system, in which our political life, generally, has been conceived. We even have 200 registered parties. Over 90 parties... [punctuation as published] [Mirot] This is an aspect pertaining to the Latin character: Like France, politics is also considered a sport and an art. [Iliescu] But it is also an objective aspect. After quite a long period of suffocation, people wanted to manifest their diversity. I consider this an objective phenomenon. It is a natural reaction. Human society is an entity consisting of diversity, even personal ones; there are about 6 billion of us living on this planet, that is, about 6 billion different personalities. To suffocate them is stupidity. Therefore, the normal reaction of the people was to express this diversity of theirs -- hence the explosion in the number of parties and newspapers. [Mirot] Exactly as in France after its liberation. [Iliescu] It is a general phenomenon. After this, I believe we took very great steps toward structuring a law-governed state. Immediately after the revolution, within the first month, there were already 30 parties. We set up a kind of a provisional parliament, the Provisional National Unity Council [CPUN]. We discussed and passed an electoral law, which also included certain constitutional principles, because we had abolished the old constitution. Then, in May 1990, the first elections took place for Parliament, which also had the role of a constituent assembly. Our first task was the drafting of a constitution. A modern and democratic constitution was devised. This was a democratic process in itself, as it was done on the basis of general consultations -- we organized a commission of deputies, senators, and experts in constitutional law; three months' work was spent just on research on our national experience, studying all the constitutions that we ever had, contemporary legislation, and the most characteristic, the most significant constitutions existing in the world; a great number of discussions and consultations with experts took place; in Bucharest they organized an international seminar on current tendencies in the domain of constitutional rights. On this basis the first draft of the constitution was drawn up. It was then published and discussed for two months; following this, over four months, Parliament discussed it point by point, article by article, and about 1,000 amendments were made. A new draft was then drawn up, which incorporated all these amendments. This again was followed by two and a half months of debates, discussing even details of the way in which it was formulated. This was followed by a vote and a nation- wide referendum for the adoption of the Constitution. All this means that we have a Constitution that is the expression of a democratic process and that expresses, by its contents, our lining up with the most modern tendencies in the life of democratic states. On the basis of this Constitution local and national elections were held in 1992. This means that we have gone through a number of radical changes in the last four years and have restructured the state in all its components, proceeding from the principle of the separation of powers in the state. In this respect, we set up new institutions on the basis of the new Constitution. This has been done on the political plane. On the economic plane, an instinctive tendency to destroy the centralized state system that coordinated the entire national economy has been manifest. The first months were characterized by a general dismantling of these centralized structures, something that obviously had negative consequences as well, since major disruptions occurred everywhere, which cost us quit a lot. However, that was a reaction to the very centralized system of our national economy. A decisive turn was taken toward promoting a profound economic reform and the transition from a supercentralized economy, with its own structures, mechanisms, legislation, and institutional forms, to a market economy. However, the economy and economic system contain greater inertia than the political system and this is the most difficult sphere for all of us. We have made many changes and have created a new economic framework. We worked out new legislation; I believe that we have more than 150 laws on the economic changes. Nevertheless, there are still many things still to be done. We took steps to liberalize prices, foreign trade, and trade in general. We took steps to promote privatization and encouraged investment from abroad. We took steps to liberalize the national currency -- total liberalization will follow shortly -- but it all takes time. On the other hand, all these abrupt changes have led to some very serious internal disruptions, to which one should add foreign international factors, such as the dismantling of CEMA [Council for mutual Economic Assistance] and the disappearance of our traditional markets, partners, and sources of energy and raw materials. It is obvious that this has had a directly negative effect, particularly on industrial production. We are currently working at half capacity in industry. Then there followed the Gulf crisis, the embargo against Yugoslavia, and the world and European recession, all of which are influencing this process. Hence, this decrease in production, to which one should add that we were confronted with a very tough drought for three years and with the dismantlement of the agricultural cooperative farms -- that was another reaction to an objective situation, namely the state's brutal interference in the life of the cooperative farms, which led to a reaction against them. But these structures have nothing to do with communist structures, despite the fact that there are even some primitive slogans claiming that they are communist structures. Cooperatives have existed for thousands of years in all countries with agricultural traditions. The cooperative movement is very strong in France, Italy, and other European countries. On the other hand, you have the people's normal reaction against the cooperatives, which were looked upon as state structures. On the other hand, there were political forces which made a lot of hullabaloo about this problem of the "old structures." However, this cost us, since the cooperatives were dismantled. We worked out a Land Law, but we could have preserved the extant organizational and management structures. You see, there is this confusion between the ownership structure and management, that is, the administration of agricultural fields. We have abolished all this, with the end result that we now have more than 5 million owners of 9 million hectares, which means an exaggerated fragmentation of the land, with all its implications for the activity in agriculture and the possibility of using mechanization, chemicalization, and technologies. [Mirot] Please tell us something about the belated process of privatization, where it seems that you have made rather slow progress. [Iliescu] First of all, let us wind up the first question. From a popular point of view, all this was a characteristic feature of the Romanian movement and the Romanian revolution. As far as changes are concerned, profound modifications took place, which transformed the physiognomy of Romanian society. Therefore, I believe that the two basic requirements for determining the nature of a revolution have been met; any other arguments are but slogans, politicking, and political struggle. Regarding political maneuvers, Iliescu is a "nobody," since for 20 years I have been removed from any political decision-taking process. I came into conflict with Nicolae Ceausescu in 1971, after his visit to Asian countries, particularly Korea. So, anything else is nothing but concoction and slogans. When one examines social phenomena, one should look at things from an objective angle, without hidden political and ideological motives and without ideological prejudices in this respect. [Mirot] What about the slow pace of privatization, since I do not want to call it a failure... [Iliescu] I do not think one can speak of a slow pace. There are two aspects involved here: the private sector and the privatization of large state-owned companies. I believe a great deal has been done with respect to privatization and the sustaining of the private sector. Immediately after the revolution, the CPUN passed a law, a law-decree, on the sustaining of the private sector of our economy. Currently there are half a million various private companies, which consist of one individual or one family, or they are small or medium-size companies. The opening was made especially in commerce. They are criticizing the somewhat oriental aspect of the small boutiques, the small booths in which things are sold. An explosion is taking place in this field. One could also regard it as a historic phenomenon, in the sense that capitalism is being rebuilt, and capital is being accumulated in the commercial sector; a small-scale initiative has manifested itself especially in the domain of commerce and services, but at the same time small and even medium-size companies have begun to emerge in industry, especially in the processing of agricultural products and food. Thus, there are currently about 500,000 such enterprises, with over 2 million employees, which represents a third of the labor force in our economy. So it is a sector that has become quite active and important. Currently these enterprises are also very active in the domain of exports. But there is a second aspect as well: the privatization of the state-owned companies. At the end of the first year after the revolution a law was passed on the reorganization of the former state-owned companies and two different sectors were established: public corporations and commercial companies -- we used the French model. The public corporations relate to the domain of infrastructure, and I think they will persist there for a long time -- in energy, the mining sector, railroads, and telecommunications. Then there is the industrial sector, with over 6,000 state-owned companies, among which are the great enterprises in the iron and steel industry, the oil processing industry, and so on. They are organized in the form of autonomous commercial companies. They are not led by ministries or other central bodies as they used to be; they will be subjected to the "great privatization." A law was passed on the privatization of those 6,000 companies and on the method that should be used to do it. The most difficult problem in the selling of those companies is the lack of capital. On the other hand, we thought of a kind of a social compensation, as all those enterprises have been built over the past 40 years by the efforts of the entire nation, of the people. Then Parliament included a stipulation in the law that says that 30 percent of social capital is to be distributed free among adult citizens who are over 18, and so ownership certificates have been distributed among all the citizens. Now we are all holders of such ownership certificates, which will have to be turned into shares as the privatization process goes ahead. Two institutions have been set up: One is the State Property Fund, controlled by Parliament, which is managing the remaining 70 percent of the social capital of those enterprises, and which also has to supervise the way in which those enterprises are being managed; the second is the Private Property Fund, which is managing the ownership certificates and the process of turning them into shares. These are the principal institutions dealing with the process of privatization. In addition to these, a government National Privatization Agency has also been set up, which in the beginning took care of the issue of these ownership certificates and their distribution among the citizens, and organized the first privatization, as a test, in the case of 30 enterprises, until the State Property Fund was set up, which took over from it, and so far it has privatized 450 companies. This means that out of those 6,000 enterprises 450 have already been privatized. However, as I have already said, the principal difficulty is the lack of capital. We are hoping for two things. First, a solution is currently being sought to boost the process of turning the ownership certificates into shares in the privatization of 2,000 enterprises. Second, we have the private sector that I already mentioned and to a certain extent capital has already accumulated there, so people might use it for that purpose. The banking sector has been reorganized. In the old system we merely had four commercial banks; under the circumstances of a state-planned system, the banking system plays quite a limited role. But now, after the explosion of the number of commercial and economic companies, banking operations have also expanded; currently there are 25 commercial banks and they still cannot cope with the demand for banking operations. And there is another difficulty, too, namely: the lack of capital of the banks on the one hand, and, on the other, the lack of capital of the enterprises. The enterprises have to resort to bank loans. The banks do not have the necessary resources, which results in a hindering, to a certain extent, of the whole process. Our case is different from that of Germany, where the eastern laender are being economically integrated... [Mirot] With the help of West Germany... [Iliescu] Yes, annually they inject $120 billion into that region. We requested a mere $1-billion loan from the Group of 24; they discussed it for over two years, and finally we were granted just half of this. Now we are again holding talks with the IMF and the Group of 24. We are holding talks related to certain preconditions; over the whole past year there was nothing but negotiations. We lack support from abroad. Our domestic resources have dropped together with a drop in production. Under the all these negative international circumstances, our foreign trade has also dropped. Our foreign trade has still not managed to become a source of hard currency; on the contrary, until now, over the past four years, our foreign trade balance has been continuously in the red. This means that we lack the necessary hard currency to sustain our national currency. The drop in production, the drop in the value of our national currency, all of this has acted to fuel inflation, and inflation and unemployment are two of the most serious social phenomena. [Mirot] Do you have a feeling that Western Europe has tended more toward Central Europe while setting you somewhat aside? Do you believe that you have really been invited to join the European Economic Community, or rather that you are being handled a little... [Iliescu] In this connection I believe that everyone is dissatisfied, and not just us; even the Czechs are, although their situation is the best among all the other countries in the transition period -- they have a favorable economic situation, a hard currency surplus of $5 billion in their national bank, their foreign trade earns about $2 billion to $2.5 billion each year, which has created the conditions to have a stable national currency and keep inflation under control and unemployment low, at about 2-3 percent -- and yet even they are dissatisfied with the circumstances under which they have to cooperate with the West. The Hungarians and the Poles have no major reasons to be dissatisfied, since four years ago their national debt was already very large. Meanwhile they have doubled their debt, which means that they had access to already open financial sources, credits at commercial banks, and so they could double their foreign debt. You must remember that two years ago Mr. Walesa went on a marathon tour to obtain the rescheduling of their debt, and he managed to obtain $8 billion and a certain reduction of the debt. Romania has obtained nothing of this kind. So we have reasons not to be satisfied. We cannot reproach anyone with anything, because in the field of economics there is no such thing as human generosity; those are merely phrases used by politicians. In economics there is no criteria other than that of interest. We do not want disinterested assistance; however, we wish a stance of normal partnership, lacking all ideological bias, because all the countries of Central and Eastern Europe are going through the same process, which is a normal process of contemporary society and of our continent. It lies in the interest of all European countries that this general integration process should be facilitated within the framework of a joint process; because now there is not just a crisis among these countries. This is a period of general crisis in the European economy and the world economy, and owing to this, only integration achieved on the basis of a partnership among equals can lead to us jointly solving the problems facing all the countries. Even the developed countries have their own problems -- unemployment, with all its very serious social consequences -- but also entirely positive phenomena, that is, technological progress. However, technological progress that has very much penetrated the service sector has eliminated a great deal of the labor force from commerce and services of all kinds. Services represented the best alternative and chance for the Western European economies after the war. Under the circumstances of technological progress, which made many people superfluous in agriculture and industry, the third sector [services] represented the sole chance; now the third sector has been affected. This why even in the case of the developed countries, the sole chance is represented by integration, I mean normal integration without protectionism, without the arrogant stance adopted by the rich with respect to the poor, of the strong with respect to the weak, and without ideological bias, but rather by establishing the framework for a normal partnership. [Mirot] Before approaching foreign policy, let us exchange a few words about domestic policy. According to an IRSOP [Romanian Institute for Public Opinion Polling] poll, the opposition is rated as having 43 percent support, I believe. However, one should not rely too much on opinion polls as they are nothing but a snapshot. We could ask ourselves the following question: Does this mean that early elections will take place? Is this a fact that could persuade you to try and set up a coalition government -- recently you had contacts with certain parties -- or would you rather continue with the current formula until the end of your mandate in 1996? [Iliescu] To my mind both alternatives are acceptable. Regardless of the circumstances and the evolution of the balance of forces in our society, all governments, regardless of whom they consist of, will have to solve the same problems. They are problems related to Romania's transition, the continuation of the process of strengthening democracy, state structures, the efficiency of the state, and, especially, to solve the economic problems that currently represent the key issue: the restructuring of the economy on the basis of the laws of the market and the restructuring of industry in connection with the process of privatization. All these are mandatory elements for any government. Of course, nuances do exist, and there are differences between ways in which these problems can be solved. However, at the same time I believe that everything also depends on the status of each, of each party and of each person. One has one perspective when one belongs to the opposition -- it is always easier to criticize and one can always reveal new problems, concrete problems. However, the view of the people undergoes a fundamental change whenever they change this position. From this point of view I would prefer it if a change took place. Even after the last elections, in which we did not manage to have any party gain a majority in Parliament, I addressed an appeal to all the party leaders to find a solution or to set up a government of national unity. This was my first proposal and it was not advanced for any demagogic purposes. In the current difficult period, because we have lived through the harshest years over the past three years, I believe in the need for the unity of all political forces and for them to assume responsibility. However, my proposal was rejected by the leaders of a number of parties. Some of them even said, in a cynical way, that during very difficult times it would be extremely dangerous for them to assume the responsibility of governing. In that case they would be better advised to let others assume the responsibility, and, as far as they are concerned, perhaps they should wait, criticize, and accumulate political capital for the future. I proposed a safe coalition in order to have a stable majority. However, owing to the circumstances of the period, such a thing proved impossible. I then proposed a political pact, regardless of the government's structure, as that may change, in order to achieve an agreement on behalf of all the parties, following the example of Spain. I even appealed to the party leaders and distributed among them the text of the Moncloa Pact, which was a political pact concluded among all the political parties represented in Spain's Parliament, comprising a rather large array, ranging from Fraga Iribarne of the Falangists, to Santiago Carillo, the communist leader. It had never even crossed anyone's mind that a coalition could be established between the Falangists and the Communists. However, they all signed the joint document, which was an expression of a national platform and the political pledge of all of them to ensure normal development and a normal solution to the grave political, economic, and social problems that the country was facing. The pact had precisely three chapters: a political, an economic, and a social one. I expressed that idea of mine about having to try to establish a joint platform. We even began work on a draft for such a platform. However, when we began approaching the concrete problems, such as the organization of the government, of Parliament, and so on, it became impossible to reach an agreement. Now we are discussing those issues all over again. In December we resumed our negotiations with all the parties and also took up that idea again. Currently negotiations are taking place among the parties. We will see what happens. Anything is possible. They are even talking about early elections, although I do not believe that there is much enthusiasm in that direction. Everyone is talking about elections, but, at the same time, everyone considers that no essential changes would occur compared with the current situation. [Mirot] For one part of your electorate this would represent a risk. [Iliescu] Yes, it would be a risk. But above all, it would not be beneficial for the country. The electoral campaign would cause time to be wasted and it would generate general social tension. From this point of view I believe that our politicians are sufficiently realistic; they are talking about early elections, but, at the same time, they also express certain reserves. The current government is a minority government. This represents a difficulty. Thus, the government is compelled to negotiate continuously with everyone on each draft law. This process also causes tension in Parliament. Discussions are taking place without anyone knowing what the final conclusion will be. Probably solutions will be found that will be extremely difficult to put into practice, but I do not think that early elections will be held; not this year, anyway.
