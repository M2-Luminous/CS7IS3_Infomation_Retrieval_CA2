He told the Caribbean News Agency Dominica might go it alone, even though it was fully supportive of the strategy of using the Caribbean Community bloc vote to influence events at the international level. "Dominica is still undecided," he admitted. This followed reports that Caricom is throwing its weight behind Costa Rica's Foreign Minister Bernard Niehaus, for the post of secretary general of the OAS, to succeed Brazil's Joao Clemente Baena-Soares. Miguel Angel Burelli-Rivas of Venezuela is the other known candidate. According to Alleyne, the government here is still considering which way its vote will go at the March 27 special General Assembly when the new secretary general will be elected. "Our concern here is the interest of Dominica, and we're very conscious, very aware of the positions of various Latin American countries on the banana issue, which is a critical issue for the future of Dominica, the economy, and the life of its people," Alleyne said. "We have great difficulty supporting countries which have shown a total disregard for these crucial interests.... "Virtually every Latin American country, in fact, has taken a position which is contrary to our crucial interest." He said Dominica had taken the opportunity at Caricom forums to emphasize this difficulty in supporting Latin American countries not sympathetic to Dominica's banana problems. Banana-producing Latin American countries are trying to gain a larger share of the European market, a move Dominica and the other Windward Islands fear might destroy the Caribbean banana industry.
