Not so much because the Party of Serbian Unity promised on two occasions that Rugova "would be arrested," or "that the Party of Serbian Unity would find ways and means to bring Rugova to court if the present political leadership of the country did not do so," but because 11 members of his Defense Ministry have already been arrested. Rugova established an army of 40,000 soldiers, armed it, and prepared it for "the liberation of the republic of Kosova." There have been rumors about his detention since the time when he became chairman of the Albanian movement for the "republic of Kosovo." It is claimed, however, that the Serbian leadership opposed his detention as long as his activity was only verbal. The leadership tolerated his activities as long as he founded ministries of education, health, culture, sports, and such, which were not considered dangerous, but after it became known that he had also established a defense ministry that worked on establishing an army, things changed. The name Ibrahim Rugova is not mentioned in the indictment against the 11 members of the Defense Ministry. Anton Koljaj, his deputy, who is now on the run, is charged with the establishment of the ministry, but it is stated that it was established according to the instructions of the Democratic Alliance of Kosovo. The attorney general was asked by journalists whether Rugova would also be arrested, and he answered that "the authorities in charge were doing their job, that they were collecting facts and that only those people whom it was proved that they were engaged in illegal activities would be charged." Rugova can still perform his political activities freely, he is still receiving foreign delegations and is going on visits abroad, where he can meet Bujar Bukoshi, the prime minister in exile, and try to achieve recognition of the "republic of Kosovo." He also wants Kosovo to become an international protectorate, as a transitional period for secession from Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Whether Rugova will be arrested depends on the outcome of the trial against the 11 members of the Defense Ministry, which is still not known. Apart from that, everybody knows that the Albanian police exist, but proof has to be found. It would also be enough to arrest Rugova. There is another aspect of the "Rugova case." It is believed that there is more than enough proof for his detention, but "the present authorities must not do it because of the international community." Rugova has the image of a democrat and a man fighting for his aims with political means, so that his detention would upset the international community and affect the already unfavorable position of Serbia. Some people even think that the detention of Rugova's assistants and followers who were arrested for arms smuggling has the goal of making Rugova flee abroad, so that the present authorities do not have to arrest him. This would also have an additional effect. The Democratic Alliance of Kosovo would be dissolved, which would weaken the Albanian movement. The recent detentions of the illegal defense ministry members and the undermining of weapons supplies made it clear that illegal Albanian institutions would be treated more severely. It remains to be seen who has better nerves, the present Serbian leadership in tolerating Rugova's activities, or Rugova, who relies on international support and "indecisive Serbian authorities." When asked several days ago to comment on the announcement of his detention, Rugova answered: "I am here, they may come." This statement was interpreted as a provocation of the Serbian authorities, because Rugova pretended that he wanted to be arrested and tried, since this would make him "a living martyr."
