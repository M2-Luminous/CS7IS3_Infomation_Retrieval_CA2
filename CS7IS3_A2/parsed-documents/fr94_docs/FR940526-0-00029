FR940526-0-00029 FR940526-0-00012 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;60&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8918; AD 94&hyph;11&hyph;02 Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 767 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to all Boeing Model 767 series airplanes. This action requires repetitive detailed visual and eddy current inspections to detect cracks of certain midspar fuse pins, and replacement of any cracked midspar fuse pin with a new fuse pin. This amendment is prompted by reports of longitudinal fatigue cracks on certain midspar fuse pins installed on Boeing Model 767 series airplanes. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent loss of the strut and engine due to cracking of both fuse pins on the same strut. DATES: Effective June 10, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of June 10, 1994. Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before July 25, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;60&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, P.O. Box 3707, Seattle, Washington 98124&hyph;2207. This information may be examined at the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Tim Backman, Aerospace Engineer, Airframe Branch, ANM&hyph;120S, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;2776; fax (206) 227&hyph;1181. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The FAA has received several reports of longitudinal fatigue cracks on certain midspar fuse pins installed on Boeing Model 767 series airplanes. A total of five cracked fuse pins have been found on two airplanes that had accumulated between 15,628 and 23,056 total landings. Cracks were found on both midspar fuse pins of the same strut on one of these airplanes. A possible cause of this cracking is ovalization of the fuse pin due to stress. Results of testing of fuse pins having a design similar to those that cracked have revealed no significant reduction in shear strength with longitudinal cracks up to one inch in length. Cracking of both fuse pins on the same strut, if not corrected, could result in loss of the strut and engine. All reported cracks have occurred on midspar fuse pins having part number 311T3102&hyph;1. Midspar fuse pins having part numbers 311T3102&hyph;2 and 311T2102&hyph;1 are similar in design to the fuse pins on which cracking was found and, therefore, also are subject to the addressed unsafe condition. The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 767&hyph;54A0062, dated April 14, 1994, that describes procedures for repetitive detailed visual and eddy current inspections to detect cracks of certain midspar fuse pins, and replacement of any cracked midspar fuse pin with a new fuse pin. Accomplishment of these inspections will provide early detection of cracks in the midspar fuse pins of both struts. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other Model 767 series airplanes of the same type design, this AD is being issued to prevent cracking of both fuse pins on the same strut, which could result in loss of the strut and engine. This AD requires repetitive detailed visual and eddy current inspections to detect cracks of certain midspar fuse pins, and replacement of any cracked midspar fuse pin with a new fuse pin. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the alert service bulletin described previously. Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days. Comments Invited Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption ADDRESSES . All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would be needed. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;60&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES .
