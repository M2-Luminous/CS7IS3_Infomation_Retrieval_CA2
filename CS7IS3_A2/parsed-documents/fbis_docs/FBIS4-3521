The Nanping Prefecture deputies made many constructive suggestions on such issues as solving the price scissors between manufactured goods and farm produce, the high prices of agricultural means of productions, the further lightening of peasants' burdens, and the development of undertakings in grain production and greening. After listening to their opinions, Jia Qinglin and Huang Wenlin fully affirmed the achievements the prefect had scored, saying: The agriculture problem is an old one, but we must have a new approach to it. The party Central Committee and the State Council now have elevated to a new height the problem of agriculture and grain. Among reform, development, and stability, stability is of overriding importance. To maintain social stability, it is important to solve the price problem. The key to stabilizing prices is to vigorously develop agriculture, grain production, and the Shopping Basket Project. While guiding agricultural production in accordance with the laws governing the socialist market economy, we should continue to support agriculture, and to encourage villages, collectives, and peasants to invest more in agriculture. Jia Qinglin stressed: As for grain-producing areas, they should be encouraged even more to develop a diversified economy, town and township enterprises, and agricultural processing industries so as to boost peasants' income, and to promote their grain production by using industrial profits and the profits gained from developing economic undertakings to support the further development of agriculture. Nanping is the province's pilot city for establishing modern enterprise systems. He hoped that Nanping Prefecture would do a good job in this experiment and would create experience in changing the way state- owned enterprises operate and in enabling them to gradually become modern enterprises. He pointed out: Forestry, which is also a strong point of the prefecture, should be fully developed. On the basis of what was achieved last year, greater efforts should made in this regard this year. The Longyan Prefecture deputies aired their views on further supporting the construction of old revolutionary base areas, especially the construction of infrastructure. After listening to their opinions, Jia Qinglin and Huang Wenlin fully affirmed the gratifying successes achieved by the old revolutionary base areas in western Fujian, which had a poor foundation for economic development and were beset with difficulties. They said: To the prefecture, development is the last word. We should increase total quantity, augment strength, continue to implement the preferential policy of opening and developing mountain areas. At the same time, we should concentrate the use of limited funds on construction of selected projects, do a solid job in work to help the poor, and -- given the existence of poverty-stricken areas -- carry out the help-the-poor policy from generation to generation. Jia Qinglin hoped Longyan Prefecture would continue to carry on the old revolutionary base areas' glorious revolutionary tradition and would work hard so that the people of the old revolutionary base areas in western Fujian would shake off poverty and gain prosperity as soon as possible.
