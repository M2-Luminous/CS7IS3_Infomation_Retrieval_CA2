Of the total amount of funds for construction, 20 billion yuan will be provided for railroads and 15 billion for highways. China will build or rebuild a total of 3,000 km of railroad in Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi. The Nanning-Kunming Railroad, which is now being built at a greater speed, will probably go into service in 1996. The Yangpingguan-Chengdu section of the dual-track Baoji-Chengdu Railroad, which constitutes the northern passageway running through the hinterland of the northwestern region; the Chengdu-Daxian County Railroad, which constitutes the eastern passageway; and the Yunnan-Guangda Railroad, which constitutes the western passageway, are now all under construction and are scheduled for completion in late 1995. In addition, the project to electrify the Chengdu-Kunming Railroad, costing 2.6 billion yuan; the Chongqing-Daxian County Electric Railroad; the Wanxian County-Daxian County line; and the Neijiang-Kunming line, are under construction or will begin construction shortly and they are scheduled to go into service within this century. China will also build or rebuild 5,000 km of trunk highways in the three provinces and one autonomous region. Sichuan will invest 11.3 billion yuan in construction by building new highways and rebuilding old highways in an advanced principal highway network, which will be supported by water transport on the Chang Jiang, making key ports its joints and Chengdu and Chongqing the centers from which the network will extend in various directions. Sichuan will also build second-class (or first-class) highways which will be connected with the land-and-water coordinated transport networks in various prefectures, autonomous prefectures, and cities across the province. The networks are now connected by expressways and outbound waterways. The main highway linking Shanghai with Chengdu planned by the Communications Ministry will extend from Chengdu to Chongqing and Wanxian County and then proceed beyond Sichuan to other places. The highway will link Chongqing, Guiyang, Nanning, and the sea outlet in the Bacho Gulf. Under this plan, the first phase project will involve the building of 800 km of advanced highways, which will serve as the main framework, and the building or rebuilding of 2,000 km of regional trunk highways. The department concerned said foreign businessmen are welcome to invest in these projects.
