FR940503-2-00111 FR940503-2-00076 Wagner-Peyser Act Final Planning Allotments for Program Year (PY) 1994 AGENCY: Employment and Training Administration, Labor. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: This notice announces the final planning allotments for Program Year (PY) 1994 (July 1, 1994, through June 30, 1995) for basic labor exchange activities provided under the Wagner-Peyser Act. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert A. Schaerfl, Director, U.S. Employment Service, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., room N&hyph;4470, Washington, DC 20210. Telephone: (202) 219&hyph;5257 (this is not a toll-free number). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In accordance with Section 6(b)(5) of the Wagner-Peyser Act, the Employment and Training Administration is publishing final planning allotments for each State for Program Year (PY) 1994 (July 1, 1994, through June 30, 1995). Preliminary planning estimates were provided to each State on February 25, 1994. Funds are distributed in accordance with formula criteria established in Section 6 (a) and (b) of the Wagner-Peyser Act. Civilian labor force (CLF) and unemployment data for Calendar Year 1993 are used in making the formula calculations. The total amount of funds currently available for distribution is $832,856,000. The Secretary of Labor set aside 3 percent of the total available funds to assure that each State will have sufficient resources to maintain statewide employment services, as required by Section 6(b)(4) of the Act. In accordance with this provision, $24,396,018 is set aside for administrative formula allocation. These funds are included in the total planning allotment. The funds that are set aside are distributed in two steps to States which have lost in relative share of resources from the prior year. In Step 1, States which have a CLF below one million and are below the median CLF density are maintained at 100 percent of their relative share of prior year resources. The remainder is distributed in Step 2 to all other States losing in relative share from the prior year but which do not meet the size and density criteria for Step 1. Postage costs incurred by States during the conduct of employment service (ES) activities are billed directly to the Department of Labor by the U.S. Postal Service. The total final planning allotment reflects $19,655,400, or 2.36 percent of the total amount available, withheld from distribution to finance postage costs associated with the conduct of ES business. The Department had planned to require State Employment Security Agencies (SESAs) to convert from penalty mail systems to commercial mail systems effective October 1, 1994, at which time the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) had planned to allocate national postage reserves to the SESAs. Based on a legal opinion, the Department cannot require this conversion. SESAs are entitled to the penalty mail privilege pursuant to 39 U.S.C. 3202(a)(1)(E). This does not impact on the change to direct accountability that SESAs implemented on October 1, 1993. States will continue to use penalty mail systems (penalty meters, penalty stamps and envelopes, permit G&hyph;12, and Business Reply Mail permit 12634) and ETA will continue to pay the SESA penalty mail costs to the U.S. Postal Service. ETA will explore with the U.S. Postal Service the possibility of having individual State penalty mail agreements with the U.S. Postal Service. This would permit ETA to allocate postage resources to the States who could then have the option of using commercial or penalty mail systems. It continues to the Departmental policy that States utilize commercial mail methods for mail which pertains to both employment security and non-employment security business. In such instances, ETA will reimburse the SESA for the employment security share of the cost. Differences between preliminary planning estimates and final planning allotments are caused by the use of a Calendar Year data base as opposed to the earlier data used for preliminary planning estimates. Ten percent of the total sums allotted to each State shall be reserved for use by the Governor to provide performance incentives for public ES offices; services for groups with special needs; and for the extra costs of exemplary models for delivering job services. Signed at Washington, DC, this 8th day of April, 1994. Robert A. Schaerfl, Director, U.S. Employment Service.
