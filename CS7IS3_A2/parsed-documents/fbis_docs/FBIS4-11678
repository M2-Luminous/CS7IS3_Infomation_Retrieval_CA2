FBIS4-11678 "drnes062_s_94003" FBIS-NES-94-062 Daily Report 30 Mar 1994 Iran Plans Urged To Prevent Reoccurrence of Incident Plans Urged To Prevent Reoccurrence of Incident LD3003200594 Tehran Voice of the Islamic Republic of Iran in English 1930 GMT 30 Mar 94 LD3003200594 Tehran Voice of the Islamic Republic of Iran English BFN [Text] It has been precisely clarified, following the return of the special expert team of the Islamic Republic of Iran to Karabakh, that the C-130 plane belonging to the Iranian Air Force has crashed in Karabakh region due to a missile fired by the Armenian forces stationed there. Based on the investigations conducted by the Iranian team, the plane had deviated course before the crash due to a technical problem. The area's control tower and navigation facilities did not respond to the pilot's request for help and assistance either. It must be noted that the Iranian expert team dispatched to the scene of the C-130 crash did not manage to find the plane's black box, which could answer so many puzzles. The Islamic Republic of Iran's Foreign Ministry -- in the wake of the announcement of the final results of the experts about the March 28th incident -- condemning the downing of the C-130 plane, mentioned the bitter tragedy as a clear indication of the adverse consequences and the rest of the situation in the region [sentence as heard]. The Iranian plane was carrying 32 people -- including 13 crew, 19 passengers, and 17 women and children belonging to diplomats' relations as well as two Iranian students residing in Moscow -- who were returning home on March 18 to spend the New Year holidays. In the incident even the lives of the innocent people and other countries' nationals were seriously exposed to danger. Assuredly, the responsibility for these acts lies with the people who are trying to step up the disputes. It is necessary that proper measures be taken to prevent occurrence of such pitiable incidents. The Islamic Republic of Iran, since the outbreak of the Karabakh conflict, laying emphasis on the importance of peace and security in the region, has called on the belligerent sides to search for a peaceful way. To this end, the impartial mediation by Tehran and the periodical visits of the Iranian officials to Baku and Yerevan indicate honesty in the part of Iran to grant help peacefully solve the Karabakh crisis [sentence as heard]. In (?a lot) of the experts' opinions, the Islamic Republic of Iran reserves the right of legal pursuit of the plane crash and fulfilment of the rights of the incident victims and compensation for the survivors of the horrible incident. Undoubtedly those behind the incident should be answerable to such inappropriate acts. The Islamic Republic of Iran's Foreign Ministry on Monday March 28th released a statement requesting the Armenian Government to identify and punish those behind the incident. It is natural that such a measure by the Armenian Government can avert the recurrence of such incidents, which in no way (?help to) resolve the current disputes and improve the atmosphere prevalent in the regional relations.
