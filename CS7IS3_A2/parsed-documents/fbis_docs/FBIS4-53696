Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], a core party in the coalition, told a lecture meeting here, "the political community will inevitably undergo another restructuring due to policy issues." He said this reconfiguration will be necessitated by sharply conflicting policies of political parties concerning Japan's tax system reform and defense policy. Ozawa was apparently referring to profound gaps among the parties over a proposed raising of indirect taxes to bolster state revenues, and Japan's response to the suspected North Korean nuclear arms program. Ozawa dismissed the seriousness of the April 26 withdrawal of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) from the coalition, which has left the Hata administration as a fragile, minority government. "We do not have to get upset" by the pullout, he said. The rift was triggered by the abrupt formation of a unified parliamentary bloc in the House of Representatives, excluding the SDP. He branded as "irrational" ongoing talks between the Liberal Democratic Party and the SDP toward forming their own alliance. "I do not worry about such moves, as I believe that those who can think and act reasonably will take a rational course of action," he said. "Because Japan needs to restore political stability as quickly as possible, we have to alleviate the current turmoil and transform the administration into a stable government by expediting the restructuring of the political community," Ozawa said. Ozawa predicted that the next election for the House of Representatives will be contested under the new single-seat constituency system which was pushed through the Diet in January. He made the statement as the administration faces the possibility that the opposition camp's tabling of a no-confidence motion against it in the Diet could force Prime Minister Hata to call the election under the current multiseat constituency system. Japan must legislate an electoral redistricting bill that would split the current multiseat constituencies into 300 single-seat constituencies, if it is to hold the next election lawfully under the single-seat system. The January legislation, combined with the redistricting bill, will replace the existing 511 seat multiseat system of elections for the lower chamber with a mix of 300 single-seat constituencies and proportional representation, under which the remaining 200 seats would be allocated.
