I will remind our readers that the host of "Reputation," Emil Kotlyarskiy, complained about the plethora of shopkeepers in Moscow and said that he, "a native Muscovite," could remember "when the capital smelled only of tangerines and lollipops" and advised the creation of a "volunteer corps of crime-fighters." Furthermore, Mr. Kotlyarskiy went on to name the chief criminals. In his opinion, they are the leaders who caused the collapse of the great Union and the disbandment of the KGB. At the end of the program he declared that when this corps begins to fight for "a people's victory," the loss of human lives will be inevitable, but "these losses will be justified." Just four days later the MTK management had to acknowledge that the producers of the program had effectively issued a televised appeal for violence and had thereby violated, at the very least, the law on the media. As MTK Program Director Igor Arbuzov assured the SEGODNYA correspondent, he saw the show for the first time when he was "watching TV at home." The Continent Russia Studio of the Congress of Russian Communities pays for the air time and furnishes its own videotapes. According to Igor Arbuzov, studio Chief Kotlyarskiy was supposed to bring the film to the MTK editorial office three days before it aired, but he brought it only on the morning of the day it was shown "and because of this our technicians did not have a chance to review it." Emil Kotlyarskiy himself, however, assured the SEGODNYA correspondent that Mr. Arbuzov has always allowed him to bring the tapes for "Reputation" in on broadcast day because "the program director and MTK Editor-in-Chief Aygar Misan have treated the Continent Russia Studio with great affection and trust from the very beginning of our association." Igor Arbuzov did not conceal his "affection" for the "patriotic creative team." He explained with pride that it was the MTK that had agreed to broadcast Kotlyarskiy's "extremely talented film" about Vladimir Vysotskiy a year ago (the message of which, viewers will recall, was that if Vysotskiy were alive today, he would support today's "Russian patriots"). The "Reputation" program has been part of the MTK broadcasting schedule since February of this year. One of the earlier shows was also debated by Muscovites for a long time because of the question the "Reputation" hosts had asked Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and Chairman Dmitriy Ragozin of the Congress of Russian Communities: "Would it be better to be born a Jew or not to be born at all?" Incidentally, Mr. Arbuzov had this to say about that show: "There is no question that the boys have their own ideas about everything, but the program was quite interesting!" The latest show, however, which justified the sacrifice of human lives for the sake of some kind of "people's victory by the native Muscovites" was, as Igor Arbuzov put it, "a bit too insensitive." It is true that Emil Kotlyarskiy said, just a few days after the broadcast, that what he had in mind was just the creation of "people's brigades, which would request permission to bear arms legally and would protect people from gangsters when they come home late at night: They could meet them at the subway station and walk them home, or, perhaps, screw in new light bulbs in dark entryways...." When he spoke of "justified losses," the filmmaker apparently was referring to people who might be killed by an electric shock when they screw a light bulb into a faulty fixture. In the fear of possible legal action, the MTK program director reported that he was removing the next episode of "Reputation" from the program schedule for 8 May and would not air any other Continent Russia shows until he had "received a precise explanation of what had happened from the producers." Judging by all indications, however, this statement was purely declarative, and the "patriotic studio's affectionate association" with MTK will continue. Emil Kotlyarskiy confided in the SEGODNYA correspondent: "Arbuzov assured me on the phone that very day that the next episode of 'Reputation' will be shown on 15 May." It is interesting that the show that was planned for 8 May and was "removed from the schedule" was made especially for Victory Day, which many communists and "patriots" have chosen as "the first day of the decisive offensive." The 25-minute program, according to Mr. Kotlyarskiy, was an excerpt from his film "Barricades on the Ruins of the Empire," with the October armed rebellion as the "main theme," interspersed with clips from newsreels showing, for instance, Marshals Zhukov and Rokossovskiy marching in the Victory Day Parade." The director acknowledged that the show also included "a few of my own comments," and that is why the film, which was supposed to have been shown on the eve of the communist demonstrations in the center of Moscow, was not only about the victory in the Patriotic War, but "about victory in general...." Even if this film is removed from the schedule for 8 May, as the MTK director promised, Mr. Kotlyarskiy feels "it is certain to air a short time later." He said that "another appropriate date for a show on victory has been recommended to us: 24 June, the anniversary of the parade in Red Square commemorating the victory in the war."
