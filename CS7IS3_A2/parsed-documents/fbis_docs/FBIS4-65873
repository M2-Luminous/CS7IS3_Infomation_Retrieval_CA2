"It is above all a question of the police and legal authorities," Herzog, who is currently chief judge of the Federal Constitutional Court and was chosen Monday [23 May] as the next head of state, told the weekly DIE WOCHE. Asked whether he believed extreme right parties and groups should be outlawed, he replied: "Yes, when the facts are such that one can be sure of upholding the case in the courts." Herzog said he could not imagine neo-Nazi theories flourishing in Germany. "What worries me much more is that the crypto-Nazis, the old incorrigibles, should find an appeal and imitators among the younger generation." Herzog, who takes office July 1, was criticised for not having dealt with the problem of mounting extreme right-wing violence in Germany in his acceptance speech Monday evening following his election. In the DIE WOCHE interview, the president-elect called for determined resistance against any development on the lines of that in Italy to bring neo-fascist parties into government. He saw no immediate danger of this, but said "the highest vigilance" was demanded. Herzog spoke out against the revival of German nationalist ideas, which he believed could "no longer be a driving force for our people" today and which struck no chord in him personally. He also dismissed the idea that reunited Germany need no longer feel concerned about its Nazi past. Herzog did "not feel emphasis should primarily be laid upon past responsibility, but on what we can learn for the future", which for him meant "a particular need to develop barriers against totalitarianism". "We must be ready in the future to draw conclusions from the atrocities of the extermination of the Jews and other minorities. I can for that reason absolutely not adopt this notion that the postwar period has ended," he said.
