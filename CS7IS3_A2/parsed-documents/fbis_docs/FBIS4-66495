They live among us. The calls for help issuing from their throats deafen our ears. Yet, we do nothing to rescue them even though we can. Rather we definitely can rescue them. Their hearts beat with their love for the land on which they have grown up and into which their roots strike deeply, defying all the endeavors to uproot them. They defy despair. A blow that does not kill them makes them cling to the soil more tenaciously. They muster whatever strength they continue to have and they move forward pace by pace, defying the despair toward which they are led by the occupation policies and by kinsmen's negligence, which is even more painful and which has surpassed all bounds and exceeded all imagination. Their will is the strong rock, which stands as a firm barrier in the face of all endeavors to break their sacred bond with the land. This land, whose soil has been mixed with the sweat of their brow, is everything to them. It is the air they breathe and the blood that runs in their veins and gives them life. It is the forefathers' will, and it is the homeland over which they dream of establishing their sovereignty, as all other simple peoples do. These people are the Palestinian farmers who live under harsh and difficult circumstances, which no other sector could endure, especially in light of the negligence and of injustice to which they are subjected by all the sides that are supposed to aid them, to help alleviate their hardship, and to curtail the immense losses they incur every season, particularly since they constitute more than 30 percent of the West Bank and Gaza Strip population! What is the real condition of the Palestinian agricultural sector today? What are the most significant obstacles facing this sector, almost dealing it fatal blows? Why is this sector subjected more than other sectors to immense losses in most, not to say all, seasons right before the eyes and within earshot of the people concerned who have undertaken to protect and support it? Moreover, what do farmers themselves say about the real conditions under which they live and the losses they incur? Finally, how do farmers see the future of agriculture in the occupied territories, and is there hope that these conditions will improve? This is what AL-BAYADIR AL-SIYASI will show in this investigative report through which we dot the i's and cross the t's with utter objectivity and without allowing ourselves to be carried away by our imagination in the issue of Palestinian farmers and the future of Palestinian agriculture in the occupied territories. Facts and Pains A most significant problem that encounters a journalist when he is gathering the material necessary for this or that report, especially in the occupied territories, is the scarcity of accurate figures and statistics on cultivated acreage, for example; on the number of workers in this sector; on the annual yield of this or that basic crop on which our farmer relies fundamentally; on the irrigated acreage and the volume of water needed to irrigate this acreage; and on dryland farming acreage. Such figures and statistics are scarce despite the presence of hundreds, not to say thousands, of agricultural associations and organizations that have been founded in the occupied territories to serve this sector in the first place, to attend to its affairs, and to deal with its problems. But it seems that those in charge of this sector do not, very regrettably, take the trouble to conduct the necessary studies in this regard. If they conduct a few such studies, they rely for their data on studies conducted by the other [Israeli] side, which always distorts the facts, especially in connection with land issues. Moreover, it is almost impossible to get the data from government agricultural offices that have such data because of laws that prohibit officials from dealing with the press. Fortunate is the journalist who manages to interview the press spokesman for one of these offices, after a pursuit of several months at least. In most cases, it is impossible to get such an interview for a variety of reasons, some of which we ourselves create and some beyond our control. Like the Palestinian people's other sectors, the Palestinian agricultural sector has been targeted primarily since the start of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. This sector has encountered a great degree of harassment and pressures. Obstacles have been placed in the path of its development through dozens of military directives that have sought to diminish and wipe out this sector, especially since it signifies a lot. Before anything else, this sector signifies the land over which the struggle revolves between two peoples, each of whom tries to assert its historical right to this land. Objective Is Disengagement Since the start of occupation, the authorities have employed numerous means to break the strong bond between the Palestinian and his land, to which he clings as he clings to life. Thousands of arable dunums of land have been used for settlement, military, and public purposes. The area of land seized by Israel since 1967 is 2.2 million dunums, i.e., 40 percent of the West Bank land, which has a total area of 5.5 million dunums. This is in addition to thousands of other dunums that have been confiscated and on which no accurate statistics are available. The latest such act was the announcement made just a few days after conclusion of the declaration of principles in Washington about the confiscation of 5,000 dunums to establish natural protectorates in the West Bank! Moreover, the authorities have prevented farmers from drilling artesian wells to irrigate crops so as to ensure that the cultivated area does not expand and to prevent the reclamation of new lands after the water necessary for irrigation becomes available. These authorities have employed as pretext in this regard the Jordanian law, which they use whenever it serves their interests. This law prohibits, according to their allegation, drilling artesian wells for irrigation purposes in order to preserve underground water resources and to ensure that large quantities of this water are not pumped out, thus increasing water salinity and making water unfit for drinking. The authorities also resorted to other means to besiege this sector and to cause it to despair, considering that they have inundated Palestinian markets with Israeli agricultural products, thus pitting domestic Palestinian production in an unfair competition against the developed Israeli product. These authorities then proceeded to ban the entry of Palestinian production to Israeli markets. In most years, they have also banned the export of the surplus exceeding the domestic market's need to the Arab markets, especially to Jordan. Occupation Is Not Only Reason The more intelligent means to which the authorities have resorted since the start of the occupation is to open the various sectors of Israeli work to Palestinian farmers at very tempting wages. At times, farmers working in these sectors collected in one month wages exceeding their entire annual income from farming. Thus numerous small farmers were encouraged to abandon the land and to go to work in Israel. This, in turn, made it easier for the authorities to confiscate vast areas of land on the pretext that they are not exploited and cultivated. To tell the truth, occupation is not the only reason why the Palestinian agricultural condition has slipped to this level of misery. The occupation charted its policy and our Palestinian institutions have, very regrettably, implemented this policy by neglecting this sector, by denying farmers financing that enables them to continue to exploit and cultivate the land, and by diverting funds allocated to aid this sector to the wrong circles, even though agricultural institutions have proliferated greatly in the occupied territories recently. It is well known that in any country, the purpose of the presence of such institutions is to serve the farmers and to look for markets to sell their products, especially when there are no markets that ensure that agricultural production is sold at good prices that yield a good return for the farmer, as is the case with Palestinian farmers today. Their purpose is also to protect land and crops and to enlighten farmers and educate them of the necessity of clinging to and utilizing their land that is faced with danger if it is abandoned. But in the occupied territories, these institutions have a different idea and their services are confined to certain people who do not need aid in the first place and who may be as far as can be from agriculture. Meanwhile, small farmers suffer the worst hardship. One should also note that dozens of these associations are no more than ink on paper and a bank account number. One may wonder: What is the role of the agriculture offices that proliferate the West Bank? Very regrettably, they are in no better a position than numerous other national institutions that are supposed to spread awareness among farmers; to offer them guidance and help them; to supply them with the pesticides they need to fight maladies and diseases that devastate their crops; and to make field visits so as to familiarize themselves with the farmers' conditions and to acquaint them with modern farming methods. However, rarely do these offices take the trouble to distribute an educational leaflet on modern agriculture or on fighting diseases that destroy crops--which have spread greatly and in mysterious ways recently. In some seasons, the cost of pesticides and remedies used in agriculture is more than the farmer's returns, because pesticide prices are high and because the remedies are adulterated at times. Farmer Is Victim There are dozens of examples of negligence of the agricultural sector, including the case of farmer 'Abdallah 'Awdah al-Rujub from Dura. Al-Rujub has been knocking on the doors of agricultural institutions and loan institutions for four years in an effort to save his 10-dunum farm, but to no avail. Al-Rujub's cultivated acreage has shrunk to less than three dunums because he has been unable to secure the funds needed to improve the farm and to enlarge his well, which would irrigate many times this acreage if he could realize his dreams to deepen and broaden the well and to secure the necessary modern irrigation equipment. Al-Rujub has obtained part of this equipment at the expense of his children's sustenance, in the hope that somebody will help him complete this good project. "I have an existing project," says al-Rujub, "and it consists of 10 dunums of land which contain a spring. In the past, I exploited just about one-half dunum according to the traditional farming method of basin cultivation. Three years ago, I enlarged the spring, making it 20 meters long, five meters wide, and two meters deep. Using drip and sprinkler irritation, I then cultivated nearly five dunums. I later tried to develop the project and to enlarge the spring site even more because water volume increases in winter. I wanted to exploit that [extra] water to cultivate the remaining acreage in the summer. The cost was estimated at the time at 9,000 Jordanian dinars. Had the sum been secured, I would have been able to employ 10 people in this project in return for a very little investment." Evident Discrimination in Loans Al-Rujub went on to add, "I have been knocking at the doors of all associations and institutions for four years, most significantly the Economic Development Association. Very regrettably, when I met with one of this association's officials and explained the project to him, he said the association grants loans for industrial purposes only, not for agriculture, keeping in mind that the association has advanced loans for the purchase of cattle and sheep. I am fully confident that if I had asked the man for an industrial loan, he would have told me that they give loans to agricultural projects only. This was not the only request I made. Initially, I sent a registered letter to the association. Then I delivered another letter by hand to the secretary six months later. To date, I have not received any response. Why? "I wonder: Why they do not help me with a loan that I can repay within a short period--perhaps no more than one year--from the yield of the same land for which the loan is to be exploited? Am I not an Arab Palestinian citizen who continues to make sacrifices to this day? Are they fair in their loans, or do they discriminate between one citizen and another? I wonder: What are the criteria on which they base their loan distribution? This is not the first time. Previously, I planted 1,000 olive trees in mountainous land that I reclaimed with bulldozers at my own expense. Nobody offered me any loan or assistance. "This is not an individual issue. It is an issue experienced by the major part of the Palestinian agricultural sector as a result of neglect by these institutions and of evident discrimination in the loan and aid policies at a time when lands are being confiscated hysterically. Is it not the duty of these institutions, which abound in the occupied territories, to devote attention to the land and to encourage the citizen to exploit it? Is it not their duty to support and aid farmers and to protect the land? I raise these questions in the hope that we will find somebody to answer them. "I say very frankly that if, on top of the circumstances that are beyond our control, the current condition persists and if this negligence continues, then say good-bye to agriculture and, consequently, to the land. Everybody will have to be then tasked for what he has done, and we will have to content ourselves with `sheep and cattle' and with imaginary projects. "The losses we incur are great and grievous losses. Yet, we persevere, and we continue to work the land in the hope that conditions and circumstances will improve and that some of these losses will be recouped. The Palestinian parties concerned are supposed to compensate us for these losses, if they are truly concerned with the land and if their goal is to defend and liberate the land!" Constant Loss Describing the current conditions under which farmers live and the constant losses they incur, Farmer Muhammad 'Abd-al-Hamid Muhsin has said: "The truth is that agriculture and agricultural work are no longer profitable under these circumstances in which loss has become the main characteristic distinguishing this sector. This is the result of scarcity of rain this season and of greatly reduced prices, compared to higher planting, fertilizer, seed, and irrigation water costs. When the crop is taken to market, it is sold at very cheap prices, because supply is greater than demand. This is the result of lack of farming policies and of sound agricultural planning among farmers, the majority of whom focus on one crop in most seasons. "This year, farmers who rely on dryland farming have suffered a hard blow as a result of scarce rainfall. The blow will be even harder for farmers who rely on irrigated farming next summer, because underground irrigation water volume will be very small when compared with previous years." Muhsin went on to add, "This season is bad. Very regrettably, the farmer alone will incur a big loss because of the absence of a national government and because of negligence by agricultural associations and other institutions that are not concerned with the agricultural sector, unlike the Israeli farmer who is protected by the government that compensates him for his losses and secures for him whatever he needs! "I believe that agriculture's future is dark, especially if favoritism persists in the departments concerned and if the Palestinian agricultural sector continues to be treated as it is treated currently, at a time when it is experiencing great hardship and when it stands alone without finding anybody to support it in its numerous ordeals." Another farmer has said, "This sector has been facing big problems, especially since the Palestinian associations concerned have focused on the industrial sector exclusively, thus inflicting a great injustice on the agricultural sector, which employs more than 30 percent of the occupied territories' inhabitants who rely basically on agriculture to secure their families' livelihood. "There is nobody to protect the Palestinian farmer or to compensate him in these seasons in which he has suffered immense losses because of low prices, high cost, and strong competition by Israeli products, which invade all domestic markets, whereas Israeli markets are banned to our products. The objective is to deal the Palestinian farmer a blow and to protect the Israeli farmer who lives under conditions that are greatly different from ours." Marj Bin 'Amir Is Sad This Year Farmer Yusuf 'Uraydi from 'Arrabah has said that rain scarcity in Marj Bin 'Amir will have a very negative impact on summer crops this year. 'Uraydi's opinion is shared by farmer 'Azmi Abu-al-Rabb, a member of the Jalbun Agricultural Association's Executive Council, who has said, "This year, the season will be bad because of rain scarcity. Numerous farmers in Jalbun village have re-seeded because the major part of the seed has rotted. Should the drought continue, God forbid, it will be catastrophic for farmers, especially in the absence of a government that cares for and aids them." Abu-al-Rabb added, "The Israeli Government has declared some parts of its agricultural areas drought-stricken lands. This declaration will aid the Israeli farmer, whereas the Palestinian farmer finds nobody to aid or care for him!" Farmer Ramzi Sha'ban from al-Jalamah and farmer Hazim Shallash from Kafra'i focused their statements on the blow suffered by the agricultural sector this year as a result of rain scarcity and drought. In Conclusion This is the painful reality under which the Palestinian agricultural sector lives these days. This sector has no gleam of hope that conditions will improve in the near future, and it displays great fear of a dark future, especially since negligence and injustice have left their imprints on it. Negligence and injustice have been tantamount to a hard blow dealt this sector, which has been fighting for decades the policy to break the bond between man and land and the attempt to drive man away from his land through confiscation, inducements, or successive blows. The result is immense losses incurred by the Palestinian farmer alone. There is nobody to care for this farmer him or to aid him farmer and help him overcome the obstacles and march forth on his path! This sector's future will be truly dark, especially if the injustice inflicted on the farmers persists, as farmers say, and if the current policies, which inevitably mean the destruction of agriculture and abandonment of the land, continue in the future.
