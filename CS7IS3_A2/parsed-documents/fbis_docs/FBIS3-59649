In April, 1991, the PNC finished installing the reactor's equipment. The PNC now looks toward the first criticality as it enters into the final round of tests. The tests are to check the sodium coolant flow and other such values to confirm that they match the design values. That data will be indispensable in obtaining other nuclear data from reactor physical tests after criticality is reached, and will contribute greatly in the detailed design of the No. 1 demonstration FBR that the electric power industry (the Japan Atomic Power Co.) will build in the near future. The design of the Monju started 25 years ago, and the results of operating the Joyo demonstration FBR (Oarai-machi, Ibaraki Prefecture) were used to the utmost in constructing the Monju. The Monju is actually the fruition of a quarter century of development efforts. Unlike power generated by light-water reactor that use water as a coolant, the Monju uses sodium. This is the first such nuclear power generation. Although the Monju is the fifth reactor of its kind, following prototype FBRs in France, the UK, and Russia (two), the facilities are the newest and best. Even France has used the Monju's sodium fire prevention measures as a reference and is now making repairs to its Super Phoenix so that it can resume operation of the reactor. The Monju uses sodium, but to prevent accidents, leakage, and fires, air is expelled from the inside of the reactor housing vessel, in which both the primary and secondary systems are located, and the inside of the reactor housing vessel has an atmosphere of inactive nitrogen. Because the periphery of the reactor cannot be seen, this was the last chance to report about the site that will be pressed with tests before criticality. A "High-Tech Castle" Made By Pulling the Pieces Over a Roller A private bay where large, heavy objects are unloaded from ships can be seen below the plateau half-way up the ria coast. Since construction of the Monju began on 25 October 1985, all the equipment and materials, such as that for the housing vessel installation (completed in April 1987) and the reactor vessel installation (completed in October 1988), have been brought up from the private bay. The number of transport ships that entered the bay is 119; in terms of weight, about 200,000 tons. Because of all that the "high-tech castle" is completed today. To get from the private bay to the site you have to travel about 1.2 km up a sloping road. Bringing the 280-ton reactor vessel up to the site took four days (starting on 11 October 1988). The scene of the cautious, 1-meter/minute pulling of the reactor vessel over a roller, like the construction of the Pyramids in ancient Egypt, is unforgettable. An event of 19 years came to mind while I was looking up at the "castle" from the bay. The delay of the start of operation of the completed Joyo demonstration reactor, the parent of Monju's construction, due to design re-evaluation (October to December 1974) was a "gift." So as not to repeat the mistake of the Mutsu nuclear-powered ship, on which a radiation leak occurred in the summer of that year, the decision was made to have a comprehensive inspection of the facilities. Needless to say, during the 16 years of Joyo operation that followed, there were no accidents, though various troubles occurred in the stages of experimental reactors in advanced countries that had started 10 years earlier than Japan. Sodium leakage, which is the FBR's weak point, did not occur, and as many as 50,031 fuel rods have been burned so far with not a single rod showing any damaged fuel. That was because the Mutsu was a "bad example" from which much was learned. Returning back to the present, the first criticality of the Monju was changed for the third time from "October criticality" to next spring because of the troubles with the fuel pellet sintering furnace (Tokai-mura, Ibaraki Prefecture) that delayed the production of the remaining 15% of the total fuel for the Monju. That happening truly shows the one-and-indivisible relationship between the "reactor" and the "nuclear fuel cycle." A look at the recent trends in the Atomic Energy Commission's FBR Development Project Special Subcommittee, which is now discussing future measures for making FBRs practical that include the No. 1 demonstration reactor project, shows that the nuclear power industry should use as material for deepening its self-awareness the fact that MITI and part of the electric power industry only see "reactors" and are lacking in consideration toward the "nuclear fuel cycle." And, the PNC should effectively use the date when it came to the surface as a bad example, as in the past example of the Joyo reactor. Engineer Spirit Making the Most of a Once-in-1,000-Years Chance During the busiest phase of the construction there were as many as 4,000 workers at the site. Recently, the total number of workers dropped to 400; 200 people are PNC employees, including 80 people from 10 electric power companies, and 200 people are from collaborating companies. Nevertheless, the atmosphere is tense as can be with the 400 workers conducting overall inspections of all the machinery and equipment before the task of loading 198 fuel assemblies into the core. The 80 people from the electric power industry are the necessary operations and maintenance personnel for future FBR electric power generation. For four years already they have been permanently stationed at the Monju, and there are 10 young electric power men burning with the engineer spirit who have been working at the plant since the construction stage. There will be a five-man system in which two men will be electric power men; one of the two has experience operating a gas reactor, a boiling water reactor, and pressurized-water reactor. They are all impressed that the frontier for unfolding Japan's nuclear power policies is in their region. "They all should be proud to not pass by this once-in-a-thousand-years chance--the startup of Japan's first FBR electric power generation," mentioned Plant Division No. 2 Chief Maeda. Next I will present a few of the results from the tests thus far. The first is an example that shows that the nuclear reactor system is a "large-scale precision machine." The fuel transporter weighs about 450 tons, and the precision when the fuel moves on the 80m-long rail at 5m/sec then stops is +/-1mm. During fuel exchange it will be entirely automated. The transporter moves precisely to the targeted fuel and is the indispensable basis for accurately bringing fuel into and out of the reactor. The next result comes from the preliminary plant characteristics tests that have been carried out since early this year. The tests involved circulating sodium in the pipes of the primary and secondary systems. The temperature of the sodium was raised to 200째C with an external heater, then when the sodium was circulated by means of a pump, the pump's rotational energy was transmitted, and it was confirmed that the temperature of the sodium entering the reactor core rose to 400째C due to the frictional heating. When the Monju actually generates power, the sodium flowing in the pipes will be at a temperature of 530째C. However, even without using an "atomic fire," the stage where it is alright to raise the temperature another 130째C has already been reached. "With this, it looks quite certain that there will be no problems with Monju operation after the first criticality," says Director Tadao Takahashi optimistically. "International Stage" With France, UK, US, and Germany Because the Monju is the newest kind of prototype reactor, it has already attracted the attention of advanced countries. Concretely, two French men who have experience operating France's Super Phoenix reactor and an English couple who have operated the British PFR are permanently stationed at the Monju and take part in all of the tests. It has also been decided that one person from the U.S. and one person from Germany will be included in the near future. It is becoming an "international stage" geared toward the practical use of FBRs. International exchange is also vigorous: in the evening after their work is finished, the Japanese workers receive French language lessons from the French men. Despite the talk about a worldwide slowdown in FBR development, Director Takahashi says, "Just because it looks at first sight as if a slowdown is occurring because of each country's social and economic situations, that does not mean that it will be choked off altogether." That is because countries will be preparing for the age around the middle of the 21st century when energy resources will start to dry up. Japan, which long ago lagged behind in development, is now in a position to move to the top in the world. "Like skating, Japan is in the position of `responsibility foremost,' and firmly senses its international responsibility," emphasizes Director Takahashi. Recently in France troubles with the prototype and demonstration reactors have continued, and the restart of the Super Phoenix's operation has been politically delayed. With the aim of starting operations in the middle of next year, political procedures and repair work are progressing. One example of that is the sodium fire prevention measures, which were thoroughly investigated by anti-nuclear groups. The Super Phoenix's secondary system is now undergoing repairs. Frankly speaking, that is something France learned by watching Japan. In the Monju's reactor housing vessel where sodium will flow in the primary and secondary system pipes, the air will be expelled and replaced with inactivated nitrogen gas. Even if there is a leak, the reactor is devised so that it will not naturally ignite. There is also a double safety measure: metal covers the floor, walls, and ceiling. In contrast, such safety measures are not provided for in the pipes of the Super Phoenix's secondary system, and that became its "ruin." Through Japanese-French atomic energy exchange, France is learning from Japan and is now doing repair work on the Super Phoenix. Getting back to domestic issues, since 2 September 1992 the Atomic Energy Commission of Japan has been looking ahead to the middle of the next century in discussing revisions to the "Long-Term Atomic Energy Utilization and Development Plan." Whether or not it reflects the trends in France and other countries, MITI and part of the electric power industry are taking a "wait and do nothing" attitude about practical use. Nevertheless, "pleading words" directed to the Atomic Energy Commission were heard from the Monju's head ranks, including the site supervisors. "Please decide the route of FBR development. The important thing is the succession of the technology."
