Paragraph 6 of Article 45 of the law prohibits candidates and parties from receiving, whether directly or indirectly, any donation in money or in any other form that could be translated into money -- including any kind of advertisement -- from unions or similar organizations. By a vote of six to three, the STF thus turned down a petition filed by the Workers Party to have the above law declared unconstitutional. Justice Sepulveda Pertence, who heard the case, voted with the minority. He believes that unlike unions, associations could make donations because they do not collect mandatory dues and contributions from their members. Justice Neri da Silveira, who voted down the PT petition, said that the ban also affects associations, in order to prevent powerful economic organizations from committing excesses. The STF has ruled that the law will stand, but that it will be incumbent upon the Superior Electoral Court to rule on the case of PT presidential candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who is facing charges for having used a sound truck from the metalworkers union of the ABC region [Sao Paulo industrial belt] in his electoral campaign.
