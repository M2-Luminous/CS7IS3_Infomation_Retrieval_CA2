On 24 January the forum on the development of relatively comfortable villages was jointly held by Kunming party committee and the city government in Guandu District. Every comrade attending the forum tried to get the floor and the atmosphere was lively. Representatives of 19 townships and towns, with a gross income exceeding 100 million yuan, and of six offices throughout the city attended the forum. Sun Gan, secretary of the city party committee, Vice Mayor Xu Zhixin, Ba Weiguo, director of the provincial administration of township and town enterprises, and Li Yuanshu, deputy director of the Provincial Administration of Township and Town Enterprises, and leading cadres of concerned counties and prefectures attended the forum. Guandu District Party Secretary Zhao Jian briefed attendants on the experience of planning rural work as a whole and bringing about all-round development of the rural economy by moving towards a relatively comfortable life. Lianmeng is known as the "most outstanding township in Yunnan," and what Jin Wenming, secretary of Lianmeng party committee, said made the argument of "relying on old townships to march towards a relatively comfortable life" more convincing. In 1993, the gross income of township and town enterprises in Lianmeng reached 583 million yuan, which accounted for 99.8 percent of the gross income of the whole town. People earned more due to the development of township and town enterprises, and per capita net income increased over 1,500 yuan a year, thus leading to a relatively comfortable life. Representatives of the offices of townships and towns, such as Majie, separately briefed attendants on the experience of linking up with large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises and with scientific research units, introducing foreign capital to develop foreign-invested enterprises, and setting up joint-stock cooperative enterprises. Pu Chaozhu attended the forum from beginning to end. He conscientiously listened to the speeches, frequently raised questions and exchanged views with others, and made systematic remarks on the question of developing township and town enterprises. When talking about the points of fully affirming the results and conscientiously summing up the experience of developing township and town enterprises, Pu Chaozhu said that township and town enterprises in Kunming made a breakthrough and developed by leaps and bounds in 1993. The gross income of township and town enterprises throughout the whole city increased by 95 percent and reached 12 billion yuan. The pace of development of Guandu District, which had a large base, was startling since it achieved 129 percent of economic growth and, as a result, the gross income of township and town enterprise throughout the district reached 3.738 billion yuan. More gratifying is that township and town enterprises, whether in Kunming or in Guandu District, were able to achieve growth in output value as well as in revenues and tax, and the increase in revenues and tax last year was over 90 percent. There was huge growth of township and town enterprises which are joint ventures in nature. This development trend of township and town enterprises is not achieved by chance and many practices and experiences can be summed up because they are not general experiences which are universally applicable. Rather, we must proceed from local conditions to sum up unique, rational, and regularized experience so as to guide future work and practices. This helps some cadres and people overcome the thinking of "being content with small improvements" and "being satisfied with small wealth," so that they will be more willing and capable to run township and town enterprises. Pu Chaozhu said: The situation is very good and the opportunity is hard to come by. We must take the opportunity to speed up the development of township and town enterprises. He said: As far as the large development opportunity is concerned, the old pattern of two superpowers' domination of the world was broken but a new multipolar pattern has not taken shape, peace and development is the main trend of the world, and we can have a relatively long period of international peace to develop ourselves. In our country, the economy is prosperous, nationalities are united, and our society is stable. This is an opportunity of joint development shared by the whole country and the whole province. As the provincial capital city, Kunming has its own unique opportunity and superiority: First, Kunming is the central city of Yunnan, with 40 percent of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises and 70 percent of colleges and universities located there. In short, Kunming is the political, economic, scientific and technological, and cultural center of the whole province, thus creating extremely favorable conditions for combining urban areas with rural areas in accelerating the development of township and town enterprises. This is called the superiority of developing comprehensive industries in comprehensive cities. Second, there is marked superiority in the location of the city. Five railways destined for coastal areas, Beijing, and Vietnam are linked to Kunming, six main highways in the province start from Kunming, and Kunming Airport is being built into an international airport. In short, Kunming has become the hub of communications and the center of commodity distribution for those who want to enter Southeast Asia and South Asia from Southwest China. As long as we orient toward the 1 billion-strong large market in Southeast Asia and South Asia while relying on the 1 billion-strong large domestic market, we have very bright prospects of developing an export-oriented economy. To develop a commodity economy we must first have a market. Third, cheap labor and low land prices help attract domestic and foreign investors to run factories in Kunming. Such opportunities have emerged inside and outside China, that is, labor-intensive industries are moving to places with cheap labor and low land prices, which is very advantageous to the development of textile, clothing, and foodstuff industries and manufactured goods for daily use in Kunming. Pu Chaozhu said: What we have is a dynamic and fleeting opportunity. We must never miss such an opportunity of development but rather seize it to accelerate our development. When talking about how to develop township and town enterprises, Pu Chaozhu said: We must sum up our experiences and have a clear understanding of the situation on the basis of accelerating the development of township and town enterprises. To accelerate our development, we must have a correct train of thought and guide the development of township and town enterprises with the thinking of deepening reform and opening up wider. The concrete practices are as follows: 1. By relying on large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises and having wide connections with scientific research and technological units, efforts must be made to develop the joint-stock cooperative system so as to transform township and town enterprises into joint-stock enterprises with multiple systems of ownership. Large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises have capital and qualified personnel, scientific research and technological units in colleges and universities have knowledge of science and technology and management as well as quick access to information, and land and surplus labor is available in township and town enterprises. If the mechanism of township and town enterprises is vigorous, the combinations of urban and rural areas, of science and technology with the economy, and of opening up and development must definitely be optimized combinations of factors of production. By so doing, strong productive forces will be formed to advance township and town enterprises to a new stage of development, which is the stage of a large scale of export-oriented development at a high starting point. As far as the joint-stock system is concerned, persons possessing science and technology can also become stockholders. We must develop multiple joint-stock enterprises, which can solve the problem of insufficient funds in developing township and town enterprises as well as invigorate them. Large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises should diversify their products and township and town enterprises should be willing to play a supporting role and implement socialized production on a large scale so as to benefit all parties. 2. We must develop an export-oriented economy by taking the market as the guide and orienting towards the two large markets at home and abroad. To develop township and town enterprises, we must have the market concept. Kunming has moved from the rear to the forefront in the process of opening up to the outside world and is now being built into a central city opening up to the outside world. Boundary lines throughout the province exceed 4,000 km and we can use a number of border trade ports. Since the economy of Yunnan strongly complements with that of neighboring countries, we have bright prospects of developing an export-oriented economy. As long as we aim at the two large markets at home and abroad, change our domestically oriented economy into an export-oriented one, and make future plans, it is absolutely possible to advance our economy to a new stage in one to two years' time. 3. We must closely integrate, with the spirit of reform, large processing enterprises in urban areas with the construction of raw material bases in rural areas. Only when we intensify our reform can we pour new vitality into the development of township and town enterprises. An important content of deepening reform is precisely to change the pattern of production and management, as well as the system of economic administration and take an integrative path of development, particularly integrating large processing enterprises in urban areas with the construction of raw material bases in rural areas. Without a stable source of raw materials, the processing industry in urban areas will certainly fluctuate and make bricks without straw. Hence, processing enterprises in urban areas must give priority to the work of establishing raw material bases, and so do township and town enterprises and state-owned enterprises.
