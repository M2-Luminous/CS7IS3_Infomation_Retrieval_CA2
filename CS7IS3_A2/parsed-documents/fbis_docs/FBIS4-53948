The heads of 22 local governments and seven economic federations out of 23 autonomies and eight economic groups polled responded to the poll, which was conducted in late April. The survey showed that 59 percent of those polled felt the goal of decentralizing the government has not been achieved totally or substantially. They based their responses on the wide gap between Tokyo and local municipalities in such fields as population density, economies and information propagation. About two-thirds of respondents said some achievements have been made in the four national development plans implemented since 1962. An overwhelming majority of leaders of local autonomies called for the carrying out of another program to balance development of the domestic economy.
