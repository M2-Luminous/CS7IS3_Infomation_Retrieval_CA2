FR941107-1-00051 FR941107-1-00011 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 654 [Docket No. 941002&hyph;4302; I.D. 092794B] RIN 0648&hyph;AG23 Stone Crab Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: NMFS issues this proposed rule to implement Amendment 5 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Stone Crab Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico (FMP). This rule would establish a temporary moratorium, ending not later than June 30, 1998, on the Federal registration of stone crab vessels by the Director, Southeast Region, NMFS (Regional Director), and would invalidate any Federal numbers and color codes issued by the Regional Director after July 1, 1994, for use on stone crab vessels and gear. In addition, NMFS proposes changes to correct and clarify the regulations, conform them to current standards, and enhance enforcement. DATES: Written comments must be received on or before December 19, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments on the proposed rule must be sent to the Southeast Regional Office, NMFS, 9721 Executive Center Drive N., St. Petersburg, FL 33702. Requests for copies of Amendment 5, which includes a regulatory impact review and an environmental assessment, should be sent to the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council, 5401 W. Kennedy Boulevard, Suite 331, Tampa, FL 33609&hyph;2486, FAX: 813&hyph;225&hyph;7015. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Peter J. Eldridge, 813&hyph;570&hyph;5305. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The FMP was prepared by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (Council) and is implemented by regulations at 50 CFR part 654 under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act). The stone crab fishery managed under the FMP is located entirely off the coast of Florida, with the majority of harvest from Florida's waters. Florida has actively managed the fishery since 1929. The FMP was implemented in 1979, principally to regulate the activities of shrimp vessels registered in states other than Florida to resolve gear conflicts with stone crab fishermen. Other FMP objectives included managing the stone crab resource for optimum yield, conserving the stocks while attaining full utilization, establishing an effective reporting system, and promoting uniformity of the regulations throughout the management area. The FMP, as amended addressed the gear conflicts and adopted Florida's rules for stone crab in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ). The biological condition of the stone crab fishery is stable, with landings of claws averaging about 3 million lb (1.36 million kg) annually. During the early development of the fishery, annual landings increased as fishing effort increased; however, landings since 1985 have not increased while fishing effort has doubled. The fishery currently has more participants and stone crab traps than are necessary to harvest efficiently the optimum yield. Florida is considering a moratorium on the issuance of State permits for the stone crab fishery while alternatives for a possible effort limitation or controlled access system are considered. The current regulations provide for the issuance by the Regional Director of Federal numbers and color codes for stone crab fishing in the EEZ when an applicant is unable to obtain a State permit. However, the Regional Director has not issued any Federal numbers/color codes under the current regulations. Amendment 5 would place a temporary moratorium ending not later than June 30, 1998, on the issuance by the Regional Director of Federal numbers and color codes for use on stone crab vessels and gear, and would invalidate any permits issued between July 1, 1994, and the effective date of the regulations implementing Amendment 5. This moratorium would end no later than June 30, 1998, and would discourage speculative entry into the fishery while potential effort or access controls are considered by the industry, Florida, and the Council.
