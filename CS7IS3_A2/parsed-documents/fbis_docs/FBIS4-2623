FBIS4-2623 "drchi070_a_94008" FBIS-CHI-94-070 Daily Report 9 Apr 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS General International Symposium on Spark Program Closes 8 Apr International Symposium on Spark Program Closes 8 Apr OW0904110994 Beijing XINHUA in English 0857 GMT 9 Apr 94 OW0904110994 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Hangzhou, April 9 (XINHUA) -- The Spark Program has been very fruitful since it was launched eight years ago. More than 14 million experts in different fields have been trained in 367 state and 173 provincial centers, who have played a key role in the development of rural economy, especially in the coastal provinces. Some 50,000 projects have been implemented through the program, covering 85 percent of the country's counties. Half of the projects have generated obvious economic and social profits. These were revealed at an international conference on China's Spark Program, which ended in this capital of Zhejiang Province Friday [8 April]. The conference was jointly sponsored by the SCST [State Commission for Science and Technology], the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation and the U.N. Development Program. Participating were delegations from 18 countries and from 17 provinces in China. The Spark Program was launched eight years ago, aimed at spreading modern farming techniques and train technical personnel for both farming and industrial enterprises. Experts attended the conference agreed that the shift of focus in the program will make rural enterprisers to be "ready for the market economy and world economic competition" in the country's better off coastal areas, in addition to training more technicians and experts in certain lines of production. "Technical training and product development will be combined in the process to better transform science into productivity," a SCST official said. In the less developed inland rural regions in the country, the program will center on promoting production and product development based on their local natural resources, according to the SCST. The SCST and local science and technology commissions will help to establish more pilot group companies in the countryside, whose annual output value will hit 100 million yuan (11.63 U.S. dollars), and generate an output value of more than 10 million yuan a year. Some 100 such companies have already been established through the program. The SCST cited Li Lianzhi as an example. Li, now president of Tianjin driving school, used to be a farmer peddling vegetables. After being trained in the spark program, he now possesses 4 research institutions, 89 branch companies and 35 enterprises, whose annual output value has reached 100 million yuan. The Spark Program provided township enterprises with easily applicable technologies and better management expertise, the SCST said. It is also conducive to narrowing the gap between the rural and urban areas and between the coastal and inland economies, experts said. Groups of technicians in research institutions and universities were organized by the state and local science and technological commissions to spread technologies, solve technical problems and launch technical projects for the rural and inland regions in winter or summer vacations and holidays. Brought to the farmers are not only advanced and easily applicable technologies, but also new bio-technology. "Farmers have come to realize the importance of science and technology in farming, livestock and fish breeding, and running enterprises," a scst official said. As a result, many training centers and research institutions have been established spontaneously by the farmers-turned entrepreneurs, the official said.
