A meeting was scheduled later Thursday in the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale between the head of the UNHCR mission in Bosnia-Hercegovina, Karin Abu-Zayd, and the separatist republic's vice-president Nikola Koljevic, said UNHCR spokesman Kris Janowski. Karadzic had personally assured UN special representative to ex-Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi the trucks would be returned as soon as possible, Janowski said. Convoys would again start moving from the Croatian capital Zagreb to the Maglaj region once the United Nations obtained security guarantees, he said, adding that convoys however were still leaving from Zenica, in central Bosnia. The stolen trucks were parked at a Bosnian Serb barracks in Tezlic, southwest of Maglaj, a mainly-Moslem enclave which received its first aid convoy in five months on Sunday after Serb forces eased their siege, the spokesman said. Rogue Bosnian Serb forces hijacked a 10-truck UN aid convoy taking 94 tonnes of food and other aid to Maglaj on Wednesday near Teslic. Serb soldiers, led by a colonel whom Karadzic said would be punished, threatened the Danish drivers and forced them to abandon the trucks, Jankowski said. The Serbs starting loading the trucks' contents onto civilian trucks, but when it turned out to be a lengthy operation, they stole the trucks, the spokesman said, adding that Serb police guarding the convoy "evaporated." The Danish drivers were abducted, then found a few hours later at Zepce, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) to the south, in a Bosnian Croat-held area. One of the trucks was recovered later, he said. Jankowski described the theft as a "very serious incident." He said Pale late Wednesday "declared itself quite upset and surprised" at what had happened. Two UNHCR convoys have reached Maglaj from Zenica and two others from Tesanj, north of Maglaj, since British UN peacekeepers entered the town Sunday. Before that, the town of 16,000 had been supplied for the past five months mainly by air drops. No convoys had been sent in since October, when two Danish drivers of a UNHCR convoy were assassinated as they were entering Maglaj.
