Mr Major has contained the changes so as to disturb as little as possible the ministerial structure in the Lords. Lord Caithness's portfolio will be undertaken at the lower level of Under-Secretary, by Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, promoted from the Whips' Office. Lord Mackay, 55, as Mr John Mackay, sat in the House of Commons from 1979 to 1987, first as MP [Member of Parliament] for Argyll and later for the redrawn constituency of Argyll and Bute. The resignation also gives Mr Major an opportunity to promote Lord Strathclyde, 33, from Under-Secretary to Minister of State at the Department of Trade and Industry. Lady Denton, 58, becomes Under-Secretary Northern Ireland, swapping jobs with the Earl of Arran, 55, who becomes Under-Secretary, Environment. Downing Street declined to give a reason for this exchange of posts. A new whip, to replace Lord Mackay, will be announced later.
