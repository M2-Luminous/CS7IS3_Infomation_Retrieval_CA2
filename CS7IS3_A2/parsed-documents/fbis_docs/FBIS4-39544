The question of granting the status of a military base to the Russian Federation Army units stationed in Armenia, the prospects of implementing the current plan for the peaceful settlement of the Karabakh problem, matters pertaining to the organization of Armenia's air defenses, and a number of other issues were discussed during the meeting. State Minister Vazgen Sargisyan, Defense Minister Serzh Sargisyan, and Interior Minister Vano Siradegyan participated in the meeting. Russian Defense Minister and Army General Pavel Grachev granted an interview to an ARMENPRES correspondent. Replying to a question on the purpose of his visit, he said that he is visiting Armenia at the invitation of Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan to conduct talks on a number of military-political matters, particularly on cooperation between the two countries within the framework of the collective security agreement. The minister said that the [word indistinct] conditions for the deployment of the Russian Army units in the Republic will be discussed. Grachev added that matters relating to the Karabakh-Azerbaijani conflict will also be discussed during his visit to Armenia and meetings with the Republic's leadership. In this connection, he specifically emphasized that Armenia and Karabakh have signed the agreement on peaceful settlement of the conflict worked out with Russian mediation, whereas Azerbaijan has so far refrained from doing so. Therefore, after his visit to Georgia on Saturday he will go to Baku to meet Aliyev to propose that Azerbaijan finally sign the agreement. Commenting on whether the number of Russian troops could be increased in Armenia, Grachev noted that there could only be talk of reducing them. After his meeting with Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan, Mr. Grachev told reporters that he is satisfied with the results of his talks with the Armenian president. The president and the Armenian people desire to have Russian bases on Armenian territory within the framework of the collective security agreement and on a bilateral basis to jointly ensure the security of Armenia and Russia. The Armenian president reiterated support for the implementation of that agreement [on Nagorno-Karabakh], which we formulated in Moscow, said the Russian defense minister. He added that he will leave for Baku on 11 June with these impressions and will ask Aliyev to once more reassess the situation and sign the agreement. He expressed the hope that after that a real and stable peace will be established in Nagorno-Karabakh.
