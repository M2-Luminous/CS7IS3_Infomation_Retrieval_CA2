To begin with, we witness the creation of a powerful democratic party, which could put an end to organisational quarrels in the democratic movement. Second, it has clear-cut domestic and foreign policy programmes, which boldly pinpoint the painful moments of the current situation. And third, the party will have a chance to work in regions, where political life had been dominated by such better organised forces as the Agrarian, Communist and other groups, formed on the basis of bureaucratic principles, Mityukov said.
