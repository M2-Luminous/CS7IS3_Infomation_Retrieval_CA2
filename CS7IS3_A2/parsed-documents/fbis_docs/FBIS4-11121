Frei said this during a dinner party to fete Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus who arrived from Buenos Aires today for a three-day official visit to Chile. Frei said that the Chilean and Czech Governments "uphold broad respect for human rights and fully enforce the multiparty system." The Chilean chief of state pointed out that "both countries enjoy a similar degree of development and uphold the effectiveness of an open international trade which is not discriminatory. They are against restrictions that prevent it from being clear." Frei added: "In the four years since March 1990, Chile and the Czech Republic have come closer on several issues and have made efforts to build solid and fruitful relations." Chile and the former Czechoslovakia resumed diplomatic relations at the ambassadorial level on 11 March 1990, when Patricio Aylwin's civilian administration assumed power, ending almost 17 years of General Augusto Pinochet's military regime. Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus will meet with Chilean public and private sector officials and will end his visit to Santiago on 22 April with the signing of a broad cooperation agreement in the areas of culture, education, and science.
