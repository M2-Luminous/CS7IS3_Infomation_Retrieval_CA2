The three parties expelled from the anti-Sandinist coalition are: the Christian Democratic Union [UDC], the Nicaraguan Democratic Movement [MDN], and the Conservative Popular Alliance [APC] headed by Miriam Arguello Morales. The reason the UDC, APC, and MDN were kicked out of the UNO ranks was that they refused to sign a statement, which was signed by the other UNO parties, demanding a national constituent assembly. Radio Nicaragua has been unable to contact the leaders of the expelled parties in order to get their reaction.
