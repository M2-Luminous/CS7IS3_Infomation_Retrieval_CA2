FR940812-2-00203 FR940812-2-00073 The Amex will ensure that not more than 20% of the weight of the Index is represented by ADRs overlying foreign securities that are not subject to comprehensive surveillance sharing agreements. 14 Currently, one component ADR, accounting for 8% of the Index value, has the majority of its trading volume occurring on the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores, an exchange with which the Amex does not currently have in place an effective information sharing agreement. 14 See Amendment No. 3: Also, see infra note 23. If the Index fails at any time to satisfy the maintenance criteria set forth in the Generic Narrow-Based Index Approval Order and Exchange Rule 901C, the Exchange will immediately notify the Commission of that fact and will not open for trading any additional series of options of the Index unless such failure is determined by the Exchange not to be significant and the Commission concurs in that determination, or unless the continued listing of options on the Mexico Index has been approved by the Commission under Section 19(b)(2) of the Exchange Act. 15 15 See Amendment No. 3. Exchange Rules Applicable to Stock Index Options Amex Rules 900C through 980C will apply to the trading of regular and long-term contracts based on the Index. These Rules cover issues as such as surveillance, exercise prices, and position limits. Surveillance procedures currently used to monitor trading in each of the Exchange's other index options will also be used to monitor trading in options on the Index. The Index is deemed to be a Stock Index option under Rule 901C(a) and a Stock Index Group under Rule 900C(b)(1). With respect to Rule 903C(b), the Exchange proposes to list near-the-money ( i.e ., within ten points above or below the current index value) options series on the Index at 21/2 point strike (exercise) price intervals when the value of the Index is below 200 points. In addition, the Exchange proposes to establish, pursuant to Rule 904C(c), a position limit of 7,500 contracts on the same side of the market. 16 16 See Amendment No. 4. The Exchange seeks to have the ability to utilize its Auto-Ex system for orders in the Index options of up to 50 contracts. Auto-Ex is the Exchange's automated execution system which provides for the automatic execution of market and marketable limit orders at the best bid or offer at the time the order is entered. The Amex believes the ability to use Auto-Ex for orders of up to 50 contracts will provide customers with deep, liquid markets as well as expeditious executions. The Amex represents that it has the necessary systems capacity to support new series that would result from the introduction of Mexico Index Options. 17 17 See Letter from Edward Cook, Jr., Managing Director, Information Technology, Amex, to Michael Walinskas, Derivative Products Regulation, SEC, dated July 8, 1994. Additionally, the Options Price Reporting Authority (``OPRA'') has stated that it has the necessary systems capacity to support those new series of index options that would result from the introduction of Index options and Index LEAPS. See Memorandum from Joe Corrigan, Executive Director, OPRA, to Charles Faurot, Managing Director, Market Data Services, Amex, dated July 8, 1994. II. Discussion The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange and, in particular, the requirements of Section 6(b)(5). 18 Specifically, the Commission finds that the trading of Mexico Index options, including full-value and reduced-value Index LEAPS, will serve to promote the public interest and help to remove impediments to a free and open securities market by providing investors with a means of hedging exposure to market risk associated with Mexican securities. 19 18 15 U.S.C. ยง78f(b)(5) (1988). 19 Pursuant to Section 6(b)(5) of the Act, the Commission must predicate approval of any new option proposal upon a finding that the introduction of such new derivative instrument is in the public interest. Such a finding would be difficult for a derivative instrument that served no hedging or other economic function, because any benefits that might be derived by market participants likely would be outweighted by the potential for manipulation, diminished public confidence in the integrity of the markets, and other valid regulatory concerns. In this regard, the trading of listed Index options and full-value Index LEAPS will provide investors with a hedging vehicle that should reflect the overall movement of Mexican stocks and ADRs in the U.S. securities markets. The Commission also believes that these Index options will provide investors with a means by which to make investment decisions regarding Mexican securities traded in the U.S. securities markets, allowing them to establish positions or increase existing positions in such markets in a cost effective manner. Moreover, the Commission believes that the reduced-value Index LEAPS, which will be traded on an index computed at one-tenth the value of the Mexico Index, will serve the needs of retail investors by providing them with the opportunity to use a long-term option to hedge their portfolios from long-term market moves, at a reduced cost.
