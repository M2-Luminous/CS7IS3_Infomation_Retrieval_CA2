"The negotiations broke down because the North proceeded with the replacement of spent fuel rods, ignoring the IAEA request to stop withdrawing them," said the sources. "Accordingly, three out of the five IAEA officials in North Korea will pull out of Pyongyang today." The sources, however, said two inspectors would remain in North Korea to witness the work of discharging spent fuel rods at the Yongbyon reactor.
