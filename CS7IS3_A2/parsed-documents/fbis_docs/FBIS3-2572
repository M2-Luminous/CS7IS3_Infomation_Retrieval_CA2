When Secretary Wang, who was grinning from ear to ear, entered the meeting hall, the people's deputies burst into warm applause. Smiling, Wang Maolin told them: Today, I am going to listen to your opinions on Governor Chen Bangzhu's government work report, and discuss with you the reform in Zhuzhou. Immediately after Comrade Wang Maolin finished speaking, (Wang Qingming), mayor of Zhuzhou city, said: The development strategy for the whole province formulated by Governor Chen's government work report conforms with practical reality. We will build Zhuzhou into a hi-tech industrial base, a goods collection and distribution base, and a transport, information and telecommunications center in the southeastern part of Hunan. This is a fairly strenuous task. [passage omitted] During the discussion, enterprise reform and the establishment of the system for modern enterprises was an issue much discussed by people's deputies. They showed very great interest in this topic for discussion. People's Deputies Wu Zhenduo, Cui Xinchen, and Ding Aiguo pointed out: It is extremely difficult to carry out enterprise reform, and we are encountering numerous difficulties. However, it does not work to give it up. Wu Zhenduo, chairman of the board of directors of the Nanfang Power Machinery Group, expressed his views in light of practical reality; after deep consideration, he stressed that the three measures taken by us for structural reform are comparatively successful as a whole. However, our reform is not yet in full swing. [words indistinct] We must push various trades and service toward the market. Secretary Wang Maolin, who worked in enterprises for many years and has rich management experience, emphasized: The method adopted by the Nanfang Corporation is worth popularizing. This method for reforming the enterprise system actually means socialization of enterprises. State-owned enterprises in Zhuzhou's industrial circles must take the lead in this regard, and must set an example for the whole province. [passage omitted]
