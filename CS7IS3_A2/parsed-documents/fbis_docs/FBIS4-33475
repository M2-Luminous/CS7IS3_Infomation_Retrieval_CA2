This comission is formed by representatives of the Government, Labor, and Foreign Ministries, Immigration, State Security, ONPAR, UNHCR, and the Red Cross, among other organizations. The commission is analyzing the request made by the United States to permit the arrival of Haitian refugees in Panama. Although Panama has not adopted an official position regarding the request, unofficial international reports indicate that the United States plans to transfer to Panama a total of 5,000 Haitian refugees who are currently in Florida. Nevertheless, Jose Javier Mulino denied that the national commission, ONPAR, and the UNHCR are studying the entry of such a large number of refugees, "because this country is not prepared to meet such expenses or deal with their presence here."
