Foreign Minister Pik Botha said Lesotho's Prime Minister Dr Ntsu Mokhehle told a South African embassy official that the Lesotho Defence Force arrested the Deputy Premier S. Baholo and three other ministers on Thursday [14 April]. The prime minister was deeply concerned about their personal safety, Mr Botha said. "The head of the Lesotho Defence Force could not be traced. At the time of the meeting with the prime minister no-one knew anything about his whereabouts." Lesotho's prime minister requested immediate South African mediation with the Lesotho Defence Force. "I informed the South African Minister of Defence Mr Kobie Coetsee about the situation and he is giving instructions for senior members of the SADF to communicate with the Lesotho Defence Force in an attempt to calm the situation and to find a solution to the present crisis," Mr Botha said. He had also informed the Transitional Executive Council's [TEC] sub-committee on foreign affairs of the events in Lesotho as well as the foreign minister of Zimbabwe. President Robert Mugabe was the chairman of the committee consisting of Botswana, Zimbabwe and South Africa which had been involved for the last few months in assisting the Lesotho Government and the Lesotho Defence Force in finding a solution to a dispute that has threatened the country's stability. "The South African Government and the TEC appeal to the Lesotho Defence Force to abandon its present course of action and to avoid bloodshed at any cost," Mr Botha said. The South African Government wished to emphasize that it would not recognize any government that endeavoured to come into being through violence. Steps would be considered in conjunction with Zimbabwe and Botswana on how to deal with the present situation, Mr Botha said. In the meantime South Africans were cautioned not to visit Lesotho until greater clarity emerged on the situation. Mr Botha appealed to those reponsible for arresting the ministers concerned not to inflict any physical or other harm upon them. The South African Government stood ready to negotiate with the officers concerned for the ministers' release, which may or may not include safe conduct to South Africa. An international task force earlier found that the Basotho people should solve their own political and military problems, although South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana were prepared to assist in this regard. This was the essence of the findings of the task force which investigated the Lesotho situation following earlier instances of military insurrection. The three countries' heads of state met in Gaborone in January and, following an appeal for assistance from the Lesotho Government, instructed the task force to investigate fighting amongst factions of the country's defence force. Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Nathan Shamuyarira told a news conference in Pretoria in January: "We are trying to assist the Basotho people to solve their own political and military problems. "The (task force) stressed this factor in this report and the heads of state will be appraised of this fact also. "It is a Basotho problem that must be solved by the Basothos."
