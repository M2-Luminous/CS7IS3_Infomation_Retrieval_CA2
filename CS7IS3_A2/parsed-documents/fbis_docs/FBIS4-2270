The main contents are as follows: 1. It is necessary to conscientiously implement the spirit of the 4 February notice by the State Planning Commission and the State General Administration of Taxation on maintaining price stability after taxation system reform is carried out. All [word indistinct] are prohibited from [words indistinct] and forcing up commodity prices at will and disrupting the market. 2. As the economy grows overall, tax burdens in enterprises will not be increased. If the tax burdens in enterprises which introduced the new taxation system increase, in principle, they should not increase prices. Because their tax burdens have increased by too wide a margin, enterprises in localities which want to increase prices should get the approval of the commodity price bureau. 3. As the current ex-factory price, wholesale price, and retail sales price already contain taxes, all [word indistinct] are prohibited from increasing the burdens on consumers by applying value-added and other forms of taxes. As far as the commodities which are sold at reduced prices are concerned, production, allocation, and wholesale departments should indicate on the price tags that taxes are not included in the reduced prices. 4. The different profit rates from marketing wholesale and retail sales of consumers capital goods, including agricultural capital goods such as chemical fertilizers and farm chemicals, should remain unchanged; that is, they should be calculated at the present taxable prices. All expenses should be collected from the different profit rates. All enterprises and units are prohibited from expanding the rates without authorization. 5. Commodity price departments in urban districts should strengthen supervision and inspection over market prices. Those who adjust the prices of commodities whose prices are set by the state without the approval of the commodity price bureau, or increase their prices because of miscalculations resulting from a misunderstanding of the situation, or force up their prices by capitalizing on taxation system reform, should be ordered to make prompt corrections and, moreover, they should be dealt with according to relevant state laws and regulations.
