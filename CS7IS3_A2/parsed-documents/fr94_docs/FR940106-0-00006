FR940106-0-00006 FR940106-0-00003 Section 1773.34(e)(1)(ii) for electric borrowers and §1773.34(e)(2)(iii) for telephone borrowers requires CPAs to test for compliance with the loan and security instrument provision requiring funds to be deposited in banks or other depositories designated in the loan documents or approved by REA. Because of the many and varied investing activities available in today's economy, CPAs have questioned the definition of funds and what, if any, investments are affected. This final rule provides a definition of funds for purposes of applying this part 1773. Section 1773.34(e)(1)(iv) for electric borrowers and §1773.34(e)(2)(iv) for telephone borrowers requires CPAs to review the financial and statistical report and state whether the information presented is in agreement with the borrower's records. CPAs have questioned whether they are required to review a certified copy of the report obtained directly from REA or whether they may review a copy represented by the borrower as having been submitted to REA. This final rule clarifies REA's requirement for CPAs to review a copy of the financial and statistical report represented by the borrower as having been submitted to REA. Section 1773.34(e)(1)(iii) for electric borrowers and §1773.34(e)(2)(ii) for telephone borrowers requires the CPA to state whether an REA borrower has complied with the provision of its loan and security instrument that requires a borrower to obtain written approval of mortgagees to enter into any contract for the operation or maintenance of all or any part of its property, or for the use of its property by others. This requirement clearly goes beyond the scope of government auditing standards because it requires all contracts, even those that have little or no impact on financial statement amounts, to be reviewed by the CPA for REA approval. This testing has, during the effective period of part 1773, translated into increased audit fees. To minimize the cost impact to REA borrowers yet provide REA the assurance it requires, this final rule details the contracts that must be reviewed by CPAs. This final rule also incorporates the illustrative management letter, as amended by these part 1773 revisions, issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants in a Technical Practice Aid dated November 11, 1992. The illustrative letter properly addresses the management letter requirements set forth in 7 CFR 1773.34 and includes specific language to ensure compliance with the promulgated auditing literature. As such, REA believes it is more informative than the sample management letter previously provided in appendix C to part 1773. Due to a procedural change within REA that will more efficiently process and review audit reports submitted by REA borrowers, this final rule also amends §1773.3, §1773.20, and §1773.21 to require borrowers to submit to REA an additional copy of the audit, report on compliance, report on internal controls, and management letter and revises §1773.21 to require the submission of an additional copy of borrowers' plans for corrective action. Comments A proposed rule entitled Policy on Audits of REA Borrowers, published September 23, 1993, at 58 FR 49442, invited interested parties to submit comments on or before November 22, 1993. Comments were received from the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA) and two certified public accounting firms. The comments submitted by NRECA were based upon an analysis performed by the Accounting & Depreciation Committee, a subcommittee of the Generation and Transmission Managers Association Technical Advisory Committee, and were considered and concurred in by the NRECA Accounting and Tax Committee. One accounting firm agreed with the proposed revisions in all respects. The other commenters agreed with the proposed revisions; however, proffered additional revisions. The following paragraphs address the additional revisions proposed by the commenters. Comment. Sections 1773.40 and 1773.45 state that the certified public accountant's (CPA) workpapers must document whether all regulatory assets and liabilities comply with the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, and have received REA approval. REA telephone borrowers that comply with generally accepted accounting principles as required by part 32 of the Federal Communications Commission's Rules and Regulations, Uniform System of Accounts for Telecommunications Companies, are not required to obtain specific REA approval of regulatory assets and liabilities. Only REA electric borrowers must seek such approval. Sections 1773.40 and 1773.45 should be amended to specify that REA approval of regulatory assets and liabilities must only be documented for REA electric borrowers. Response. REA agrees with the comment and has revised §1773.40 and §1773.45 accordingly.
