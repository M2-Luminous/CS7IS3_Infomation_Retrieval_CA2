SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Paperwork Reduction Act Statement The information collection requirements contained in this rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 and have been assigned OMB Control Number 2506&hyph;0121. I. Statutory and Regulatory Background The Uniform Relocation Act Amendments of 1987 (Title IV, Pub. L. 100&hyph;17, April 2, 1987) (1987 Amendments) amended the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (URA). Principal among the 1987 Amendments is an expanded definition of the term ``displaced person'' to include any person who has moved or moved his personal property ``as a direct result of rehabilitation or demolition'' or privately undertaken acquisition. Under the revised definition, an ``unlawful occupant'' or a person occupying a displacement dwelling ``for the purpose of obtaining assistance,'' or a short-term renter who begins occupancy of the property with knowledge of its acquisition for a project that involves displacement, is not a ``displaced person.'' (Section 402, 1987 Amendments.) In section 402(e) of the 1987 Amendments, the term ``comparable replacement dwelling'' is defined, in part, as a dwelling that is adequate, decent, safe, and sanitary, functionally equivalent and generally in as desirable a location as the location of the displaced person's dwelling. Also added by section 402(e) is a definition of the term ``displacing agency'', which means ``any Federal agency carrying out a program or project, and any State, State agency, or person carrying out a program or project with Federal financial assistance, which causes a person to be a displaced person.'' Section 405 of the 1987 Amendments added a new paragraph 4 to section 202(a) of the URA to provide a maximum reestablishment payment of $10,000 for a displaced farm, nonprofit organization, or small business. Section 202(c) of the URA also was amended to change the range of the fixed payment that is available as an alternative to a payment for actual reasonable moving and related expenses. The new fixed payment ranges from $1,000 to $20,000. The former payment ranged from $2,500 to $10,000. Section 406 of the 1987 Amendments amended section 203(a) of the URA to increase the maximum payment under section 203 from $15,000 to $22,500 with respect to replacement housing for a homeowner, and under section 204, amended by section 407 of the 1987 Amendments, the maximum payment was increased to $5,250 for a renter. However, when such amounts are not sufficient to provide a comparable replacement dwelling as required by section 205(c)(3), agencies must provide additional or alternative assistance to the displaced person. Such additional or alternative assistance is authorized under section 206 (amended by section 409 of the 1987 Amendments). Section 412 of the Amendments authorized the lead agency (Department of Transportation (DOT)) to issue, with the active participation of HUD and other Federal agencies, regulations to implement the URA. On March 2, 1989, DOT issued a government-wide final rule (see 54 FR 8912) to follow an interim rule issued by that agency on December 17, 1987 (see 52 FR 47994). On February 19, 1988 (53 FR 4964), HUD published an interim rule advising that it would make effective as of April 2, 1989 ``all the rule changes necessary to implement amendments'' to the URA. (Section 418 of the 1987 Amendments mandated that the amendments take effect no later than April 2, 1989.) II. Public Comment on Interim HUD Rule HUD received only one comment in response to the interim rule. The comment concerned the fact that HUD did not join with DOT and certain other Federal agencies in the December 17, 1987 DOT interim final rule that implemented several of the 1987 Amendments. The commenter thought that HUD's delay would result in lower replacement housing payments for displaced persons. The DOT interim rule did not increase the amount of replacement housing assistance to be provided to a person displaced from a dwelling. The URA ``common rule'' jointly published in the Federal Register (51 FR 7000) by HUD and 16 other Federal agencies on February 27, 1986, set forth an open-ended ``make whole'' standard as the basis for determining the amount of replacement housing assistance to be provided to displaced persons.
