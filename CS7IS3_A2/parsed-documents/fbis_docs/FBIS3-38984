As the Bonn Foreign Ministry reported on Tuesday [8 February], FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel promised this in Brussels on Monday during a meeting with his Algerian counterpart, Mohamed Saleh, which focused on the ban on political activities by Rabah Kebir, which had been announced by Bonn. Kebir, who has applied for asylum in Germany, belongs to the leadership circles of the extreme, militant "Islamic Salvation Front" (FIS) in Algeria, which the government holds responsible for numerous murders of foreigners.
