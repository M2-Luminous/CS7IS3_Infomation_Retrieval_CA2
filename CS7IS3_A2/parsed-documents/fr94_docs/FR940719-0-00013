FR940719-0-00013 FR940719-0-00003 The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The FAA recognizes that the obligation to maintain aircraft in an airworthy condition is vital, but sometimes expensive. Because AD's require specific actions to address specific unsafe conditions, they appear to impose costs that would not otherwise be borne by operators. However, because of the general obligation of operators to maintain aircraft in an airworthy condition, this appearance is deceptive. Attributing those costs solely to the issuance of this AD is unrealistic because, in the interest of maintaining safe aircraft, most prudent operators would accomplish the required actions even if they were not required to do so by the AD. A full cost-benefit analysis has not been accomplished for this AD. As a matter of law, in order to be airworthy, an aircraft must conform to its type design and be in a condition for safe operation. The type design is approved only after the FAA makes a determination that it complies with all applicable airworthiness requirements. In adopting and maintaining those requirements, the FAA has already made the determination that they establish a level of safety that is cost-beneficial. When the FAA, as in this AD, makes a finding of an unsafe condition, this means that this cost-beneficial level of safety is no longer being achieved and that the required actions are necessary to restore that level of safety. Because this level of safety has already been determined to be cost-beneficial, a full cost-benefit analysis for this AD would be redundant and unnecessary. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES . List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by reference, Safety. Adoption of the Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. §39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: 94&hyph;10&hyph;06 Boeing: Amendment 39&hyph;8913. Docket 93&hyph;NM&hyph;80&hyph;AD. Applicability: Model 707/720 series airplanes, as listed in section 4 and appendix A.4 of Boeing Document D6&hyph;54996, ``Aging Airplane Service Bulletin Structural Modification and Inspection Program_ Model 707/720,'' Revision E, dated March 8, 1994; certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent degradation of the structural capability of the airplane, accomplish the following: (a) Accomplish the inspections specified in Section 4 and Appendix A.4 of Boeing Document Number D6&hyph;54996, ``Aging Airplane Service Bulletin Structural Modification and Inspection Program_Model 707/720,'' Revision E, dated March 8, 1994, in accordance with the schedule specified in paragraph (b) of this AD. Repeat these inspections thereafter at intervals not to exceed those specified in the Boeing Document for each inspection. (b) The maximum initial inspection time for the inspections required by paragraph (a) of this AD shall be the later of the times specified in either paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this AD: (1) The threshold for inspection time for the inspection specified in the Boeing Document, measured as an accumulated total of flight cycles or time-in-service, as appropriate; or (2) The ``phase-in'' period for the inspection specified in the Boeing Document, measured from a date 18 months after the effective date of this AD. Note 1: For the purposes of this AD, the ``phase-in period'' is defined as the allowable period to accomplish the initial inspection when the ``threshold'' specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this AD is imminent or has elapsed. (c) If any discrepant condition identified in the service bulletins (that are specified in the Boeing Document) is found as a result of the inspections required by this AD, prior to further flight, accomplish the corresponding corrective action specified in the service bulletins. (d) The terminating action for each inspection required by paragraph (a) of this AD consists of the accomplishment of the modification specified in the corresponding service bulletin. (e) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Seattle ACO. Note 2: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Seattle ACO. (f) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with §§21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. (g) The inspections and corrective actions shall be done in accordance with Boeing Document Number D6&hyph;54996, ``Aging Airplane Service Bulletin Structural Modification and Inspection Program_Model 707/720,'' Revision E, dated March 8, 1994, which includes the following list of effective pages: ␣ 1Page No. 1Revision level shown on page List of active pages: Pages c.1 and c.2 E ( Note: The issue date of Revision E is indicated only on the title page; no other page of the document is dated.) This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies may be obtained from Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, P.O. Box 3707, Seattle, Washington 98124&hyph;2207. Copies may be inspected at the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. (h) This amendment becomes effective on June 20, 1994. Issued in Renton, Washington, on May 6, 1994. S. R. Miller, Acting Manager, Transport Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service.
