FR940812-2-00191 FR940812-2-00068 3.b.6␣A minimum sample of 100 intersections should be inspected with MRPC to meet the criteria of this part. 3.c␣Data Acquisition and Analysis 3.c.1␣The bobbin coil calibration standard should be calibrated against the reference standard used in the laboratory as part of the development of the voltage-based approach by direct testing or through use of a transfer standard. 3.c.2␣Bobbin coil probes should be calibrated based on four 100 percent through-wall holes. 3.c.3␣Once the probe has been calibrated on the 100 percent through-wall hole, the voltage response of new bobbin coil probes for the 20 percent to 80 percent American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) through-wall holes should not differ from the nominal voltage by more than +/^10 percent. 3.c.4␣Probe wear should be controlled by either an inline measurement device or through the use of a periodic wear measurement. When utilizing the periodic wear measurement approach, if a probe is found to be out-of-specification, all tubes inspected since the last successful calibration should be reinspected with the new calibrated probe. 3.c.5␣Data analysts should be trained and qualified in the use of the analyst's guidelines and procedures. Data analyst performance should be consistent with the assumptions for analyst measurement variability (Section 2.b.2(1)) utilized in the tube integrity evaluation (Section 2). 3.c.6␣Quantitative noise criteria (resulting from electrical noise, tube noise, calibration standard noise) should be included in the data analysis procedures. Data failing to meet these criteria should be rejected, and the tube reinspected. 3.c.7␣Data analysts should review the mixed residuals on the standard itself and take action as necessary to minimize these residuals. 3.c.8␣Smaller diameter probes can be used to inspect tubes where it is impractical to utilize a full-sized probe provided that the probes and procedures have been demonstrated on a statistically significant basis to give an equivalent voltage response and detection capability when compared to the full size probe. This demonstration can be done on a plant-specific or generic basis. 4. Tube Removal and Examination/Testing Implementation of voltage-based plugging criteria should include a program of tube removals for testing and examination as described below. The purpose of this program is to confirm axial ODSCC as the dominant degradation mechanism as discussed in Section 1.a and to provide additional data to enhance the burst pressure, probability of leakage, and conditional leak rate correlations described in Sections 2.a.1, 2.b.3(1), and 2.b.3(2), respectively. 4.a␣Number and Frequency of Tube Pulls Pulled tube specimens for at least six tube support plate intersections should be obtained for each plant either during the plant steam generator inspection outage that implements the voltage repair limits or during the inspection outage preceding initial application of voltage-based repair criteria. Additional pulled tube specimens should be obtained periodically after the initial application of voltage-based plugging criteria on a frequency of six tube intersections every two steam generator inspections outages. In some cases, it may be necessary for the staff to request plant specific tube pulls due to special circumstances involved with a particular plant specific application of the voltage-based repair limits. Alternatively, the request to acquire pulled tube specimens may be met by participating in an industry sponsored tube pull program endorsed by the NRC that meets the objectives of this guidance. Such a program would have to satisfy the following objectives: (1) To confirm the degradation mechanism for plants utilizing the generic letter for the first time, (2) to continue monitoring the ODSCC mechanism over time, and (3) to enhance the burst pressure, probability of leakage, and conditional leak rate correlations. [Note; the industry has proposed such a program in letter dated May 10, 1994, to Brian Sheron, NRC, from David J. Modeen, Nuclear Energy Institute (Reference 5), which is currently under NRC staff review.] 4.b␣Selection Criteria Selection of tube pulls should consider the following criteria: 4.b.1␣There should be an emphasis on removing tube intersections with large voltage indications. 4.b.2␣Where possible the removed tube intersections should cover a range of voltages, including intersections with no detectable degradation. 4.b.3␣As a minimum, selected intersections should be such as to ensure that the total data set includes at least a representative number of intersections with MRPC signatures indicative of a single dominant crack as compared to intersections with MRPC signatures indicative of two or more dominant cracks about the circumference. 4.c␣Examination and Testing Removed tube intersections should be subjected to leak and burst tests under simulated MSLB conditions to confirm that the failure mode and leakage rates are consistent with that assumed in development of the voltage-based criteria. In addition, these data may be used to enhance the supporting data sets for the burst pressure and leakage correlations subject to NRC review and approval as stated in 4.d, below. Subsequent to burst testing, the intersections should be destructively examined to confirm that the degradation morphology is consistent with the assumed morphology for ODSCC. 4.d␣General Criteria for Burst and Leakage Models and Supporting Test Data This guidance allows only the use of NRC approved burst and leakage models and correlations; this includes NRC approval of the data that supports the models and correlations.
