The studio announcer introduces a report from the Zivince Press Center on attacks at Dubrave airport in Tuzla. An unidentified correspondent from the press center says that "the defense lines are exposed to sporadic provocations, while important buildings like Dubrave airport are the target of artillery attacks. Howitzer shells were launched from Drvenik at the wider area of Zivinice. Owing to this, a general alarm signal was sounded. The enemy attacks did not have any consequences and all the defense lines remain stable." Maglaj correspondent Hajrudin Sermic reports that "the fiercest fighting, hand-to-hand fighting is in progress on the south and southeastern fronts, where the aggressors -- vicious animals -- are attempting infantry breakthroughs. Up to the time of filing this report, two women have been killed, while five civilians, three of them children, have been seriously injured." Mirza Sadikovic reports from Bihac and says that "this morning, the chetniks once again viciously attacked the defenders' lines on Grabez, [name indistinct], Hasin Vrh, and the Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau. They are again attempting breakthroughs in the region of the Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau from the areas of Livaci, (?Brtnik), and (?Grmusa). Our defenders are resisting heroically." Provocations on the demarcation lines with the army of the so-called Kladusa autonomy have escalated since last night, particularly in the areas of (?Trst) and Pecigrad in the Cazin Commune. Since this morning, they are using mortars and are bringing in fresh forces and equipment. Viktor Boban reports from Zavidovici and says that "an artillery attack from all of the aggressor's available arsenal began at 0900 [0800 GMT] this morning. The attack from the well-known chetnik positions was directed at the town center. Around 30 destructive shells, of which 16 were 122-mm howitzer shells, were fired in less than 40 minutes. The material damage in residential areas is immense. The morning hours on the Hajdarevici front were marked by fire from a chetnik Bofors. The situation is similar in Maholj, were the enemy is using antiaircraft machine guns." Gorazde correspondent Fahrudin Bekic reports that "the chetniks continue with their dirty work. From their positions in Medena Glavica they used 82-mm mortars to pound civilian targets in Ogleceva. The usual provocations went on on the Rogatica route, while the enemy forces from Ustipraca used antiaircraft machine guns to target Gajevi. Provocations were also registered on the demarcation line toward Cajnice and Foca."
