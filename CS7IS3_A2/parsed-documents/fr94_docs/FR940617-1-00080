FR940617-1-00080 FR940617-1-00012 In that same final rule, the agency acknowledged that hexachlorophene containing surgical scrub drug products are substantive in their action and do not produce an initial high reduction but with repeated use are effective in reducing the resident skin flora and suppressing bacterial growth in the user's glove for up to 6 hours. Based on a lack of available products capable of producing both an initial high reduction in the resident skin flora and a prolonged microbial suppression marketed at the time of the agency's action on the ingredient in 1972, the agency agreed with the recommendations of its Antimicrobial I Panel and concluded that the ingredient should continue to be marketed for use as a surgical scrub and for handwashing as part of patient care. The agency stated its intention to reconsider its criteria for evaluating such products in light of risk-benefit judgments as new products containing both attributes become available (42 FR 63771). Since that final rule was issued in 1977, data have been submitted to the agency demonstrating the effectiveness of surgical hand scrub formulations capable of producing an initial 1-log 10 reduction and a suppression of microbial growth in the wearer's glove for up to 6 hours. (See section I.E., comment 10 on alcohol and section I.I., comment 17 on povidone-iodine.) The agency notes that the persistence of the antimicrobial effect demonstrated by an alcohol-containing surgical hand scrub formulation was provided by a preservative agent in the vehicle. Based on the new data, the agency has concerns about the risk associated with the initial use of substantive surgical hand scrub formulations, and with the use of these formulations after extended lapses in their routine use. Therefore, the agency is proposing that all surgical hand scrub formulations must demonstrate an initial one-log reduction in the bacterial flora. The agency invites comment on the use of substantive antimicrobials in health-care antiseptic drug products. Based on the revised effectiveness criterion for these drug products, the agency is proposing a revised definition of a surgical hand scrub drug product in ยง333.403(c)(3) as follows: ``An antiseptic containing preparation that significantly reduces the number of micro-organisms on intact skin; it is broad spectrum, fast acting, and persistent.'' The agency believes that the modified ASTM procedures for the testing of health-care or antiseptic handwashes, surgical hand scrubs, and patient preoperative skin preps being proposed for inclusion in the testing requirements provide protocols that are appropriate for the final formulation testing of these drug products. The proposed protocols describe, in detail, study conditions and materials to be used and address the concerns raised by the comments. For instance, the proposed protocol for the testing of surgical hand scrub products includes a baseline criterion for subject selection of equal to, or greater than, 1.5 ร 10 5 bacteria per hand and specifies that a 50 to 100 mL volume of sampling is to be used. The proposed protocols also specify requirements for a number of areas not addressed by the testing guidelines proposed in the previous tentative final monograph. For example, they address statistical aspects of study design and data analysis, and the use of neutralizers. A positive control is included in the protocols as a means of validating the testing procedure, equipment, and facilities. The agency believes that the proposed protocols for the testing of these products provide a consistent approach to the effectiveness testing of health-care personnel handwashes, surgical hand scrubs, and patient preoperative skin preparations. The agency is incorporating the above criteria and testing requirements in proposed ยง333.470 of this tentative final monograph and invites specific comment on them at this time. After reviewing any submitted comments or data, the agency may revise the testing requirements and procedures prior to establishing a final monograph. The agency also recognizes that the test procedures may need to be revised periodically to reflect new information and newer techniques that are developed and proven adequate.
