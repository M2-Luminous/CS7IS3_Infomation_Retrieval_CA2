In 90 days, the Brazilian Government expects to begin simultaneous negotiations over bilateral free trade agreements with eight South American countries. The goal is to consolidate, as of 1995 and over a 10-year period, a regional market in which 80 percent of trade will be made with zero tariffs. Negotiations have a very broad scope and, for this reason, the Brazilian Foreign Ministry has decided to set no rigid limits on the talks with the other South American governments, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said. The decision already has been made. As has happened in Brazilian foreign policy over the past few decades, the decision seeks to extend beyond the terms of the Franco administration, which designed it. Itamaraty already has included this decision in the "permanent principles" that are always mentioned by Foreign Minister Celso Amorim. From a strategic viewpoint, it means that South America's biggest nation now will engage in broad negotiations to integrate the Amazonas (to the north) and the River Plate (to the south) basins. The objective is to create a regional free market that will be, nonetheless, open to promoting relations with the emerging political-economic blocs in North America, Europe, and Asia. The representatives of the South American governments involved in those negotiations regard this Brazilian diplomatic initiative as a legitimate effort to recover the political influence the country had in the region until the early 1980's. Furthermore, it is also regarded as sort of a countermeasure for the action the United States began undertaking in South America after Mexico joined NAFTA. The U.S. action seeks to reach, in the medium term, the largest possible number of bilateral free trade agreements in Latin America. This obviously interferes with the interests of Brazil, the region's main exporter and largest market. The two other major emerging Latin American markets are confronting political and socioeconomic problems that cast doubts on the future expansion of their economies: The Mexican risk increased after the Chiapas revolt, while Argentina is facing social upheavals in specific areas and increasing commercial deficits. This situation, which is dominated by the U.S. need to expand its business base in the Southern Hemisphere to assure its future world leadership, might be leading Washington to adopt a new political position toward Brazil. The appearance of irritation in the economic competition with Europe and Japan already had led the United States to modify the foundations of its foreign policy, Brazilian diplomats said. Now, since Mexico joined NAFTA, Washington has decided to emphasize its actions in South America. The Clinton administration began to use diplomacy as a lever to open markets for U.S. exporters. Until a short time ago, the U.S. State Department would only preach free trade, allowing exporters to operate naturally and independently. "During the Cold War, the U.S. Government did not need to engage very directly in the battle for the opening of markets in support of U.S. products because this was done indirectly and domestically through subsidies to local industries, technological projects, and the national defense budget. But the international arena has changed," a Brazilian ambassador and top Itamaraty member said. He added: "Now they are engaged in a real diplomacy of commerce, of business. It is something similar to what Japan and Europe are doing, though with different intensity." Based on such prospects, the Brazilian Government decided to intensify its efforts around its plan for the creation of what the diplomatic bureaucracy has called the South American Free Trade Zone. In addition to a relative competition with the United States for political influence in the region, there might be very specific economic reasons that justify this Brazilian endeavor. One of those reasons is that Brazil's participation in the commercial flow within Mercosur [Common Market of the South] has almost reached a saturation level: Brazil already supplies 25 percent of the total imports bought by Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Brazil's current participation in the trade operations of the rest of South America (that is, outside the Southern Cone) is five times smaller. This group of countries is spending $36 billion annually in imports bought from the rest of the world. In the eyes of the Brazilian Government, this is a very promising market for Brazilian products. It has enough possibilities for making current Brazilian commercial operations grow at least four times as much. In other words, it has the potential for becoming something as important as Mercosur is now for the Brazilian economy after a decade of negotiations. That is, the creation of a free trade zone in South America has become a priority for Brazilian foreign policy.
