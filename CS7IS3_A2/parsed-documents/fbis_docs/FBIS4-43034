He governed initially in coalition with the small Freedom Party, but was was quick to dissolve this when his partner made far-right nationalist Joerg Haider as its leader. Since then, Vranitzky's Social Democrats have formed a grand coalition government with the conservative Austrian People's Party. Born in 1937, Franz Vranitzky earned a doctor of economics. In his youth he was a member of the national basketball team. He is married, with a son and a daughter. [Lambroschini] The latest polls foretell a "yes" in the referendum. But a close one. There is reason for concern when we reflect back on the referendum on nuclear power which ended, in November 1978, with Chancellor Kreisky's resignation. At the time, 31 percent of the no vote three prior to the vote changed to a 51 percent on voting day. What is your prediction this time? [Vranitzky] I believe that Austrians will say "yes" to Europe, but I also believe that the outcome will be very close. There are several reasons for this reticence. The euphoria we experienced following the outcome of the successful negotiations with Brussels could not last. Those who opposed Austria's joining Europe thought that the discussions with Brussels would never end. For this reason they concentrated their fire on the negotiations, rather than immediately attacking the referendum. Now that they have adjusted their focus, they are gaining points, because the campaign is emotional, whereas, by the nature of things, the government's arguments are founded on reason. It is always easy to play on people's fears by predicting the worst. Finally do not forget that, economically, 1993 was a very bad year. In Austria, as in the rest of Europe, many people therefore reacted as if the economic recession was the result of European integration. Despite this, I firmly hope that the parallel between this referendum and Kreisky's will remain a false one. [passage omitted] [Lambroschini] Austria already enjoys all the trade advantages which the European Union [EU] can offer, with the Economic Economic Area between the European Free Trade Association [EFTA], of which you are part, and the Europe of the Twelve. Is not the real reason for your application for membership a political one? Is not Austria, which was occupied for 10 years by the Red Army, seeking for protection against Russia? Is not Austria, which has particularly unstable neighbors, looking to sign an insurance contract against the risk of another Yugoslav conflict spilling over its borders? [Vranitzky] I never said that our application could be explained simply by economic reasons. If that were the case, we could be satisfied with out participation in EFTA. I have always thought that European integration should be a political project. Europe has much more important tasks to accomplish than the simple exchange of goods. Whether we are talking about monetary union or the continent's security, the solution can come only from a shared political will. To confront, as you say, the risks of destabilization in East Europe, we need a political decisionmaking power. [Lambroschini] Do you really believe that if Europe had had a common foreign policy four or five years ago, the war in Yugoslavia could have been prevented? Do you not rather think that the failure was due to the refusal of the major European countries -- France, Germany, Great Britain -- to accept their responsibility and carry their partners with them? [Vranitzky] We will always come back to the need for common action. Today, in Yugoslavia, there are not just French and British troops. There are also Belgians, Spaniards, and Danes. Even if France and Germany have given the kick-off, the game cannot be limited to these two players. [Lambroschini] You therefore reject the view of the British, who had hoped that the arrival of four EFTA members would have the effect of weakening the camp of the partisans of a political Europe. [Vranitzky] I place myself among the proponents of political union. [Lambroschini] In joining Europe, will Austria renounce its faith in the "state as provider of all?" Will you accept the idea that combating unemployment requires you to abandon certain social benefits, when confronted with international competition, which makes labor costs too high? [Vranitzky] Rather the opposite. For Austria, joining Europe means both promoting its economic expansion and strengthening its social welfare system. In order to meet the competition from countries whose social welfare is not as good as ours, my social-democratic convictions forbid me to call into question our concept of social progress. We must meet this competition by improving the training of our workers, by investing in research, by getting out of less well-performing economic areas in order to concentrate on leading-edge technology. [Lambroschini] Hardly will Austria have joined the Twelve then it will have to participate in the debate on the reform of the European institutions scheduled to take place in 1996. For you, what needs to be changed to enable the Europe of Sixteen to find again the effectiveness which was already seriously compromised in the Europe of the Twelve? [Vranitzky] For me, the 1996 intergovernmental conference will represent that next step in the process of defining the objectives of European integration. First of all we will have to work to eliminate the so-called democratic deficit. In other words, improving the relationships between European Parliament, the Council of Ministers, and the Commission. Second, we will have to discuss common foreign policy and common security policy. When, in the referendum campaign, people ask me: "But why are you in such a hurry to join the EU?," the reply is obvious. We need to act quickly because we are determined to take part in the 1996 debate. [Lambroschini] But given the differences in the approaches of the Twelve and in their very different economic situations, do you not think that a two-speed Europe is inevitable? [Vranitzky] I am absolutely against a two-speed Europe. Such an approach would strike against the very idea of a united Europe because it would provide an all too easy excuse to those who do not want to accept the reforms. [Lambroschini] In France, many people are afraid at the idea that Austria's membership will strengthen the German bloc. Certain of them are even talking of a new annexation. Without going that far, shortly before the fall of the Berlin wall, Francois Mitterrand had welcomed you at the Elysee [office of the president] with the rather ambiguous words: "Austria, the third German state, is welcome in the European Community." [Vranitzky] Let us be clear. Austria is not a German state. Austria is only an Austrian state. That is what I told Francois Mitterrand, adding: "We do not see ourselves as members of a German bloc." To which President Mitterrand replied: "All right, we understand you. We will not insist." A second comment: Comparing Austria's entry into the EU to annexation by Hitler is to have really totally forgotten the terror involved. [Lambroschini] Economic relations between Austria and Germany are already very extensive. When you join the EU, what will win the day, the intensification of your relations with Germany, or diversification? [Vranitzky] Diversification will win the day. But remaining outside the EU would, on the contrary, lead to an intensification of relations with our largest partners. [Lambroschini] Once Austria has entered the Union, what will remain of its neutrality? [Vranitzky] For Austrians, neutrality means that they refuse to take part in a war. But I believe that we need to work together to set up a system permitting joint action against those who violate peace. Joining the EU does not therefore impair our neutrality. [Lambroschini] But if a common European security system leads to a common war, how will you be able to preserve your neutrality? [Vranitzky] Under the UN collective security system, as provided for by the UN Charter, we have already taken part in joint actions, without in this way violating our neutrality. Hence, during the Gulf War, we allowed arms to pass through Austrian territory and Austrian air space. We would certainly not have permitted this in the case of a bilateral conflict. [Lambroschini] Other neutral countries, Sweden and Finland, have applied to enter the EU and are interested in NATO's offer of a Partnership for Peace. What about Austria? [Vranitzky] Long before NATO dreamed up this Partnership for Peace, Austria had worked on developing its relations in the military area with the East European countries. With a view to peacekeeping operations, we wished to assist them with their training programs. The fact is that the development of relations with the former Warsaw Pact countries is the main objective of the Partnership for Peace. We have told NATO that, for the time being, Austria will concentrate its efforts on its entry into the EU but that, once it has achieved this goal, we will examine this Partnership for Peace very closely. That being said, it is clear that, for Sweden and Finland, their potential membership in this system will not call their doctrine into question. These two countries remain firm in their refusal to take part in military alliances. [Lambroschini] Austria will therefore continue to refuse to join NATO? [Vranitzky] Precisely. [Lambroschini] Your insistence on demanding the accelerated integration of the new Central European democracies is another subject which separates you from most of the Twelve. Here you opposed Margaret Thatcher when she explained to you that the Twelve would commit themselves to advanced cooperation with East Europe only when it had built up a market economy. [Vranitzky] My analysis, indeed, is the opposite of that of the former British prime minister. I do not believe that these countries will be able to establishing market economies without first gaining the cooperation of West Europe. The Sixteen will have to increase their cooperation with East Europe, and will have to do so in a coordinated way. This is, moreover, a further reason for insisting on the EU's political vocation. Given the risks of destabilization in East Europe, limiting European integration to the members of the EU and EFTA is not enough. East Europe must be included in the integration process. [Lambroschini] When do you believe that this enlargement of the Union to include the East European countries will be possible? [Vranitzky] Perhaps by the end of the century. [Lambroschini] And Russia? [Vranitzky] First of all we need to concentrate on the countries nearest to our borders. But later, in one way or another, Russia too will have to be associated with this process of European integration. [Lambroschini] Are you not concerned to see former communists return to power in neighboring Poland and Hungary, and to observe that they are the second largest political force in the Czech Republic? [Vranitzky] I have studied closely the programs of the parties and the men who represent this new socialist or social-democratic approach. I believe that most of them are very clearly different from the communist movements of the past. They have proved their desire to continue in the path of the market economy. [Lambroschini] And what is your analysis of the return of another ancient peril, that of fascism, in Italy, another of your neighbors? [Vranitzky] Like a lot of people, I believed that what is happening today in Italy could never happen again. The most serious problem is that, unlike the new socialists in East Europe, who have abandoned Stalin and Lenin, Italy's neofascists continue to refer to the past, to Mussolini and his regime. But we shall see what the Berlusconi government is going to do to come up with convincing solutions. [passage omitted]
