The mutual interest in the lives of our states' peoples is determined by the proximity of their destinies in the past and present. The Belarusian countryside is experiencing similar difficulties to the Russian countryside at a complex period in its history. In the recent past Belarus was one of the leading republics in terms of per capita agricultural production. The marketable production of milk, meat, and potatoes made it possible not only to meet our own requirements but also to deliver a substantial quantity, under mutually advantageous exchange, to other republics and primarily to Russia. Large livestock raising complexes similar to the specialized farming facilities of Western countries made it possible to achieve high production indicators. Belarus was one of the Russian countryside' most reliable partners for deliveries of tractors, other agricultural equipment, and mineral fertilizers. Today too it is prepared for the closest cooperation with Russia's rural workers and to supply reliable equipment and other output. The actions of our states' governments in concluding the treaty on the union of our monetary systems were also aimed at such relations. With the start of the treaty's operation artificial obstacles will be lifted which are dividing not only states but primarily the inhabitants of cities and villages -- barriers which have artificially arisen between us. The present development of the Republic of Belarus' agriculture is proceeding within the scheme of a mixed economy and rational support for collective farms and peasants' private plots. The main principle of our reforms in the countryside is not to destroy but to help all commodity producers irrespective of forms of ownership, all those who are able and capable and willing to work honestly on the land. The breakdown of our ties is affecting the position of the Belarusian countryside, the production of reliable agricultural equipment, and the mutually advantageous exchange of the fruit of their labor between the peoples of Russia and Belarus. We sincerely hope that this influence is of a temporary, transient nature and that common sense will prevail. We wish that the Russian rural workers may successfully overcome the difficulties of our complex time and we wish them favorable conditions for spring work and hope for the restoration and development of the traditional fraternal ties with the Belarusian countryside and between our peoples.
