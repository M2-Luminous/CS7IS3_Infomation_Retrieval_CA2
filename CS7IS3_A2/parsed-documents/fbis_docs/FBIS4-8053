Protection Force for former Yugoslavia (UNPROFOR) on Sunday denied claims by the Moslem leadership in Sarajevo that Serb forces had used poison gases and killed thousands of civilians in an attack on Gorazde, a Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina. Spokesman Rob Annink told reporters in Sarajevo that Serb forces had possibly only used smoke mortars in the region of Gorazde, the French news agency AFP said. The Moslem presidency in Sarajevo said on Saturday evening that thousands of people had been killed in the Serb attack on Gorazde when poison gases were used. The statement was immediately carried by leading news agencies from all over the world. Moslem Radio Sarajevo even said that the Gorazde suburbs of Bace and Mlinarice were pounded with chemical shells, with 1,000-10,000 casualties as a result. Moslem Presidency Vice-President Ejup Ganic said that he would leave for New York already on Sunday to ask for an emergency session of the Security Council because of this incident. Deputy commander of the general staff of the Bosnian Serb army, General Milan Gvero on Sunday told TANJUG that the Serb side had never used chemical weapons in the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Serb side does not manufacture, possess or use such weapons, he was adamant. Gen. Gvero said that the Moslem side was using poison gases in order to accuse the Serbs and provoke a military intervention against them.
