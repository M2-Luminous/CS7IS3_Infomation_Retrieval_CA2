U.S. President Bill Clinton and Czech President Vaclav Havel have just finished their talks, which lasted 45 minutes. They are prepared to make short statements and after that they will answer two questions. I would like to ask President Havel to make his statement. [Havel] I would like to say that the Czech Republic is extremely honored by the visit of the U.S. President as well as by the fact that Prague was chosen as the location of the meeting with the representatives of neighboring countries. During the talks we had either as delegations or individually, we made it clear that the Czech Republic welcomes the Partnership for Peace project and is ready to immediately start giving this project a concrete content. The Czech Republic considers this project to be well-balanced and good. At the same time, we expressed our will to cooperate with our neighbors. We noted the similarity of our stances with our neighbors, and we stressed that we also attach great importance to regional cooperation. We discussed several other topics, including economic cooperation. On behalf of the Czech side this is all for the time being. [Clinton, in English with simultaneous Czech translation] First I want to express my thanks to President Havel for his warm welcome. I am paying only my second visit to Prague. I was here 24 years ago in the same week but in a totally different role. The progress that Prague and the Czech Republic have made has made a great impression on me. Likewise, my conversions and meetings with your president, prime minister, and other representatives have also made a great impression on me. I confirmed that the security of this republic and other members of Central and Eastern Europe is very significant for the security of the United States and European countries as well as of the Atlantic alliance. The Partnership for Peace is the beginning of a genuine security relationship which could lead to full membership in NATO. Of course, we must also think about the economic dimension of security. Without this, it would be difficult to achieve good policy and develop genuinely democratic relations in the name of the success of nations in all Partnership countries and the development of society. We have been talking about these things; further talks await us tomorrow, when we will talk, perhaps in more specific terms, about how to attain these aims. In any case, I thank President Havel for his support for Partnership for Peace. [Moderator] Your questions, please. Czech Television, [name indistinct]. [Question] I am [name indistinct] from Czech Television. Gentlemen, do you think any East European country could join NATO ahead of the rest? [Havel] We interpret Partnership for Peace as a door open to all, but, of course, a lot will depend on each individual just how soon he passes through that door. This projects wants to deal with each country individually. [Clinton] This issue has not been resolved. [Passage indistinct] As regards Partnership for Peace, one has to emphasize that with immediate effect it will provide for joint exercises, joint preparation of the armed forces, and joint solutions to a number of issues which could lead to full membership. [Moderator] [Word indistinct], please. [Question] [passage indistinct] [Interpreter] Apologies from the interpreter. I can't hear the question. [Havel] Developments in the Russian Federation have been complex, dramatic, and painful and we are naturally following them most attentively. But we firmly believe that in the Russian Federation too, democracy and the market economy will gradually prevail, despite all the complex stages and episodes of this development. [Moderator] The presidents have a further program ahead of them. Thank you for your questions and your attention. Good bye.
