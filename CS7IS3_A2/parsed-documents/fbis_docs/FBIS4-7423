Speaking at an Afta conference at the United Nations building in Bangkok yesterday, Suphachai told hundreds of influential Asean economists that "the Afta agreement should be modified". He said he was not satisfied with Afta, both in terms of its long timespan, its limited range of products and its restrictive regulation for new membership. The "Afta and Beyond: An Asean Perspective" seminar was jointly organized by the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (Escap), the Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI) and Queen's University, Canada. Suphachai viewed Afta as an attempt by the Asean Six to consolidate their bargaining position -- amidst a feeling of "grim hope" about the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks -- by reaching a regional free trade agreement. "(But) as the Round has successfully been concluded, the (original Afta) requirements might not be well suited to 1994," he said. Suphachai, who represented Thailand at the latest Asean informal economic ministerial meeting in Malaysia earlier this month, said he was disappointed with Afta's slow progress. The Asean economic ministers had met on an informal basis to speed up the Afta process and Suphachai had hoped to push through a shorter timeframe. However the Asean ministers missed the opportunity to announce a new Afta time-frame, even though it had been widely speculated that the deadline would be reduced from 2008 to 2003. A statement from the meeting said the Asean ministers simply agreed that senior officials would review "the implementation of Afta". "But (they did not) agree on a particular year," Suphachai said. Asean leaders agreed last year to cut tariffs on Asean manufactured goods to 0 to 5 per cent over a 15 year period. Suphachai, though, insisted that "the Afta time-frame should be shorter (because) the period is too long compared to Gatt and Nafta". The members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) agreed last month in Marrakech to cut tariffs on manufactured goods by one-third over a 10-year period. Moreover, the range of commodities that fall into the Afta tariff cut basket should be expanded, especially to include farm goods. Non-processed farm products are excluded from the Afta tariff cut requirement. "This may be no longer appropriate," Suphachai said, citing Gatt and the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) requirements where the tariffs on farm goods would have to be cut over specific timeframes. If Asean continues to ignore the farm sector in its regional free trade plan, "it might jeopardize Asean attempts to become a leader in farm trade at the World Trade Organization (which supersedes Gatt next year)", Suphachai said. On expanding Afta's membership, Suphachai recalled his "bitter" experience in unsuccessfully persuading his counterparts to accept Australia and New Zealand as new partners. "Asean ministers agreed to discuss the linkage between other regional groupings with Afta, but they avoided naming names," Suphachai said. Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating stated a clear intention to join Afta during his recent visit to Bangkok. But Malaysia's International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz has strongly opposed the move. "Asean is not a free-for-all organization," she was quoted as saying. Without referring to Australia, Suphachai expressed disappointment at the Malaysian minister's stance. "It's rather ironic," he said. "The trend is that Asean is trying to persuade some of its neighbours that they are not ready to join Afta, but ignores other countries that are." Some experts view Afta with scepticism. On the meeting's panel yesterday, Richard G Harris, from Simon Fraser University, Canada, questioned how much could Asean have done to open up the regional free trade area, as the grouping has to overcome factors which have been its engine behind a flourishing growth rate of Asean exports in the last decade -- or "export-oriented protectionism" to support export promotion policies. He said the economies of many highly successful East Asian countries were and continue to be protectionist, although at considerably lower levels than before, domestic markets for finished consumption goods are rather heavily protected. Intermediate products and basic industrial raw materials, such as steel and petro-chemicals, are also quite heavily protected, with capital goods less so. Although the protection measures have succeeded in promoting rapid growth of manufactured export products, it has led to a relatively peculiar structure of export production. "This pattern has meant, among other things, that the direct contribution of exports to economic growth has been quite small. In Thailand, for instance, the aggregate contribution of exports to economic growth declined in the later 1980's and early 1990's due to the high cost of exports," he said. Moreover, local exporters preferred to have a high local content requirement to avoid direct competition with foreign companies. "This has led to protectionism and created the artificial structure of export production." Dr Narongchai Akrasani, the Afta architect, however, suggested Asean can achieve the free trade by working hard on its own regional free trade area. "(But) we will not have the free trade area under the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation or under the World Trade Organization in the year 2010," he felt. Due to strong internal political pressures, more powerful countries cannot support free trade at a global level, no matter what they have said, Narongchai claimed. As such, Asean should achieve a free trade area by itself with Afta, he said.
