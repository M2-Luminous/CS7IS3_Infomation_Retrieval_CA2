After pointing out that only in the last 35 years have we been owners of our destiny, Raul warned that now we must begin all over again and there is no other way. Furthermore, he highlighted that even if it were out of respect for our dead, we must be loyal and firm. Raul, who is second secretary of the party and minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR], spoke to pilots of the Antiaircraft Defense and Revolutionary Air Force [DAAFAR] brigade in Santa Clara, after visiting the Central Army's air base. Raul also visited the daycare center and the elementary school of that military community. The exposition presented by Brigadier General Nilvio Sanchez, head of that unit, demonstrated how all of its air and antiair units are being protected and are ready for combat, or are being preserved and are ready to be taken out of the bowels of the earth and put into action within little time. In the same manner, Division Gen. Ulises Rosales del Toro, first vice minister of the FAR, underscored that such a high level in the condition of the equipment had never been obtained before, which responds to the capacity developed by Cuban specialists to repair and maintain even the most complex equipment. Ruben Martinez, head of the DAAFAR, added that $13 million had been saved in airplane engine repairs alone last year. During his tour, Raul was also able to witness the intense labor carried out at the Victoria de Santa Clara agricultural-livestock farm and how all the resources of a large tank unit in Villa Clara are being maintained and properly protected.
