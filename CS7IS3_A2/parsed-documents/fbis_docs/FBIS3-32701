FBIS3-32701 "drlat030_t_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-030 Document Type:Daily Report 14 Feb 1994 Venezuela Reactions to Release PA1302215194 Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 1805 GMT 13 Feb 94 PA1302215194 Mexico City NOTIMEX Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [Text] Caracas, 13 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- There was favorable reaction today to the release -- authorized by President Rafael Caldera -- of 23 people involved in the 1992 Venezuelan military coup attempts, because "national coexistence is strengthened." This was the common opinion of social leaders in praising the gesture, Caldera's first, which released 12 civilians and 11 military personnel from the San Carlos military detention facility on Saturday. Nevertheless, main coup leaders Hugo Chavez Frias, leader of the 4 February coup attempt, and Hernan Odreman Gruber, leader of the 27 November uprising, publicly reiterated their refusal to be discharged from the Army in exchange for their freedom. The 11 freed officers placed themselves at the disposition of military tribunals in addition to accepting their military discharge as a condition to having their cases dismissed, in accordance with requests by Caldera and the high military command. Episcopal Conference President Monsignor Ovidio Perez stated that the presidential decision is aimed at strengthening the country's coexistence and to having greater interaction with society to solve the country's problems. Carlos Canache Mata, a leader of the former ruling Democratic Action (AD) Party, said President Caldera's pacification policies are correct as they allow the Armed Forces to heal its wounds. Orlando Contreras, acting secretary for the Social Christian Party, said his organization shares the reasoning that led President Caldera to make this decision, the third one applied to members of the military since 1992. Of the 247 military personnel and civilians who took part in the uprisings "against the corrupt Carlos Andres Perez government," as Chavez Frias says, 124 persons remain in jail, most in military installations. Due to the failed 27 November coup, about 48 mid-rank officers are in exile in Peru and four others are in Ecuador. About 116 people had their cases dismissed during the Perez term, which was suspended in June 1993 due to alleged corruption. Octavio Lepage, Congress president who acted as president for one month in 1993, pardoned one captain. The last administrator of the former ruling AD party, Ramon J. Velasquez, acquitted seven officers and "pardoned" Commander Luis Reyes due to health problems. Likewise, during the Velasquez administration, which ended its term on 2 February, four members of the military, one captain, one lieutenant, one sergeant, and one air technician returned from exile in Peru. Three had their cases dismissed. The military court, due to a counterorder by the arresting officer, freed seven of the 11 Air Force officers who took part in the 27 November attempt. They appealed the decision and reenlisted.
