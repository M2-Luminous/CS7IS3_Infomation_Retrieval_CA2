[Salman] Israel has no right to hold a referendum on the Golan because it is Syrian territory. A referendum in such a case contravenes international law and the UN Charter regarding other countries' territories. There can be no referendum on the territories of other countries. The Golan was occupied by force and the Security Council passed Resolution 242 rejecting the occupation of others' land by force. There is an explicit provision to this effect. In addition, when Israel made a decision to annex the Golan and apply Israeli laws there, the United Nations swiftly rejected this and emphasized that the Golan was Syrian territory, that it must be returned to Syria, and that Israel must withdraw from it. Therefore, proposing the idea of holding a referendum on returning or refusing to return the Golan is like holding a referendum on whether the international law itself is correct or incorrect. Thus, holding a referendum totally contradicts international law and legitimacy. A referendum is invalid and absolutely inadmissible; otherwise, it would set a precedent that would prevent the existence of the United Nations. It might set an example for other countries of the world to reject Security Council resolutions and international law, making a referendum the judge on the legitimacy or illegitimacy of any resolution. [Al-Sa'id] In the wake of the Geneva summit, Israeli Prime Minister Rabin said that President Clinton and not President al-Asad spoke about normalization of relations. Rabin stressed that President al-Asad did not explain what his concept of peace was. [Salman] Israel, as we know, wants to blackmail any stance and wants to take before giving. Israel has not yet given anything. When Israel withdraws from the Golan, it is withdrawing from Syrian territory that will be returned to Syria. Israel is not giving anything, but the establishment of relations between countries is voluntary and subject to the will of this or that country and, consequently, to mutual confidence between countries. If there is no mutual confidence between individuals there can be no friendship. This definitely applies in international relations. President al-Asad on the Geneva forum and within the hearing of the whole world left no room for doubt that Syria and its leader declare that he is ready to sign a document of a comprehensive and fair peace in the region. This was so decisive a response to all those who attended this conference that President Clinton applauded it. Israel, however, has grown used to skirting issues and wants to foil and subvert the positive results of any meeting that binds it to withdraw from Arab territory. [Al Sa'id] What are your views regarding security arrangements, which primarily concern Israel since fears about govern its motives and moves in the region? [Salman] It is impossible for anyone to discuss conclusions before preludes nor to debate details before setting forth general principles. The basic issue in the peace process is Israeli withdrawal from the Arab territories, but the security issue is one of the main clauses outlined in the Syrian document that was submitted in the sixth round of peace talks. President al-Asad reiterated this issue at the Geneva summit when he stressed the right of all countries of the region to live in peace. Regarding Israel's apprehensions about security, I maintain that Syria's and every Arab country's security is threatened by Israel. The outstanding threat to the Arab countries is by far more real than the threat to Israel's security. [Al-Sa'id] The Geneva summit was successful, but Israel's reaction to it was lukewarm. It even voiced reservations about Syria's intentions. My question is: What is your opinion about the talks that are about to take place now? [Salman] Quick reactions are always the loudest. By reacting to the results with such coldness, Israel gave the impression that it does not intend to work to make peace in this region, because it believes that peace does not serve its expansionist designs in the region. Thus, it believes that peace may put an end to the expansionist designs it had been dreaming of. Everybody knows that the founders of Israel always reiterated that Israel's borders extended from the Nile to the Euphrates. By accepting a just and comprehensive peace in the region, everyone will know the geographical boundaries he can live in. That is why Israel viewed these resolutions as halting its aggressive designs toward its neighbors. All these matters boil down to one thing; that is, that Israel must withdraw first. Before withdrawal, there can be no talk about any future idea or step. Thus, the details and moving to discuss these details entirely depends on the beginnings, which constitute the main principle; that is, the withdrawal. So it is absolutely inconceivable for us to talk about the nature of security or talks or how we will have to coexist in the future. [Al-Sa'id] But did President al-Asad obtain guarantees from the United States at the Geneva summit confirming that Israel will withdraw from all the Golan? [Salman] The initiative that United States has offered within the framework of the Madrid Conference and the rounds of talks that followed it is based on international legality, as represented by Resolutions 242 and 338, meaning full withdrawal. So when the negotiations are guaranteed by and based on international legality, as represented by Resolutions 242 and 338, this means that the United States is offering a guarantee that it will work according to these resolutions to achieve peace in this region. The United States is a permanent member of the Security Council and it has recognized these two resolutions. So by honoring the Security Council resolutions, it respects its participation in making these resolutions. [Al-Sa'id] But Syria has no objection to security arrangements under which multinational forces, including U.S. troops, could be deployed, and through which some parts of the Golan could be disarmed? [Salman] Syria will agree to any formula endorsed by the international institutions. The Security Council may authorize the United States to send U.S. troops as a guarantee to the region. If this happens, Syria will certainly respect this international will. Thus, all we want is to establish real peace and security in the region and not imagined security that could be violated at any time by Israel when it has the chance to do so. [Al-Sa'id] It is said that Syria's support for the 10 Damascus-based Palestinian groups is one of the reasons behind accusing Syria of backing terrorism. [Salman] We differentiate between national struggle and terrorism. These groups constitute a resistance force to liberate the territory occupied by Israel. Similarly, Hizballah is a Lebanese party fighting to liberate its territory. How can these groups be called terrorists? It is Israel that is killing people daily. A proof of this is the number of Palestinian dead and detained in the occupied territories despite the Gaza-Jericho agreement. As a matter of fact, the number of dead Palestinians and detainees has doubled since the agreement was signed. Israel has filled its jails with Palestinians who are struggling to liberate their land occupied by Israel. [Al-Sa'id] Can the United States fulfill its promise of establishing a comprehensive peace, particularly since Israel is trying to put forward numerous pretexts to avoid withdrawal? [Salman] This is what the United States has affirmed and is affirming every day and at every meeting between us and the United States. Through the Geneva summit and the U.S. delegations' visits to Syria and Syrian delegations's visits to the United States, we have considerable confidence because the U.S. Administration is serious about resolving this issue and establishing a fair and comprehensive peace in the region. Peace will serve the interests of all countries of the region and it represents a real interest for the United States in the region. Instead of having soldiers stationed in the region as foreign forces, the United States can do without this presence when the region is stable and secure. It can thus deal with the region as a friend instead of being viewed as a force interfering in the domestic affairs of the region. [Al-Sa'id] Do you fear the possibility of Israel's resorting to holding early elections and of the Likud, which is more extremist than the Labor Party, taking power? [Salman] We are confident that the Israeli rulers dream about peace in their own special way, a peace of hegemony and domination. If this does not materialize, they will not accept the establishment of peace in this region. Circumventing issues is a major characteristic of Israel's behavior. Thus we do not think that the Israeli side will agree to establish peace in this region. We expect that they will circumvent the Geneva summit resolutions in one way or another. Perhaps they will create a problem by dissolving the government or calling for new elections or a referendum. All signs indicate that they want to circumvent the outcome of the Geneva summit. The propaganda campaign against Syria, President al-Asad, and President Clinton in particular was one of Israel's attempts, backed by its massive media organs and the Zionist lobby, to prevent the convening of the Geneva summit and to pressure and intimidate Clinton about it. [Al-Sa'id] What is your current view of the situation regarding the Gaza-Jericho agreement? [Salman] I praised this agreement from the outset, but what President al-Asad said about this agreement proved to be true: Every paragraph in this agreement needs an agreement and every agreement in it requires negotiations. The issue is in a vicious circle. Israel evades and will continue to evade. Israel will not give because it has grown used to taking. We know the destiny of this agreement. It was born feeble and it is now in the intensive care unit. [Al-Sa'id] Was there a sort of bargain over Lebanon in the Geneva summit--something like pulling the Syrian forces out of that country or disarming Hizballah in return for Israel's withdrawal from the Golan? Israel claims that organizations such as Hizballah threaten its security. [Salman] There is a Security Council resolution relevant to Lebanon, namely, Resolution 425. It calls for an immediate Israeli withdrawal. Before the Israeli occupation of Lebanon, no organizations like Hizballah had borne arms. Thus, these organizations are struggling and offering sacrifices to liberate the south. If their raison d'etre is removed, there will certainly be no need for any fedayeen operations. Those organizations will find no need to carry weapons if the land is liberated. Now they are fighting to liberate their lands. When an Israeli is killed, he is killed in occupied Lebanese territory. Hizballah does not infiltrate deep into Israeli territory; it is fighting Israel on Lebanese territory. But through the terms it uses--terms like the security belt, which all of us are now repeating--Israel has managed to delude the world into thinking that it is living in fear, and that it is the victim that needed the belt to protect itself. But this belt is in occupied Lebanese territory and an integral part of Lebanon--south Lebanon. It is not a security belt, as Israel claims; it is Lebanese territory, and its inhabitants are carrying arms and struggling to liberate the land occupied by Israel. [Al-Sa'id] Although President Clinton spoke about the need for qualitative relations with Syria, the world was surprised at the U.S. State Department announcement after the summit that Syria will not be struck off the list of states sponsoring terrorism. [Salman] We are not totally taken aback by this; this is not surprising. Had the United States--and I mean the U.S. Administration in particular--been convinced that Syria was a terrorist country, the Geneva summit would not have taken place, and the exchange of visits by Syrian and U.S. delegations world not have continued. Many U.S. Congress and Administration officials come to meet the president. Syria was unfairly accused of terrorism thanks to the influence of the Zionist lobby in the United States. Had it not been for the influence of the Israeli and Zionist lobby in the United States, which put pressure on the U.S. Congress and Administration, the [terrorism] decision would not have been made. As regards daily interaction, the United States and Syria do not deal with each other on the basis that Syria is a terrorist country. It is enough to say that to date, neither Israel, nor the Zionist lobby in the world, nor anyone in the U.S. Administration itself could provide a single piece of evidence that Syria carried out or was involved in any terrorist act, either at a state or at an individual level.
