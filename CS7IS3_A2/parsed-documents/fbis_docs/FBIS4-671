These agreements between the presidential group and the opposition were reached after four months of negotiations at the Palais du Peuple in Kinshasa. The HCR-PT bureau also underlined that the application for the post of prime minister should include among others the minutes and general report on consultations with the Sacred Union and its allies, and a report on consultations with the presidential group duly signed by all the parties concerned. It may be recalled that Etienne Tshisekedi's party, the Union for Democracy and Social Progress, which participated in the Palais du Peuple negotiations, did not sign the protocol agreement due to differences over the appointment of the head of government. Under the transitional constitutional law promulgated on 9 April, a prime minister should be appointed between 9 and 20 April.
