We must clarify that these are simply projected figures. Mr. Victor Borge, could you tell us what an exit poll is? [Borge] All day long we have conducted a poll at more than 120 locations throughout the Republic. We have asked people who are leaving the premises after casting their vote who they voted for. The data collected has been sent via telephone and fax to our computer center, where it has been processed. This is the first projection of how people were voting all day long. [Reyna] Throughout the entire country? [Borge] Yes, throughout the country. [Reyna] Would you then give us the results of your poll? [Borge] Yes. Let's take a look at the graphs. According to this poll, candidate Ernesto Perez Balladares of the Democratic Revolutionary Party [PRD] is in the lead with 37.8 percent of the votes. Second place is close between Ruben Blades of the Papa Egoro Party, who has 23.4 percent, and Mrs. Mireya Moscoso de Gruber of the Arnulfista Party, with 22.4 percent of the votes. Next in line is Ruben Dario Carles, with 11.2 percent of the votes. These figures have an error margin of plus or minus 3 percent, so we cannot be certain whether Mr. Blades or Mrs. Moscoso de Gruber is in second place.
