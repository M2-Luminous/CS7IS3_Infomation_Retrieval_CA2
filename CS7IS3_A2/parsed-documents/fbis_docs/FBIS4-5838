These Cambodian soldiers fled into Thailand on 10 April to escape the Khmer Rouge encirclement and bombardment of Pailin. Police Lieutenant Colonel Kay Kien, 40, one of the Cambodians who fled to Thailand, said he was given instructions from the government by Police Lt. Col. Teap Li. The instructions were to protect Pailin -- captured from the Khmer Rouge on 19 March -- by taking 150 men to defend Phum O Lak, about 3 km from the Thai border and 22 km northwest of Pailin. They came under heavy Khmer Rouge fire and received no government reinforcements. Thus, they had to flee into Thailand on 11 April [date as published]. They asked the Thai force in the area to send them back to Battambang. Teap Li disappeared; his fate is unknown. According to the latest report, although there has been no confirmation of the Khmer Rouge recapturing Pailin, Cambodian Government soldiers say the Khmer Rouge now has the advantage because it is in a position to cut off supply routes and carry out guerrilla activities in many areas, particularly in Pailin itself. They expect more Cambodian Government soldiers to flee into Thailand. Moreover, there have been occasional violent acts along the border. On the same morning, the inspector of the Khlong Nam Sai police station received a report that a Cambodian man and woman, about 50-60 years old, were killed and their bodies left near Ban Noi Si Chomphu, about 20 km from Aranyaprathet. Their bodies showed that they were killed by sharp instruments. They were reportedly killed by Cambodian or Thai robbers who took their four cows, which had been grazing in Thai territory. Efforts are being made to inform their relatives.
