This was stated today, among other things, at a news conference by the SDA. On behalf of the SDA, correspondents were addressed by Edhem Becakcic, a member of the SDA Main Committee; Dr. Fahet Halilovic, president of the Sarajevo Municipal Committee; and Muhamed Kupusovic, a member of the municipal committee. Edin Muhic has more details: [Begin recording] [Muhic] The main topics of today's SDA news conference were the Bosniak-Croat agreement and the UN administration of the wretched Sarajevo. Edhem Becakcic spoke on the SDA's stance on the international community initiatives for resolving the Sarajevo issue: [Becakcic] The SDA accepts administrative assistance to the legal authorities of Sarajevo and Bosnia-Herzegovina in restoration and reconstruction of [word indistinct] of the Bosnia-Herzegovina capital. Demilitarization is a victory of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, which was defending and managed to defend all of Sarajevo's residents and which agreed to the lifting of the artillery blockade of Sarajevo after it has successfully endured attacks of enormous artillery [words indistinct] aggressor. [Muhic] The Bosniak-Croat agreement is a better solution than all previous draft agreements on Bosnia-Herzegovina's internal organization, president of the SDA municipal committee Fahet Halilovic stated. At the beginning, he emphasized the positive segments of this agreement: [Halilovic] These are: coalition, the right to veto, proportional representation, and the autonomy of cantons. This is actually a model that [word indistinct] so far the most perfect solution for these mixed, complex societies. [Muhic] It is also positive in that the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis is trying to be resolved by political means in this way. One of the negative implications of this agreement is that the independence of administrative units could be used by some [word indistinct] forces as the basis for further ethnic cleansing. Asked by a correspondent whether the agreement makes allowances for such occurrences, Dr. Halilovic replied that there is a possibility that in the ethnically cleansed environments the fascist elements would try to [word indistinct] the actual situation. This agreement limits the possibilities for such occurrences; however, the actual situation unfortunately often deviates from a normative agreement. Regarding the problem of a UN administration of Sarajevo, Dr. Halilovic says: [Halilovic] What must be emphasized is that the duration of the UN administration is strictly limited, as we must insist on this -- namely two years. What the administrator must do is secure the integrity of the town of nine communes, with the exception of Pale, which was treated differently even in the Vance-Owen plan. No solution can be vested in this way if a plebiscite of the residents is not carried out throughout the entire territory of Sarajevo, in all communes. [Muhic] The plan that envisaged a union of republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina from last August has been surpassed, Muhamed Kupusovic, a member of the municipal committee and president of the Sarajevo Executive Council, emphasized: [Kukusovic] I would like to emphasize one point, and that is that certain factors of this plan have nevertheless remained -- namely, in the coming talks and combinations to resolve the problem of Sarajevo, Pale has been excluded as the town's commune. [Muhic] Edhem Becakcic was asked whether the Bosniak-Croat agreement represents the partitioning of Bosnia-Herzegovina in two parts. He replied that such a partitioning is out of the question, and that time will show how the problem of the territories controlled by Karadzic's Serbs will be resolved. [end recording]
