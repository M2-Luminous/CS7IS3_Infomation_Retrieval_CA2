Now, the rural people's complaints about excessively heavy burdens have become a serious matter seldom heard of in the past. It is a direct reaction to the lack of growth in income. Lack of growth in income has dampened the rural people's initiative, shaken agriculture's position as the foundation of our national economy, and aroused the concern of all quarters. This state of affairs has prompted our country to dig into the root cause of the problem. Whether the rural people's income can grow steadily depends on whether the mix of rural products and the proportions of rural people engaged in different fields of work are kept reasonable and are adjusted from time to time with the development of the economy. Agricultural products, especially grain, have a low Engel's coefficient. In the entire national economy, the proportion of needs for agricultural products, grain in particular, falls with the progress of economic development. This means that, as the economy grows, the only way to steadily increase the rural people's income is to adjust their product mix and occupational makeup so as to turn out more high-value-added products and have more people engaged in non-agricultural production. The problem that in recent years our grain production has increased but the rural people's income has declined is exactly an inevitable result of our failure to make the above adjustments in time. In a market economy, the adjustments of the mix of products and the proportions of people in different occupations are automatic and quick. In China's rural areas, however, such adjustments do not occur as a quick reaction to signs of changes in the market condition. There are many reasons for this. One of the chief reasons is that, following the implementation of the land contract system, property rights are not clearly defined and, accordingly, cannot be transferred smoothly from one person to another. In other words, the imperfect land system and the slow development of the land market are main obstacles to improving our agricultural returns and raising the income of the rural people. I. Accelerating Land Market Development Is an Urgent Task in Rural Reform A radical measure taken by our country for its rural reform is the implementation of the output-related contract responsibility system based on households. The prime significance of this responsibility system lies in that it changes the old land system and distribution system. The tremendous achievements of our rural reform are universally acknowledged, but no reform can give benefits forever. In recent years, with the development of the rural economy, more and more hidden shortcomings in our present land system have been brought to light. While we have set the goal of building a socialist market economy, these shortcomings are placing hurdles in our way toward fostering a market economy in rural areas. Since 1984, a variety of new problems have cropped up in China's rural areas. The crux of the problems is the conflict between the market mechanism pursued by the commodity economy and the administrative interference relied upon by the planned economy. From an objective viewpoint, the fast growth of agricultural production and the rural people's income before 1984 was abnormal. It was due to an immense surge of the farmers' productive enthusiasm, and hence a sudden eruption of the rural productive force, triggered by the change in the system. Such a fast growth had its limitations, and there is no reason to expect it to persist. After 1985, agricultural production and the rural people's income entered a stage of regular growth -- a normal economic phenomenon. At a time in this stage, the grain output did not go up. On the one hand, this was inevitable when intra-agriculture adjustments were under way. On the other hand, it reflected the spontaneous need of farm households to act in accordance with the law of value after they had become the main elements in rural economic operations. With the decontrol of the markets for certain farm products and the rapid development of non-agricultural undertakings in rural areas, farmers, who could work on their own, would inevitably choose to produce those farm and sideline products that were relatively high-priced and had a high added value or would go to work in township enterprises or do their own businesses. That is to say, the market mechanism lured the rural people to spur the adjustment of the agricultural structure. It was due to this adjustment that the rural per-capita income increased rather quickly between 1984 and 1988. Unfortunately, we did not take advantage of that situation by using the market mechanism to adjust our supply and demand, allocate our resources, and guide our production. Instead, we judged the whole situation by the ups and downs in grain output. This led to the reinstatement after 1989 of a series of traditional measures to artificially adjust our agricultural structure, such as strengthening control over the agricultural production and input plans, increasing subsidies to farmers for purchase of means of agricultural production, and raising the government's grain procurement prices. At the same time, we restricted the flow of the agricultural labor force to urban areas and non-agricultural sectors, and controlled the production of farm products not included in the unified distribution plan in an effort to ensure a higher grain output. In so doing, we have forced our labor, land, and financial resources to go from the lucrative undertakings and products back to less profitable grain production. The results: On the one hand, our grain production no longer remains unchanged, but hit one record high after another. On the other hand, however, our gross agricultural output has not increased as noticeably as we expected, while the farmers' income has declined remarkably and the government's burden caused by subsidies has become heavier and heavier. What is more, the government's heavy burden has only invited the farmers' complaints about their declining income. This fully bears out the fact that the traditional policies and measures can no longer meet the needs of the new rural situation, and we must have a new mindset and seek a new way to solve the issue of agricultural development. The new mindset and new way is to deepen our rural reform by fostering the market so that the market mechanism, under the government's macro-guidance, will play a real fundamental role in the allocation of agricultural resources. There are two tasks in fostering the rural market: One is to foster a product market. Here the main task is to do away with the unified and fixed-quota purchase system and to facilitate direct contact between producers and consumers so that the rural people can manage production in accordance with changes in social demands. The other task is to foster a production-element market. The principal work is to establish a mechanism for the free flow and optimum allocation of such production elements as labor, funds, and land. An active production-element market is a prerequisite for timely adjustments of the production structure in line with market demands. Only when production elements are exchanged and transferred freely between farm households and are combined in an optimum way based on their relative advantages, is it possible to adjust the rural production structure and occupational makeup in line with economic development. Now, the governments at all levels have done a great deal of work toward building the product market. Contracted purchase is very popular, the grain price has been by and large liberalized, and pace is being quickened to foster the product market. In contrast, the development of the product-element market is comparatively slow. Now, in our rural areas, a number of limitations still exist on the flow of the labor force. The financial market is small and chaotic. In particular, due to delay in the formation of a rural land market, the household contract responsibility system has become an objective factor restricting the development, exploitation, and transfer of our land resources. Because of this, quickly fostering a land market should be a breakthrough point in our next move to deepen the rural reform. Now, in our rural areas, the productive force is still at a low level, and nothing other than land can provide so many job opportunities for the people. Under such circumstances, land not only has the function of developing production, but also plays a social security role; that is, it has a welfare nature. For this reason, when the output-related household contract responsibility system was first introduced, land was allocated according to the number of household members. This was objectively necessary. Nevertheless, since land is one of the most fundamental elements of production, without a land market to invigorate it, the mobility of other production elements will be greatly hampered. So, even though fostering the land market is the most thorny task, we must do it in order to pave the way for an all-round and in-depth rural reform. II. The Present State and Problems of the Land Ownership System The household contract responsibility system was quickly popularized in the tide of rural reform with the main goal of correcting the over-centralized control and the separation of labor and means of production inherent in the old system. It was correctly oriented and did tackle the vital points of the problems. However, practical experience over the past few years has revealed the following drawbacks of this land system: With regard to the land use rights, there are three major problems: First, the instability of land contract periods has affected farmers' investment expectations. To avert the negative effect of short contract periods on farmers' investment zeal, the CPC Central Committee clearly stated in its No. 1 Document of 1984 that the term of a land contract is 15 years, and it cannot be changed. This did set farmers' minds "at ease." However, the statement that the term of the contract is so many years and is unchangeable or it can be extended implies, in itself, that after this number of years, eventually it may be changed. This means that the output-related contract responsibility system is still an expedient measure and cannot help stabilize farmers' long-term investment expectations. As farmers dare not provide too much input into the land, the reserve productive capacity of the land tends to diminish, resulting in the deterioration of production conditions. It is quite likely that with the approach of the termination of their 15-year contracts, farmers will all the more aim at short-term profits rather than long-term benefits in using the land. Secondly, the frequent readjustments of the contract responsibility land has led to numerous land-border disputes. The land distribution system based on household members has, in itself, the problem of frequent readjustments to cope with the change in the household size. The longer the time, the more such changes will occur and the more frequently the land has to be readjusted. A survey reveals that all rural areas have made remarkably more readjustments of their contracted land since 1985, and that an almost complete reshuffle has taken place in land distribution in a span of four or five years. The principle of "overall stability, minor readjustments" established by the central authorities has been invoked by grassroots units as a basis to readjust their contract policies. The primary goal of such readjustment is to solve the land problem for the increased population. However, too frequent readjustments have added to the fragmentation of the already-divided contracted land and created a number of land-border disputes. This is another factor affecting farmers' investment in the contracted land. Thirdly, the fact that collectives such as township and village enterprises can use land without giving compensation has resulted in a waste of land resources. With the concept of the collective ownership of land, when setting up a new enterprise, a village collective may use, without paying anything, the land designated for contracting to farmers. Township enterprises may use contracted land freely or by paying a nominal fee as compensation. In many localities, when a township or village enterprise wants to take over a piece of land already contracted to a household, all it needs to do is to hire the main laborers of that household as its employees, and there is no further obligation. According to a survey of 280 villages conducted by a department concerned, under the condition that no state tax was levied on transactions involving the change of farmland into non-farmland, the compensation on 56.8 percent of the village-requisitioned land was less than 10 years' land rental, and the annual interest on the per-mu compensatory fee was below the bank's interest on savings deposits. The losses to the farmers were grave. The result of little or no compensation for land taken from farmers is that township and village enterprises have indiscriminately taken up large tracts of farmland, thus seizing resources from the hands of farmers and wasting the already-scanty arable land. However, because we have not formed a land market, land is apt to be viewed as a no-price resource, and even if we want to give it a reasonable price, it is hard to do so. Two main problems exist with regard to land revenue: One is that various "covert taxes," levies, and income retentions have affected farmers' revenue from the contracted land and led to unequal financial burdens. After the land contract system was put into effect, no improvement has been made on the complicated and ambiguous land tax system formed at the time when all purchases and sales were monopolized by the state and when the people's communes still existed. Now, farmers are the main producers. They hope to see a simple and clear-cut land tax system. In their words, what they want is that "after paying enough to the state and giving enough for collective retention, all that remains is ours." Yet the current land tax system actually consists of two kinds of taxes--an overt tax (collected by the state) and a covert tax. The latter can be further divided into a hidden tax, which is actually the fixed-quota purchase of farm products by the state, and a concealed tax, which is the extra financial burden shifted onto farmers (in the form of various levies and income retentions). The covert tax is a highly flexible and arbitrary burden and often damages the interests of farmers. For this reason, it often induces farmers' complaints and resistance, and directly dampens their enthusiasm about agricultural production. Now, many localities have adopted a "two-land system" which divides land into contract responsibility land and food-grain land. They use the contract responsibility land to guarantee the land tax revenue, but in doing this, they concentrate and aggravate the tax burden on one part of the land. The policy of using industry to subsidize agriculture is aimed at offsetting part of the hidden costs of farming. But, because different localities may give different subsidies to agriculture, this policy can add to the inequality in the distribution of burden. In fact, the principle of fairness, targeted by the equal distribution of land, has often been marred by the unequal land tax burden. The other problem is the unfair distribution of revenue from the increase in land value. This has directly affected farmers' interests. With the expanding scale of urban construction and the rapidly increasing numbers of large-area development zones, large tracts of farmland have been diverted to non-agricultural purposes. Now, a lot of farmland is being transformed into industrial and urban land. This is actually a shift of the primary industry's capital to the secondary and tertiary industries. Inevitably, such a shift will raise the value of land to a considerable extent. In our rural areas, land belongs to collectives, while farmers are members of the collectives and they get a share in the distribution of collective revenue on the basis of the land they are farming. For this reason, any revenue from the increase in land value should be reasonably distributed among the collectives, the farmers giving out the land, and the new land users. Nonetheless, the fact is that without a land market and effective government control and guidance, it is hard to decided on a reasonable land price, and it has become a common phenomenon that land is transferred at too low a price. What is more, a large amount of revenue from the increase in land value is enjoyed by new land users or small groups, while very little goes to collectives and farmers. In 1984, with the surging of township enterprises, there appeared a tide in using farmland for non-agriculture projects. At that time, a large part of the extra profit created by rural industries through the use of farmland was retained in the rural community either for use in subsidizing agriculture or for public welfare purposes. Now, a new tide of this nature is coming into being. Although industry and real estate business have created large amounts of extra profits from land, including revenue from the increase in land value, basically these profits do not benefit farmers at all. According to surveys in Guangdong, Hebei, and other localities, fees paid to farmers as compensation for use of their land, for making up for their loss of crops, and for subsidizing their resettlement expenses total only 2,000-20,000 yuan per mu, whereas land that has "roads, running water, and electricity and has been leveled" generally sells for 200,000-300,000 yuan per mu. Such a high revenue from the added land value is almost entirely enjoyed by the government departments or the real estate companies concerned. This has brought about a situation where government power is used to exploit the rural collective property. Such a situation has drawn farmers' complaints and often led to their conflicts with the government department or the real estate company. On the land-disposal right, the chief problem is the various subjective and objective restrictions on the subcontracting and transfer of land. These restrictions have three negative effects: In the first place, they affect the development of non-agricultural undertakings. To those farmers who wish to switch to industrial or commercial jobs, their contract responsibility land is a big hurdle because after they have given up farming, in most cases they still have to pay tax on the land and may even be fined for leaving the land idle. Further, because of the land's social security function and their inability to exchange the land for anything valuable, they can hardly come to a determination to leave the land. Secondly, these restrictions affect the development of land operations of scale. Appropriate-scale land operations is one of the significant measures to raise agricultural productivity, while the subcontracting and transfer of contracted land is a necessary condition for such operations. Now, on the one hand, in some rural areas there is no lack of high-caliber farmers, but due to the insufficient land contracted to them, their productive capability cannot be fully utilized. On the other hand, some farm households, for one reason or another, are unwilling to do farming with the result that large tracts of contract responsibility land are lying idle. Thirdly, the above-mentioned restrictions hinder the development of the rural financial market. With the continued change in the rural production structure and occupational makeup, rural people have an ever-increasing need for long-term loans from banks or other financial institutions so as to invest in new production projects. International experience and lessons show that long-term loans for agricultural production are possible only when there is an appropriate mortgage. The mortgage should not be subject to depreciation and should be immovable and invulnerable to damage. From this perspective, the land-using right is the most appropriate thing that rural people can use as mortgage. Failure to liberalize the land disposal right is bound to hinder the development of the rural financial market, thereby obstructing the readjustment and optimization of the rural production structure. III. Enact and Perfect Relevant Laws and Regulations To Speed Up Land Market Development A sound land system should meet at least two requirements: One, a clear-cut property right; two, a self-adjusting and self-changing mechanism. The essence of building a land market is to set up and make perfect a system for the selling and reselling of the land-using right during the land contract period and to put this system within the framework of laws and regulations after we have clearly distinguished the land ownership from the land-using right. In fact, whether our attitude toward fostering the land market is active or not, farmers have already acted in this direction, driven by their market-oriented initiative. In those areas where the economy is relatively developed and more new job opportunities exist, there are considerable instances of subcontracting the land or asking others to farm the land, either openly or secretly. Meanwhile, some local governments have implemented more active policies to protect farmers' interests in line with the development of the situation. In certain localities, the land contract period has been extended to 20-50 years--in Hainan Province, the contract period is as long as 70 years. In other localities, farmers who no longer want to farm their contracted land are allowed to subcontract or transfer their land-using rights to others as long as this does not affect the agricultural tax, the villages' income retention, and the fulfillment of the local farm labor plan. As an alternative, they may return their contracted land to the collective, which will give it to new contractors. Still other localities have adopted a "two-land system," which divides land into "food-grain land" and "contract responsibility land." The basic goal is to liberalize the transfer of the contract responsibility land while maintaining a stable guarantee for the people's food requirements. Now, it is rather common that land owned by rural collectives finds new applications or enters the market. This is especially noticeable in coastal developed areas and in the suburbs of inland cities. In most cases, this phenomenon finds expression in the utilization of land as a form of capital for industrial or real estate ventures, including joint and cooperative projects. At the same time, however, the practice of using various pretexts to indiscriminately divert farmland to other purposes is becoming an increasingly serious problem. Now, the farmland used for building development zones alone has exceeded 200 million mu. In the absence of a proper land market rule, this practice is causing more and more losses to the state, collectives, and farmers. This state of affairs, coupled with the problem of farmers leaving large tracts of farmland idle, indicates from another perspective the necessity and urgency of building a land market and making it perfect as soon as possible. After introducing the small peasant-owner land system to replace the feudal land system and with the development of productive forces and the increase in employment opportunities, Japan, Korea, and some West European countries have all traversed a course from restricting to encouraging the transfer of land and finally to the development of appropriate-scale family farms. This shows that building the land market is a matter common to all countries. In view of the land's dual function of production development and social security, we should comply with three principles, namely, efficiency, development, and fairness, in fostering our rural land market. The efficiency principle means that we should do our best to achieve the most rational and efficient use of land so that our limited land resources will give us more benefits. Through the transfer of the land-using right and with the adjustment by the market force, we may develop appropriate-scale operations to raise our agricultural productivity. By the development principle, we mean that through the subcontracting and transfer of the land-using right, we should adjust and optimize the product mix and occupational makeup and develop non-agricultural production in the countryside as a way to spur the development of the entire rural economy. The fair principle means that in the course of transfer of the land-using right, we should ensure that farmers leaving their land will not be deprived of security for livelihood, and those transferring their land-using right to others will not lose the benefit from the increase in land value to which they are entitled. We should acknowledge the fact that the rural people are the natural beneficiaries of the collective-owned land. We should also give due recognition to the investment they put into the land during their contract period. This way, we will not only maintain social stability in rural areas, but also ensure equitable competition on the land market. Now, we may start with the following five measures to foster the land market: First of all, it is necessary to make clear that the output-related household contract responsibility system is a basic system, which will remain stable and unchanged for a long time to come. Practical experience shows that this contract responsibility system is a way of production suited to the current level of our rural productive forces. It must be taken as a foothold to proceed to the next stage of our rural reform. If the farmers do not request a change, the state should respect their choice and should not use administrative measures to impose any other rural cooperative system upon them. Now that the 15-year contract period, as stipulated in the CPC Central Committee's document, is running out, it is imperative to announce as soon as possible that the output-related contract system will remain unchanged and the farmers can continue to use the land for a long time to come. It would be best if something could be done to assure them that the land they are using "would not change whether there are births or deaths in their families." Only by deepening the reform toward improving the contract responsibility system and by clearly defining the relationship of land ownership versus the land-using right, can we avoid going astray in improving our land system. Secondly, we should, by means of law, clearly define and protect the integrity of the rights to the use, revenue, and disposal of land. The integrity of these three rights means the integrity of the farmers' rights and interests under the contract responsibility system. It is also a fundamental condition for pushing land to the marketplace. The various acts at present infringing upon farmers' rights related to land operations can only be checked by a clear-cut land law. Since 1984, we have encouraged the buying and selling of the contract responsibility land but without noticeable success. One of the reasons is that we have not clearly specified the land-using right. Once we have a clear-cut land administrative law, we should issue land-using right certificates so as to give a legal protection to the output-related household contract responsibility system. Thirdly, we should establish a system allowing land-using right certificates to be used as mortgage so as to facilitate the transfer of such right in rural areas. When the land-using right can be transferred in association with the use of certificates for the land-using right as mortgage and when the land-using right can be mortgaged through the transfer of such certificates, transfer of contracted land will be a very simple process. Once certificates for the land-using right can be transferred, it is possible to increase the average scale of land-related operations and raise the efficiency of land utilization. Mortgaging these certificates for loans will quicken the development of the financial market and the readjustment of the production structure in rural areas. Of course, specific requirements on such certificates should be established so as to facilitate the transfer of the land-using right and prevent farmers from using land as a value-guaranteed saving rather than a production element they should earnestly work with. Fourthly, we should accelerate the formulation of laws and regulations on the land market so as to set a standard for its normal development. To meet the obvious needs and comply with the principle of land market development, we should work out as soon as possible a perfect legal system for the management and operation of the land market and check those acts that hurt the interests of the state and farmers in the lease or sales of the land-using right. The most urgent task at present is to levy a value-added tax on land at a progressive rate so that benefits from the increase in land value--as reflected in differential land rentals--will not go enormously to a few units and individuals. By doing so, we can put the inappropriate "real estate craze" to an end. Fifthly, it is imperative to reform the land tax system so as to combine the overt and covert taxes into one tax. Now, our country's actual revenue from agriculture is gradually declining with the abolishment of the state monopoly system for the purchase and sales of agricultural products. The diversified rural economic activities, in particular the operations conducted by farm households, require socialized services provided by the government and other related organizations. This requires that townships and villages have a stable revenue. After the reform of the agricultural products procurement system, the covert tax should be turned into overt tax, and all kinds of expense apportionment and the special products tax should be abolished. Instead, a unified land tax system should be put into practice. In coordination with the land tax reform, efforts should be made to improve the rural social security system so as to reduce the impact of market competition on farmers. Though the above-mentioned tasks are interrelated, some of them can be started earlier than the others. However, we must have a proper overall plan for these tasks in order to ensure the integrity, orderliness, and equality of our land market. Moreover, the silent emergence of the land market in our rural areas is a fact that we must acknowledge. This is a worthy attempt to better use land so as to achieve a higher marginal productivity. It is also a significant way to raise the rural people's income through the readjustment of their production and occupational structure. The government should act in accordance with this trend to speed up the development and improvement of the land market. This is a vital part of the current work in building a socialist rural market economy as well as an effective way to break through the predicament of no growth in the rural people's income.
