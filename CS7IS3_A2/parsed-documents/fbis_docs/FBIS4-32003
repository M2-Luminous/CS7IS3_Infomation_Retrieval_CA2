In return the Nigerians offered 30 percent of the transferred amount, a bank staffer told PAP on Wednesday. The bank customers rejected the Nigerian proposal and notified the bank whose authorities believe the Nigerians were trying to launder money in Poland. The Nigerians wanted to transfer many million dollars to each account. The proposals came from the Nigerian Federal Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Federal Ministry of National Defence. The Nigerians justified their proposal with the unstable situation in their country and asked to keep the operation in secret. A similar proposal was reported on Wednesday by the "DZIENNIK BALTYCKI" daily which wrote that the Nigerian Construction Ministry and the Nigerian national oil corporation wanted to transfer 57 million U.S. dollars. They wanted to pay 17.8 million U.S. dollars for the transaction and sacrificed further 4.2 million dollars for the servicing costs, read: bribes.
