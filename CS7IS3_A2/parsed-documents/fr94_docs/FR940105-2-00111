FR940105-2-00111 FR940105-2-00052 Accordingly, the Commission believes that synchronizing the close of trading for the CXM with the close of trading for such derivative products will allow market participants to hedge their positions more effectively. Specifically, traders and investors will be able to employ closing strategies that reflect price movements that take place during the last fifteen minutes of derivatives trading, as well as complete last sale information for the various indexes' component stocks. To the extent that the CHX proposal will promote fair hedging opportunities, the Commission finds that extended trading hours should increase volume in the CXM, thereby adding to the depth and liquidity of the market for that basket product. 10 10 The Commission used a similar rationale in approving extended trading hours for stock index options. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 22957 (February 27, 1986), 51 FR 7869 (March 6, 1986) (File Nos. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;85&hyph;49, SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;86&hyph;02 and SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;86&hyph;06). See also Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31591 (December 11, 1992), 57 FR 60253 (December 18, 1992) (File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;92&hyph;18) (approving trading of portfolio depository receipts until 4:15 Eastern time). The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of the notice of filing thereof. The CHX proposal is designed to eliminate a barrier to fair hedging opportunities; accelerated approval thereof will allow the resulting risk management benefits for traders and investors to be realized immediately. In addition, the proposed rule change was published in the Federal Register for the full statutory period and no comments were received on any aspect of the proposal. It is therefore ordered, Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 11 that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;CHX&hyph;93&hyph;29) is approved. 11 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988). For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 12 12 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1991). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
