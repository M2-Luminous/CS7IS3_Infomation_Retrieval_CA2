Gen. Mario Enriquez Morales criticizes the meager contribution made by Guatemalans -- especially politicians -- to the peace process and says that talks with the URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity] might last until 1995. He also admits that the Army has made a major effort to balance two different issues things: tolerance of officials involved in the political-ideological arena with the antisubversive campaign of those officials who remain in the mountains fighting the guerrillas. [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] How far is the Army willing to go vis-a-vis negotiations with the URNG? [Enriquez] Our desire for peace is genuine, but that does not mean we will leave it up to the URNG to do whatever it wants with the Guatemalan Army. We are willing to go as far as the URNG did in its response to the overall proposal and as far as the government did in its response to that proposal. They might want to ask for things beyond that point, which could exacerbate the situation. The constitutional president of the Republic is our commander in chief, and it will be up to him to set the limits for the Army. As our commander in chief, I do not think he will set us adrift. [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] To accept...to what extent? Despite the military's claim that they are apolitical and nondeliberative, they are doing just the opposite. [Enriquez] That is your view because we speak to the media. Those who speak up the most are Gen. Enriquez, Colonel Morris Eugenio De Leon, and our spokeswoman. [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] It is not only my opinion. Gen. Pineda Carranza and Gen. Balconi Turcios, among others, have also spoke out recently, and their public statements have triggered various comments, one of which is that the Army has entered the political arena and is actively participating... [Enriquez] We are speaking up because various national sectors and participants are inviting us to different forums. We believe that, as part of Guatemalan society, we must attend all these events. We cannot withdraw from that area because the Army is being criticized by its enemies. That is why we accept all invitations. [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] What concessions are you willing to make during the negotiations? [Enriquez] We are concerned about and interested in all the topics on the agenda. After all, we are Guatemalan citizens first, soldiers second. We are concerned about what might happen if a national constituent assembly is formed and about the changes it might make in the Constitution. We are interested in future developments in the agrarian situation because it could trigger a disaster, a social turmoil...because the potential for violence exists. We are also concerned about the issues of Indian peoples. We hope the efforts to polarize Guatemalan society along ethnic lines do not succeed, because we must preserve general peace. There are some aspects of Agreement 169 that are unconstitutional. They must be made to fit within the Constitution. We are even more concerned about issues that are closely related to the Army and which concern us directly. That is normal. Just as the Chamber of Agriculture has great interest in the agrarian situation, we are very concerned about the truth commission. [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] Why are you concerned? [Enriquez] How could we not be? We have not become belligerent, but we know well that some people seek to morally destroy the Army as an institution through accusations made by an illegal, clandestine, and illegitimate minority. I think it would be unfair to omit the names of those who have been URNG militants since 1960, or those of union leaders, university students, and all those who became involved in this. Too many parties were involved, including countries like Cuba, where nearly everyone received training. [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] Mexico...? [Enriquez] Mexico...well, there is no reason not to mention that country just because they are being so nice and hospitable to us. Reality prevails there. Aren't the guerrilla commanders in Mexico. Do they not give refuge to the guerrillas? Did the refugees not go there? Didn't the CPR [Communities of Resistant People] go there when we entered Ixcan? It is a sanctuary for subversion. The URNG wants the commission to have some specific tasks; for example, they want them to have judicial functions. In that case its purpose would not be reconciliatory because it would open wounds that have already healed. It would be a commission of revenge. Anyone who focuses on revenge keeps his own wounds open. The URNG's wounds are undoubtedly still open because it did not gain power and would like to destroy those who opposed their reaching it; in this case, the Army. [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] You have said that you will be tolerant in the negotiations. Do you think it will do any good? [Enriquez] I don't think it will do any good, but many think it will. I would like to find someone who could convince me, because I have said -- maybe too intensely -- that a truth commission will not reconcile us. I will say it again. Whether or not this commission is authorized, I will say it today and always: It will not reconcile us. There is international proof that will not reconcile us. [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] Give us an example. [Enriquez] What happened in Argentina? The Painted Faces appeared and there was a serious confrontation. They were killing each other in El Salvador. If general amnesty had not been declared three days later, who knows what would have happened... With all those precedents, why are we going to get involved in this? We do not fear the commission or the truth. We have told them that we fear the truth that "you, who are clandestine and illegal, want to apply against the Army." In the case of the truth commission, we have a ceiling and a floor. You can be fully assured that the ceiling does not include our military personnel putting their heads in the main plaza to have them cut off. [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] Your position that all sectors be tried, including nations, could hinder an agreement, clarifications could become unrealistic. [Enriquez] It would be more unrealistic if all sectors were not included. [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] But the armed conflict was between the Army and the rebels... [Enriquez] That is what some believe: The Army and the guerrillas were involved, no one else. That is untrue. It cannot be. There were many actors here...Let everything come out in the open. Unions and political parties have been infiltrated. Donaldo Alvarez Ruiz and Valiente Tellez were not soldiers. I am certain there were death squads that were not created by the military, either. So it is not just the Army and the URNG. It is not just Guatemala. Mexico, Cuba, Russia, and Nicaragua were involved. Isn't that where the arsenals came from? [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] What about the nations that supported the Army...? [Enriquez] That's the bad part, no one helped us. We were left alone, they wanted to finish us off once and for all. [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] How will the officers react if the government accepts a commission such as that wanted by the URNG? [Enriquez] I think the officers will not be pleased at all. I like to respond directly, which is why I say they will not be satisfied. We are not willing to go to our deaths like little lambs to the slaughter. We prefer to die fighting. We have told the URNG this. [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] One can perceive opposing attitudes in the armed institution. On the one hand, you are playing in the political arena with open and tolerant policies, while on the other hand, the officers and soldiers are fighting the guerrillas in the conflict areas with counter-subversive polices because they remain in the area of confrontation. How can the positions be reconciled? [Enriquez] You are right. We learned this from the URNG. They have a local and international attitude and yet another attitude for their combatants. If we do not get smart, they are going to beat us. The soldier is trained to fight. The second lieutenant, the lieutenant, the captain, and the major are trained to fight. Meanwhile, the lieutenant colonel, the colonel, and the general have to be prepared to work in the political-ideological arena, not in the party aspect, to defend the Army. We have always said that militarily we are superior, but politically the URNG is ahead of us. [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] What specifically are you doing to reconcile both viewpoints and attitudes? [Enriquez] We are doing a lot in the Army. It is a lot of work because we know that a military and political effort must be made to consolidate peace in Guatemala. Each officer and soldier knows that we have opened our arms to peace, but they also know that as long as there is an armed conflict, we must fulfill our constitutional duty to effectively combat subversion. [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] How have officers in the conflict areas reacted to the withdrawal of detachments from the resettlement areas and to the orders that they must treat the displaced and returning refugees as brothers when they have always seen them as guerrillas? [Enriquez] That shows you how the Army has changed, because the message has reached all levels. The officers agree with what is happening. You cannot imagine how the commander talked to all those people when the soldiers withdrew from Tercer Pueblo after so many years, so many dead and wounded, and so many harassment attacks. [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] But if there are two viewpoints or attitudes and no institutional position, there might be concern that someone could suddenly come out and say there is dissension in the ranks. [Enriquez] I do not know if there is dissension in the ranks. A lieutenant in Playa Grande told me in front of 52 officers: "General, I am very sorry we have left Tercer Pueblo." He spoke to me about our dead and wounded and how we were giving up by withdrawing from Tercer Pueblo. I replied: "You are right. As a lieutenant, that is how you must think, and I congratulate you. I am also sorry, but we have to open our arms to peace, to those who return, and to the CPR so we can begin walking on the path to peace. But that is the way a military man must think," I told him. A candle must not be so close that it burns the saint's statue but not so far away that it doesn't illuminate it. They were given the urban area of Tercer Pueblo, but we were left on the outskirts, because that was the agreement and because constitutionally we can be there. We removed the Cuarto Pueblo detachment from where it was because the CPR were very close, 1,200 meters away, and we placed it at the border with Mexico. Now they say we have them surrounded because we are in Mayaland, Monaco, Xalbal...but that's life. Nevertheless, I can assure you that our position is unified. It is the same for everyone. It is one of opening, even though the desire to fight must continue to exist among our people until all of this ends. [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] Do the changes in the Army also include cleaning up the institution, as you recently told the media? [Enriquez] I told the media and I also told the officers that I want the Army to take a bath with the best soap. I also told them that it would be "an external bath, because I cannot go into your consciences." Nevertheless, I warned them that "you will pay for any error that you individually or any group of you commits and that compromises the armed institution. The law will be enforced. Let us hope it falls with greatest severity on those who commit the error." That is what we must do. We are determined. All the commanders know this. We will not tolerate anything. [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] When you spoke of a cleanup, you also said you wanted to solve the crime against anthropologist Myrna Mack... [Enriquez] I believe that has already been solved. [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] There are still the masterminds... [Enriquez] That is what Helen Mack says, right? If we follow that line of thinking, all of a sudden [former President] Vinicio Cerezo will have to go to jail because he was the leader. I would have to go to trial if anything happens anywhere and a soldier is to blame. That should not be so. In this case, a person has already been tried. I do not think he was following orders because if he had been, he would have said so a long time ago. [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] Let's talk about your views on the agenda. What are the most important topics, and which are the most likely to be sticking points? [Enriquez] The truth commission is important, but that issue is now separate from human rights. The most important issues are the strengthening of civilian power, the role of the military in a democracy, and the land issue. I think the land issue will be a difficult one. [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] What about the constitutional reforms being discussed at the negotiating table? [Enriquez] That is the third most important issue. We have tried to probe a little into the changes they are seeking because the URNG says the Constitution is antisubversive. They may want to make many changes, and of course they are not going to have a large enough presence at the national constituent assembly to make them. That could pose a serious problem. [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] Could the land reform issue be a part of the agreements, or would it have to discussed at the constituent assembly? [Enriquez] This must be dealt with constitutionally because private property is expressly recognized in the Constitution. Furthermore, the talks are between the government and the URNG, which means the legislative and judicial branches have no say in the negotiations. The only thing the government can do with its legislative powers is promote action in that direction. It cannot offer or guarantee that this or that will be done, because approval or rejection of any reform falls under the authority of other branches of government. The URNG wants to change the Constitution, including the Army's mission. Apparently they want to remove the clause on domestic security, so the final decision belongs to the constituent assembly, not the executive branch. [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] Would the next issue be the Indians? [Enriquez] We focus a lot of attention on that issue because it is a significant problem in our society. It is easily exploited by those who are talented at making the best of contradictions. While it is true that the indigenous communities in our country have lived -- or have been forced to live -- apart from the rest of society, I do not believe it is part of a policy promoted by the government or the Coordinating Committee for Agricultural, Commercial, Financial, and Industrial Associations [CACIF]. What worries us is the fact that they have become quite ideological. These are the most important issues. Once we manage to overcome the military issue and the other more difficult matters, once I hear the URNG say "cease fire," then I can say we are going to attain peace. [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] What is your opinion of the behavior of all the other sectors of our community regarding the peace process? [Enriquez] As of just recently, I would say it has primarily been indifference. It was as if the people really believed that the only two players were the guerrillas and the Army, like you said before, and that everything would end when they decided to stop fighting. Period. That is really not the way it is. I find that they have become more aware and now realize that the subversive attacks were directed at the government and the system in Guatemala with the objective of completely changing everything. They know now that the Army, as the nation's armed force and legitimate defender of the Guatemalan State, was obliged to fight them. That is precisely what we have done. We have carried out our mission, and we are determined to accomplish it. [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] What is your opinion about the political sector? [Enriquez] The only thing I can say about the political sector is that I hope the parties grow stronger and, as rightful institutions, they meet the people's expectations for the coming elections. [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] Do you mean growing stronger in their present form? [Enriquez] When I say grow stronger, I mean I hope the members choose their leaders wisely. If they do, they will not have to regret it later and say that their leaders did not meet the expectations they created. Now there are elections for deputies, and the general elections are almost here. The people must think carefully about who they will vote for. If they do not, we are going to see the same problems all over again and it will be the voters' fault alone. We do not vote. [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] What can you say about the politicians' participation in the peace process? [Enriquez] Their contribution is almost imperceptible. There were representatives from the political parties when the talks began, but they gradually disappeared. Lately the politicians have said nothing about peace or a cease fire. The media has been bolder in writing about these issues. [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] There is light at the end of the tunnel now that the Human Rights Agreement has been signed. Many feel it is the beginning of peace. Objectively speaking, how realistic is it to hope for peace in the next few months? [Enriquez] I do see light at the end of the tunnel; so much so that I, as defense minister, would dare express my honest enthusiasm and delight about the Human Rights Agreements. The agreements not only bring international verification, which is a firm step toward peace, but they also include a statement by the government and the URNG of their willingness to attain peace in December, before the end of the year. If there is no political willingness, however, it is logical to conclude that the talks will grind to a halt. That is also true. Nevertheless, I do not believe that any further delay would benefit anyone, not even the URNG. [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] Based on what you believe will happen, not on what you would like to see, would you venture to say that a peace agreement will be signed in December? [Enriquez] If you ask me what I would like to see, then I say yes, I hope peace can be signed in December or earlier. If you ask me what I think will happen, I would have to say that when I was overly optimistic in the past, I was disappointed. I would rather not be so optimistic this time. I think the peace talks could go on into part of next year. [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] Where could the stalemate arise? [Enriquez] Practically everything is behind schedule. They were supposed to start talking about the displaced persons on 8 May, but they have postponed that until 21 or 24 May. There you have a fortnight already, and they will surely postpone other issues. I am sure they will encounter obstacles on some issues. I only wish it were a matter of saying: "This is as far as we can go." Then they could go on the record as saying that the URNG wants this or that and the government wants that and the other. But that is not the way it works. They prefer to go on fighting over each issue.
