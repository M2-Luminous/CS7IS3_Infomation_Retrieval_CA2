Boris Yeltsin and Nursultan Nazarbayev Show the CIS Leaders How To Restore Economic Ties on a New Basis"] [Text] The Russian-Kazakhstan talks in the Kremlin began with a one-on-one conversation between Boris Yeltsin and Nursultan Nazarbayev. The presidents were then joined by the two countries' state delegations, which include Premiers Viktor Chernomyrdin and Sergey Tereschenko. A large package of Russian-Kazakhstani agreements are expected to be signed as a result of the talks. It is planned that Boris Yeltsin and Nursultan Nazarbayev will sign a Treaty on Military Cooperation, a Treaty on the Further Deepening of Economic Cooperation and Integration Between Kazakhstan and Russia, a Treaty on the Basic Principles for Resolving Questions Linked with the Civil and Legal Status of Citizens of Kazakhstan Permanently Resident on Russian Territory and of Citizens of Russia Permanently Resident on Kazakhstan Territory, and an agreement between the two countries on the basic principles and conditions governing the utilization of the Baykonur space center. Around a score of documents relating to military and technical cooperation, the peaceful utilization of nuclear energy, and cooperation in the fields of the economy, science, culture, and legal relations are expected to be signed at head of government level. A total of 22 documents are scheduled to be signed as a result of the talks. "The basis of our mutual relations is the treaty concluded in May 1992," Tair Mansurov, Kazakhstan ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary to Russia, said in a ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI interview. "We are confident that our president's visit to Moscow will make it possible to add yet another fine page to the history of our peoples' friendship. Our common border is very nearly 6,000 km long, and 12 Russian and 6 Kazakhstani regions are located along it." The ambassador recalled Nursultan Nazarbayev's remark that "the entire population of Kazakhstan is Russian-speaking," adding that the Kazakhstan leader regards relations with Russia as a priority. As for the Baykonur problem, about which there has been much argument recently, Tair Mansurov's view is that the space center must be preserved as an enormous achievement of scientific and technical thinking and it must operate in the interests of Russia and Kazakhstan alike. Economic cooperation, which must be developed and deepened, remains the foundation of cooperation between the two countries. As the ambassador said, one of the documents prepared for the presidents' meeting relates precisely to economic relations. On what basis can enterprises which used to be part of a unified technological chain but, by a whim of fate, have found themselves on adjacent territories, restore their severed ties? Russian Government First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets is absolutely confident that transnational financial and industrial groups can and must become the new basis for this. In these groups the interests of allied enterprises are not national or -- even more so -- political but purely economic, since they are all "interlinked" through common finances to the production of the same finished output. The financial health of each individual enterprise will be totally dependent on the successful activity of the entire financial and industrial group as a whole. The formation of the first Russian-Kazakhstan transnational financial and industrial group based on the "Omsknefteorgsintez" production association and 14 allied enterprises is currently on the agenda. It is typical that Kazakhstan's leaders were the first to realize the necessity and expediency of such a step and officially put a proposal to this effect to President Yeltsin. It is perfectly possible that one of the practical results of N. Nazarbayev's visit to Moscow will be precisely the signing of a special intergovernmental agreement on this. However, the concentration of enterprises from the two countries around "Omsknefteorgsintez" is by no means the sole opportunity for building mutually advantageous cooperation. In O. Soskovets' view, joint work to modernize the Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Combine could be particularly promising and mutually advantageous. This combine, which smelted around 20 percent of all Russian steel and exported 3 million tonnes a year, was traditionally geared to obtaining raw material from Kazakhstan. "What is the point of us bringing in pellets from the Lebedinskiy Mining and Enrichment Combine and spending 14,000-15,000 rubles [R] on shipping something priced at R12,000 a tonne of when we have appropriate Kazakh enterprises with empty order books right next door? Such cooperation could benefit everybody," the first vice premier believes. Life itself is inexorably pushing our countries toward cooperation. And if the leaders of Russia and Kazakhstan manage to lay the political foundation for joint work, financial and industrial groups could indeed become the locomotive which will pull the two countries' economies out of crisis.
