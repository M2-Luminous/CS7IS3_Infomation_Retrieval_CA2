As of Thursday (KST), the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) team had not been able to inspect the 5-megawatt nuclear reactor and radiochemical laboratory at Yongbyon, sources in New York and Washington said. Moreover, even if South and North Korea agreed to exchange special envoys at their sixth working-level contact at Panmunjom on Saturday, it would be too late for the exchange to occur before March 21, when the United States and North Korea are scheduled to hold the next high-level meeting in Geneva. The United States has said these two conditions -- IAEA inspections and an inter-Korean exchange of special envoys -- are prerequisites to the third round of talks between Washington and Pyongyang. North Korea wants to continue its negotiations with the United States on normalizing relations and economic assistance, among other things. The sources said, however, they will have to wait until the weekend to see whether the IAEA inspection team is permitted to inspect the two nuclear facilities at Yongbyon before returning to Vienna. In this connection, Deputy State Department Spokeswoman Christine Shelly said she understood the IAEA inspectors were encountering "some difficulties" in Yongbyon. "We, of course, regret that they (IAEA inspections) have not proceeded as smoothly as we would have liked up to this point" she told a regular weekly press briefing. But noting that there is still some time left, Shelly urged North Korea to meet its commitments that they have made. She also recalled that the third round of U.S.-North Korean high- level talks can be held only when South and North Korea exchange special envoys to discuss the nuclear question. Prior to Shelly's remarks, the U.S. State Department was reported to have conveyed the American position on inter-Korean envoy exchange talks to the North Korean Mission to the United Nations in New York on Tuesday (EST). North Korea has said it did not agree to exchange special envoys as a precondition for further U.S.-North Korean talks. It is also refusing to open the five-megawatt reactor and the radiochemical laboratory to IAEA inspectors.
