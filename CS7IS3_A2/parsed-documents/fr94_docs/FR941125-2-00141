FR941125-2-00141 FR941125-2-00096 Of the stated factors, the administrative law judge found that factors (2), (3), (4), and (5) were relevant. As to factor (2), Respondent admitted to dispensing Ativan without a prescription; as to factor (3) Mr. Gore was convicted under New Jersey State law of a single felony of unlawfully distributing a controlled dangerous substance; as to factor (4), Respondent dispensed controlled substances without a valid prescription in violation of the Federal Controlled Substances Act and New Jersey State law; and as to factor (5), the administrative law judge found that Respondent's conduct at Family Pharmacy in New Jersey, the action of the New Jersey State Board of Pharmacy taken against Mr. Gore, and his subsequent conviction all were found to threaten the public health and safety. The administrative law judge noted that Respondent's major defense was that he was no longer associated with All Drugs Pharmacy, Inc. However, the administrative law judge determined that the evidence as a whole does not support that the transfer was an arms-length transaction. Judge Tenney concluded that the continued registration of All Drugs Pharmacy, Inc. would not be consistent with the public interest and that is registration should be revoked. The Deputy Administrator adopts the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommended ruling of the administrative law judge in its entirety. Based on the foregoing, the Deputy Administrator concludes that Respondent's continued registration would not be in the public interest. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104, hereby orders that DEA Certificate of Registration, BA2097562, issued to All Drugs Pharmacy, Inc., be and it hereby is, revoked; and that any pending applications of Nasir Gore, be, and they hereby are, denied. This order is effective December 27, 1994. Dated: November 17, 1994. Stephen H. Greene, Deputy Administrator.
