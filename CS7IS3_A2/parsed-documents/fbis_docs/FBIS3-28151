Among the main points are: 1) To study a reduction of land value tax on land for public use; 2) to postpone a plan to ease conditions for a special tax break for selling one's residential property to buy a more expensive one; and 3) to postpone implementation of an increase in liquor and tobacco taxes. Moreover, the package includes plans to maintain special corporate tax and to change delayed payment of inheritance tax into payment in kind. The ruling parties are scheduled to reach a conclusion on income tax reduction and revenue sources for the reduction, at their representative meeting. Subsequently, in combining the currently-revealed package with the conclusion on income tax cuts, they intend to compile the ruling parties' outline for revision of the tax system for fiscal year 1994 on 8 February. The centerpiece of the proposal package is the land tax system. The ruling parties have advocated the need to study a reduction of land value tax on land which "is used for public purposes." Moreover, in view of demands among the ruling parties for the abolition of land value tax, the package indicates: "The role of land tax value should be replaced with that of property taxes from a medium-to-long term point of view." At the same time, regarding alteration or abolition of land value tax, it stipulates the principle of "continuing the system itself for the time being." Regarding the issue of increasing taxes on profits from transfer of corporations, the ruling parties have demanded that the present limit for a holding period be abolished and the tax rate be set at 10 percent in all cases. On this issue, the Ministry of Finance has already worked out its proposal: "The basic points of the tax such as the tax rate remain untouched and the scope of tax reduction for the sellers be expanded." However, the ruling parties' proposal package mentions "the current situation in which even if companies try to tackle restructuring in a bid to overcome the economic recession, they have to give up the plan due to the lack of financial resources." Thus, the package reflects demands made by Shinseito, Komeito, and other parties on the issue. Regarding a special tax break for selling one's residential property to buy a more expensive one, the idea of easing conditions concerning transfer prices has now cropped up within the ruling coalition. However, the package points out: "The tax break system was already revised in 1993," and demands the current limit of "100 million yen" be maintained. Meanwhile, regarding a tax break for selling business property, the package proposes the introduction of special measures for selling depreciation assets from the viewpoint of promoting the restructuring of companies. As for indirect taxes, the package clearly indicates a critical view of the growing demand within the government for increased liquor and tobacco taxes, saying: "It is difficult to seek public understanding of such an increase which may be regarded as an increase in the general public's tax burden." Regarding the issue of how taxes ought to be put on public-service corporations -- the issue is now being discussed as an example of the preferential taxation treatment -- the package stresses: "It is necessary to see that there are many cases where the preferential system of taxation is used badly and such cases should not be overlooked." Stating that "some measures should be taken to remedy the situation," the package proposes such measures as lowering limits of taxation on profit-making business to improve the taxation system.
