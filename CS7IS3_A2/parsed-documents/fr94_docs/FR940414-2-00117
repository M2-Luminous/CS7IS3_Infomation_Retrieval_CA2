FR940414-2-00117 FR940414-2-00076 9. Applicant requests an exemption from section 17(g) and rule 17g&hyph;1 to the extent necessary to permit the Partnership to comply with rule 17g&hyph;1 by having a majority of the members of the Board take such actions and make such approvals as are set forth in rule 17g&hyph;1. 10. Applicant requests an exemption from Section 17(j) and rule 17j&hyph;1 (except rule 17j&hyph;1(a)) because the requirements contained therein are burdensome and unnecessary in the context of the Partnership. Requiring the Partnership to adopt a written code of ethics and requiring access persons to report each of their securities transactions would be time consuming and expensive, and would serve little purpose in light of, among other things, the community of interest among the Partners by virtue of their common association in the Morgan Stanley Group; the substantial and largely overlapping protections afforded by the conditions with which the Applicant has agreed to comply; the concern of the Morgan Stanley Group that personnel who participate in the Partnership actually receive the benefits they expect to receive when investing in the Partnership; and the fact that the investments of the Partnership will be investments that usually would not be offered to the Partners, including those Partners who would be deemed access persons, as individual investors. Accordingly, the requested exemption is consistent with the purposes of the Act, because the dangers against which section 17(j) and rule 17j&hyph;1 are intended to guard are not present in the case of the Partnership. 11. Sections 30(a), 30(b) and 30(d), and the rules under those sections, generally require that registered investment companies prepare and file with the Commission and mail to their shareholders certain periodic reports and financial statements. The forms prescribed by the Commission for periodic reports have little relevance to the Partnership and would entail administrative and legal costs that outweigh any benefit to the Limited Partners. Exemptive relief is requested to the extent necessary to permit the partnership to report annually to its Partners in the manner described above in paragraph 37. An exemption also is requested from section 30(f) to the extent necessary to exempt the General Partner, MSVC II, members of the Board, and any other persons who may be deemed members of an advisory board of the Partnership from filing Forms 3, 4 and 5 under section 16 of the Exchange Act with respect to their ownership of interests in the Partnership. 12. Applicant submits that the exemptions requested are consistent with the protection of investors in view of the substantial community of interest among all the parties and the fact that the Partnership is an ``employees' securities company'' as defined in section 2(a)(13). The Partnership was conceived and will be organized and managed by person who will be investing in the Partnership, and will not be promoted by persons seeking to profit from fees or investment advice or from the distribution of securities. Applicant also submits that the terms of the proposed affiliated transactions will be reasonable and fair and free from overreaching.
