Undoubtedly the taxpayers did not win, and possibly the PPR [Progressive Renewal Party] lost as well despite Sandra Cavalcanti's announcement that she was not going to obstruct the amendment any more because the changes she had asked for had been accepted. Politically speaking, Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso may also be considered a loser because part of the agreement with the PPR was not fulfilled, either through technicalities related to congressional regulations or misunderstandings by Senator Espiridao Amin. Be that as it may, unless the effort to increase revenues surpasses that of Dona Maria I, The Demented, who levied taxes that led to the execution of Tiradentes [reference to Queen Mary I of Portugal who ordered a large portion of Brazilian gold be transferred to Portugal, prompting the bid for independence that led to the execution of one of its leaders Joaquim Jose da Silva Xavier Tiradentes in 1792], we are bound to conclude that it will be difficult to balance the budget if salaries of public servants and military men are not frozen at 93 levels (in real-terms, of course) -- the Law on Budget Guidelines [LDO] lifts the requirement to withhold 20 percent of education-related salaries -- and at the same time approves housing expenditures three times above 1992 levels. Balancing the budget under these conditions will be made especially difficult since the executive branch agreed to remove from the amendment the article which empowered the administration to cut the budget whenever revenues fell short of expenditures. The administration managed to prove it can control Congress, although the finance minister was forced to make a few concessions in the LDO. The congressional advisers of the military ministries (who acted openly in favor of salary hikes for public servants in 1994 and 1995) made their objective very clear -- and they won. Everything has been approved and it is now up to the banks to pay up and balance the budget, and the Federal Revenue will carry on. The votes cast last night have led to a partial success in the effort to correct, during the next two years, some of the imbalances that the 1988 Constitution inflicted on the distribution of revenues and services between the Federal Government, the states, and the municipalities, and to reduce (or eliminate) the allocation of certain percentages of the revenue to specific expenditures which slowed down the implementation of any government policy. It remains to be seen whether, after enduring a lot of pain from the Budget Investigating Committee, Congress has not managed -- in a roundabout way without actually setting down anything in writing -- to change the budget from discretionary to compulsory by removing from the executive branch the possibility of cutting expenditures if there are not enough revenues. Let us not be deluded by the praise that will be lavished on Congress for its patriotism and on the minister for his unselfishness. The FSE amendment will come up for the second vote on 23 February. A formal vote will also take place on the same day for the promulgation. The finance minister also hopes to see the final text of the amendment published in the 24 February issue of the official gazette. There is a little problem that must be solved first before the executive branch can implement its economic recovery plan without first getting approval for the budget: Some parties want the Federal Supreme Court [STF] to decide if it is constitutional to promulgate one amendment after another. These parties believe the process of constitutional revision requires that all, we repeat all, approved amendments should be promulgated at the same time so as to have a coherent Constitution to which the people can refer at any time. Should the STF rule in favor of these parties, where will that leave the finance minister's plan? Even though the minister obtained a victory at the plenary meeting, the bill that was approved was different from the original one -- especially as far as compulsory transfer of funds is concerned. The minister and his advisers did not manage to fully reverse this situation, which Minister Cardoso himself severely criticized in his 7 February speech. Approximately 80 percent of federal revenues are committed to compulsory transfers or fixed obligations leaving the executive branch only 20 percent to carry out its programs. In this aspect, which was essential for the success of the initial plan, the minister was defeated. We could also say that the efforts of General Romildo Canhim, the federal administration secretary, to institute some discipline in the pay scales of civilian and military public servants were also seriously jeopardized by the fact that it is quite possible there will be real salary hikes in 1994 and 1995 (which was forbidden in the original bill). The victory of the executive branch, although showing some rays of hope, should not lead us to believe that the war against inflation has been won. Several battles lie ahead, the worst being defining whether it is constitutional to promulgate the amendment that establishes the FSE before the constitutional revision is concluded. The road ahead is fraught with surprises.
