FBIS4-17709 "drsov082_v_94004" FBIS-SOV-94-082 Daily Report 27 Apr 1994 Lithuania Walesa Says Treaty Ends Past Walesa Says Treaty Ends Past LD2704122594 Warsaw Radio Warszawa Network in Polish 1005 GMT 27 Apr 94 LD2704122594 Warsaw Radio Warszawa Network Polish BFN [Text] [Announcer] President Lech Walesa has said in Vilnius that the Polish-Lithuanian Treaty has put an end to the past. [Correspondent Prygon] Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas had a similar view and expressed the hope that the treaty will prove to be sufficiently substantial to be beneficial to both our states and nations. Thus, the principle that in Polish-Lithuanian relations we should look into the future rather than the past has been reiterated. Poland and Lithuania are linked by similar interests in the economy and foreign policy. For this reason, and despite the fact that Lech Walesa is still skeptical about the Partnership for Peace program, he thinks that we should, I quote, turn this partnership into a great factor for security for Europe. He added that there is no free Poland without a free Lithuania. Lech Walesa supports the idea put forward by Algirdas Brazauskas yesterday for a meeting between the heads of the Baltic states and the heads of the Visegrad Group. Asked about the rebroadcasting of the Polish Television First Program to Lithuania, Lech Walesa said he will do everything he can to ensure that as many programs as possible reach Lithuania. He admitted, however, that there are technical difficulties. It is possible to overcome them, in the same way as we can overcome the situation at our border-crossing points. At the same time, he expressed the hope that by the year 2000 we will not be divided by a border.
