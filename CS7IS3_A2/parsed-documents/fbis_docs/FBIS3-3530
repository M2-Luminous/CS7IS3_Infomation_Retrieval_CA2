This economically booming province has simplified port formalities. Instead of making repeated examinations of trucks coming in and out at different localities, customs officers only check the trucks once, at the Shenzhen crossing point bordering Hong Kong. Generally, they will no longer make on-board examinations of foreign ships, and they will make only some spot checks on tourists. A provincial official in charge of port management said that the province officially opened seven first-grade ports and built 20 second-grade ports last year. Guangdong had 44 first-grade entry and exit ports and 152 second- grade ports by the end of last year. These ports handled 71.384 million visitors last year, 111.51 million tons of cargo and 8.42 million motor vehicles, increases of 5.6 percent, 29.9 percent and 10.1 percent over the previous year, respectively.
