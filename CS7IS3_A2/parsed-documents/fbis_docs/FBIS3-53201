As usual, he claimed that Syria has not clarified the nature of the peace it seeks to establish in the region and adds that Israel will not agree to a complete withdrawal from the Golan and to the evacuation of the settlements but to a withdrawal on the Golan in exchange for a complete peace. The truth is that, since the launching of the U.S. initiative, Syria has explained that it aspires to a just and comprehensive peace in the region and to the settlement of all the aspects of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Syria has submitted practical, objective, and balanced proposals since the sixth round to translate the UN Security Council resolutions and the peace for land principle into tangible reality. Syria, also announced through its foreign minister that it is ready for a full peace in exchange for a full withdrawal. However, the Israeli officials who have done their best since the Madrid conference to undermine the Washington talks and raise obstacles and obstructions have so far rejected the formula of a just and comprehensive peace. They did not abide by the UN Security Council resolutions and insist on partial settlements and peace in installments. When Rabin speaks about withdrawal on the Golan, he refers to a partial and limited withdrawal and wants a full peace in return. This is so in spite of the fact that Syria had informed all the parties concerned that the Golan is nonnegotiable and that peace depends on Israel's full withdrawal. Rabin wants to share the Golan with Syria. The Golan has been Syrian land since time immemorial and cannot be divided. The UN Security Council resolutions are clear. They demand a full Israeli withdrawal, do not permit the forcible seizure of the land of others, reject the settlement operations and the transformation of the landmarks of the occupied territories. Syria is fully committed to the implementation of Resolutions 242 and 338, which are the basis of the peace process. Has Israel done the same? Rabin speaks on every occasion about a withdrawal on the Golan and not from the Golan. Thus, he places an insurmountable obstacle before the attainment of any progress on the Syrian track. Syria has announced on every occasion that it rejects partial deals and aspires for a comprehensive peace. Why then does Rabin insist on phased partial settlements and peace in installments? Rabin, actually plans to swallow up part of the Golan. It goes without saying that Syria will not be dragged into such deformed and mutilated settlements and will not give up any inch of its territory. Rabin's statements seek to raise doubts about the feasibility of the Syrian-U.S. summit scheduled to be held in Geneva in the middle of this month. Everyone knows that the United States seeks a comprehensive peace and is in accord with Syria on this. Comprehensive peace cannot be established without Israel's full withdrawal, the removal of the occupation, and the elimination of the settlements in accordance with the international legitimacy resolutions and the principle of exchanging land for peace. But, Israel refuses to withdraw, insists on occupation, and resorts, as usual, to the pretext of security. Security and expansion go together with respect to the Israeli rulers. They have launched many wars of expansion under the pretext of security. They reject peace now under the pretext of security. What peace are they talking about if it will not lead to the elimination of the occupation, the return of the land, and the entrenchment of the right of the dispersed and the refugees to return to their land and properties? Perhaps, we can see the type of peace Israel wants through the negotiations resulting from the Gaza-Jericho accord. Israel has not conceded a single essential thing to the Palestinians. It insists on entrenching its occupation and hegemony and its control over the crossings, routes, areas, and the Palestinian people's resources. Everyone agrees that occupation is the opposite of peace. Although the Palestinian side became involved in Israel's schemes, it soon reaped the bitter fruits. It found itself face to face with an endless series of operations of deception and misleading actions. Syria will certainly not be dragged into such agreements and insists on the meticulous implementation of the UN Security Council resolutions. It will pay no heed to any Israeli proposals that do not contain a full and comprehensive withdrawal from the Golan.
