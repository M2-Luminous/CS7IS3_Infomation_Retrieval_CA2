FBIS4-25076 "drchi108_w_94007" FBIS-CHI-94-108 Daily Report 4 Jun 1994 HONG KONG & MACAO Hong Kong Legislative Council Approves Airport Funding Legislative Council Approves Airport Funding HK0406051094 Hong Kong SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST in English 4 Jun 94 p 5 HK0406051094 Hong Kong SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST English BFN [By Linda Choy] [Text] Legislators yesterday gave the go-ahead for a funding request of $715 million to finance the installation of the airport railway immersed tube and related projects amid signs of optimism for a Sino-British agreement. The approved funding was $102 million less than the original request tabled in the Legislative Council last month due to lower tender prices submitted to the Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC). It represents about three percent of an equity injection of $23.7 billion for the airport railway contained in the fourth financing package given to the Chinese side in February. The Financial Secretary, Sir Hamish Macleod, also confirmed a report that the latest proposal on equity injection to the Provisional Airport Authority stood at $36.6 billion. The two amounted to a total equity injection of $60.3 billion by the Government -- $40 billion more than that in the first proposal. Sir Hamish said he did not think the revelation of the figures would affect the Sino-British talks. "I think they will understand that just to review the equity is reasonable," he said. Sir Hamish said there was a need to reassure legislators on whether the funding request tabled to them would be in line with the amount of equity. He refused to say whether the revelation meant that the gap between the two governments had become narrower. "At different stages in the talks, as work progresses, then we have to gradually reveal more in order to give members enough of the picture for them to feel that they can make a reasonable judgment and approve the funds," he said. Last week, the Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, Lu Ping, said he expected an agreement on the airport in about two months. The money, granted as advanced funding, will become part of the equity injection to the MTRC [Mass Transit Railway Corporation]. The MTRC confirmed that British firm Tarmac International and Japan's Kumagai Gumi had jointly been awarded the project. Due to earlier delays, it was estimated that the airport railway section linking Central to Kowloon would be completed only in April 1998. According to the latest submission, the estimated cost of the airport railway immersed tube and related works has dropped from $726 million to $630 million. The construction supervision and resident site staff allowance also dropped by $7 million to $51 million. The reduction in the prices listed has resulted in a lower project contingency level at $34 million. Meanwhile, Sir Hamish's confirmation of the equity amount also sparked criticisms that the Government was "governing through the media." Three leading parties the United Democrats, the Liberal Party, and Meeting Point -- also questioned the Government for rejecting their request for details of the fourth financing proposal, information of which has been leaked to the press. The Liberal Party's Steven Poon Kwok-lim said: "As legislators, we are not happy with it. Are you governing through the media?" Chief Secretary Anson Chan Fang On-sang dismissed the suggestion. "We do not feed information to the press. We do not have complete control on what the press may or may not say," she said.
