The report, published in the Japanese daily ASAHI SHIMBUN, said the accords were reached in the face of import liberalization for the products next year. Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Mutsuki Kato told reporters that Japan is holding negotiations with the U.S. and Australia to guarantee the 1986-1988 level of butter, skim milk and other milk product imports. The talks under way do not concern country-by-country accords, which are prohibited by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Kato said. He added that Japan, which is holding the negotiations under GATT rules, has no secret deals and has offered no guarantees on milk product imports. Kato said that Japan will inform GATT of the results of the negotiations when they are completed.
