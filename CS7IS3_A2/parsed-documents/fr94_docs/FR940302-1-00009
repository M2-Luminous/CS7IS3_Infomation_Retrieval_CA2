FR940302-1-00009 FR940302-1-00003 9 CFR Part 94 [Docket No. 93&hyph;173&hyph;1] Change in Disease Status of Austria Because of Rinderpest, Foot-and-Mouth Disease, and Swine Vesicular Disease AGENCY: Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: We are proposing to declare Austria free of rinderpest, foot-and-mouth disease, and swine vesicular disease. As part of this proposed action, we would add Austria to the lists of countries that, although declared free of rinderpest, foot-and-mouth disease, and swine vesicular disease, are subject to restrictions on meat and other animal products offered for importation into the United States. We would also add Austria to the list of countries from which the importation into the United States of llamas and alpacas is restricted. Declaring Austria free of rinderpest, foot-and-mouth disease, and swine vesicular disease appears to be appropriate because the last outbreak of rinderpest in Europe occurred prior to 1921, there have been no outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease in Austria since 1981, and there have been no outbreaks of swine vesicular disease since 1979. This proposed rule would remove the prohibition on the importation into the United States, from Austria, of ruminants and fresh, chilled, and frozen meat of ruminants, although those importations would be subject to certain restrictions. This proposed rule would also relieve restrictions on the importation, from Austria, of milk and milk products of ruminants. DATES: Consideration will be given only to comments received on or before May 2, 1994. ADDRESSES: Please send an original and three copies of your comments to Chief, Regulatory Analysis and Development, PPD, APHIS, USDA, room 804, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The regulations in 9 CFR part 94 (referred to below as the regulations) govern the importation into the United States of specified animals and animal products in order to prevent the introduction into the United States of various animal diseases, including rinderpest, foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), bovine spongiform encephalopathy, African swine fever, hog cholera, and swine vesicular disease (SVD). These are dangerous and destructive communicable diseases of ruminants and swine.
