According to an NPFL press release, the arrest and imprisonment of thousands of Liberians by ECOMOG on grounds of merrymaking and curfew violation shatters the pride of the Liberian people. The NPFL release says ECOMOG cannot be permitted to play the role of being a judge, jury, and executioner in the Liberian conflict when there is a constitutional government to give clearly-defined instructions. The NPFL is, therefore, calling on the people of Liberia, especially those in Monrovia, to be vigilant in protecting the civil liberties of the nation.
