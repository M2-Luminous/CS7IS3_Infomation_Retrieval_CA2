General Lyuben Petrov ended a five-day visit to Belgium on Friday [11 March], during which he noted the similarities between army reforms in Belgium and Bulgaria, he told BELGA on Thursday. His talks with his Belgian counterpart, Lieutenant General Jose Charlier, focused in particular on the Partnership for Peace proposal made by NATO to its former enemies in East Europe. General Petrov believes that the lack of financial resources could, however, prevent his country from being a "major partner" in multilateral cooperation activities with NATO. Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev came to Brussels on 14 February to sign the Partnership for Peace document proposed by the Atlantic alliance to former Warsaw Pact countries. "We may not be greatly involved," said General Petrov on Thursday, in reply to a question which raised the fact that most of the costs of the Partnership will be borne by East European countries. He believes the Bulgarian Army welcomes this proposal which includes possible joint participation in peacekeeping activities. He pointed out that for the first time Sofia had sent a contingent of blue helmets to Cambodia. But they encountered "difficulties" when they arrived due to their lack of preparation. The Bulgarian chief of staff believes each participating country is free to choose the Partnership activities. "We are in the process of preparing a national program, which the government and Parliament must then approve," he stated. He is also pleased with the quality of the bilateral military cooperation which has existed between Belgium and Bulgaria over the last two years, "the best" of any Western countries which maintain military contacts with Sofia, and which has produced "substantial exchange programs," in the words of General Charlier. The Belgian chief of staff observed that the first joint military exercises planned by the Partnership would probably not be able to start immediately. "We must first set up the necessary structures, receive the political directives, and draw up procedures," he stated. During his visit to Belgium, General Petrov met with Belgian Defense Minister Leo Delcroix. He also visited SHAPE [Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe], the Florennes air base, the 7th Armored Infantry Brigade at Marche-en-Famenne and the National Geographical Institute.
