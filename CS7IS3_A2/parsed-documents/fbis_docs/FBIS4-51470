FBIS4-51470 "drchi104_b_94002" FBIS-CHI-94-104 Daily Report 27 May 1994 United States & Canada Justice Ministry Says U.S. Rejects Prison Exports Claim Justice Ministry Says U.S. Rejects Prison Exports Claim HK2705151894 Beijing XINHUA Hong Kong Service in Chinese 1222 GMT 27 May 94 HK2705151894 Beijing XINHUA Hong Kong Service Chinese BFN [Text] Beijing, 27 May (XINHUA)--The person-in-charge of the Ministry of Justice pointed out today that a U.S. Embassy official in China has confirmed that a 21 May report by the ASSOCIATED PRESS [AP] alleging that China "is still exporting prison products" is totally groundless. Pursuant to the relevant provisions of the "Memorandum of understanding between Chinese and U.S. Governments on banning the import and export of prison products," the Chinese Ministry of Justice allowed and arranged for two officials from the U.S. Embassy in China to visit Zhejiang Province No 4 Prison and other such units between 19th and 21st May. During the visit, prison officers answered U.S. officials' questions and provided them with information. The visit failed to uncover evidence of any violations of the "Memorandum." But AP reporter John Leicester, after interviews with the concerned U.S. embassy officials in China, claimed in his report that "U.S. consular officials in China were informed that these reform institutions are still exporting prison products to the United States." Concerned Justice Ministry departments made inquiries at the U.S. Embassy in China about this matter. Lorraine Toly, a U.S. embassy official, stated that AP's report was mistaken and had distorted what she had said in the interview. She said this was what she had told the AP reporter: "If the U.S. Customs is tipped off that a certain Chinese prison is exporting its products to the United States, they will contact, together with Chinese authorities, this prison to request an inspection." "In this reporter's dispatch, my interpretation became `Toly says that U.S. officials have been informed that these reform institutions are still exporting prison products to the United States.'" This U.S. embassy official said that she was "annoyed" by the AP report, and added "I will telephone AP to make a complaint." This embassy official has written to the Chinese Justice departments concerned, apologizing for any possible confusion created by the report. The person-in-charge of the Ministry of Justice reiterated that the Chinese Government has always been conscientious, responsible, and efficient in implementing the "Memorandum of Understanding Between Chinese and U.S. Governments on Banning the Import and Export of Prison Products." He pointed out that the letter by the U.S. official showed that the 21 May report by AP is a complete distortion of the facts.
