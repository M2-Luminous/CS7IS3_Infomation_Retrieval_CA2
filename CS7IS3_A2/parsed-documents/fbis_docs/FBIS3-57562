This time the heads of 19 republics, autonomous okrugs, krays, and oblasts from the Siberian region met in Omsk. Having exchanged opinions, the members of the coordinating council concluded that different territories share many common problems. In this sense the experience of one of the programs of "Siberian Accord" -- Omsk conversion -- is particularly noteworthy. Despite the fact that only one-third of the funds required to implement the program have been allocated, the conversion program has nonetheless commenced. And it is already possible to speak of practical results. These include the An-74 -- the first Omsk aircraft -- a tractor, and television sets. But, sadly, everything could end there. Because there is not enough money to start series production of the new articles and goods. It is in this area that a common solution must be found, along with an answer to the question of what should be done next. If the country needs this aircraft, it means that we should pool the financial interests of all the region's oblasts. The coordinating council members viewed this means of integrating funds on mutually advantageous terms as one of the options for developing industry. Admittedly, other proposals were made too -- to appeal once again to the government to allocate money. But these suggestions were not supported by the majority, since there have already been many such appeals, but they have had little effect. The conference participants adopted several fundamental decisions. These included the creation of new financial-industrial groups and an integrated data base, and so forth. An organizational matter was addressed too. The new coordinating council chairman was elected. He is Valeriy Roshchulkin, deputy head of the Omsk Oblast Administration. The former council chairman -- Leonid Polezhayev -- has become the head of the interregional association.
