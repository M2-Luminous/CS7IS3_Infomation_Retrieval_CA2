The specific information to be included under each of these headings is described in Section C of Part III, Evaluation Criteria. The narrative should be typed double-spaced on a single-side of an 81/2 x 11 plain white paper, with one inch margins on all sides. All pages of the narrative (including charts, references/footnotes, tables, maps, exhibits, etc.) must be sequentially numbered, beginning with Objectives and Need for Assistance as page number one. Applicants should not submit reproductions of larger size paper, reduced to meet the size requirement. The length of the application, including the application forms and all attachments, should not exceed 60 pages. A page is a single side of an 81/2 x 11 sheet of paper. Applicants are requested not to send pamphlets, brochures or other printed material along with their application as these pose xeroxing difficulties. These materials, if submitted, will not be included in the review process if they exceed the 60-page limit. Each page of the application will be counted to determine the total length. 5. Organizational Capability Statement The Organizational Capability Statement should consist of a brief (two to three pages) background description of how the applicant organization (or the unit within the organization that will have responsibility for the project) is organized, the types and quantity of services it provides, and/or the research and management capabilities it possesses. This description should cover capabilities not included in the Program Narrative Statement. It may include descriptions of any current or previous relevant experience, or describe the competence of the project team and its demonstrated ability to produce a final product that is readily comprehensible and usable. An organization chart showing the relationship of the project to the current organization should be included.
