FR941207-0-00067 FR941207-0-00011 The intervention component calls for establishing a range of graduated sanctions that includes both immediate interventions and intermediate sanctions, including both nonresidential and residential placements and programming. Boot camps offer an intermediate sanction for nonviolent juvenile offenders. These programs should be short-term and include a formal aftercare phase, actively involving the family and the community in supporting and reintegrating the juvenile into the community. While the strategy encourages the use of non-residential community-based programs and intensive supervision programs for many juvenile offenders, it recognizes that the criminal behavior of some serious, violent and chronic offenders requires the use of secure detention and corrections facilities to protect the community and provide a structured treatment environment. This grant program will facilitate jurisdictions in meeting the challenge of placing juvenile offenders in need of confinement in secure facilities. Grants for Correctional Facilities The Subtitle A authorization provides for two different grant programs: (1) Violent Offender Incarceration Grants, and (2) Truth in Sentencing Incentive Grants. Of the total federal funding authorized to Subtitle A grant programs each year, 50 percent is allocated for each of these two grant initiatives. With the exception of a limited discretionary grant program, this funding will be distributed to states based on the formula specified in Subtitle A. Although the statute provides for states and multi-state compacts as the only eligible grant recipients, Subtitle A requires that states involve counties and other units of local government and share funds received under this program with them. To be eligible to receive funding under either of the Subtitle A programs, states must comply with a series of assurances involving sentencing policies and practices and other guarantees of sound correctional systems to ensure that violent offenders are sufficiently incapacitated and that the public is protected. Included in the assurances are requirements that the state: (1) Implement sentencing reforms that ensure violent offenders receive sufficiently severe punishments, (2) recognize the rights and needs of crime victims, and (3) develop a comprehensive correctional management plan that includes diversion programs, particularly drug diversion programs, community corrections programs, systems designed to accurately evaluate and classify inmates within the system, and programs and treatment designed to assist in reducing recidivism, including rehabilitation and treatment programs and job skills. Emphasis will be placed on a corrections system's ability to plan for and implement these basic components of a comprehensive and coordinated approach to correctional policy. Comprehensive Correctional Planning By definition, a comprehensive system involves state and local governments; thus, the development of a comprehensive plan necessitates a partnership and collaboration among state and local entities. Because the flow of offenders begins at the local level, both local and state governments play key roles in the punishment of offenders through alternative sanctions and incarceration in correctional facilities. The input of county and municipal juvenile and criminal justice officials will be considered essential to creating an effective overall state strategy to meet the goals of this grant program. Both local and state governments also have a strong interest in any change in the capacity of any component of the corrections system. The statutory assurances are clear in their intent that states are expected to share funds with local units of government in support of effective implementation of the comprehensive plan. Participants in the comprehensive plan development should represent a broad mix of interested and involved organizations and officials from varying perspectives. Every effort should be made by the state to include mayors, city and county officials, police departments, sheriffs, judges, prosecutors, community corrections administrators, representatives from the treatment and education communities and indigent defense, concerned citizens, and victims' advocates, as well as the juvenile justice system. Applicants should also take an active role in involving state and juvenile justice administrative agencies and advisory boards. The manner in which criminal and juvenile justice functions are structured in various states and their relationships with other justice agencies will affect the roles played in the development of an effective correctional plan. The comprehensive correctional plan must address how the state has involved local jurisdictions and the plan for sharing funds with local facilities, truth in sentencing and victims' rights issues, and the continuum of correctional options required for adult and juvenile offenders. It must meet the overall goal of incarcerating violent offenders, and must convey the options for nonviolent offenders that will free up traditional bed space to accomplish that goal. Victims' Rights and Needs To be eligible to receive grants, states must provide assurances that they have implemented policies that provide for the recognition of the rights and needs of crime victims. No specific requirements for complying with this condition are prescribed by this interim rule in relation to fiscal year 1995 funding because of the need for comprehensive review of the status of victims' rights measures in state systems. State applications for fiscal year 1995 funding should include information on measures which are in effect or under consideration in the state to protect the rights and interests of crime victims. More definitive guidance will be provided concerning compliance with this condition in a final rule or related guidelines for funding in fiscal year 1996 and thereafter. Areas that have been identified as implicating important rights and needs of crime victims include: (1) Providing notice to victims concerning case and offender status, (2) providing an opportunity for victims to be present at public court proceedings, (3) providing victims the opportunity to be heard at sentencing and parole hearings, (4) providing for restitution and other compensation to victims, and (5) establishing administrative mechanisms or other mechanisms to effectuate these rights.
