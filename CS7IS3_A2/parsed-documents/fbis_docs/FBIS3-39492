Balladur dropped five points to 55 percent in a poll by the BVA institute carried out for the weekly Paris-Match while those dissatisfied with him increased by seven points to 36 percent. Two polls published a week ago showed a similar trend, with Gallup registering a seven percent drop to 52 percent and CSA a six-point drop to 56 percent as Balladur, an undeclared candidate in 1995 presidential elections, battled with sometimes violent protest movements. Since last October, the prime minister has given way to the protesters, capitulating first to Air France strikers by withdrawing a draconian restructuring plan for the loss-making airline. In January, a massive demonstration by more than 600,000 teachers and students against a reform plan forced its abandonment and last month, the government gave way to violent protests by French fishermen protesting cheap imports. The BVA poll said 62 percent would support a broad protest movement of demonstrations or a general strike, compared with 56 percent a month ago, in face of Balladur's attempts to reduce unemployment and fight recession, criticised by some sections of his own right-wing coalition as too timid. The BVA poll also said there was an increase of two points to 74 percent of people thinking there was a risk of an upheaval comparable to the student uprising and general strike of May 1968. The poll also said 21 percent, compared with 17 percent, would take an active part in such an upheaval, while another 41 percent would support it, compared with 39 percent a month ago. Six percent, a one point drop, would oppose it and 25 percent (unchanged) would remain neutral.
