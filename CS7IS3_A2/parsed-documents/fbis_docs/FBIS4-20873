This was stated at a briefing today by Grigoriy Karasin, director of the department of information and the press of the Russian Foreign Ministry. He stressed that Russia's position on this question remained unchanged. We were the initiators of the trilateral moratorium on nuclear tests, which is being observed de facto by Britain, too, and we recently stated once again our intention of continuing to adhere to it. At the same time we called on the other nuclear countries to do the same, the spokesman of the Russian Foreign Ministry stated. In connection with this, he recalled that during the Russian-U.S. summit meeting in Moscow, Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton confirmed Russia's and the United States' commitment to achieving within a very short period an international treaty on the total banning of nuclear tests. Karasin also noted the constructive atmosphere at the talks on this question, which are taking place at the disarmament conference in Geneva.
