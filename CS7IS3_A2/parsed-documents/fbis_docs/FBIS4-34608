A total of 85 percent of domestic operations have been suspended and the economic effects of the strike are already being felt. Here is Jaime Garcia, chief of operations at the El Dorado International Airport in Santa Fe de Bogota, on the emergency plan that is being implemented today in the nation's airports. [Begin Garcia recording] The emergency plan in the airports is being implemented by some airlines that are cooperating to enable passengers to reach their destinations. The domestic airlines cooperating are Intercontinental de Aviacion and Islena de Aviacion, Satena, and there are a few Aires flights. [end recording] Intercontinental de Aviacion today covered its normal routes, that is, from Santa Fe de Bogota to Cali, Popayan, Barranquilla, and San Andres, among others, for a total of 19 daily flights. Likewise, there are 19 other flights from other cities to Santa Fe de Bogota. Islena de Aviacion is operating special routes from Santa Fe de Bogota to Cali, Medellin, and San Andres. Nevertheless, 80 percent of the nation's passengers travel on Avianca, and this company does not have agreements for the transfer of passengers. Therefore, if you have an Avianca ticket and decide to travel on another airline, you will most likely have to purchase a new ticket. Meanwhile, Ases and Avianca announced they have hired foreign pilots to fly their international routes.
