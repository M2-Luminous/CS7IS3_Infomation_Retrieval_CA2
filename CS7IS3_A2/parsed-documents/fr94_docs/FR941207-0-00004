FR941207-0-00004 FR941207-0-00001 DOD has identified two problems that are encountered by an employee whose coverage under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3) ends during the leave year. Some of these employees face forfeiting ``use or lose'' annual leave at the end of the leave year at the new installation because they are unable to show any evidence of advance scheduling of annual leave. Other employees request that a ``restored'' annual leave account be established at the time of their transfer or the completion of the realignment of the DOD installation, even though accrued annual leave is not subject to forfeiture until the end of the leave year. Under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d), excess annual leave cannot be considered for restoration until after the end of the leave year in which it is forfeited. An employee whose coverage under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3) ends late in the leave year may find it impossible to schedule all annual leave that would be subject to forfeiture before the end of the leave year. DOD has requested that OPM amend §630.308 to allow agencies to consider restoration of annual leave forfeited at the end of the leave year to an employee whose coverage under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3) ends during the leave year if the employee can demonstrate a correlation between the lack of advance scheduling and coverage under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3). OPM agrees that such annual leave may be considered for restoration. We have revised the regulations to require affected employees to make a reasonable effort to comply with the advance scheduling requirement in 5 CFR 630.308(a). However, the head of the agency may exempt employees from the advance scheduling requirement if the employee can show that he or she was covered by 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3) during the leave year and that he or she was unable to comply with the scheduling requirement due to circumstances beyond his or her control. Although an employee may be exempt from the advance scheduling requirement, this does not guarantee that the employee's excess annual leave will be restored, since there may have been sufficient time to schedule and use his or her annual leave before the end of the leave year. Annual leave restored to the employee for the current leave year is subject to the time limitations established in 5 CFR 630.306(a). Waiver of Notice of Proposed Rule Making and Delay in Effective Date Sections 341 and 2816 of Public Law 103&hyph;337, which broadened coverage under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3), were effective on October 5, 1994. In order to give practical effect to this legislation, I find good cause exists to waive the general notice of proposed rulemaking pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B). Also, I find that good cause exists for making this rule effective in less than 30 days. The delay in the effective date is being waived to give affected employees the benefit of these new provisions. Regulatory Flexibility Act I certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because they will affect only Federal agencies and employees.

The agency shall extend this period by 1 leave year for each additional 208 hours of excess annual leave or any portion thereof.
