"As I have repeatedly said, we are in close contact (with other Group of Seven nations) to take appropriate and timely measures," Fujii told a news conference after a morning cabinet meeting. Referring to the yen's rise to the 101 yen level against the dollar Monday in overseas markets, Fujii quoted market participants as saying the move stemmed from the German mark's strengthening. Asked about the impact of the yen's rise on Japan's economy, Fujii said, "As Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno and I have been saying at the Diet, the economy is moving toward a recovery, but the yen's rise is worrisome." Concerning falling stock and bond prices, Fujii said he wants to "watch for a while" and that he should refrain from commenting on day-by-day movements.
