Chinese sources said the speech, made on January 24 at a national meeting on propaganda work, provided the theoretical underpinning for a series of measures the administration would take to ward off socio-political instability. Mr Jiang, who is also party chief, disclosed that in the training of cadres, more emphasis would be put on raising their ideological purity as well as their total obedience to the edicts of patriarch Deng Xiaoping. The President said the national goal this year was "safeguarding political stability" and "maintaining the sustained, high-speed and healthy development of the national economy. All comrades in the party must clearly recognize this national situation, and obey and provide service to this national situation," Mr Jiang said. Reiterating a point of view that remnant Maoists had used against Mr Deng, Mr Jiang said the leadership must guard against "one hand being relatively strong, and the other hand being relatively weak". This is a reference to the fact that radical reformists such as ousted party chief Zhao Ziyang had concentrated on developing the economy while neglecting ideological indoctrination and "the dictatorship of the proletariat". Mr Jiang urged the propaganda and media workers to "provide a correct guidance to public opinion. They [propaganda and media cadres] must insist on making good propaganda about the line, goals, and policies of the party," he said. "In political matters they must remain in unison with the Party Centre." A large segment of the address was devoted to the propagation of a new generation of cadres who would be loyal to the party and to Marxism. He called upon central and provincial leaders to ensure that their officials would be "armed with the theoretical weapon" called Deng Thought. He also called upon regional leaders to use two to three years to provide training in Deng Thought to lower- level cadres. Special attention should be paid to the education of staff in the ideological, propaganda and media fields, Mr Jiang said. He urged leaders of various levels to show concernto these staffers "from the point of view of politics, ideology, work and lifestyle". A Chinese source said in terms of its stress on Marxist orthodoxy, Mr Jiang's address was on a par with speeches made by the leadership soon after the Tiananmen Square massacre. They said Beijing had worked out plans to combat "de-stabilising factors" in the sensitive period that stretches from the opening of the National People's Congress this week to the fifth anniversary of the June 4 crisis. More state-security agents have been deployed to keep surveillance not only on dissidents but on "trouble-makers" in state factories, many of which are not paying full salaries. The media has been told to avoid reporting on "negative" news.
