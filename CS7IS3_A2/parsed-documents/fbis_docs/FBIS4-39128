"At present, the Ukrainian parliament must first of all consider economic issues," leader of the presidential service on foreign policy Anton Buteiko declared in his interview with the agency INTERFAX-Ukraine Thursday [2 June]. In his opinion, "Kiev fulfills the treaty's demands striving for a non-nuclear status" without joining the NPT Treaty. On 1 June Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk submitted a draft decree on Ukraine joining the NPT Treat to the parliament for consideration. According to the project, "presence of nuclear weapons on the Ukrainian territory till its complete destruction does not contradict the Treaty." In addition, Kiev intends to view "the violation of the territorial integrity and inviolability of its border on the part of any nuclear state" as a violation of the NPT [Non-Proliferation] Treaty. Kravchuk is once more addressing the parliament with a proposal to join the treaty. On 3 February this year Ukraine's parliament expressed its intention to consider this problem in the future.
