[see item LD0905163994 in previous Terrorism Report] The unofficial nature of this report prevents the officials of the Foreign Ministry to question officially the Lebanese Government on this issue. Following the arrest of Samir Ja'ja', SALAM carried a commentary discussing the responsibility of the Lebanese Government at a time when it has gained relative control over the affairs of its country. The commentary underlined the need to clarify the fate of the Iranian hostages. The Iranian ambassador in Beirut also met with Lebanese officials to discuss the issue. Public opinion and the concerned families of the Iranian hostages are anticipating an answer from a government which has undertaken the affairs of Lebanon. Basically speaking, with increased control by the Lebanese Government over various areas and especially over Beirut, it is only natural for the [Israelis] to have considered it dangerous -- security-wise -- to look after the Iranian diplomats who were taken hostage. It is possible though, that the Iranian hostages were taken from the very start to occupied Palestine and directly questioned by the Zionists. The Israelis were confident that with the border conflicts and their presence in South Lebanon, they too would have hostages. Thus, they considered the exchange of the valuable Iranian hostages for other hostages as one of the solutions. At any rate, it is now the duty of the Lebanese Government to clearly state that the Iranian hostages are being held captive by the Zionists. Following this step by the Lebanese Government, ways for freeing the Iranian hostages from the clutches of the Zionists will be found.
