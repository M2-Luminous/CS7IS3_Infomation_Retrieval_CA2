South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha said in Pretoria that the group was analyzing the situation and had initiated multiparty negotiations. He said differences between the opposing military factions appeared to involve more than a dispute on salary increases. A report is to be submitted to the governments of the working group countries this weekend, and the foreign ministers of the three countries will probably meet on Monday to discuss the report.
