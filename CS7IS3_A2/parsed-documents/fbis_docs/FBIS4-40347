Some of the Georgian parliamentary deputies assert that the Russian paratroops have been bought by the Abkhazians and, therefore, cannot act as peacekeepers. [Unidentified correspondent] The peacekeeping operation in Abkhazia has been postponed until 26 June. This was stated by Shevardnadze at a meeting of the parliamentary majority before parliament started work. The opinion of the opposition deputies differs markedly from Shevardnadze's point of view about the introduction of peacekeeping forces into Abkhazia. In an interview for Georgian television Shevardnadze condemned the actions of the opposition and described them as an attempt to wreck the peacekeeping operation. Shevardnadze expressed confidence in the success of the peace process, the first stage of which, the return of refugees to Gali Rayon, will begin in the next few days.
