He explained that the measures that the Israeli Government has adopted so far are mere worthless formalities. In a news conference he held this afternoon, 'Abd-Rabbuh asserted that the Palestinian leadership wishes the peace process to continue and the negotiations to succeed but at the same time it believes that several major requirements need to be met to guarantee the success of this political process. He announced that the foremost requirement is providing protection and security for the Palestinian people against the terrorists among the Israeli settlers. 'Abd-Rabbuh said that the Palestinian leadership will continue its contacts with all the concerned parties, namely the UN Security Council, the United States, Russia, and the EU in order to fulfill the necessary conditions to resume the negotiations. The Palestinian official said that the current circumstances do not encourage the resumption of the negotiations because if they were resumed they would remain under the threat of the Israeli settlers' armed terrorism, particularly in the absence of any effective deterrent by the Israeli Government. He pointed out that the measures and methods employed by the Israeli Army against the Palestinian citizens who were protesting the Hebron massacre caused many of them to be martyred and dozens to be wounded. He added that the Israeli Government is still adopting limited and nominal measures against a small number of settlers but is using mass punishment against the Palestinians in the occupied territories, such as imposing total curfew and allowing the army to fire at them. 'Abd-Rabbuh said that Israel's disarming of five settlers is a measure that cannot convince anyone that it wishes to provide protection for the Palestinian people, especially when the Palestinians see large numbers of armed settlers walking about in their towns and villages. 'Abd-Rabbuh added that there seems to be a consensus about having international presence in the occupied territories and said this has now become an urgent demand in order to reassure the Palestinians that they will be safe from further violence.
