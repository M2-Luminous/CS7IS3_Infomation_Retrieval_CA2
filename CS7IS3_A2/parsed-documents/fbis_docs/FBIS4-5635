Military sources at the border said the Khmer Rouge forces had seized Highway Nos. 10 and 5 which were the main supply lines for the government troops to Pailin from Battambang and Banteay Meanchey before moving into Pailin yesterday evening. Details of the fighting remained sketchy last night. But the sources claimed the Phnom Penh force suffered heavy casualties and damage from the assault by the guerrillas. Several government tanks were seized by the guerrillas as ground troops were sent in "disarray" by the attacks, the sources claimed. Thai military officers claimed last night at least 15 Phnom Penh soldiers fled across the border into Ban Phakkat of Chanthaburi's Pong Namron district last night. [Bangkok THE NATION in English on 13 April carries a report on page 1 that adds: "Sixteen Cambodian government soldiers were among a group of Cambodian border residents driven into the Thai soil after fighting in Pailin yesterday, prompting rumours that the gem- rich town in western Cambodia might have been recaptured by the Khmer Rouge. ["The Thai military could not immediately confirm border sources' reports that most of the soldiers, who crossed into Thailand's Chanthaburi province, were senior officers. ["The sources reported heavy fighting around Pailin over the past week. ["`The fact that senior Phnom Penh army officers fled to Thailand indicates that the Khmer Rouge have made significant advance or even have recaptured the town,' the communist faction's biggest headquarters, one source said. ["Army sources said they could not immediately confirm the border reports, but noted that Phnom Penh forces in Pailin had faced serious logistic problems because food supplies could be sent only by airborne methods."]
