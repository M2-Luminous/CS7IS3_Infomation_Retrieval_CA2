For this reason, 33 soldiers have been sent to Belet Uen to guard the German camp and the convoys, it is reported in the Friday edition of BILD-ZEITUNG, citing an internal situation report by the Defense Ministry. "Isolated criminal acts and bandit activities" against the UN troops in Somalia have risen in the last few days, the newspaper quotes the report as saying. There are ever more deliberate provocations of members of the UN troop contingent. According to BILD-ZEITUNG, attacks on the German camp were also increasing. In the last two weeks alone there have been at least five instances of Somalis trying to enter the German camp and get onto the airfield. The Bundeswehr guards fired warning shots on several occasions. [Hamburg DPA in German at 0931 GMT on 31 December reports: "A spokesman for the Defense Ministry has rejected the BILD-ZEITUNG report that the 33 additional soldiers were sent to Belet Uen only because of the recent shooting at Bundeswehr soldiers in Mogadishu. Within the framework of the exchange of German soldiers in Somalia, 33 additional soldiers were sent as early as 20 December to increase safety levels and to reinforce the contingent for its withdrawal, the Defense Ministry spokesman told DPA in Hamburg on Friday."]
