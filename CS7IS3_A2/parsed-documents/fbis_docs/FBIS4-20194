According to a straw poll, there are now at least 280 -- perhaps as many as 310 -- certain "yes" votes (of the necessary 260) in the European Parliament in favor of new EU [European Union] members, and it is as good as certain that the Parliament really will vote on the issue in May. A major uncertainty factor in the tough timetable necessary to bring Sweden into the EU in 1995 now seems to have been removed. After the Tuesday and Wednesday meetings and debates at the European Parliament, it is as good as certain that the Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish, and Austrian membership agreements will be added to the agenda and voted on in May. The Christian Democrats -- the Parliament's second biggest party -- decided Tuesday evening that the issue should be raised for discussion in May. The socialists did not hold their meeting until Wednesday evening but earlier that day their group leader, Jean-Pierre Cot, estimated that at least 130 of the almost 200 socialist deputies were in favor of raising the matter for discussion in May. It is true that there are no guarantees that there will be a sufficient number of "yes" votes in support of enlargement (at least 260 out of a total of 518) when the matter is voted on, but the party groupings' latest straw poll says that there are at least 280, perhaps 310, who intend to vote "yes."
