According to the same sources, Moslem forces fired from infantry arms, grenade launchars, snipers and mortars on the Serbian districts of Sarajevo -- Grbavica, Dobrinja one and Dobrinja four, Lukavica, Nedjarice, Ilidza, Vogosca and Rajlovac. It is further said that Moslems have renewed attacks on the Serbian settlement of Zlatiste near Sarajevo, trying to cut off traffic between Sarajevo and Pale, the political and military headquarters of Bosnian Serbs in the vicinity of the capital city of the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Intensified Moslem attacks have also been registered in the region of Doboj, Ozren, Maglaj and Zavidovici, while Moslem armed provocations persisted near the Teslic, Vlasic, Gradac and Trebava battlefields (central Bosnia-Herzegovina). There is no peace either in the region of Gorazde, a Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina which has been under U.N. protection, where Moslem forces persist with their attacks on neighbouring Serbian towns of Foca, Cajnice and Ustikolina. Moslem units in the region of Kladanj and Kalesija, in eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina, also continued their artillery-infantry operations against the Serbian side, Bosnian Serb sources said.
