Doctors decided to prevent him from receiving visitors because of his extreme exhaustion. 'Arafat felt exhausted after his return from visits to Algeria and Mauritania but he forced himself to receive a U.S. Senate delegation yesterday morning. After the delegation departed the PLO headquarters, 'Arafat went up to his private apartment on the second floor. Several Tunisian and Palestinian doctors were promptly summoned to 'Arafat's residence and he was given a physical examination plus several laboratory tests. The doctors gave strict orders banning visits to 'Arafat and advised him to get total rest.
