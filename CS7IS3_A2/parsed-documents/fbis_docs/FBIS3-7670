Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri said the note sent by the UNHCR thanked Thailand for temporarily granting the refugees shelter during fighting in Cambodia. [Begin recording] [Prasong, in progress] ... I cannot figure out. When he was here, Prince Sirivut did not say a thing to me concerning that. I explained to him our policy -- we have no centers for the refugees; we allow them here for a short period of time and they must return when there is calm. The UNHCR should consult with the Cambodian Government and arrange things together. There is a large area in Cambodia. If they plan an offensive, they should prepare a site to which their people could be moved. [End recording] Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan said that the action taken by Thailand was not an abuse nor did it contradict international norms. Thailand provided shelter for refugees who crossed into the country and sent them back when the situation improved. Those people were sent back on a voluntary basis. The spokesman of the Prime Minister's Office added that the foreign minister had reported to the cabinet about the repatriation of refugees and said it was carried out under government policy. The refugees were sent to a safe area on a voluntary basis. He also noted that he already made everything clear to the Cambodian foreign minister. As for a report about the United Nations expressing concern about the issue, he said he had made a clarification to the United Nations and offered to provide facilities to it if it wishes to be here to take care of the refugees. Commenting on this subject, Defense Minister General Wichit Sukmak said that Thailand generally is praised for its help for the distressed. Thailand upholds its commitment to the UN principles. He said the United Nations should take the refugees with it if it wants to protest against Thailand.
