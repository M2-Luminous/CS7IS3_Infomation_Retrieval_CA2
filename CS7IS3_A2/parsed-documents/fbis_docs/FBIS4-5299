At a time when the pace of social innovation is said to have slowed to a sluggish crawl, expectations are high that the multimedia field will spawn a new, next-generation industry. According to the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications' January report, Toward the Creation of a New Information Industry, by the year 2010, the market that will be created (in video programming, new television services, and terminal units) as a result of optical fiber networks will generate no less than an estimated 56 trillion yen. Related markets (including existing markets for terminal equipment and software) will grow to 67 trillion yen, bringing the total by the year 2010 to 123 trillion yen. Optical fiber networks will also create new jobs for an estimated 2.4 million workers, to account for about 3.6 percent of Japan's workforce, which is expected to reach 27 million by 2010. But will multimedia really take root in Japan? On 12 January [1994], Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation president, Masashi Kojima, announced "NTT's Basic Ideas for the Multimedia Age." The report touched on the following four points, among others: 1) in February 1994, NTT is expected to set up a multimedia promotion desk; 2) in September 1994, it will inaugurate a high-speed, wideband pilot backbone network (for intracompany office automation [OA] transmissions); 3) from 1995, it will begin pilot multimedia services for general residential use, and 4) it will attempt to lower the cost for customers wanting to access optical fiber networks. The advent of a multimedia society, though often discussed, is an idea that belonged to the world of fantasy in the past. But with the recent announcement of the basic idea by NTT, Japan's core information communications enterprise, that fantasy world seems capable of becoming reality. Related industries--in communications, broadcasting, cable television, computer games, home electronics, printed news, and publishing--are all keeping their eyes on NTT's movements. Last October, when one of the regional Bell telephone companies, Bell Atlantic, announced plans to purchase the foremost cable television company, Tele-Communications, Inc. [TCI], there was suddenly a multimedia boom in the United States. NTT's announcement is comparable to that of Bell Atlantic. A closer look at NTT's multimedia plans would show that: 1. The role of its multimedia promotion desk is to a) collect data from all parts of the world about trends in information communications, b) formulate NTT's basic strategies, c) set up a pilot office to handle business matters, and d) establish an intracompany multimedia organizational structure. Rather than engage directly in business activities, the promotion desk will be responsible for preparing the way for NTT to go into the multimedia business. 2. The pilot high-speed, wideband backbone network will put NTT's existing nationwide, intracompany OA net into routine, practical use. NTT will set up new super-high-speed ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) switch nodes for existing optical fiber networks at each of its bases (10 main cities, including Tokyo and Osaka) and test high-volume, ultra-high-speed transmissions of 2.4 gigabits (1 Gb = 1 billion bits) per second and 10 gigabits per second, as well as develop network applications and operational technology. The backbone network will be linked to university research institutes and hospitals, etc., and be used for LAN [local area network] communications and trial transmissions of high-volume data files. Also to be tested are multimedia communications with user participation. 3. In pilot multimedia projects aimed at the average household, a model residential area will be designated and projects carried out in cooperation with cable television companies (with NTT leasing lines to them) and information providers [IP] (companies providing information services). Optical fiber cables will be laid in the designated areas to bring interactive television into households -- videos-on-demand (where users can see programs or films of their choice anytime they want), home-study courses, communication games (electronically distributed computer games) -- through a merger of cable television and the telephone. 4. NTT is aiming to lower the cost of optical access circuits into homes by the year 2000 or 2005 to levels comparable to current copper wiring. Important Not To Lose Out to the United States Behind NTT's decision to announce its multimedia plans at this time, we see several factors: tie-ups have been occurring between U.S. regional Bell companies and cable television companies, the United States has been witnessing a multimedia boom, and U.S. and British information communications companies are expanding into a global operation. Moreover, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, the agency overseeing activities in this area, has been favorable to the aggressive stance NTT is taking in its field. By way of background, U.S. cable television and telephone companies began investing in cable companies in Japan in 1993. That was the year TCI tied up with Sumitomo Corporation and invested in Suginami Cable Television. The second-ranking cable company in the United States, Time Warner, tied up with Itochu and invested in Cable Vision 21, a Fukuoka city cable company. And Nynex Corporation, another regional Bell company, tied up with Tomen Corporation and invested in a Yokohama television station. Even before these tie-ups, regional Bell companies -- US West, Nynex, Southwestern Bell, and Pacific Telesis -- were making their way into the British cable television field. If NTT were to sit quietly by watching these developments, there was a chance it would be left behind by multimedia trends in other advanced countries. No doubt it was also moved to hurry its multimedia strategy along from a sense that the multimedia industry in the United States would overpower Japan's own multimedia and cable industries. NTT's plans with regard to multimedia as a business, however, end with its building fiber optic networks and providing circuit services to users, those in the cable television field and IP's. It is not, apparently, to enter into program production or the field of terminal equipment. Although NTT announced in January [1994] that it had invested in General Magic, a company that boasts the best technology in communications software development anywhere, the aim behind this tie-up is to build a communications network that can easily be linked up to the next generation of information terminals. As multimedia gains in popularity, what form can we expect to see it take in Japan? First of all, we can probably expect to see it catching on with businesses and in the office rather than the average household. In the United States, cable television is already widely subscribed to and the expectation is that it be equally popular among businesses as in the home. This is not so in Japan's case. For business use, we can imagine, for example, several enterprises, though located apart from each other, all watching the same screen to come up with joint designs for machinery and parts. The same with posters. Revisions and changes can be worked out on the spot, even though the client and advertising firm are in different locations. We can also expect video conferencing to take place, bringing a greater sense of proximity and immediacy to users than is now possible. Among its many other possibilities, multimedia might also be used in employee education and the introduction of new products within companies. Japan's Technology Is Best in World NTT's optical communications technology is the best in the world. Though still in the experimental stage, during the autumn of 1993, NTT succeeded in 100 gigabit per second optical transmissions, thus setting a world record for speed. Neither AT&T nor BT (British Telecom) has as yet rivaled NTT in carrying out such ultra-high-speed transmissions. When it tests its backbone network this September [1994] with optical transmissions of 2.4 gigabits per second and 10 gigabits per second, NTT will again be setting a world speed record. Even AT&T is only now at the stage where it will start testing transmissions this year of 2.4 gigabits per second. In size, Japan has the second-largest communications and terminal equipment markets in the world, and those in the communications industry in other major countries, including the world's leading manufacturers, are eager to enter these markets. As indicated earlier, the process has already begun, with U.S. cable companies entering Japan's cable business. Also occurring more frequently are tie-ups between Japanese and U.S. manufacturers for the development of next-generation information terminals (to handle a mix of voice, data, and images at high speeds). Cases in point include tie-ups between Apple Computer and Sharp, Microsoft and Toshiba, and AT&T and NEC. In the area of multimedia games, tie-ups have also occurred between Microsoft and Sega Enterprises, Silicon Graphics and Nintendo, and AT&T and Matsushita. NTT, however, seems to be working as a kind of deterrent for foreign communications, cable companies, and manufacturers, somewhat tempering the ambitions of foreign companies toward Japan's markets. In addition to its strength in terms of technical development and ability to create a national network, it is a business enterprise backed by some 58 million telephone subscribers. Parenthetically, U.S. and British communications companies are said to have made a clean sweep on the European continent, capturing its markets in data and mobile communications. Leading U.S. cable companies are very powerful. TCI and Time Warner link their respective operating regions together by satellite to broadcast programs throughout the United States. TCI has 13 million subscribers nationwide. Moreover, wideband cable networks are continuing to grow. One reason is that cable companies, while having monopolistic management rights in their regions, are not under fee restrictions. Satellite communication is also growing. The national character, which seems to indicate a liking for direct visual media, as testified by the world preeminence of U.S. television and film industries, can be considered a factor as well. Thus, as of the present, U.S. software and know-how to create programs are far more advanced than Japan's. On the other hand, the United States is behind in modernizing (digitalizing, opticalizing) its regional telephone networks -- one of the aftereffects of AT&T's breakup. Although the Clinton administration is pushing the idea of building an information highway and regional Bell companies are putting their efforts into modernizing their present communications networks, there will not be enough wideband networks to be sufficient for multimedia. Regional Bell companies do, however, have more funds at their disposal than cable companies and are moving to buy up the latter and acquire their wideband networks and through these networks to go into multimedia services. In Japan, the work of modernizing networks is progressing not only in the long-distance communications field, but in regional communications as well. The conversion of subscriber circuits to optical fiber in central Tokyo is slated for completion by 1995 and in the business districts of large cities like Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya by 1997. Also slated for completion are optical fiber networks for suburban residential areas by the year 2010 or 2015. In contrast to the progress that is being made in modernizing its telephone networks, Japan is behind when it comes to developing wideband cable television networks. The reason is that cable companies until now have operated within local, administrative units such as municipal districts. At the end of fiscal 1992, of the 123 municipal cable companies (accounting for 1.075 million subscriber households), only 24 (roughly 20 percent) were operating in the black (if we include hard-to-reach reception areas, we are talking about some 56,437 cable television facilities and 8.34 million subscriber households). In December 1993, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications released a report, Measures for Developing CATV, with the aim of strengthening the management base of cable television companies, stimulating businesses to accommodate multimedia, and expanding wideband networks. Such aims depend mainly on plans to 1) expand the geographic scope of cable television enterprises; 2) move cable television companies toward the communications business; 3) put "model" pilot undertakings, like videos-on-demand, which accommodate the merger of communications and broadcasting, into operation; and 4) bring in the capital, technology and software know-how of foreign enterprises to foster the spread of cable television. In addition to the cost of investing in circuits, the cable television business has been troubled by the slow growth in subscriber numbers due to a lack of interesting programs. Though it has been possible for cable companies to gain approval to enter the telecommunications business, there have been very few examples of this happening because of the heavy burden of investing in new equipment and facilities. Taking such circumstances into account, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications seems to have set out on a course of nurturing the cable television industry, the goal being to improve management by effecting economies of scale in advertising, cable installation, the procurement of video programs, etc. In response to these new measures, two Nagoya cable television companies, Cable Network and Central Cable Television, announced their joint merger at the start of 1994. With roughly 300,000 subscribers, the newly formed company will have the largest customer base in Japan. In the future, there is a strong possibility that cable television business interests will move in the direction of operating multiple CATV stations, which require large amounts of capital, in order to develop MSO (multiple system operator) companies. In the long term, we can expect to see more and more entries into the communications field through MSO's and greater regional communications competition. For cable television companies to begin offering multimedia services, however, it seems that for awhile they will have to rely on NTT circuits. It seems highly likely that it will be in this form -- using NTT's circuits -- that cable television companies will provide programs to their subscribers. The conversion of NTT's trunk line to an optical fiber network is already nearing completion. Putting Energy Into Developing Software With Japan being so much behind the United States in the software field, will there really be a multimedia boom in this country? Considering the high educational level of the Japanese, the emergence of all sorts of creative and original programs and commercial messages (CM) on broadcast television, and the extraordinary energy that has been thrown into applied technology and the creation of commercial products in the past, the development of programs and software to meet demands seems quite possible. Again, with Japan's preeminence in optical technology both as it relates to hardware and transmissions, the construction of the next generation of optical fiber communication networks is steadily moving ahead. Timely investments and detailed studies of demand are important in building optical fiber networks; however, when the important factors are considered, it seems very likely that the future, as seen in mid-range terms, will hold for Japan the flowering of multimedia.
