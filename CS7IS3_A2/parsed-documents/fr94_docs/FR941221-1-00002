FR941221-1-00002 FR941221-1-00001 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;187&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 747 Series Airplanes Equipped With Pratt & Whitney Model JT9D Series Engines (Excluding Model JT9D&hyph;70 Engines) AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes. This proposal would require modification of the nacelle strut and wing structure, inspections and checks to detect discrepancies, and correction of discrepancies. This proposal is prompted by the development of a modification of the strut and wing structure that improves the fail-safe capability and durability of the strut-to-wing attachments, and reduces reliance on inspections of those attachments. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent failure of the strut and subsequent loss of the engine. DATES: Comments must be received by February 16, 1995. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;187&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.
