This statement was made yesterday to HA'ARETZ by Fatah member Sufiyan Abu-Zayida in reaction to a report by security elements on the emerging cooperation between Fatah Hawks squads and Hamas. "In their press interviews, Dr. Ibrahim Yazuri and Khalid al-Hindi have encouraged the Fatah Hawks to act against Israelis," said Abu-Zayida, the PLO liaison with the Israeli authorities. Yesterday he was mentioned as one of the young leaders who have lost control over the Hawks. "It stands to reason that if they meant to forge such cooperation, they would not run to the press with their remarks of encouragement. In my opinion, this is just a guess on the part of the Shin Bet." [passage omitted] A senior officer said yesterday that the experimental period in which the pursuit of Fatah members was discontinued in return for their stopping all terrorist activity failed and therefore was called off.
