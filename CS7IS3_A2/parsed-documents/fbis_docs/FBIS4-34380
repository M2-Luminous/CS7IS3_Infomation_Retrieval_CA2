The president is partly responsible, perhaps more than partly because he heads the government, but to his excellency's responsibility should be added that of those -- in Congress or in sectors of the bureaucratic machinery -- who wish to reattribute to the public sector its former prevalence over the private sector. It is this wish that explains the campaign, which we could call a form of terrorism, that has just begun to take shape and will reach a climax during the period immediately preceding and following the implementation of the real. The executive branch views entrepreneurs as people who evade taxes, create cartels, and abusively increases prices. To fight tax evasion, the government uses the Federal Revenue Department, the behavior of which clearly reflects the mentality of the highest bureaucratic spheres of Brasilia: A tax collection goal has been established, and it must be achieved at any price. Control was first intensified, and there is nothing wrong with that; on the contrary. As this was not strong enough and the current laws -- no matter how strict or lax -- did not achieve the desired target, a provisional measure was drafted to transform what was a crime into a tort [ilicito civil]. This provisional measure also established that those who collect taxes or social contributions and who subsequently do not transfer them to the Treasury or the Social Security Ministry will be sentenced to 90 days in jail. Fear of being arrested, however, probably will not result in increased revenues. The government now wishes to make credit and debt operations a triangular operation: If A has a debt with the Federal Treasury and is owed some money by B, the Treasury will approach B and collect some of what he owes A. It is not important if this procedure clashes with the Fiscal Code or with good sense in general. It does not matter if this move removes B's "privilege" of not paying his debt to A on the day it becomes due or if it extracts the resources A needs to finance his company, the Federal Revenue department has money to collect from A and will get it from B. Legally, everything is resolved through the provisional measure, which Congress will not bother to analyze because of its total lack of interest. The provisional measure will be redrafted as many times as the president and the Federal Revenue Department deem necessary. This is "Itamar's popular democracy." Control on economic activities is becoming stricter by the day. The recently sanctioned Antitrust Law has been defended as not having introduced anything new. It merely consolidates current laws, seeking to ensure free competition. It just so happens, however, that Delegated Law Number 4 and Law 8880/94 (which created the Real Value Unit -- URV) were not revoked. Both these laws prevent infractions against the economic order. The result of all that is that the Cade [Administrative council for Economic Defense] is preparing to control oligopolies (a key word meaning activity against the people). It is also preparing to order the Sunab [National Supply Superintendency] to strictly enforce the law against store owners. The campaign slogan is a war against "abusive prices," the exact meaning of which no one seems to know, and the definition of which cannot be found in any law. The closest the government has come to explaining the characteristics of this "crime" is contained in an article of Law 8880, which states: "It is deemed abusive to unjustifiably increase prices to a level where the price equivalent in URV's is greater than the average increase registered from September to December 1993." Thus, the plan that did not freeze prices will punish those who cannot explain why their prices have gone up. Bureaucrats are not concerned about "unjustified increases," they are only concerned about "abusive increases" which can only be identified after comparing the current price to the September/December average price. To do so, no cost analysis is conducted. In other words, despite all that is being said about the market law, prices will remain frozen until guidelines to clarify this policy are released. Worse still is the government definition of an oligopoly. The executive branch believes an oligopoly is synonymous of a cartel and a situation where competition among companies that work in an area of business simply does not exist. A disinformation campaign against oligopolies has been continuing since [former] President Collor's installation. As a result, oligopolies have become cartels in all areas where there is no competition. The Cade will focus on those oligopolies and on the companies of the "highest concentration sectors." These two types of companies will not be allowed to increase their June prices beyond the September/December average. If they are lucky, their managers will manage to justify increases. If bureaucracy spots them, however, they will be charged with infractions against the economic order, fined, and forced to comply with the rules or run the risk of facing a warrant for preventive arrest. When the Real Plan is effectively implemented, Sunab and Cade will pursue those who abuse the people's patience -- and all this will happen without a price freeze and in the defense of free competition. This is just one more aspect of "Itamar's popular democracy," which is closing in on "speculators..."
