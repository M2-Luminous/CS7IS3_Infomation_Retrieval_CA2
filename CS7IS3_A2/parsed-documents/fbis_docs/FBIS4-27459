He said the state has established joint ventures with five out of the nearly 30 private banks, such as the Overseas Commercial Bank, the Cambodian Public Bank, Canadian Bank, and the Metropolitan Corporation Bank. In joint ventures with the private sector, some state-owned banks have a small share, while others have larger amounts. But in general, the shares of state banks are from the diversification of their immovable assets in proportion to their value, as agreed upon with each commercial bank. This state policy to halt joint ventures with private banks has already been promulgated by the NBC. However, the result of its implementation is not yet known. The NBC has withdrawn its capital from the private banks at the proposal of the Asian Development Bank [ADB]. The ADB has suggested that since the NBC is within the state structure, it does not need to establish other joint ventures with the private sector. The national bank should think only about improving its work and efficiency. This official added that the joint state-private banking system has been used in the last four to five years because the nation has moved from a centralized economy to a free market. This is because in the centrally-planned system, all banks, like the factories and enterprises nationawide, were under the control of the state, which would bear all their profits and losses. But since the political system has changed, the economy should also change likewise. It should be recalled that during the past few years, the NBC has generated income for the state amounting up to billions of riel annually. According to the private bank law, a private bank will be permitted to open a banking business only with a capital of $5 million upwards. Moreover, each bank, big or small, is duty-bound to pay the state 50 million riel annually as business tax. It is learned that as of 31 May this year, the NBC plans to stop allowing private-own commercial bank to open in Cambodia. However, there will be some special cases concerning private banks. That is, permission will be given only to the private banks from big countries such as the United States, Japan, France, Australia, and Canada.
