Radio Free Europe reported this evening that two Moslem soldiers were killed and four were wounded in Croat-Moslem clashes near Gornji Vakuf. Moslem Radio Sarajevo has not reported about Moslem-Croat clashes around Gornji Vakuf these days, but Croatian radio claims that the fighting is between two groups of smugglers. The Croatian radio did not say which side sustained casualties. Military sources of the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) have said that the HVO military police will try to seize the smugglers, who are said to have "abused the reached agreements on opening communications and are not refraining even from armed clashes." Bosnian Croats and Moslems signed an agreement on the forming of a Moslem-Croat federation in Washington in mid-March under strong pressure from the United States. The federation Constitution has already been adopted but clashes between the two peoples continue. Serbs, the third nation who live in this former Yugoslav republic were not invited to the Washington talks.
