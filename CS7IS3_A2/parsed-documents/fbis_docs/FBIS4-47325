Denisenko and O.A. Stetsenko; UDC 621.391.81] [Abstract] Both spectral and correlation characteristics of nonlinearly frequency-modulated pulse signals are comprehensively examined, nonlinear rather than linear frequency modulation being necessary for perfect shaping of compressed signals. For specificity are considered a pulse signal u(t)= Re [U(t)exp(j_o_[.sub]0[/]t)] and power-law frequency modulation _o_(t)= _o_[.sub]d[/](2|t|/_t_[.sub][/])[.sup]p[/]sign(t): t- time, |t| � _t_[.sub]i[/]/2, _o_(0)- carrier frequency, _t_[.sub]i[/]- pulse duration, U(t)= U[.sub]0[/]exp(j_ps_t)- complex envelope with amplitude U[.sub]0[/] and phase _ps_(t), _o_[.sub]d[/]- frequency deviation, p- power exponent, sign(t)- sign function. Analytical expressions are derived for the spectral density S(_o_) and the correlation function R(_t_) of such signals. The continuous phase _ps_(t) in the expression for the spectral density is approximated is approximated with a piecewise-constant function coinciding at discrete time intervals _D_t= |g[.sub]i[/]/2N and the phase difference _ps_(t)- _ps_(t- _t_) in the expression for the correlation function is made approximately equal to _t__o_(t). For a numerical analysis, S(_o_) and R(_t_) are normalized to S(0) and R(0) respectively. Calculation for p < 1 and for p > 1 including p= 1 confirm that within the _o_ � |g[.sub]d[/] frequency range the signal spectrum is almost uniform when p= 1 (linear frequency modulation) and nonuniform when p < 1 or p > 1, with the maximum spectral density S at frequencies near _o_[.sub]d[/] when p < 1 and near _o_= 0 when p > 1. The farther p is from 1, moreover, the higher and narrower is the S(_o_)/S(0) peak. Figures 5.
