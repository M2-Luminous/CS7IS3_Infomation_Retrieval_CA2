He said that postponement of the meeting, which was supposed to take place in the second half of March, was due to special circumstances concerning officials in Egypt. In a statement to MENA, Dr. al-Majali called for Arab reconciliation, saying that Jordan sincerely extends its hand to Arab brothers for solidarity. He said: I think that this matter is very essential, especially as there is a system being worked out for the region, and we are afraid that it will be worked out without consulting us. This will not be to our advantage. Therefore, we must have Arab understanding and solidarity, and determine the system acceptable to us in the region. Regarding the peace negotiations, the Jordanian prime minister pointed out that the resumption of the Arab-Israeli peace negotiations in Washington must take place following agreement by the Arab countries concerned. Jordan cannot adopt a separate decision in this regard. He said that this subject might be discussed on the sidelines of the meetings of the Arab League foreign ministers council currently being held in Cairo. He emphasized that no date has been set for a meeting of the Arab states concerned with the peace process. Answering a question, Dr. al-Majali denied that any prior arrangements had been made for a Jordanian-Saudi summit meeting during King Husayn's visit to Saudi Arabia for the minor pilgrimage. He said that the Jordanian monarch's visit was only to perform this religious rite.
