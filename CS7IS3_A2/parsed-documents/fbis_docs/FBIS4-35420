Otherwise, foreign interference in Yemeni affairs--against the will of its people and government--will complicate the crisis and make it impossible to be resolved. Sanaa has accepted a cease-fire on the condition that the declaration of secession by Aden be abrogated and the unity of the Yemeni people be preserved. This is an objective, courageous, and responsible position on the part of Sanaa, and one that all Arab countries and international organizations, including the Security Council, should support. If the interference by some Arab and foreign countries seeks to internationalize the Yemeni crisis in order to encourage and entrench the secession of the south, this is something that conflicts completely with Arab League and UN Charters, and at the same time conflicts and ignores the will of the Yemeni people. Halting this destructive war and resorting to fraternal and constructive dialogue between the north and the south, rather than the exchange of destructive missiles and shells, is a national, pan-Arab, and humanitarian demand that both sides should accept on the basis of emphasizing legitimacy and national unity, not entrenching secession. The Security Council is currently facing a difficult test, and we hope that it will adopt just resolutions which respect the legitimacy and unity of the Yemeni people and their territorial integrity, and not encourage the separatist tendency of a handful of secessionists who deviate from the brotherly Yemeni people's will in the north and the south. We would like to remind the Security Council that UN involvement in resolutions of the crises in Somalia, former Yugoslavia, and other past and current crises did not solve these crises but aggravated them in a more dangerous manner than they had been the case before internationalization. We also want remind Arab brothers in all Arab countries that unity was the choice of the Yemeni people and the consensus of the leaders and masses in the north and south, and this official and popular choice should not be snubbed.
