Macro-Trends 1) The State of Sino-Japanese Trade Sino-Japanese trade has been growing steadily in the last few years. In 1992, at a time when Japan was mired in recession, when its trade with the United States and Europe barely held steady in the first half of the year and its exports to South Korea actually fell, Sino-Japanese trade shot up to almost $30 billion, after breaking the $20 billion barrier in 1991. According to a trade statistical bulletin issued by the Japanese Ministry of Finance, Sino-Japanese trade amounted to a historic high of $28,903,000,000 in 1992, a gain of 26.7 percent from 1991. Specifically, Japan exported $11,957,000,000 worth of goods to China, up 39.2 percent compared to a year ago, and imported $16,946,000,000 worth of products from China, up 19.2 percent, with Japan running a deficit of $4,989,000,000, off 11.4 percent from the deficit of $5,627,000,000 in 1991. In the first half of 1993, China became Japan's second largest trading partner. Sino-Japanese trade has continued its solid growth since the opening of 1993, totaling $7,628,000,000 in the first quarter, up 23.5 percent compared to the same period a year ago. Japanese exports to and imports from China amounted to $3,396,000,000 and $4,232,000,000, up 36 percent, up 36.3 percent and 14.9 percent, respectively, from the corresponding period a year ago, giving Japan a trade deficit of $836 million. If this trend holds up, Sino-Japanese trade may top $30 billion for all of 1993 and Japan's trade deficit will continue to narrow, possibly dipping below $3 billion for the entire year. Looking at the monthly data for the first quarter of 1993, Japan ran a deficit of $750 million in January, $50 million in February, and $40 million in March, down 29.7 percent from the same period in 1992. If China continues to import steel and electrical machinery from Japan at the current rates, it may run up a trade deficit with Japan in some months but will still end the year with a small surplus. At a time when China's monetary policy is being tightened and structural adjustment is under way, in particular, the momentum in steel and electrical machinery importation by China may be stalled, making a trade deficit less likely. 2) Sino-Japanese Trade: Commodity Mix Japan's imports from China in 1992 essentially consisted of the following: a) apparel, $4.85 billion, up 50.1 percent, 43.5 percent of total Japanese apparel imports by value and over 60 percent by volume; b) electronic products, $1.11 billion, up 34.9 percent. The growth in sound equipment exports such as radios and recorders was particularly striking, up 65.8 percent compared to the preceding year; 3) miscellaneous exports, also up sharply. In such categories as footwear, toys, and furniture, China has replaced South Korea as the top supplier to Japan. It is now the largest exporter to Japan of a lengthening list of products, accounting for 44 percent and 64.8 percent of total Japanese toy and umbrella imports, respectively. d) grain, oil, and foodstuff, up 20.6 percent. e) mineral-type fuels, down 3.4 percent from a year ago. Petroleum products imports plunged 37.5 percent, crude oil imports rose 1.2 percent to reach $1,791,000,000, and coal imports climbed 4.9 percent to hit $296 million. f) Raw materials imports fell 6.4 percent to $1.07 billion. Timber was the only gainer , up 20.2 percent. Otherwise steel imports fell 40.1 percent; cotton, down 46.7 percent; raw silk, down 55.1 percent between January and November; and silico-manganese, down 2.81 percent also between January and November. Chinese manganese exports to Japan will be badly hurt because of a decision by the Japanese Government to impose an anti-dumping tax on such exports. Japan's exports to China in 1992 consisted mainly of the following: a) Electronic exports rose 61.7 percent, 55.4 percent of total Japanese exports to China; b) transportation machinery, including automobiles, $1,163,000,000, up 111.7 percent from a year ago; c) steel, $1,474,000,000 in value, up 8 percent from a year ago, and 2.4 million tons in volume; d) textile products, $1,223,000,000, up 32 percent from 1991; e) plastics, up 17.4 percent; paper and paper products, up 35.3 percent; and records and tapes, up 144.4 percent. Judging from the state of Sino-Japanese trade, China has become a major market for Japanese exports. In 1992 Japanese exports to China amounted to $12.8 billion, 3.7 percent of total Japanese exports, making China Japan's seventh largest export market. Automobile and machinery exports practically doubled. Japanese imports from China continue to be dominated by grain, raw materials, coal, and petroleum, but machinery imports did show a gain. In the long haul, Japan would continue to see China as a market for its high-added-value products such as automobiles and electronic goods. 3) The Trends Of Japanese Investment in China a) Pattern of Japanese overseas investment Investment in China is a key component of direct overseas Japanese investment as a whole. The latter, in turn, is a product of the shift in Japan's trade orientation strategy prompted by trade conflicts between that country and the United States and Europe. Since recording its first trade surplus with the United States in 1965, Japan has waged an unbroken stretch of trade wars with the latter in such areas as textile products, iron and steel, automobile, and semi-conductor chips. Since 1980, the United States has been running a trade deficit with Japan in the tens of billions of dollars each year, accounting for between 40 and 60 percent of America's total foreign trade deficit, including a gap of $43.67 billion in 1992. Japan's trade surplus with West Europe zoomed past $20 billion barrier in 1987 and hit $31.1 billion in 1992, 60 percent of the foreign trade deficit of the European Community. Japan's overseas trade surplus rose 20 percent in the first half of 1993 compared to the same period a year ago. For Japan, the direct consequence of a massive trade surplus is the appreciation of the yen against the dollar, which has made Japanese products less competitive on the international market, which, in turn, has forced the manufacturing industry at home to shift operations overseas in a big way in favor of local production. Japan's overseas investment totalled $170 billion between 1986 and 1990 and reached $35 billion in 1992 alone. The lion share of direct Japanese overseas investment has gone to the United States. The resurgence of the U.S. manufacturing industry, including its success on the automobile, semi-conductor, and computer markets, has squeezed the rate of return of Japanese corporations operating in that country to the depressed level of 1 percent. Since 1990, in fact, some companies have been losing money, causing Japanese investment in the United States to head downward steadily since 1989. In contrast, Japanese enterprises in East Asia have been chalking up margins of profit exceeding 5 percent. Japanese investment in East Asia has been on the rise since 1990. In East Asia as a whole, China has considerable appeal to Japan as a place to invest mainly because it enjoys relative political stability, its economic reform has brought it closer to the international market, and it boasts ample manpower and raw materials, low prices, and a vast domestic market. According to the latest statistics, Chinese wages are almost one-twentieth those in Japan. Of all Japanese enterprises in China, 70 percent are making a profit, in contrast to the low-profit operations of Japanese companies in West Europe and North America. This has persuaded Japanese business to increase investment in China. The Ricoh Corporation has decided to move the entire production of its standard copiers to China. The Sanyo Electrical Company is also considering shifting to China the production of television sets, air-conditioners, refrigerators, and video-cameras. As of late 1992, the Chinese Government had approved 3,694 investment projects from Japan, with a negotiated investment of $5.97 billion, of which $3.88 billion were actually invested, 11.3 percent of all foreign investment in China. As Sino-Japanese trade expands, Japan's investment in China will continue to grow substantially, as indicated by the following: First, research on the Chinese market and economy is being taken seriously and the enthusiasm for investing in China is still going strong among large-, medium-sized, and small enterprises in Japan. There has been a marked increase in the number of large investment projects in China. Accordingly, economic and trade organizations along with banks and other institutions in Japan have all augmented their research offices and added staff to focus on changes in China's market and economy and the situation surrounding this huge potential consumer market. They regularly invite experts from the pertinent research organizations in China to visit Japan to brief them on China's economic reform and investment policy. A number of banks have also put together China tours for their customers so that they could get to understand China's investment climate, etc., on the spot. Second, investment consulting organizations have been set up specifically targeting the market in China. The Babaiban Group of Japan, a successful investor in the circulation sector in China, recently created a "China commercial investment club" in Tokyo. According to the group president, the investment climate in China is very good at the moment. China needs Japan's technology, experiences, and fund, so now is a good time for Japan to open up a new market in China. Babaiban plans to open 1,000 stores in China by the year 2010. As they see it, investing in the circulation business in China, where labor costs are low, requires little investment in terms of equipment. Even more important, China is a massive consumer market. On the other hand, investing in China also presents some problems, notably the following: First, Japanese investors have indicated that some large Japanese banks balk at making loans to small- and medium-sized companies which want to invest in China because it is too risky. This has dampened the interest of small- and medium-sized companies in investing in China. However, if the Bank of China would come forward to be the guarantor, the companies will find it easier to obtain credit. Second, there are signs of growing friction between Japanese companies in China and the Chinese side over such issues as the legal person status, the retention of foreign exchange, and the examination of their financial and accounting systems. Third, since 1992 there has been widespread concern among Japanese investors about the overheating of the Chinese economy which took place earlier and other problems like price increases and unstable exchange rates. Endless price increases and rising costs hurt the bottom line of joint ventures. Fourth, the investment policy is too arbitrary and secretive and there is an excess of administrative intervention. 2) Changes in the structure of Japanese investment in China Direct Japanese investment in Asia (including China) has changed in two remarkable ways since the latter half of 1980. First, within the manufacturing sector, investment in capital-intensive projects such as those in the electronic and automobile industries now accounts for a rising share of total investment. To encourage car-makers to invest in China, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] in Japan plans to hold regular meetings with the Chinese Government and the enterprises, the focus being the automobile industry. According to MITI estimates, China's annual automobile demand will reach 3 to 5 million vehicles by the year 2000 (1.3 million in 1992), most of them being family sedans. Japanese carmakers will gradually shift their operations from Europe and United States to China. Currently an excessive portion of total investment goes to the non-manufacturing sector. In the future, the center of gravity would gradually be shifted to the manufacturing sector. Second, investment in the tertiary industry has been rising relative to all investment. Japanese investment in the tertiary industry is concentrated in banking, commerce, and the restaurant trade. The well-known Babaiban Group, for instance, expects to open close to 1,000 commercial outlets in China by the year 2000. 2. Some Ideas on Expanding Sino-Japanese Trade and Investment 1) On Expanding Sino-Japanese Trade Despite the lingering recession in Japan and its diminished demand for imports, the appreciation of the yen and mounting pressure from the United States and Europe on Japan to open up its market bode well for boosting Chinese exports to Japan. Furthermore, the decision by Japan and the Coordinating Committee on Export Controls [COCOM] to lift the embargo on a growing number of products also makes it easier for China to import from Japan. However, there is concern in Japan's business community that measures of macroeconomic regulation and control taken by China to put the brakes on its overheated economy would worsen the foreign trade environment and public psychology. To pave the way for the resumption of China's membership in GATT, the renminbi may yet be devalued again. As part of its market diversification strategy and in order to reduce trade conflicts with the United States and Europe, China will increase its imports from those countries and South Korea, a move that will inevitably affect the share of imports from Japan. According to analyses, Chinese exports to Japan in 1993 will grow at the same rate as in 1992 while imports are not expected to increase as fast as in the preceding year. Sino-Japanese trade is projected to grow 20 percent or so in 1993, for a total value of $35 billion (Japanese customs figures). Specifically, Chinese exports to Japan will rise 15 percent to about $19.5 billion; imports will go up about 30 percent to hit $15.5 billion. With imports rising faster than exports, China's trade surplus with Japan will continue to shrink. Sino-Japanese trade is projected to break the $50 billion barrier by 1995, making China Japan's largest trading partner after the United States. To develop Sino-Japanese trade, we need to examine a few issues. a) Sino-Japanese trade and investment are an important part of economic and trade relations in Asia as a whole. A new international trading pattern is taking shape today, one characterized by growing economic regionalization. To turn its economy around and prompted by self-interests and strategic considerations, Japan is in the midst of refocusing its economic and trade strategy to East Asia. With its expanding economy and 1.1 billion people, China naturally has become Japan's primary target. It is important for them to further long-term cooperation and enter into a lasting complementary economic relationship. After establishing diplomatic ties and laboring for over 20 years, China and Japan have built a friendly cooperative relationship of mutual trust and complementariness. This complementary relationship will assume more prominence and the potential for developing bilateral economic and trade cooperation is vast. b) Trade disputes multiply and the anti-dumping issue must be faced up to. Nowadays protectionism is on the rise around the world. As Sino-Japanese trade grows rapidly, trade friction between the two countries may intensify. At a cabinet meeting on 29 January 1993, the Japanese Government decided to slap an anti-dumping tax on manganese imports from China, the first time Japan conducted an anti-dumping investigation and imposed an anti-dumping tax on a foreign commodity invoking the terms of GATT as well as its domestic tariff law. This move was also unprecedented in the history of Sino-Japanese trade. Already both the Japanese public and the government are deeply concerned that Chinese textile imports are entering Japan excessively. The possibility of a second anti-dumping investigation into a Chinese product cannot be ruled out. We should give this matter our full attention and come up with a response. No time should be wasted in formulating all pertinent laws and regulations to meet the new challenge. In addition, China should consider acting correspondingly with regard to certain import commodities. c) Enhance the competitiveness of export commodities and expand our share of the Japanese market. The Japanese market is ferociously competitive and highly demanding. Therefore it is imperative that we never stop researching and developing new commodities specifically with the changing characteristics of the Japanese market in mind. In particular we need to marry trade with science and technology to turn out more high added value products and make ourselves more competitive. In addition to ensuring the quality of Chinese products and broadening their variety and design, we need to stabilize the supply of merchandise long term and expand our exports to Japan. Recently many customers have complained that the quality of Chinese products has declined, deliveries are late, and export channels are disorderly. All of that should be taken seriously by the departments involved. d) Use imports to increase exports. As the needs of economic construction at home grow steadily, China will import significantly more steel, machinery, and automobiles from Japan in the future. Steel imports, in particular, are slated to rise sharply. It has been calculated that China imported over 100 million tons of steel from Japan, enough to build 20 Laihu bridges (at 600,000 tons per bridge), in the 20 years since the two countries normalized their relations. At a time when the Japanese economy is still in the doldrums and its currency is rising in value, hurting its exports, the role played by China's massive imports in economic growth in Japan is obvious. In accordance with the principle of equality and mutual benefit, therefore, China should continue to use imports to boost exports to Japan, including electronic casts, conventional machine tools, and coal. e) Develop new commodities and cultivate the Japanese market without cessation. Japan ran up a whopping $100 billion strong surplus in its foreign trade account in 1992, to the intense chagrin of the United States and countries in Europe which have repeatedly pressured Japan to open up its domestic market, even threatening to involve anti-dump provisions against Japan and limit imports from Japan. Japan has no alternative but to open up parts of its market in stages. This provides a good opportunity for Chinese products to make their way into the Japanese market. China has already acquired a wealth of experience in attracting Japanese capital and technology, improving packaging and design, and producing popular and marketable products with a high added value. By spotting and responding to trends and characteristics in the Japanese market, we must be ready to adjust our export strategy anytime, for example, by noting which commodities are going upscale, how uses are being coordinated, and what designs are becoming fashionable, and how improving packaging. 2) On Attracting Japanese Investment in China a) The energy sector may well become the largest recipient of Japanese capital, a conclusion drawn from changes in Japan's energy strategy. In the wake of the disintegration of the Soviet Union and changes in the Middle East, the energy community in Japan has begun adjusting both the form and the strategy of its energy trade. Instead of importing energy from abroad, which essentially constitutes the current Japanese energy policy, Japan is shifting to the development of energy resources overseas. Japan's trade associations and oil companies have begun petroleum prospecting overseas actively. Oil companies also are getting heavily involved in the liquefied natural gas market. "Self-financed oil field" is the term used by Japan to refer to an oil-field in which it has invested and whose crude oil output it shares with the oil-producing nation in accordance with a predetermined ratio. There is a fundamental difference between Japanese and American or European international oil capital: the Japanese petroleum community has no "self-financed oil fields" or crude oil. This is the weakness of Japan's corporations. After the first global energy crisis in 1973, Japanese oil companies and leading trade associations acted on the national policy of broadening the development of self-financed oil-fields and got together to set up a joint petroleum development corporation to begin oil prospecting activities in Abu Dhabi, Indonesia, and China. However, with U.S. and European companies already established there, the Japanese found themselves shut out of the most productive oil-fields. For the Japanese, this venture had very modest results. In the late 1980's, major Japanese trade associations abandoned investment-based oil trade, which is highly risky, one after another. Taking advantage of the opportunity, Japanese oil companies entered into direct trade with oil-producing nations and the trend gained momentum. Their role in energy trade weakened, the trade associations were forced to participate in the international energy market via the "self-financed oil-field" route. The appreciation of the yen and the explosion of fixed assets during the "bubble economy" days gave Japanese companies the financial wherewithal to invest in overseas oil prospecting and extraction. The end of the Cold War between East and West and the discovery of new oil-fields in countries like Vietnam and Yemen also opened the door for the resurgence of Japanese enterprises. Through a mix of competition and cooperation, Japanese trade associations and oil companies are in the process of putting together an integrated international oil capital system in the U.S. and European mode. In developing overseas energy resources, the Japanese business community has not put all its eggs in the petroleum basket. As interest in environmental protection intensifies around the world, the demand for natural gas, which is far less polluting than oil, is rising by the day. Power companies in Japan have become more dependent on natural gas. In 1991, 28 percent of the electricity generated in Japan was derived from petroleum, more than any other fuel. By the year 2000 the figure is expected to fall below 20 percent. In contrast, 25 percent of the power generated in the year 2000 will be derived from natural gas, up from 22 percent in 1991. For this reason Japanese enterprises have been rushing to invest in natural gas development even as they put money into oil prospecting and exploitation. This is the new characteristic of Japan's involvement in the development of overseas energy resources. China should diligently explore any opportunity to extract oil and natural gas in cooperation with Japan. b) The commercial and circulation sector can attract Japanese capital in a big way. Since the circulation sector is a high-profit sector, it must be opened up to an extent that is just right. Specifically the wholesale part of the sector cannot be opened while retail operations can be thoroughly deregulated. Take advantage of this opportunity to accelerate circulation reform as well. c) The automobile industry may well become one of the industries attracting most Japanese capital. No major Japanese auto maker thus far has set up a large-scale production base in China, where the automobile market is one of the sectors with the most potential. Investing in the Chinese car industry is the next big move in Japanese investment, whether by transferring a plant here from Europe or the United States, entering into a joint venture with China, or setting up a wholly Japanese-owned enterprise. The Toyota Corporation, for instance, plans to increase its assembling capacity in Asia, including China, from 350,000 to 1 million vehicles by the end of this century. d) Most attractive to Japanese investors is the banking industry. But a lot will depend on the deepening of banking reform in China and how far China will go to open up banking to foreign banks.
