He explained Azerbaijan's position to achieve peace. [Geydar Aliyev] We are waging a war against Armenia. The war was not started by us. It was Armenia that started the war against Azerbaijan. We have not occupied even an inch of Armenia's land. But, Armenia has occupied Azerbaijan's lands. Therefore, our war is a just war. We are defending ourselves. We want to liberate our lands. We want to liberate them peacefully, that is, through talks. I have repeatedly said that we want to achieve this peacefully on the sole condition that the Armenian troops leave all the Azerbaijani lands. Once the Armenian troops leave, we could hold other talks. [Serveroglu] The guests said they share President Geydar Aliyev's views and added that the Azerbaijani Cultural Society in Turkey is taking steps in this direction. Other issues were also discussed at the end of the meeting. Vafa Gulizade, state adviser on international affairs, took part in the meeting. [end recording]
