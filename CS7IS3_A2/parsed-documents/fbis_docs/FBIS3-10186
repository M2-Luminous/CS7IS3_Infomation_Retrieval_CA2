He demands, however, that some conditions be met. Fleury wants those coordinating his candidacy to create a movement around him to enable him to face Quercia on an equal footing. He wants to avoid engaging in an electoral adventure and being used as an anti-Quercia instrument. Last week in Brasilia, Fleury became convinced that he could seek the presidential nomination. In less than 24 hours -- between the evenings of 24 and 25 February -- he received the support of ranking members of his party. Yet Fleury refused to leave Brasilia as a candidate. Addressing a group of PMDB deputies who were prepared to launch his candidacy, Fleury said: "Hold it! Not yet." A meeting with PMDB deputies on the evening of 24 February was the highlight of his visit to Brasilia. Of the 99 deputies in the PMDB bloc in Congress, 48 were there. The promoters of Fleury's candidacy believe as many as 70 members of the PMDB bloc in the Chamber of Deputies could support Fleury. They also believe between 25 and 27 PMDB senators support him. Fleury is scheduled to dine with these senators this week. If he agrees to run, Fleury could surprise former Sao Paulo Governor Quercia. Fleury's aides began on 25 February to draft a map outlining support for Fleury state by state. This evaluation shows Fleury has the support of most PMDB members in 10 states. It is expected that he has almost overwhelming support in major states such as Rio Grande do Sul and Minas Gerais. It is also expected that most delegates to the PMDB convention from Rio de Janeiro and Bahia States favor Fleury. PMDB members from the states of Santa Catarina, Mato Grosso do Sul, Espirito Santo, Alagoas, Rio Grande do Norte, and Pernambuco are still expected to support Quercia. The remaining states are considered either pro-Quercia or undecided. Sao Paulo State, which is considered pro-Quercia, has the largest number of PMDB delegates. Of the 625 municipalities in the state, the PMDB has 362 mayors; most of them -- with rare exceptions -- are loyal to Quercia. Quercia also controls the PMDB bloc at the Sao Paulo Legislative Assembly, where 20 of the 26 deputies are loyal to him. Fleury and Quercia are, however, even regarding the 14 PMDB federal deputies; each has the support of seven deputies. The pro-Quercia faction appears to be strong in the states of Para, Mato Grosso, Paraiba, Goias, and Ceara. In Parana State, the PMDB answers to Governor Roberto Requiao, who also dreams about the presidential succession. The promoters of Fleury's candidacy have emphasized other factors that favor their candidate. They contend that most of the strong PMDB gubernatorial candidates support Fleury. This is true of Antonio Britto (Rio Grande do Sul), Tarcisio Delgado (Minas Gerais), Divaldo Suruagy (Alagoas), Garibaldi Filho (Rio Grande do Norte), Wilson Campos (Mato Grosso), and Gerson Camata (Espirito Santo). The list also includes weaker candidates, such as former governor Moreira Franco (Rio de Janeiro) and the candidate to be nominated by the PMDB in Santa Catarina State. Moreira Franco, who admits that he would prefer Britto for the presidency, yesterday met with Quercia in Rio de Janeiro. He later said he will call Fleury tomorrow to ask if he plans to seek his presidential nomination. Another factor favorable to Fleury is the support from all PMDB national leaders. Luiz Henrique, the PMDB president; Pedro Simon, the government leader in the Senate; Luiz Carlos Santos, the government leader in the Chamber of Deputies; and Tarcisio Delgado, the PMDB bloc leader in the Chamber of Deputies, are all opponents of Quercia. Simon has already announced his support for Fleury and Santos is the leading promoter of Fleury's candidacy. Fleury is aware that the support he is receiving is prompted more by resistance to Quercia than by his own electoral appeal and has made it clear that he will not join an anti-Quercia front. He wants his candidacy to be an option to help the PMDB remain undivided over the presidential succession issue. He also voiced disagreement over the way some people have announced their support for him. "Fleury's candidacy is more palatable than that of Quercia," Simon said. Fleury wants his support to be centered on political issues, without making any reference to Quercia. Loyal to Quercia, Para Governor Jader Barbalho distrusts the expressions of support for Fleury. He said: "It is a wedge being used by our adversaries to divide the PMDB in Sao Paulo," adding: "Behind the promotion of Fleury's candidacy by the Rio Grande do Sul leaders is the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] candidacy." His failure to draw the support of PMDB governors is another problem for Quercia. Except for Barbalho, none of the other six PMDB governors has voiced support for Quercia. Goias Governor Iris Rezende, who was a Quercia supporter, hopes to become a presidential candidate. Fleury's supporters are trying to persuade Rezende to run on Fleury's ticket. Amazonas Governor Gilberto Mestrinho has also remained silent. Paraiba Governor Ronaldo Cunha Lima has declined to state his position. Both Mestrinho and Cunha Lima were considered allies of Quercia. Tocantins Governor Moises Avelino has no leaning toward Quercia and Parana Governor Roberto Requiao is an avowed foe of Quercia. Fleury's supporters expect to obtain the support of the PMDB governors.
