Leaders of the extinct FN-3-80 today told journalists in Managua that Jose Angel Talavera, alias "Chacal," leader of this organization, supported "the occupation of Quilali," which began on 14 May. The FN-3-80 blamed National Police "Commander" Fernando Caldera for the expulsion of former rebel leaders "Pajarito" and "Cascabel" from the police academy due to alleged lack of discipline. The former FN-3-80 leaders were being trained at the police academy in Managua to occupy police positions in the municipalities of northern Nicaragua. Some 600 FN-3-80 members completed their disarmament on 15 April in exchange for land and credits to purchase properties and organize a cooperative for farmers. In addition, the government promised to incorporate dozens of demobilized FN-3-80 members into the police in 13 municipalities in northern Nicaragua. The former FN-3-80 leaders blamed "Commander" Caldera for the current "inactivity" in the implementation of the government agreements with the demobilized rebels. There are no reports indicating that Army troops patrolling the areas near Quilali will move to dislodge the demobilized rebels who have occupied this municipality near the Honduran border.
