This view was expressed by Sergey Filatov, chief of the Russian president's administration, at a meeting with chief editors of the Russian media in ITAR-TASS news agency on Thursday, the day the agreement is discussed at a meeting of the State Duma. Filatov said that 50 telegrams from chiefs of Russian regions who are ready to sign the agreement without any reservations had been received in the Kremlin by now. He said the text of the document had been supported by 12 trade union leaders, all religious confessions, the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Council of Veterans and other public organisations. Chiefs of administrations of a number of territories and regions, as well as leaders of some parties, sent to the president's apparatus their proposals and remarks to the text of the document which are discussed by the working group headed by director of the institute of state and law of the Russian Academy of Science, Boris Topornin. Filatov noted that the presidential administration does not interfere in the activity of the group for perfecting the draft agreement and brings no presure on it whatsoever. He said the opposition took advantage of the pause in the preparation for the signing of the civic accord agreement. Therefore he believes that the document should be adopted before May 1 and that as many signatories as possible should be involved.
