Turkish warplanes are regularly intercepted by Greek fighters in Greek national air space, but the sources said Turkish sorties over the Aegean were now being flown in attack formations and planes armed with air-to-air and air-to-surface missiles had buzzed Greek navy boats patrolling Greek waters. They added that two Turkish naval vessels had also strayed into Greek waters off the island of Milos, 77 nautical miles from Pireaivs.
