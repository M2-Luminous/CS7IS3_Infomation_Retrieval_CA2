In 1984 Seselj was given an eight-year prison sentence by the post-Tito communist authorities when a document was seized from his home that praised the Titovization of Yugoslavia and condemned the federal system. Freed 22 months later, he founded the Serbian Radical Party, and a great number of dissidents flocked to support his ideas. Later, however, the Serbian intellectuals distanced themselves from Seselj, frightened by the extreme radicalism of his views: a strong government, unification of the Serbian lands at any price, a hard stance toward the outside world, and liquidation of all "traitorous" parties in the country. Following the last elections his party now has 39 seats in the new Serbian parliament (previously it had 72). It is now the third largest party in parliament after the Socialist Party and the opposition Depos coalition [Democratic Movement of Serbia]. [Chobanova] How do you view the situation in Serbia following the elections? [Seselj] The socioeconomic situation in Serbia will remain very grave and will even worsen. How can it improve? This government has no program nor mechanisms to solve the economic and social problems. [Chobanova] Can the Radical Party do anything to improve the situation? [Seselj] We will continue to criticize the people in power in all fields. We will see what the results are. [Chobanova] How did your break with the Socialists come about? [Seselj] We have never been together. This is a great delusion that is widespread among the public. We simply gave them a chance to form a minority government. We were not in a coalition with them, and continually criticized them. Later, when we wanted to topple the government, they dissolved parliament. We kept away only from Milosevic -- from the outset we did not criticize him, only the Socialists. Even now it would have been the same if Milosevic had not started arresting our supporters. We started criticizing him, and therefore won so few votes. Many people cannot stand the Socialist Party, but for some irrational reasons respect Milosevic. [Chobanova] Let us talk about Bosnia. Will there be an end to the war? [Seselj] I do not believe so, unfortunately. The Muslims are continually spurred on by the West and their appetites are growing. [Chobanova] But surely they have no forces to oppose and resist? [Seselj] They have obtained a lot of weapons. They delivered many weapons to them by air drops and they will try to mount a big offensive. [Chobanova] Perhaps they are counting on foreign military intervention. What do you think about this? [Seselj] They have lost on this point too, there will be no military intervention. Who wants to die for the Muslims in Bosnia. Furthermore, it is very difficult to intervene militarily in Bosnia. [Chobanova] Did the Serbian Radical Party have any soldiers fighting in Bosnia? [Seselj] Yes, but they were all part of the Serbian troops. We did not have any separate units. [Chobanova] What do you think about the West's policy toward the Balkans as a whole, apart from Bosnia? [Seselj] The West's policy is wrong. First, the Americans are settling some of their own accounts in the Balkans. It is in their interest to halt the unification of Europe. They want to hinder the consolidation of the EC. If there were no conflicts in the Balkans, they would dream one up, to justify their intervention and presence here. Second, Germany wanted to draw Slovenia and Croatia within its orbit. This is the reason Yugoslavia split. Germany has not yet stopped completely at this point. The Americans also have their interests regarding Turkey, and protect it. [Chobanova] They also have interests in connection with Macedonia. [Seselj] Macedonia is also connected with this, because the Americans clearly realize that the EC will never accept Turkey as a member. For this reason, Turkey is a convenient ally for them to drive a wedge into the heart of Europe. Turkey also has appetites regarding Bulgaria and Greece and wants to establish a convenient link with Macedonia, Albania, Sandjak, and Bosnia. [Chobanova] Today, when Macedonia is an independent state, it cannot remain an apple of discord and will not burden the relations between Serbia and Bulgaria. [Seselj] It should not make these relations difficult, but I fear there will be a big war in Macedonia, because 40 percent of its population are Albanians. [Chobanova] After Zhirinovskiy's victory in Russia you said that "our man has won in Moscow." Your words received great publicity in Bulgaria. Moreover, a few days ago Russia said that it wants to play a bigger role in the Balkans. [Seselj] It is in our interest for Russia to play a bigger role in the Balkans. Russia has traditionally helped Serbia, Bulgaria, Greece, and Romania. Always, when we were close to Russia, when Russia intervened, we gained benefit from it. As soon as Austria-Hungary or Germany intervened, it immediately caused a quarrel between the Balkan peoples. For example, look at the war between Serbia and Bulgaria in 1885: It was completely unnecessary. This war was provoked by Austria-Hungary, and the Serbs suffered the most from it. [Text] A short time ago Vuk Draskovic said that the division of Bosnia would not be to the Serbs' advantage, because it would create an Islamic state in the heart of Europe. The Islamic countries will aid the new state and Serbia will be left to its own fate. [Seselj] Such a danger does exist, but when this civil war is over, we Serbs have no intention of living with the Muslims any longer. We did not start this war. The West persuaded Izetbegovic to insist on complete independence. Much blood has been shed in this war. Why should we live together again? It is better to separate. Otherwise, we will continue to have bad relations with the Muslims. Why should we have a permanently unstable state? We want to have within our state the parts that are Serbian, that are indisputably Serbian. It never came into our minds to keep Macedonia by force. There is no Serbian majority there. Why should we force 700,000 Bulgarians, 700,000 Albanians and God knows who else to live together with us? No conflicts have broken out there either, no attacks on (Yugoslav Army) barracks. Our army withdrew from there peacefully. Why should we do it? In Kosovo, however, we cannot retreat. For us this is sacred ground and we cannot give it up. On the other hand, we do we need central Bosnia, where Muslims form the majority -- in Zenica, Tuzla, and so on? It is true that these have never been Serbian lands, and the Muslims have never been Serbs, although they possessed a Serbian national consciousness for several centuries. [Chobanova] I also wanted to discuss the prospects for relations with Bulgaria. [Seselj] We support having the best possible relations with Bulgaria. When we were all in the same party -- Draskovic, Komnenic, and me -- when those demonstrations took place in Skopje in the spring of 1990, we sent a letter in support of the Bulgarians. I have always been against recognizing this fictitious Macedonian nation, and have always advocated friendship with Bulgaria and finding a compromise solution. We hold the view that the eastern part of Macedonia should be handed over to Bulgaria. [Chobanova] Do you suggest that Macedonia should be divided? [Seselj] Yes, it should. The part populated by Bulgarians should belong to Bulgaria. I think this would be the best solution. And one of the reasons in its favor is the Albanian danger. Only by such a solution will we finally eliminate Turkey in the Balkans. If necessary, Albania should also be given the Western part of Macedonia, where Albanians form the majority. It is important to us for the Albanians not to become a majority in the Vardar valley, which is a vitally important artery for us. There is a danger that this may come about. The Albanians already form a majority in Skopje.
