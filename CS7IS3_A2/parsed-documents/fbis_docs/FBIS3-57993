Support for nonalignment has correspondingly increased a bit. Less than a third of all Finns, 29 percent, think that allying ourselves with the Western powers in time of war is the best national defense alternative. The figure produced by the latest opinion poll is 6 percentage points fewer than the one obtained in a similar poll a year ago. Support for nonalignment has correspondingly increased slightly. The number of Finns who support an increase in appropriations for defense has also clearly increased: 27 percent want to increase appropriations for the Army. Just last spring, only 14 percent of the respondents were in favor of raising them. Finns now view increasing appropriations for it with as much enthusiasm as they did during the peak of the economic boom in the final years of the past decade. The National Defense Information Planning Board commissioned the Finnish Gallup Company to conduct the opinion poll in the latter half of October. Participating in the poll were 1,053 Finns over age 15, who were interviewed in person. A similar poll is conducted twice a year. Planning Board chief secretary Pertti Alanen thinks that the drop in support for alliance with the West is statistically "of slight significance." On the other hand, support for full alliance with the Western defense system, with bases located and Western troops stationed in Finland, has increased during the past year. The 2-percentage-point difference may, of course, be just a statistical error. How Finns react to cooperation with Russia in time of war was not polled before. But now, 2 percent of them feel it is the best solution, while 49 percent think it is the worst model. Thirty-one percent of the poll respondents would interfere with Aland's demilitarized status. This was the first time the issue was raised and the respondents were residents of mainland Finland; Aland residents were not included in the poll sampling. It was argued that there was a need for changing the situation by, among other things, eliminating exemptions--that is, a desire to get Aland residents into the Army and the necessity of defending Aland. Thirty-six percent of the respondents felt that a change in Aland's status is necessary, and 32 percent thought it would be needlessly difficult to define that position. The men, in particular, wanted changes. Nearly half of the women under age 35 would leave Aland in peace. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Best Soltion for Defense(distribution of opinions in percentages) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |1992 |1993 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |No military alliances |36 |39 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Cooperation with the Wes-|35 |29 | |t in time of war | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Joining a Western milita-|9 |11 | |ry alliance, troops and | | | |bases in Finland | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Cooperation with Russia |-- |2 | |in time of war | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Defense alliance with Sw-|11 |11 | |eden | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Something else or cannot |9 |8 | |say | | | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
