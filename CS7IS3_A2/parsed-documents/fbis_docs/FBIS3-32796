Making a sustained effort in refurbishing the theater of military operations and in maintaining techniques, the Central Army engineering regiment obtained the special Victoria-25 Emulation award. Engineering Unit 3170 received the award of being the first group of its type in the country, and the banner that raises it to the level of National Vanguard of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, an award obtained for the sixth consecutive year. During 1993 this unit made laudable efforts to build tunnels, silos, and firing positions, and achieved considerable progress in conserving resources and improving the troops' living conditions.
