But Lt. Col. Marcos Ibanez, civil military operations officer of the Negros Island Command, said that "if it is true, then it is an indication that the rebel movement continues to weaken." Ibanez said the emergence of another faction will be advantageous to the government. It will also be good for the peace talks initiated by the government.
