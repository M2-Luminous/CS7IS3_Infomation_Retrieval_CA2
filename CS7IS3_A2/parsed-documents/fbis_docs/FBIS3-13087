Abu-Musa told IRNA in an interview that Palestinian combatants who always confront compromising plans, follow the path of Imam Khomeyni and will continue their struggle until the freedom of the Holy Qods. The role the Islamic revolution of Iran plays in countering the Zionist conspiracies has caused the world arrogance to adopt anti-Iran stands, he noted. Muslim nations today, under the auspices of Imam Khomeyni's teachings, have realised that the U.S. and Israel are their major enemies, Abu-Musa remarked. He urged Islamic and national forces to resist against the U.S. and Israeli conspiracies and not let the Zionists rule the region. Abu-Musa said the last Friday's massacre by the Zionist forces of Muslim worshippers in al-Khalil [Hebron] was the natural consequence of 'Arafat-Rabin agreement.
