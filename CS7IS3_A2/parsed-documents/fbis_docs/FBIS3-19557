Speaking at a news conference in Aydin, Mentese noted that the backbone of the separatist organization has been broken in the struggle waged against terror and added: The government had to take certain measures regarding various developments in the country. As a matter of fact, we have managed to break the backbone of the separatist organization through the measures we have taken. The necessary measures have been taken throughout the country to ensure that the 27 March elections are held in a secure atmosphere. These measures are also valid for the Nevruz holiday celebrations to be held on 21 March. We are sending some 150,000 troops to the southeastern Anatolian region to ensure security during the elections. Mentese said that the leader of the separatist organization, Ocalan, has been exerting efforts beyond belief to sit at the negotiating table within a political framework with the Turkish Republic in a bid to keep his name and his organization on the world agenda and added: He will, however, never be able to realize this because we are rejecting this proposal which is tantamount to harming democracy. Mentese concluded by saying that a draft bill is being prepared that will regulate the passage through the Bosporus of tankers carrying dangerous cargo.
