"We are turning into an information-analytical structure which would cooperate with the Foreign Intelligence Service, the Federal Counter-Intelligence Service and the tax inspection," he believes. Petrov noted that the priority task of the board which previously dealt with checking the implementation of laws and decrees, will be the preparation of informational-analytical materials for the Russian leader about the activities of the federal power bodies and power bodies of the subjects of the Federation. Speaking about the right to demand documents necessary for check-ups from enterprises and organizations, Petrov pointed out that the board has no intention to violate the law on commercial secret. "Our enquiries may concern regular information about the financial and economic activities," he said. According to Petrov, commercial structures will not be the main target of check-ups. "We are more interested in the federal and regional power structures and high-ranking officials," he said. Petrov noted that the president's decision to transform the board was not caused by some current political reasons, and by no means is linked with the package of economic decrees signed recently by Boris Yeltsin.
