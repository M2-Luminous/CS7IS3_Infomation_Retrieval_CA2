Paine called their attitude "incorrect" from Russia's viewpoint for two reasons: "It is wrong to stick to double criteria in politics: if you support territorial integrity of Russia, you must support territorial integrity of the neighboring states -- there is no alternative," Paine said. "And it is wrong to condition the signing of an inter-state treaty on the settlement of internal conflicts. Problems of this kind exist in many countries. It is difficult to imagine someone order other countries not to have anything to do with Russia until its federal authorities settle relations with the Chechen Republic, for example". As concerns benefits for Russia, Paine said Russia needs sea ports badly. Georgia has several and can provide the much-needed services to Russia. Paine also pointed to the problem of Russian troops and military bases on Georgian territory. "Georgia guarantees required provisions for the Russian troops," he said. The two countries's agreement on military strategic issues is of significance for all Commonwealth member-countries. The drawing of new borders could cost Russia tens of billions of roubles. Also important are the agreements with Georgia on transit transportation of Russian goods by land and sea via Georgia, Paine said.
