FR940713-1-00056 FR940713-1-00012 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Chapter II [Docket No. 940558&hyph;4158; I.D. 052394B] West Coast Salmon Fisheries; Disaster Relief AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Advance notice of proposed rulemaking; modification of comment period. SUMMARY: NMFS is reducing the comment period on the advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding appropriate limitations, terms, and conditions the agency should use in providing proposed assistance to person engaged in commercial fisheries for uninsured losses resulting from the west coast salmon fisheries resource disaster. DATES: Comments must be received by July 15, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be sent to Bruce Morehead, Office of Trade and Industry Services, National Marine Fisheries Service, 1315 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Bruce Morehead, 301/713&hyph;2358. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: An advance notice of proposed rulemaking, requesting public comment over a 60-day period, was published in the Federal Register on June 3, 1994, at 59 FR 28838. In addition to the comment period on the advance notice of proposed rulemaking, NOAA/NMFS held a series of meetings with the affected public and received numerous comments that it is crucial to expedite the development and publication of the proposed and final rule for the disaster assistance program. NMFS agrees with the need to act quickly and believes that the public will not be disadvantaged by the shortened comment period because of the public meetings and the fact that there will be additional opportunity to comment on the proposed rule. Dated: July 7, 1994. Charles Karnella, Acting Program Management Officer, National Marine Fisheries Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;16874 Filed 7&hyph;7&hyph;94; 4:27 pm] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;22&hyph;P
