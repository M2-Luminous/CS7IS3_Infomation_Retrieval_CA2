FR940930-1-00020 FR940930-1-00008 Section 1.131(a)(3), if added as proposed, would allow a showing of prior invention to be made in a pending application or a patent that is undergoing reexamination where a single party holds both the application or patent undergoing reexamination and another patent where the claimed inventions were, at the time the later invention was made, both owned by the single party or subject to an obligation of assignment to that party. Further, in order to rely on proposed §1.131(a)(3), the inventions claimed in the application or in the patent undergoing reexamination and in the other patent must not be identical as set forth in 35 U.S.C. 102. Other Considerations The proposed rule changes are in conformity with the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., Executive Order 12612, and the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. The Office of Management and Budget has determined that the proposed rule changes are not significant for the purposes of E.O. 12866. The Assistant General Counsel for Legislation and Regulation of the Department of Commerce has certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, Small Business Administration, that the proposed rule changes will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities (Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b)), because the proposed rules would affect only a small number of applications and would provide a streamlined and simplified procedure, eliminating the need for requesting waiver of the rules. The Patent and Trademark Office has also determined that this notice has no Federalism implications affecting the relationship between the National Government and the States as outlined in Executive Order 12612. These rule changes will not impose any additional burden under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. List of Subjects in 37 CFR Part 1 Administrative practice and procedure, Inventions and patents, Lawyers, Reporting and record keeping requirements. For the reasons set forth in the preamble, and pursuant to the authority granted to the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks by 35 U.S.C. 6, the Office proposes to amend Title 37 of the Code of Federal Regulations as set forth below, with deletions indicated by brackets ([]) and additions indicated by arrows (><).
