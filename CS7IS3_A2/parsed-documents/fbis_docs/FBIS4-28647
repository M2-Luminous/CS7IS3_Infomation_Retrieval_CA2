Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai, in a lecture in this central Japanese city, said there is "a strong possibility" that the United Nations Security Council will adopt a resolution against North Korea in a week or 10 days unless Pyongyang reconsiders its stance on the issue. Kumagai said Japan's basic policy will remain unchanged over the issue, as the government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata has resolved. He noted the absence of China's objection to a sanctions resolution adopted Friday by the International Atomic Energy Agency against North Korea. China abstained instead of voting against it. Kumagai also said the nuclear issue poses to Japan a policy choice of whether to continue or abandon 50 years of alliance with the United States since the end of World War II.
