FBIS4-953 "drafr076_c_94038" FBIS-AFR-94-076 Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA SADF Says Integration of Forces `Progressing Well' SADF Says Integration of Forces `Progressing Well' MB1904183094 Johannesburg THE STAR in English 19 Apr 94 p 7 MB1904183094 Johannesburg THE STAR English BFN [Report by Norman Chandler] [Text] The South African Defence Force [SADF] says the integration of various military forces in the country into a national defence force is progressing well. It has denied outright that it is "dragging its feet" over the matter, as alleged by Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- ANC military wing] (MK) commander Joe Modise in Bloemfontein at the weekend. The South African National Defence Force (SANDF) comes into being next Wednesday as a successor to the SADF. It will comprise MK, members of the Bophuthatswana, Venda, Ciskei and Transkei defence forces and, later, APLA [Azanian People's Liberation Army] forces. General Georg Meiring, Chief of the SADF, told THE STAR yesterday that Modise's allegation was not true. The SADF had presented a comprehensive proposal regarding integration in October but this had been rejected. Subsequently it was decided to form a multiparty team to plan and facilitate integration and this had only recently got off the ground. "This team went through a planning process aimed at accommodating people in the assembly areas, the end result being the same plan that w?s originally rejeited," Meiring added. He said he was confident that the integration process was progressing well. "Planning is a joint effort and cannot be laid only at the defence force's door. We are adamant that integration should be a success." Modise said he suspected the SADF had "its own agenda" and wanted to delay the integration process in the hope it could stay in command and determine who joined the SANDF. "This we will not allow. We are very worried about it ... but we are going to ensure that integration takes its course once a new government comes in". He said the SADF had previously had facilities for Citizen Force intakes of up to 20,000 new recruits but had now "reluctantly identified three of its bases where MK members could assemble".
