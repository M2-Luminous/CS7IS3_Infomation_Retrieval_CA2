Britain is producing a Hong Kong version of "sunset imperial power" in a vain attempt to preserve its political and economic interests in Hong Kong. It signed the Sino-British Joint Declaration, committing itself to cooperating and negotiating with China on the handover of political powers and a smooth transition in the latter half of the transition period. However, after he came to Hong Kong, Chris Patten reneged on the promise, refused to cooperate and negotiate as required by the provisions of Annex II, set up his own agenda, and deliberately created a situation which is not going to converge with the Basic Law. The presentation of Patten's package to the Legislative Council [Legco] shows that the British have determinedly turned their back on convergence and cooperation. Premier Li Peng responded firmly to Britain's attempt to continue its rule in his Government Work Report to the National People's Congress [NPC]: "Britain's colonial rule over Hong Kong is going to end. This is something no force can resist." "Whatever the twists and turns, the Chinese Government and Chinese people are determined and capable of restoring sovereignty over Hong Kong and maintaining its long-term stability and prosperity." The phrase demonstrates the solemn position of the Chinese government. What Britain is now pursuing in Hong Kong is colonial rule. This is a fact. If Britain is sincere in implementing the Joint Declaration and pursuing friendly cooperation, its interests thereby reside in the joint declaration. However, since Britain has refused to cooperate, naturally it has to be responsible for the consequences that flow from the refusal. Colonialists do not have any political, legal, or moral right to dictate the future of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR] or to continue its influence and extend its terms of rule by doing what is properly the SAR Preparatory Committee's work, that is, organizing the first government and legislature for the SAR. The Chinese Government will work firmly in accordance with the Joint Declaration. Britain's colonial rule over Hong Kong has to end. The council founded on the Letters Patent and Royal Instructions will die "a natural death" when the hour strikes. On 1 July 1997, China will restore its sovereignty over Hong Kong and the councils erected on Patten's package will end on the same day. China will form the first government, legislature, and the two municipal councils in accordance with the Basic Law and NPC resolutions. This is a changeover of sovereignty, not a change of government within a country. The Joint Declaration announced long ago that colonial rule would end. Nobody can resist this historical progress. Before Patten's package was presented to the Legco, there was still a possibility of the convergence of the political systems. The Chinese Government still hoped that Britain would repent but Britain pushed the matter beyond the point of no return by presenting Patten's package to the Legco; there will not be cooperation in the transition of the political system and China does not entertain any illusions about Britain. China will not do anything useless. Since there is no possibility of cooperation, China can only open an effective road toward restoring sovereignty over Hong Kong and maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. The Chinese people are blessed with the courage of not being daunted by difficulties or rugged terrain. If the Chinese Government wants to restore its sovereignty over Hong Kong, it will have the ability, together with Hong Kong citizens, to achieve a smooth transition and form the SAR government and legislature to enable Hong Kong's prosperity and stability to continue. By pretending to enter into negotiations Britain has wasted China's valuable time for arranging for the SAR. Premier Li Peng's discourse in his government work report on the problem of Hong Kong indicated that the Chinese Government will count on the power of the Chinese people and rising national power, intensify and speed up the Preliminary Work Committee work, unify Hong Kong compatriots on a broad basis, and successfully pursue the early-phase preparations for the SAR government and legislature with one mind and through joint efforts. This historic task must see results before 1996. The Preparatory Committee must be created in 1996 to ensure that the political powers are effectively taken over. The government work report is a great encouragement for all patriotic and Hong Kong-loving people. The Hong Kong people will not let their motherland down and will do their best to make the establishment of the SAR a glorious chapter in their history. Britain's attempt to resist China's restoring its sovereignty over Hong Kong will end in total failure.
