Our environmental protection work has been strengthened. However, data in the bulletin shows that current environmental protection in our province is still far from meeting the demands of economic development. In some localities, problems caused by effluent, exhaust fumes, waste residues, and noise still spread unchecked. Environmental pollution, mainly seen in cities and towns across the province, is becoming serious and is spreading very fast. The scope of ecological damage has widened and has become more acute. In a small number of localities, environmental pollution and ecological damage have become factors constraining sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the local economy.
