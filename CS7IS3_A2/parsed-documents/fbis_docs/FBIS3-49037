How much state property has been privatized so far, how much is left to be privatized, and what is the share of the private sector in the generation of the gross national product? [Skalicky] These questions are very difficult to answer in precise figures. The problem is that we neither know the exact value of the property that remains in the hands of the state, nor do we have precise numbers on the property already transferred to private hands in the framework of restitutions. We only know that more than 100,000 real estate properties have been returned, for instance, in the framework of the small-scale restitution on the level of enterprise-authorized persons. Another property transfer took place by means of the so-called small-scale privatization that is to end with this year. It was an insignificant amount from the point of view of the entire process of denationalization -- the book value lies somewhere between 20 and 25 billion korunas, the yield is approximately 33 billion korunas. Practically all the property that had been registered in time was included in the large-scale privatization. The book value of the property that entered the two privatization waves totalled about 1.2 to 1.3 billion korunas. Some of the enterprises on the list ended in bankruptcy and liquidation even before the privatization projects were submitted and assessed. The value of the property being privatized is lower by this amount. We do not precisely know the book value of the property that, as decided, will not be privatized for five years, and the same applies to the property that is to remain in public or state ownership. [passage omitted] Much more important than the value of the property in the state or private hands is, however, the data on the development of the share of the private sector in the generation national product. It has already reached 57 percent, which indicates even more favorable development than corresponds to the real pace of privatization. Namely, private firms not only emerge from privatization but also on "green sites." [Skalkova] Can you at least give the ratio between the state property privatized for remuneration and the share of property for which the state does not collect any financial means? [Skalicky] The property transferred free of charge in the form of the coupon privatization is estimated at 400 to 450 billion korunas. Another significant share of the property -- about 60 to 100 billion korunas -- was transferred to communities in the form of shares of certain enterprises that represent environmentally, for instance, a burden on the region or are of key importance for its infrastructure. The value of property that has been sold directly or in the form of shares to domestic or foreign investors -- or the sale of which has been decided -- amounts to only 200 to 250 billion korunas. That is a surprisingly low amount if we compare it with the value of the property transferred free of charge. [passage omitted] [Skalkova] How do you foresee the development in investment funds? [Skalicky] They will go basically in two directions. A part of the funds will tend to the role of the traditional institutional investor, i.e. stabilize its average proceeds by a broad portfolio. These funds will not have any ambitions of an influential owner. The other part of the funds -- and I put my hope with respect to the influence exertion on the enterprises in these funds -- will limit the diversity of the portfolio to a special sector or a group of enterprises. Therefore, in the future, we will have to consider the abolition of the 20 percent limit to the capital participation of these funds in stockholding companies. [passage omitted] [Skalkova] Lately, the share of foreign investments seems to be ceding to the portfolio investments, but this type of capital does not bring any know-how or new technology, which the enterprises need to be competitive. What, in your opinion, is the contribution of such privatization? [Skalicky] I would not underestimate this type of privatization, because the foreign investor must have decided for it in order to influence the enterprise. The only thing is that this form is less obvious and -- similarly to investments in enterprises made prior or after the privatization -- manifests itself only gradually. I actually consider this trend desirable because now, when the conditions for normal development of the economy have been created, we definitely need foreign capital. One of the greatest current problems are the excessively expensive credits. The portfolio investments, however, are not a part of the privatization process but rather -- and I insist -- a beneficial result of the gradual privatization. They certainly would not enter anonymous state enterprises in the same scope. [passage omitted] [Skalkova] What will the privatization process be like after the second wave of privatization is completed? [Skalicky] I would characterize this period by saying that it will be the post-privatization cleanup. We want the founding sectors to now submit a list of property for additional small privatization waves. We are going to collaborate on a similar task with the district offices. There is also some state property established by the communities. We intend to involve the district privatization commissions in the search for the unattached property. There will not be much, but some will certainly be found. [passage omitted] There is a relatively broad scale of methods at our disposal, so the privatization process can reach its end as quickly as possible. It should happen before the end of this electoral term.
