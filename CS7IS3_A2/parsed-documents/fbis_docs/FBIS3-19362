Replying to a question, Kasoulidhis said this is evident from statements by [Turkish Cypriot leader] Rauf Denktas that the talks could not take place with such speed. Kasoulidhis repeated that our side believes the talks should take place at a slow pace but that the timeframe of until the end of March is more than long enough for the UN Security Council, with the UN secretary general's report, to reach conclusions about where the proximity talks are headed.
