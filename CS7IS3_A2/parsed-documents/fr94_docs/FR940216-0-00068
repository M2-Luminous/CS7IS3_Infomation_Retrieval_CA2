FR940216-0-00068 FR940216-0-00010 F. Duration of Augmentation In its April 1992 proposal, EPA proposed that augmentations would remain in effect until the next subsequent complex model update was issued. EPA further proposed that if an augmentation had been valid for three or fewer years upon implementation of the subsequent update to the complex model, then refiners were permitted to continue using the augmentation in conjunction with the previous complex model for an additional length of time, subject to certain restrictions. EPA has received a number of comments on this proposal. Today's rule includes a set of limitations on the duration of the augmentation that incorporate some elements of these comments. These limitations are described below. The Agency is concerned that fuel suppliers not be allowed to claim emission effects in perpetuity based on the testing program described in this section due to the smaller degree of statistical confidence in such effects compared to those included in an updated complex model. The Agency also recognizes the need for fuel suppliers to recoup investments made to reformulate gasoline, including investments to utilize the emission effects identified through vehicle testing. Therefore, petitioners will be permitted to use emission effects determined through vehicle testing only for a limited period of time. In general, this period of time extends until an updated version of the complex model takes effect. Updates to the complex model will be issued by EPA through a formal rulemaking process at such time that the Agency determines that sufficient additional data has become available to warrant issuing such an update. Since some augmentations may be in place for a relatively short period of time before the model is updated, the Agency may not be able to adequately assess the augmentation. However, if a proposed update to the complex model is issued within three years of the time at which the augmentation takes effect, then fuel suppliers may be permitted to continue using the augmentation to determine the emission effects of reformulated gasolines. Specifically, if the Agency does not formally accept, reject, or modify the augmentation in question for inclusion in the updated complex model, then the augmentation will remain available until the next update to the model takes effect. If the Agency reviews the augmentation and either excludes the augmentation entirely or includes the augmentation in a modified form, then the augmentation will remain available for use in its original form, in conjunction with the complex model for which the augmentation was issued, to those fuel producers who can demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that they have begun producing fuels that are certified using the augmentation. In such cases, the augmentation may continue to be used for five years from the date the augmentation took effect or for three years of fuel production, whichever is shorter. For the reasons discussed above, augmentations to the model for the effects of a given parameter over a particular range are permitted only once. Regardless of whether the emission effects of a parameter are included in an updated model, the augmentation can neither be used nor renewed (even with data from a second identical test program) once the maximum time period for use of a model augmented with the effects of that parameter has expired. Further testing is permitted, however, to provide EPA with the additional data needed to include the effect in a future update to the model. G. Limits on the Range of an Augmentation Fuel suppliers will be permitted to claim the emission effects of augmentations only to the extent that the test program measured the effects of the fuel parameter in question over the range in question. If the parameter is included in the complex model, then the augmentation will be valid for fuels containing levels of the parameter between the level tested in the test program and the nearest limit of the complex model (as described in Section IV). If the parameter is not included in the complex model, then the augmentation will be valid for fuels containing levels of the parameter between the candidate and baseline levels (i.e., the levels found in Addition Fuels 1 and 3 in Table V.1). This provision is intended to be consistent with the limits on the application of the simple and complex models as expressed in Sections III and IV. H. EPA Approval, Confirmatory Testing, and Fees In the process of reviewing a model augmentation, EPA must confirm the accuracy of the test results. To this end, EPA intends to monitor the petitioner's test program. The Agency also reserves the right to perform confirmatory testing to assure the validity of the test results and the emission performance of the reformulated fuel before allowing augmentation of the model. EPA further reserves the right to collect fees any lawful of an amount sufficient to recoup all costs associated with such confirmatory testing. EPA anticipates that if any confirmatory testing is performed that it will be of a limited nature and focused only on those aspects of the test program which are unexpected or contrary to prior test programs and engineering knowledge. Since EPA has not proposed methods to be used to calculate and collect such fees, these provisions will be handled through a subsequent rulemaking.
