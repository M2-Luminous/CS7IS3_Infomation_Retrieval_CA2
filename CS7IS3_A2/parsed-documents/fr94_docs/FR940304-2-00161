I. Introduction On June 18, 1993, pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 1 the Government Securities Clearing Corporation (``GSCC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change relating to the release of confidential data. Notice of the proposed rule change was published in the Federal Register on August 10, 1993. 2 On December 30, 1993, GSCC filed with the Commission an amendment (``Amendment No. 1'') to the proposed rule change. Notice of Amendment No. 1 was published in the Federal Register on January 20, 1994. 3 No comments were received. This order approves the proposed rule change. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b) (1990). 2 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32710 (August 2, 1993), 58 FR 42584. 3 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33464 (January 12, 1994), 59 FR 3142. II. Description Currently, GSCC Rule 29 provides that, absent valid legal process, GSCC will release clearing data 4 that is identifiable as to a member only to (1) that member, (2) the Commission upon request, (3) another self-regulatory organization, and (4) an ``appropriate regulatory agency'' as defined in Section 3(a)(34) (C) of the Act with regard to a member that is primarily regulated by such agency. The proposed rule change amends GSCC Rule 29 to permit GSCC to release clearing data to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (``FRBNY'') and to other third parties that perform a regulatory or oversight function related to the government securities marketplace. 4 Clearing data is defined essentially to include any data relating to a member's trading activity that is held or produced by GSCC. An agreement between GSCC and the FRBNY controls the release of data to the FRBNY. The FRBNY has agreed to maintain member specific information in confidence, subject to certain exceptions. The FRBNY may share GSCC data with the members of the Interagency Working Group on Market Surveillance 5 and may release GSCC data as required by law. The FRBNY also has agreed to follow certain procedures should third parties attempt to obtain release of GSCC data through the FRBNY. 6 5 The Interagency Working Group on Market Surveillance is composed of representatives from the FRBNY, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (``Federal Reserve Board''), the United States Department of the Treasury (``Treasury''), the Commission, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC''). The FRBNY will provide each member of the working group with a copy of the agreement with GSCC and request confirmation that the other members will follow the procedures contained in that agreement. 6 If the FRBNY is presented with a request under the Freedom of Information Act (``FOIA'') (5 U.S.C. 552 (Supp. I 1993)), the FRBNY will decline requests for member specific information to the extent that the information is exempt from FOIA. If a FRBNY determination under FOIA is appealed, the FRBNY will notify GSCC to permit GSCC to raise an objection. If the information is requested under a subpoena or other form of legal process, the FRBNY will notify GSCC, if not prohibited by law. The FRBNY, however, will make its own determination whether it is required to comply with the disclosure request under the subpoena.
