According to a report by the Central News Unit in Kabul, clashes have raged since yesterday in the capital of Afghanistan, and so far hundreds of people have been killed or wounded. Also, thousands of shells, mortars, and rockets have hit the warring sides positions and various areas of Kabul. Kabul Radio and Television, which is controlled by the supporters of President Borhanoddin Rabbani, strongly attacked General Dostam and announced that he has been stripped of all his legal and official powers. Borhanoddin Rabbani last year appointed General Dostam as the first deputy of the Afghan Defense Ministry. According to the Kabul Radio and Television, Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan] forces are confronting the Defense Ministry forces and are fighting alongside General Dostam's forces. Rasul Sayyaf, the leader of the Etehad-e Eslami [Islamic Union of Afghanistan] and the main ally of Afghan President Borhanoddin Rabbani, also stressed, during a speech broadcast on that country's radio and television, that battles will continue until the complete annihilation of the Northern Movement led by General Dostam. The report of the Voice and Vision correspondent from Kabul mentions that again today the Iranian Embassy in Kabul became the target of a mortar attack during the exchange of fire between the warring sides, but none of the embassy workers were harmed.
