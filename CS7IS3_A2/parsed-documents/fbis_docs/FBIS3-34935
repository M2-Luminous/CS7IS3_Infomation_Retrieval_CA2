The cable says: The immortal epic of the Mother of Battles, fought by great Iraq, has charted a course for the Arab nation to prove its cultural and historical presence and safeguard its rights and dignity in a changing world dominated by forces of evil, falsehood, and serfdom, led by the United States and its ally, world Zionism. The cable adds: By virtue of your God-given faith, leadership, and wisdom and the people's deep love and true allegiance, you, the inspired knight, were qualified to lead this major, historic confrontation. Tyranny and aggression were defeated at your own hands. In your sacred name, strugglers and fighters uttered the biggest "No" in the history of mankind, and through you the voice of human justice rose above all other voices and the banner of God is Great fluttered over all other banners.
