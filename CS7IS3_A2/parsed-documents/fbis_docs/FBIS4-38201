It understands peace as meaning the restoration of both the land and rights and as being a just and comprehensive peace that ensures strength and dignity and rejects capitulation, bargaining, and submission. The paper adds: Syria also cooperates with all international efforts aimed to promote the peace process and achieve its objectives according to the bases approved by the international legitimacy and its resolutions. Syria rejects any attempt to derail the peace process. AL-THAWRAH asserts that Syria, which adheres to a just and comprehensive peace based on the resolutions of international legitimacy, will not yield to pressures or blackmail, and will not be dragged into the delusions of separate deals because Syria has always advocated pan-Arab causes. The paper notes that Syria has always warned and still warns against partial, separate deals. Concluding, AL-THAWRAH says: Syria, with the support of the masses, has become stronger in the national and pan-Arab arenas. Syria is today more self-confident than ever before while the masses are adhering to the national and pan-Arab principles on whose basis Syria joined the peace process. Syria even opened the way for this process and gave it momentum at several turning points.
