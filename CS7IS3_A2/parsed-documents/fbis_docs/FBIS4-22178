Nearly four years ago, there were plans to transfer one of the aviation regiments of the Western Troop Grouping to Tokmak. The pilots who had flown reconnaisance in Ukraine gave high praise to both the airfield and the people serving there. And why not? It is located in the beautiful steppes of Tauria. The runway is wonderfully suited to any type of airplane. The airfield has everything that an aviation unit needs: Parking areas for the planes, the necessary communications facilities, and modern equipment. In short, the aviators of the Western Troop Grouping would have been only too glad to serve there. Unfortunately, however, this was not meant to be. What ensued was a flaunting of sovereignties, as it was then called, and the aviation regiment flew off under the Russian flag to Kursk Oblast. Meanwhile, the Tokmak airfield continued its quiet, provincial existence. But not for long. A storm was moving in from the Black Sea, even though Tokmak is some distance away. At any moment, the Sevastopol clouds were threatening to explode in thunder and lightning... By now, the reader has probably figured out that the aviation equipment command [aviatsiyno-tekhnichna komendatura] has no connection with the customary duties of military service. There is also no military police unit [hauptvakhta] for offending airplanes. The job of the aviation equipment command is to do what needs to be done to make possible distant flights by individual airplanes or groups of airplanes. That was also the job of the personnel of the airfield--servicing the aircraft of the Black Sea Fleet. They were subordinated, accordingly, to the command of the Black Sea Fleet, and they tried to serve in a manner that would not bring dishonor to the naval uniform. And they succeeded. There were no complaints from the Black Sea Fleet command--but only up to a given moment. After Ukraine became an independent state, the personnel of the aviation equipment command held a general meeting at which they decided to take the Military Oath of Loyalty to the people of Ukraine. Incidentally, this was the second unit in the Black Sea Fleet, after the battalion of marines, to hoist the yellow-and-blue flag... This raising of the flag, however, was only a symbolic action, inasmuch as the unit had taken the Ukrainian oath three days before the State Flag of Ukraine was approved. This action did not get a great deal of publicity--after all, all sorts of things were then happening in the provinces. But the response from Sevastopol was lightning swift. The then Commander of the Black Sea Fleet, Igor Kasatonov, proclaimed the Commander of the unit, Viktor Petrovskyy, all but a criminal and ordered him to be dismissed from his job and arrested. Shortly after this, the unit was visited by a Commission, headed by Major-General Borys Shevchenko, Chief of Rear Services of the Black Sea Fleet Air Force. A campaign was launched to persuade the unit to renounce its Ukrainian oath. But the servicemen of the Aviation Equipment Command remained steadfast. Then came the threats. When this also failed to produce results, an order was issued to hand over all the existing equipment to the main aviation base of the Black Sea Fleet. This involved no more and no less than 179 special motor vehicles. Warrant Officer Kostyantyn Romanenko, who was responsible for the vehicles, refused to carry out the order. Major Viktor Petrenko also regarded this order to be illegal. And so they managed to keep the equipment. But the Black Sea specialists would not have been rear-service personnel had they left empty-handed. Failing to get the equipment, they promptly began to haggle... over the production of the subsidiary plot. And they succeeded in leaving with 70 hogs, 10 cows, more than 200 rams, and a couple hundred chickens. If it weren't so sad, it would be funny, as they say. After taking everything they could take, the Black Sea Fleet command progressively began to reduce all deliveries of supplies to the airfield. There was chaos at the top, but it was not the staff officials who suffered. This ambiguity--although the aviation command [aviakomendatura] had taken the Ukrainian oath, it was still subordinated to the Black Sea Fleet--produced all sorts of oddities. The story of the handing over of the grunting and mooing livestock pales in comparison with the incident involving the missiles that followed. Yes, you read it right, air-to-air missiles. It so happened that the fighter aviation regiment that was then stationed in Zaporizhzhya had given the unit commanded by Major Petrovskyy 83 missiles for safekeeping. Shortly thereafter, the aviation regiment was transferred to Kazakhstan, and the responsible officials simply forgot about the missiles. The Major spent two years corresponding with various staffs before he found the owners of the missiles. For two years, the unit diligently looked after the missiles, while military officials of various ranks literally kicked around Petrovskyy's request from office to office and from republic to republic. ...Today, as we sat in a sheltered command post, Major Viktor Petrovskyy and his Deputy for Educational and Social-psychological Work, Senior Lieutenant Vasyl Romanenko, laughed as they told this story. But how much civic courage did Petrovskyy need to hold out then, at the dawn of the formation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine? Viktor Mykolayovych had many years of service behind him at a nuclear testing range in Novaya Zemlya. But here, on the mainland, as it were, he had neither picket, nor yard [i.e. nothing]. How would he and his family have managed if he had been thrown overboard from his unit in the Black Sea Fleet? Where would he have been able to turn had this happened? To his old parents in a village near Kryvyy Rih? This does not even bear thinking about... A little over a year and a half ago, the tribulations of the aviation personnel in the small Ukrainian town finally came to an end. At the request of the commander of the unit, the aviation equipment command was made part of the 5th Army of the Ukrainian Air Force. And what did the "wings of the Fatherland" get (and not only they) by taking in the Black Sea Fleet's "foundling"? In addition to a wonderful airfield, a large amount of needed supplies that are in critically short supply. Here are but two figures. The "ownerless" missiles were not the only thing that the unit managed to keep. For example, of the 35 metric tons of fuel used by the 5th Army for flights in 1993, 6 metric tons came from the storage tanks at the Tokmak airfield. Major Petrovskyy's subordinates also helped the young Ukrainian fleet. More than 2,000 full sets of naval issue clothing were handed over to the Ukrainian Navy. Even though we do not serve our Fatherland to grow rich, still, what did the aviators get in return? And here we have some interesting numbers. In the last five years, for its 34 officers and warrant officers, the unit received 14 apartments, nine of which were occupied by their new owners in 1993. For the sake of comparison: Between 1954 and 1989, the unit was assigned only nine apartments. While not all the officers have yet received apartments, all those who wanted a household plot got one. It should be noted that the success in solving questions involving the social welfare of the servicemen is due to the active support of the city authorities. Yevhen Karban, the mayor of Tokmak, has done a great deal for the servicemen. They came to him with a whole variety of requests, and he always showed understanding for their needs and did everything in his power to help them. This year, the city is prepared to give the unit four to five apartments (this means that the housing problem will be removed from the agenda for the next few years). Obviously, on condition that the Ministry of Defense contributes its share to the construction of this housing. I should note that the prices at which the city is offering the military the apartments are more than reasonable. Small wonder that the prestige of serving in the military under these conditions is not falling in the unit but rising! Just before I visited the unit, a Certification Commission met on selecting candidates for contract military service. There were three to four applicants for each vacant private's or sergeant's post. Solving the question of contract servicemen is of great help to the airfield. Judge for yourselves: The 34 officers and warrant officers and 20 term servicemen are responsible for 179 motor vehicles, 150 of which are in their safekeeping, and 418 hectares of land housing more than 30 objects and communications facilities [obyekty and komunikatsiyi]. Thus, every member of the collective has to do his own job and the next man's, as they say. For example, Warrant Officer Kostyantyn Romanenko, whom we mentioned earlier, is simultaneously the chief of the weather station and responsible for the equipment being looked after by the unit. Warrant Officer Petro Nayden holds three jobs simultaneously--he is in charge of PPM, the munitions supply warehouse, and unit's chemical service. Fortunately, guard duty in the unit is performed by militarized security forces [voyenizovana okhorona]. The servicemen guard only two of eight posts. Still, none of the servicemen complain about their lot. They work hard and wait for those in the higher staff to finally listen to what they think. The thing is that for the last two years, the unit commander has submitted numerous proposals regarding improving the unit's organizational and staff structure. So far, there has been neither welcome nor farewell, as the saying goes. This is the only problem that the collective cannot resolve on its own. For example, the problem of heating both living quarters and office premises seemed much more complicated, but they solved it! It had been decided at the outset that the unit would get its heat from a boiler that uses oil fuel. The problems with oil fuel are well known. Still, the servicemen did not give up. Thank God, there is no shortage in the unit of sensible people who are jacks of all trades. They reduced the space they used, closed down some of their facilities, and put electric boilers heated by water in others. Once again, with the help and support of the city authorities and local industrial enterprises... I was about to leave the aviation equipment command on a gloomy February morning. Major Petrovskyy was handing out assignments for the day. His somewhat hoarse voice could be heard quite well near the headquarters. As usual, there were more jobs than people. Nonetheless, the staff orderly [dnyuvalnyy shtabu], Private Vitaliy Malyshev, who could also hear everything the major was saying, said with a smile on his face: "There are only a few of us, but we wear sailors' T-shirts [i.e., we can do anything]. If need be, we'll accept both the Shuttle and Buran." I am convinced that his joke contains a lion's share of truth.
