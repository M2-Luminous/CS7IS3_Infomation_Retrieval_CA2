He answered his own question by establishing the Gorbachev Fund in 1991. The fund absorbs the millions of dollars Gorbachev earns speaking and attending conferences, and through its activities paints a profile of his interests and concerns. As the Soviet Union and Gorbachev's political power crumbled in late 1991, the international socio-economic and political fund, better known as the Gorbachev Fund, was formed from two other institutes: the Economic and Social Reforms Fund, headed by Stanislav Shatalin, a well-known economist, and the Foreign Policy Association, led by Eduard Shevarnadze, former Soviet foreign minister. The structure of the new fund was streamlined to concentrate on two key areas of studies -- Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and the future of civilization, which includes issues concerning Russia's return to Europe, the problems of transforming formerly totalitarian societies, and international paths to democracy. Much of the focus is on domestic affairs, and the typical bread-and-butter reports are devoted to general topics, like the questionable results of "shock therapy" to establish free markets in Russia, the deplorable state of the CIS, the instruments of achieving social stability, and even the crisis of traditional values and the chances for Russian liberalism. With so much criticism of the status quo, it is no wonder that Russian President Boris Yeltsin has felt the heat and attacked the fund. Still, the fund denies it is deliberately antagonistic. "The spirit of confrontation is alien to the fund. Everything that is being done is aimed at promoting the higher national interests of Russia", Grigory Revenko, deputy president of the fund said during an interview with CNA. However, he did not deny that some of Gorbachev's remarks might sound like bitter criticism to Yeltsin. Revenko said all reports and papers from the fund are sent to government offices. "We consider it to be our noble duty," Revenko said, tacitly admitting the fund gets little in response for its work. The new institute was originally supported by the income from several buildings, most notably a hotel on the prestigious Leningradskaya Prospect, which also houses the institute. But the hotel and other sources of funding later became enmeshed in a battle which threatened the fund's survival. On Oct. 7th, 1992, Gorbachev refused for the second time to appear as a witness at the hearings of the Constitutional Court probing the "Communist Party Case." The case sought incidents of criminal behavior in the Communist Party, which Gorbachev headed as chairman. He refused to testify on the basis of presidential immunity. In retaliation, President Yeltsin issued a decree depriving the fund of all of its buildings, including the hotel which provided the fund with its necessary financial independence. The next day, police picketed the building and barred entrance to all employees with the exception of Gorbachev's private secretary and a group of his closest aides. Subsequently, President Yeltsin allowed the fund to lease one thousand square meters of the hotel building, almost two floors. This space accommodates the fund's 130 staff members. Last year,the fund paid 200 million rubles (US$125,000) rent. Today, the Gorbachev Fund draws its finances from voluntary donations from individuals and private companies, and from the royalties and fees given to Gorbachev personally for his lecture- tours, such as here in Taiwan, articles published in the press and TV talk-shows and radio seminars. "The very name Gorbachev remains, along with oil and the space program, one of the most marketable values left in our country," the pro-Yeltsin liberal daily IZVESTIA admitted in 1992. Making profits is not a policy of this think-tank, Revenko, who is also a close aide to Gorbachev, noted in his interview with CNA. Money is still a matter of survival for the fund. "The average pay of our staff is half that of government clerks," he said. And yet, a large part of the fund's activities amount to charity and sponsorship of Russian art and culture. The key project of the fund is focused on saving children with leukemia. More than one million US dollars, collected partially through donations, have been given to a Moscow clinic for children suffering from leukemia. The donation allowed the medical center to acquire sophisticated equipment that has boosted the children's recovery rate to one of the best in the world. The Gorbachev Fund has also provided grants for other medical institutions in the city of Bryansk and in the Stavropol region. The Gorbachev Fund has also given financial support to the children's fund, founded by the Russian film director Rolan Bykov; to the popular literary magazine "THE NEW WORLD;" and to the publishing house producing the collective works of the famous Russian philosopher Vladimir Vernadsky. The fund's list of projects seems endless. It sponsored a TV program "The Green Lamp;" and launched, in cooperation with the fund in support of art, a monthly magazine "VIA REGIA." It sponsors training of young Russian talent in foreign universities. In Moscow, the fund conducts classes for school teachers of the northern district of Moscow, and at one time, it tutored young specialists in political science, introducing them to the problem of conflict management and public speaking. Still, with all of these activities, the center of the Gorbachev Fund remains Mikhail Sergaivich Gorbachev -- his lectures and speeches, his conferences and his TV appearances. This first visit to Taiwan is a part of the fund's ever expanding concern. "The fund is keen to establish fruitful relationships with similar foreign funds and with research centers abroad. First contacts with such institutions in South Korea and Taiwan were made, and we are optimistic," Revenko told CNA. CNA asked Revenko if there was a central set of principles that drew together the many activities of the Gorbachev Fund. "We continue to preach and practice the ideals to which we pledged loyalty back in 1985, we still believe in democratization, freedom of economic activity and glasnost." Glasnost is the Russian word for openness and accountability, applicable to how the triangle of government mass media and the general public interreact.
