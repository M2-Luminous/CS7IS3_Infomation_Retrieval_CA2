FR940118-1-00008 FR940118-1-00005 Therefore, the Assistant Secretary proposes, in the best interests of the Federal Government, to extend the current projects for one additional year with the Federal Government bearing the cost. This proposal is consistent with the President's mandate to implement cost-effective, cost-saving initiatives. In order to make these cost extensions, the Assistant Secretary must waive the regulation at 34 CFR 75.261, which permits extensions of projects only at no cost to the Federal Government. In consideration of the foregoing, the Assistant Secretary proposes to waive 34 CFR 75.261 as applied to the DFSCA Regional Centers Program during FY 1994. Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification The Assistant Secretary certifies that this waiver would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The limited number of entities affected by this waiver are current centers and potential applicants under a new competition with a limited project period of 12 months. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 This waiver has been examined under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 and has been found to contain no information collection requirements. Intergovernmental Review This program is subject to the requirements of Executive Order 12372 and the regulations in 34 CFR Part 79. The objective of the Executive order is to foster an intergovernmental partnership and a strengthened federalism by relying on processes developed by State and local governments for coordination and review of proposed Federal financial assistance. In accordance with this order, this document is intended to provide early notification of the Department's specific plans and actions for this program.
