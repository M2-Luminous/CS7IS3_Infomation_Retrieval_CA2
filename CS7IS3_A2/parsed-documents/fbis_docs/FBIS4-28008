Of course, with Thailand this is always different, unless they themselves are the `victim' of neighborly meddling in their own internal affairs. So armed with the usual double standards, the Thais continue to meddle and flex their muscles in the internal affairs of Cambodia, their favorite `weak' neighbor. A recent glaring example of this affair is when General Charan Kunlawanit, head of Thai National Security Council, embroiled himself in Cambodia's internal affairs when he dispatched a diplomatic note warning Australian foreign Minister Gareth Evans to reject His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk's plea for military aid for the Kingdom of Cambodia. General Charan apparently argued that aid would expose Cambodia as a puppet of the West. The question about what General Charan's role is in this matter has turned out to be an interesting one. Never mine that the Khmer Rouge has all this time received support from certain segments of the Thai military, which makes them to be puppets of Thailand. This turn of events is highly suprising for a man who personally vetoed a U.S. request last year for permission to put up aerial reconnaisance to monitor Khmer Rouge movements along the Thai border, as reported in the FAR EASTERN ECONOMIC REVIEW. General Charan's neutrality is of course a foregone conclusion, especially in light of his comments to the BANGKOK POST a year earlier, when he said Thailand would "be crazy" to sever ties with the Khmer Rouge. The rebels "share the same fence as ours. Boycott them and we endanger our own being" the good general said. Naturally, General Charan is not representative of the whole of Thailand, but what is clear is that Thailand is not in too much of a hurry to see Indochina, especially Cambodia's in-fighting stamped out -- not if Thailand stands to gain from another long, drawn out war. And so the Thai comedy plays on.
