Deputy director Martynov also said that his enterprise and another company, whose name he did not disclose, has begun to produce a physical amplifier (metathrone) Miranda, developed on the basis of fundamental achievements in the field of psychotronics. The weekly conducted an independent research, which revealed that work indeed had been done at the plant to produce metathrones, which are regarded as a side branch of psychotronic weapons. Such devices have long been used in the American industry to locate and establish the causes of any systemic failures. The weekly cites specialists as saying that "on September 24, 1990 an agreement was signed between the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of the United States and the KGB of the USSR on joint research in the field of psychotronics". The weekly said however that cooperation in this field has not developed.
