However, AZAPO President Itumeleng Mosala warned that the government of national unity was incapable of meeting the political and economic aspirations of the black majority. "Our people did not choose a government. They merely endorsed a settlement," he said of last week's elections. Prof Mosala said at a press conference in Cape Town the interim constitution compromised the demands of the black majority on land and the transfer of power. A coalition government could not deliver desperately-needed socio-economic transformation. "The poverty and alienation of our people is so desperate that you need an effective government to deal with these issues. This settlement has failed to bring about a transfer of power to an effective government and has betrayed the interests of our people." Prof Mosala said he had noted Mr Mandela's offer to accommodate leaders of the Pan-Africanist Congress and AZAPO in his cabinet, but no formal offer had yet been made. "AZAPO will receive whatever gesture is made in the spirit in which it is made. Our central committee will consider the matter and respond." He said AZAPO would not "act as spoilers" to frustrate the implementation of the ANC's Reconstruction and Development Programme, but would seek support for alternative development programmes. Prof Mosala predicted AZAPO would become "the political home of millions" as the masses became disillusioned with a new government's failure to deliver socio-economic change. "We will fight the elections next time round and we will win those elections. AZAPO also intends winning the Western Cape when the time comes." He said the ANC failed to win the Western Cape because it "failed to take seriously" the needs and fears of the coloured community.
