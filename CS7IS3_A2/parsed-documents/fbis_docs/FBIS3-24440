Margolin, director of the EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN Economic and Legal Consultation and Business Information Agency's legal center: "State Privatization Program: Internal Contradictions"] [Text] The State Program of Privatization of State and Municipal Enterprises went into effect beginning 1 January. One has to admit with regret, however, that the long-awaited and finally adopted state program has inherited two main shortcomings from its 1992 predecessor. Namely, failure to describe the main mechanisms for implementation of a score of requirements defined in a most general form, and obvious and hidden contradictions. Without claiming an exhaustive analysis of the document, we would like to offer some comments on individual provisions of the state privatization program. I. Buyout of Land Lots The most impressive example of imperfections of the former kind is the remaining uncertainty in the matter of buyout of land lots by privatized enterprises. Can one use privatization vouchers for buyouts? If so, to what extent (along with rubles)? In what form should one apply and what is the time frame for review? Which precise property fund (oblast, rayon) is the seller? (The state program mentions "corresponding property funds.") What are the procedures for interaction between rayon and city land use committees and property funds in the buyout process? Does an enterprise acquired in the process of privatization as a single property complex won in a bid or at auction have the right to buy out the land lot? (It is easy to see that the existing norm in the current law, duplicated by Article 5.3.7. of the state program--regarding the requirement that more than 80 percent of shares of privatized enterprise must be first sold for vouchers--covers only facilities converted to joint-stock holding.) The answers to these and many similar questions remain up in the air. As do the proclamations of the official ideologists of privatization of enhancing its attractiveness through state emission of "land privatization vouchers." II. Reorganization of Enterprises Undergoing Privatization Neither are many practical problems of privatization removed by another provision literally borrowed from current economic legislation--that structural subunits are not permitted to be separated from privatized enterprises (with the potential autonomous privatization of these subunits) if they constitute "a single technological complex." Skipping the interpretation of the latter notion, the program provides poor aid to the work of commissions on arbitration of disputes between state enterprises and their subunits, which currently act under the guidance of the joint directive of the Russian Federation GKI [State Committee for the Administration of State Property] and Russian Federation GKAP [State Committee for Antimonopoly Policy and Support of New Economic Structures] No. LB 4953 and No. 1898-r, dated 3 November 1993. III. Sale of Equity (Interest, Shares) Owned by the State Despite outward operational simplicity, the problem of privatizing state equity in partnerships and joint-stock companies of mixed form of ownership is still shrouded in mystery. Article 5.2 of the program says that the corresponding state equity (blocks of stock) must be sold through auctions and bids. Meanwhile, the procedures for holding them remain unclear, as also the forms and time frame within which the winners in these actions and bids must pay for this interest, information support for this procedure, who may initiate privatization of state-owned equity in joint ventures, limited liability partnerships, joint-stock companies, and so on. It is indicative that this is the only privatization method of those included in the general list that has not received any comments in the text of Part 5 of the state program. IV. Status of Property Contributions By State Enterprises In the Charter Capital of Other Enterprises Comparison of the previous (1992) and current texts of the privatization program show that its authors no longer insist that state enterprises' contributions to the charter capital (funds) of enterprises of any organizational-legal form be considered state property and property funds--their legal successors (Paragraphs 4 and 6 of Article 5.1 of the 1992 state program). It is clear that this provision obviously contradicted Article 14 of the RSFSR Law "On Property in the RSFSR," the methodology of appraising state enterprises' property in determining the size of charter capital (Decree No. 66 of the Russian Federation President dated 29 January 1992) and standard privatization plan. However, the problems that have emerged as a result of applying this provision of the old state program last year, for instance, are thereby not resolved at all. The corresponding interest in "business type" enterprises, which at the insistence of some committees and property funds was not included in appraisals, quite often is still carried on joint-stock companies' books. The conundrum of this situation is that now the legal base for transferring the rights to these contributions (blocks of shares) to property funds is absent. The property has in a way ended up in neverland: On one hand, it is not recognized as the property of the AOOT's [publicly held joint-stock company], which are the legal successors of state enterprises; on the other, it has not been really transferred to the funds, which in addition have lost the prospects for a legally documented transfer of the corresponding rights. From the examples above one may draw the following conclusions. Either the state program's authors assumed in advance that this document cannot, and should not, be a direct-action normative act; or they deliberately gave carte blanche to regional committees and property funds to engage in various sorts of improvisations. It should be noted that the former hypothesis is only partially supported. Thereby giving legitimacy to the latter. Really, the state program assumes, for instance, that giving officials of bodies of state administration the role of representing the interests of the state in joint-stock companies' boards of directors, the procedures for maintaining the stockholder register, and the procedure for preparation and conduct of a general shareholder meeting of a publicly held joint-stock company are to be spelled out in special statutes drafted and approved by the Russian State Committee for the Administration of State Property or with its direct participation. One would think that if we just have patience and wait for the issuance of these administrative acts, complete harmony will come to reign in matters of the mechanism of implementing the corresponding requirements of the state program. Alas, this is only a first glance and incorrect impression. No matter how perfect from the standpoint of corresponding procedures these documents may end up being, their authors clearly will attempt to keep them from contradicting the main text of the state program. Thus frequently driving future executors up a normative dead end of sorts. V. Joint-Stock Company Administrative Bodies. Stockholders General Meeting Let us pay attention, for instance, to the fact that the first of the aforementioned statutes, whose development is envisaged by Point 3 of Article 2.3 of the state program, will include the institution of representing the holder of the controlling share of stock in a joint-stock company--the state--for some reason only on the board of directors. At the same time, the procedures for their participation in general meetings of stockholders apparently remained undefined. The same is confirmed, by the way, by another provision of the same point of the state program, which says that officials of bodies of state administration will represent the interests of the state in the boards of directors on a contract basis. Does it follow from this that the right to vote for the corresponding share of stock may be given to other functionaries of corresponding departments? Can the state be represented at general stockholders meetings, in the event the controlling share of stock is "frozen" in state ownership up to three years, by, for instance, representatives of holding companies or FPGs [financial-industrial group] operating in the same sectors as the joint-stock company? Answers to these and similar questions apparently take us into the sphere of rather creative interpretations of the program. In any case, the second provision of Article 11.4 ("Representatives of the administration and employees of joint-stock companies cannot act as representatives of the state at shareholders meetings and on the board of directors") appears to mean, after all, representatives of this particular joint-stock company. The latter assumption, however, is based only on a common sense judgment. Unfortunately, the program authors, while including in it some mandatory provisions, clearly forgot about this. This involves, in particular, such requirements enumerated in Point 9 as mandatory mailing to participants in the general shareholder meeting materials on the meeting agenda, including ballots for voting in elections of the audit commission. The point is that by its legal and commercial nature, most plans for shareholder meetings are of a confidential nature (first and foremost with respect to setting up new enterprises on a shared basis with other partners; board of directors and audit commission's reports, which enumerate joint-stock company clients; some especially sensitive intra-company provisions; etc.). Thus, in attempting to "protect shareholders' rights" in the form of the utmost openness, according to the logic of the state program the joint-stock company's executive bodies must deliberately put themselves in conflict with investors and partners in cooperation. As to the requirement of mailing electoral ballots for the audit commission's election (assuming, of course, that they will not be blank forms, which would be absurd), this is technically impossible altogether. As is known, current legislation does not contain any restrictions regarding stockholders' rights to be nominated for membership in this control body of the joint-stock company. For instance, current legislation does not have the requirement that the written consent of the nominee must be obtained and the nomination procedure completed one week before the meeting (unlike, for instance, nominations to the board of directors). Which means that stockholders may nominate their representatives to the audit commission right at the meeting. What is the point then in mailing the ballots home? Another item that clearly contradicts common sense and current legislation is the restriction contained in Point 9.10.6 of the state program with respect to converting publicly held joint-stock companies into privately held joint-stock companies and limited liability partnerships (and all publicly held companies at that, not only successors to state-owned enterprises); and the quotas on membership of outside investors in their boards of directors. The point is not that these bans are easy to circumvent (which is precisely what happens in practice). The issue is whether we should expect much of the provisions in the state program given that they have absorbed the norms launched into legislative orbit in total disregard of the entire sum of other current legislative acts, as well as stockholders' true--not perceived--interests. The answer to the latter question suggests that as in 1992-1993, committees for the administration of property, property funds, working privatization commissions, as well as executive bodies of joint-stock companies will have to resort to quite major improvisations in using the norms of the document under review. Essentially, one is led to this conclusion also by direct contradictions within the state program, of an internal nature, and the different interpretations that are inevitable in comparing it with other normative acts. An example. According to Article 17.5 of the state program, activities of unregistered financial-industrial groups are not permitted. Meanwhile, this does not follow from the main document regulating the process of creation of FPGs--Edict No. 2096 of the Russian Federation President of 5 December 1993. The functioning of full-fledged FPGs, a long as they do not claim the right to use in their company name the words "financial-industrial group," and the corresponding state preferences for those that have been approved by the State Committee on Industry, is not forbidden at all.
