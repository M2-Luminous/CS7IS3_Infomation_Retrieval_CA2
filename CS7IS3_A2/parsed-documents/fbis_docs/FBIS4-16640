Aleksandr Savchenko said that inflation had dropped to 8 percent in March from more than 50 percent last December, 19 percent in January, and 12 percent in February. He put the number of state companies now in private hands at more than 3000 or 4 percent of the total. He said that 10 percent of the industry had already been privatized with the privatization figure for the light, timber and wood processing industries running at 30 percent. The same indicator for the services sector reached 20 percent. A total of 88 percent of collective farms have been transformed into cooperatives, partnerships and stock-holding companies. The number of private farms runs at 30,000. At the same time, Savchenko said that nothing short of financial aid from EBRD, IMF and the World Bank could help Kiev cut its budget deficit, halt inflation and speed up the privatization of large enterprises. He pointed to EBRD's involvement in a project to promote Ukrainian exports and attract private investment to develop Ukrainian port facilities on the Black Sea coast. The updating of 1200 gas pumping stations and a length of more than 2,500 km gas pipelines is one other possible area of cooperation, Savchenko said.
