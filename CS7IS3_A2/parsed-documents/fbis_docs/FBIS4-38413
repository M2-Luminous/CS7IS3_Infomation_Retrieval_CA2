Regions Combat Moscow and Bad Weather"] [Text] The changing weather of May meant continuous troubles for the organizers of the "Federalism And Interethnic Relations in Modern Russia" conference that ended in the "Forest Vistas" [Lesnyye Dali] guest house near Moscow Saturday. First, owing to the sudden spell of cool weather and other state affairs, Ivan Rybkin and Sergey Filatov could not make it to the conference. Second, the participants in the conference, whom the inclement weather drove under the roof of the main building of the guest house, started to show marked boredom by the end of the first day and started to slip away. Even despite the absence of the heads of the State Duma and the President's Staff, however, it was full house during the first plenary sitting, with Sergey Shakhray, who had not been permitted to quit [as vice premier] the day before, appearing on the panel apparently as an attraction. The vice premier, who presented a paper [doklad] on the problems of federalism in Russia, expressed the conviction that the main problem is a contradiction between the ethnic and territorial principle of the state's construction (the "asymmetrical" nature of the federation), and he once again lauded the treaty with Tataria [Tatarstan] whose model, in Shakhray's words, is quite applicable in Crimea, the Dniester Region, and Karabakh. The vice premier also complained that market relations in conditions of weakness of federal authorities increase regional disproportions, and declared for regulation of prices of energy and shipping by rail. Shakhray's speech provided the point of departure for the conference participants, who had come, according to its organizers, from 66 federation components. Remarkably, the number of critics of the "May Theses" [Shakhray's keynote address, paralleled with Lenin's "April Theses"] was greater than of those who went along with them. For example, Ramazan Abdulatipov, Federation Council vice speaker, deemed the signing of separate agreements with federation components to be incorrect, while delegates from the republics did not like the idea of a gradual transition to a territorial structure of the federation. Despite the cool weather outside the window, especially heated debates flared up during the second day of work at the sittings of the sections and "roundtables." In the course of the discussion the participants divided in two big distinct groups: representatives of the republics, who demolished the new Constitution, which should never have been passed in a referendum, and those who were demanding that the Federation Treaty be religiously observed and suggested that separate agreements be signed with all who would like to sign them. Delegates of the krays and oblasts (supported by Moscow politicians and academics) tried to persuade the "republicans" not to hurt ethnic Russians, to give up the idea of sovereignty and remake their constitutions as Moscow is asking for. At the end, everyone remained of the same opinion, agreeing only that the State Duma, 40 percent of whose members are Muscovites, cannot reflect the regions' interests adequately.
