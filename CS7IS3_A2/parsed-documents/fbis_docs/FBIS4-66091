Dropping its usual diplomatic language, the Commission singled out France and Denmark for lax fiscal policy along with more familiar laggards led by Spain, Greece, Italy, and Portugal. The UK, which has introduced record tax increases to curb a 50 billion pound budget deficit, escapes criticism on the fiscal side. But Mr John Major's government receives an unwelcome warning from Brussels about the risks of inflation. The criticism appears in an update of the Commission's macroeconomic guidelines which are intended to serve as a blueprint for the EU to the end of the century and a framework for achieving a single currency. Union heads of government approved the first version of the guidelines at the Brussels summit last December. The latest paper has been adjusted to take account of the economic recovery now under way in Europe. Mr Henning Christophersen, the economics commissioner, stressed the importance of reducing budget deficits. He expressed concern about the recent rise in long-term interest rates in Europe and said measures should be taken to reduce them so as not to harm the recovery. The Commission paper calls for a "clear confirmation" in member states' 1995 budgets that fiscal consolidation is under way. It urged Belgium to match its budget targets, and called on Spain, Portugal and Greece to embark on long-term budget pruning. The Commission also noted that in Denmark and France "it is important to ensure that the fiscal expansion is reversed as the economy gains momentum." On inflation rates, the Commission says Spain, Portugal, Italy and Britain have yet to decline into the range set by the macroeconomic guidelines. Its prediction that Italy and the UK "are expected to approach it significantly next year" may irritate Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor of the exchequer, who has already clashed with Brussels over its lower growth forecast for the UK.
