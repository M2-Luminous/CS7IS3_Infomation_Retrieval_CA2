Relevant government authorities in charge of North Korean economic affairs on 5 March said: Since the second half of 1993, North Korea has been instituting, on a trial basis, a system for privatizing land cultivation rights for farmers in certain areas by which the North Korean authorities take a certain proportion of the harvested farm produce as a fee for the land and the farmers privately own the remainder of the farm produce. The government official in charge of North Korean economic affairs said the government authorities have recently learned that North Korea has been secretly instituting this experimental reform measure in areas such as Hoeryong in North Hamgyong Province, where the residents are mostly political prisoners. North Korea is instituting this measure secretively on a family basis and is thoroughly cutting off the areas from the outside. The government official said: "North Korea seems to be experimenting on capitalist market economy principles by partly permitting cultivation rights and maintaining the present North Korean system to solve its serious food shortage problem." The official added, "North Korea selected the areas where political prisoners live for the experiment in order to closely study the possible effect of the change on the maintenance of the present North Korean system through the people most critical of the present North Korean system." Another expert on North Korean affairs commented: "This is a significant change as it represents signs of a North Korean experiment on new land reform for the first time in 36 years since private ownership and land cultivation rights disappeared in North Korea in 1958."
