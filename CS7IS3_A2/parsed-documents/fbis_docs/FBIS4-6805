Bandung PIKIRAN RAKYAT regrets that the protests demanding greater welfare lost their direction and that conscience was replaced by emotions. The Medan incident, which cost lives and property, has obviously marred the sacred struggle of the Indonesian workers. PIKIRAN RAKYAT hopes that officials in charge of manpower more actively monitor the condition of workers in their respective areas in the wake of the Medan incident. ANGKATAN BERSENJATA focuses on who is behind the protests. It says the culprit is none other than the so-called Indonesian Prosperous Trade Union or SBSI. The minister of manpower does not recognize SBSI as an organization representing workers. Moreover, the organization has not been registered, and its existence has not been endorsed by the minister of home affairs. However, SBSI continues to conduct its activities, while the press consciously or unconsciously helps promote the organization by giving wide converage to its statements and activities. SBSI does not stop its activities, although workers are indifferent to some of its activities. Its methods -- agitation, dissemination of rumors, and mass action -- led to violence. In the wake of the incident, ANGKATAN BERSENJATA calls for a comprehensive investigation of SBSI's involvement in the Medan protests, including subsequent action against its leaders. Meanwhile, the daily urges the All Indonesian Trade Union [SPSI] as an organization representing workers to be more sensitive to the aspirations of its members. Focusing on the incident, POS KOTA says the Medan protests showed that the Pancasila industrial relations system is not working as it should. According to POS KOTA, it is very important to implement the Pancasila industrial relations system in local private companies, let alone in foreign private companies. It has often been questioned as to why most businessmen refuse to sign employment agreements and allow SPSI to set up units in working places and why the government has no power to require or force them to do so. The question has yet to be fully answered, POS KOTA concludes.
