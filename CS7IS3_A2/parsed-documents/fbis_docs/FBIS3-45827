Just dial 1601155 -- everything is at your fingertips. The 160 Wonder Information Centre, an employment hot line, has been helping job hunters since last August. As a branch of the Beijing Tonke Information and Technology Development Company, it is the first such service in China. "Station 160 is now known as `know-all' in Beijing," said Mei Nan, an official of Tonke. People who want to find a new job or change professions can phone the station, explain their needs to an operator, and get the needed information in just a few seconds. An individual's resume and an enterprise's brochure can be stored in the station's "Wonder" computer network. Registered individuals and companies also can go to the station to search for information directly. The computer contains background information on more than 400 companies and 6,000 job seekers. The job hot line is a joint venture between the Beijing Telecommunications Administration and Wonder Information Centre, a private enterprise. The Tonke Company, an arm of the Beijing Telecommunications Administration, also manages seven other 160 branch stations plus a comprehensive station offering a wider range of services. "Even some big names such as Stone Computer Company and the Holiday Inn Lido Hotel are registered here," said Li Guige, executive chief of the station. The service operates daily for 14 hours, from 8:30 am to 10:30 pm, and can handle 500 calls each day. The job-finding information stations and the comprehensive station are serving the public well. In Beijing, for example, about 34 percent of the people registered have said the hot line helped them find a satisfying job. According to the latest statistics, sales promoters are most in demand -- more than 50 percent of the registered enterprises want to fill such positions. People skilled in computer sciences, secretarial work and public relations also are eagerly sought. Of the people registered with the hot line, 28 percent have graduated from a university, and 4 percent have double bachelor's degrees. "We aim to attract senior managers and scholars to enter our network, such as scientists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and famous professors at Beijing University," Li said.
