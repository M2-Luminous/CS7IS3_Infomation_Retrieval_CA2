What can you say about this? [Radetskyy] A total of 2,000 combat units are subject to removal. The first train with 60 combat units left Ukraine for its destination site on 4 March. One could ask, why only 60? Just because this is a technically founded norm. The next trainload was due to leave for Russia on 9 March. This did not happen, though; and it was not the fault of Ukraine. The point is that there was an information leak in the Russian press that revealed the departure date. Can you imagine what could have happened if some lunatic, or a group of people, had decided to follow the example of Herostratus [who burned a famous Greek temple to become famous]? I believe that it would be better if journalists stuck to the Hippocratic principle of "do not harm." As for the next shipment, it did leave Ukraine, but not before we made sure that all precautionary measure were taken along its route. Ukraine has always had a serious attitude toward its commitments. [Chernomorskiy] The press has recently published a lot of articles about the excessive number of generals in the Ukrainian Army. They say that Ukraine has more generals than all of the NATO countries combined. [Radetskyy] The Ukrainian Army, numbering more than half a million servicemen, has 260 generals. So, in this respect, it is not all that different from other Armed Forces in Europe. But this issue did not appear out of nowhere -- Ukraine does have many generals. The point is that they are attached to different ministries and committees, and have nothing to do with the Army. Plus, 260 is not a final figure. Under certain conditions, it could be revised and reduced. These conditions, however, do not exist at present. The Academy of Ukrainian Armed Forces will become operational on 1 September. Beside Ukrainian officers, it will accept foreign and CIS officers for study. As it will need experienced scholars, generals with vast expertise will surely be invited to teach at this institution. [Chernomorskiy] A lot of speculation was raised by the statement of Vice Admiral Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy, commander in chief of the Ukrainian Navy, when he said our country has no intention of selling its share of the Black Sea Fleet. At the same time, Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian defense minister, insists that the agreements made in Massandra be honored. [Radetskyy] There was no Massandra agreement as such, to begin with. Only an agreement on intentions was signed. I believe that these intentions will be implemented only by mutual agreement of the Ukrainian and Russian presidents, who are also commanders in chief of their Armed Forces. They are empowered to make a final decision. In any case, we should clearly define what is subject to division or sale. This is why on 15 March, we began an inventory of the Black Sea Fleet assets as of December 1991, after which Russia and Ukraine are to determine to what degree the fleet should be scaled down. In the end, the final course of action is to be made during the third stage. In any case, Ukraine will not be left without the fleet. Even today, the Ukrainian Navy includes five combat ships, and there are still new ships under construction at Ukrainian shipyards! [Chernomorskiy] What is the situation in the Air Force? According to evidence gathered by our newspaper, 300 pilots have applied for discharges; because of fuel shortages, they rarely get the chance to fly, losing their skills. The 19 unique TU-160 aircraft, costing $250 million a piece, are also sitting idle on the ground. Their maintenance must be quite expensive, I presume. Maybe we should sell them? [Radetskyy] Your paper's evidence is, to put it mildly, overstated. There were no more than 100 pilots who requested discharges. These were primarily officers whose length of service makes them eligible for retirement. Some want to change their citizenship and move to another CIS country for permanent residence. This is a natural process. At the same time, I admit that there are reasons for concern. Depending on the type of aircraft, the standard annual flight time for U.S., German, or Dutch pilots is 160-180 hours. This norm was a little lower in the former Soviet Air Force. In Ukraine, it is 25-40 hours in most Air Force units. Of course, the pilots did not fold their wings. They fully exploit training facilities, which unfortunately, cannot substitute for real flying. Now, about the TU-160's, as Ukrainian airspace is too small, our strategy does not envision employing these planes. I personally believe that these planes can be sold -- not for money, though. The dollars or rubles that we would receive for them could get past the Defense Ministry, disappearing in different channels. We would be better off if the other party would pay with components for combat and army aviation vehicles, fuel, or diesel fuel for housing construction. Of course, it is up to the government and president whether or not those planes need to be sold. [Chernomorskiy] You mentioned housing construction. How many servicemen are without a place to live? How is this problem being tackled? [Radetskyy] As of 1 March 1994, there were 78,236 officers and warrant officers in the Ukrainian Armed Forces without housing. According to a state program, the Defense Ministry will receive between 24,000 and 28,000 apartments annually. Unfortunately, the state is not in a position to implement this program right now. Last year, we were given only 14,000 apartments in spite of the active engagement of several foreign companies in the housing projects. Things will hardly improve over the next two years. I would like to note, however, that a great deal depends not only on the state budget, but on the attitude of local authorities as well. For example, Dniepropetrovsk, Ivano-Frankovsk, Lvov, and Chernigov Oblasts cope with the problem of housing for the military much better than other regions. [Chernomorskiy] What are your impressions from your recent trip to the United States? [Radetskyy] I was part of the president's team and, at the same time, a guest of newly appointed U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry. I was quite impressed with my visit to the Pentagon, but it was not over its size or number of hallways. I was stunned by the atmosphere of openness. You know, I am not 20 years old and can tell real candor from phony. All my questions were comprehensively answered. They saw a partner in me, not a potential adversary. I also had a chance to visit West Point, the oldest military academy in the United States. Our readers would be curious to know that this military institution recently began to admit women. Representatives of the fairer sex account for 12 percent of all cadets at the academy; beautiful, but not weak. I myself saw young women do 50 and more push-ups. U.S. servicemen have an almost fanatical attitude toward sports. One could think they want to restore the traditions of ancient Sparta. West Point cadets are the elite of the U.S. Armed Forces. I am very pleased that the U.S. defense secretary and I reached an agreement on sending a group of our boys to study there. Finishing on the topic of military educational, I must admit that serious blunders were made while reforming our system of military education. Incidentally, this issue was brought up in parliament by deputies of different orientations. I believe that the Defense Ministry conducted too passive a policy in this sphere, and did very little to turn our academies into forges turning out officers for CIS and other countries. U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry has recently paid a return visit to Kiev. The Americans were pleased with its results, and expressed their hope that contacts between our two ministries will continue to expand and strengthen.
