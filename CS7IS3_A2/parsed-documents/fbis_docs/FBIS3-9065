This was a result of a serious commitment by the United States, international pressure, and perhaps the obligation of Russian diplomacy in the Balkans. Judging from the rate and outcome of these efforts and the results in the field, we reckon that, at least, this stops that part of the conflict, avoids that part of the war, the most absurd part of the war -- the Croat-Bosnian war. Of course, it points out the aggressor more, against whom there should be no illusions. However, the line of political isolation and the strict application of sanctions should continue, and they must be conditioned by other elements of the crisis. Of course, the results of this agreement bring to the fore those other elements which, because of the tragedy of the war in Bosnia, have been somewhat marginalized. Here I want to point out the problem of Kosova and reiterate that by signing the agreement, this is the first step, a step that should be followed by other measures to solve the crisis definitively, a crisis that cannot be solved without finding an acceptable and stable solution to the Kosova issue and the pan-Albanian problem in the Balkans.
