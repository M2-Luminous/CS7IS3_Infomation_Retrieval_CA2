FR940323-2-00052 FR940323-2-00036 [Docket No. RP94&hyph;102&hyph;000] Carnegie Natural Gas Co.; Petition for Cancellation of Technical Conference March 17, 1994. Take notice that on March 14, 1994, Carnegie Natural Gas Company (Carnegie) filed with the Commission a motion to cancel a technical conference previously ordered. On January 28, 1994, the Commission issued an order in response to Carnegie's filing to direct bill Account No. 858 costs, and established a technical conference to address the concerns of Carnegie's customers. Carnegie states that it believes that the concerns expressed by New Jersey Natural Gas Company (New Jersey) and the Columbia Distribution Companies have already been decided by the Commission in other proceedings. Carnegie argues that the issues identified by the parties have either been resolved by the Commission or mooted as a result of the tariff sheets filed by Carnegie in Docket No. RS92&hyph;30&hyph;000, and this supports the cancellation of the technical conference in this proceeding. Carnegie also seeks an order summarily approving its tariff filing. Carnegie states that copies of the filing has been served upon each person designated on the official service list compiled by the Secretary in this proceeding. Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rule 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure 18 CFR 385.211. All such protests should be filed on or before March 24, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
