Speaking at a work meeting on straightening out the problem of circulating fund shortages among major industries and trades in the northeastern region here today, Yang Changji, vice minister in charge of the State Economic and Trade Commission, said: Leading comrades in both the party's Central Committee and the State Council have been constantly attaching importance to reform and development of state-owned enterprises. For years, although conditions of state-owned enterprises have improved following the introduction of various state policies and measures, certain problems remained. Currently, due to the problems of circulating fund shortages, sluggish products sales, and overstocks experienced by some state-owned industrial enterprises, defaults of goods payments among enterprises have become relatively serious. Yang Changji said: The causes leading to the current mutual indebtedness among enterprises have both similarities to and differences from those of the past. The similarities involve investments in fixed assets, fund shortages, behind-schedule funding, and unsuccessful local fund-raising, while one difference is that more and more funds have been diverted to enterprises in producing finished products this year. Wanton price revision by some enterprises and overall rises in production costs are new causes. He said: The general principle for solving the problem of mutual indebtedness among enterprises should be strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control, deepening reform, and taking measures aimed at effecting a permanent solution to the problem, under which enterprises themselves will be playing a leading role in seeing that no new debts will be incurred while exercising stricter control over fixed asset investment, restricting production, reducing stocks, and promoting sales. In the meantime, we need prompt actions that may bring quick results, including using the smallest possible amount of credit loans to improve cash flow, solving the problem of circulating fund shortages among major industries and trades, and guaranteeing the normal production of state-owned enterprises as well as social stability. It has been learned that major industries selected for solving the problems of circulating fund shortages are coal, metallurgy, nonferrous metals, electric power, chemical engineering, and forestry. Since March, the State Economic and Trade Commission, the People's Bank of China, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, and the Coal Industry Ministry have managed to help the metallurgical, electric power, and chemical engineering industries settle goods payments due to 20 provinces and municipalities and 75 major coal mines. The estimated clearance of over 4 billion yuan will help alleviate the coal industry's fund shortage problem to a certain degree. Currently, thorough investigations into the problem of circulating funds shortages in the five industries of metallurgy, electric power, nonferrous metals, chemical engineering, and forestry in the northeastern region have completed. Yang Changji emphasized: In settling the goods payments of enterprises among each other, we should lend support to enterprises whose products are in demand and marketable and refrain from injecting funds into enterprises with slow product sales and overstocks. In the meantime, strict checks should be conducted to ensure that no circulating funds will go to fixed assets, that all loss-making activities caused by fixed assets investment will be stopped from top to bottom, and that funds designated for settling debts will not be diverted to engineering works and equipment under both infrastructure construction and technical transformation programs. We should intensify efforts to prevent new debts and, in particular, enforce strict settlements when dealing with some enterprises which simply refuse to pay without reason. Practices of unreasonably holding or returning bills or refusing to pay without grounds should be rectified conscientiously. Addressing the meeting, Zhang Xiao, president of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, disclosed: In a bid to ease the conditions of enterprises' fund shortages, banks have enlarged their margins for loans involving circulating funds since the second quarter. Recently, the State Council also adopted a policy of handling loans involving circulating funds on a case-to-case basis. With all these measures, the problem of circulating fund shortages among enterprises should be alleviated. She also pointed out: In solving the problems of circulating fund shortages and mutual indebtedness of goods payments among enterprises, the only way out is to exercise stricter control over investment in fixed assets and excessive rises in consumption funds and the enforcement of the policy of "restricting production, reducing stocks, and promoting sales" against unmarketable products -- and not to rely on relaxation of the money market.
