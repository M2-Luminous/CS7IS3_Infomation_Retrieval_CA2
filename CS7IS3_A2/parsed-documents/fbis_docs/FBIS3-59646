In China, all of the power plants that are in operation or are planned are the pressurized water reactor (PWR) type, but the course from now on is to deal with BWR power plants. To Hitachi, Toshiba, General Electric of the U.S., and other companies that deal with BWRs, a new market will open for nuclear power plants in the 1,000-megawatt class, one of which costs Â¥300 to 500 billion. To TEPCO, as well, the effect of mass production will lead to lower costs in the introduction of nuclear power. Of the different types of BWRs, China shows interest in the advanced boiling water reactor (ABWR), which has simplified mechanics and keeps construction costs down. TEPCO told China about the features of an ABWR: 1) the reactor housing vessel and reactor building are small, and 2) the thermal efficiency is 1.1% higher than that of a conventional BWR. TEPCO is building an ABWR, which was jointly developed by TEPCO, Hitachi, Toshiba, and GE, at its Kashiwazaki-Kariwa power plant (Kashiwazaki-shi; output: 1,356 kW). Because the transmission and transformer systems in China are small--Chinese-produced steam turbines are 600,000-kW-class--they are not the 1,000,000-kW-class large-scale equipment as in Japan, so even with ABWRs China wants 600,000-kW-class mid-scale reactors. China's independently developed Qinshan No. 1 reactor will go into operation next year. Then, the Qinshan No. 2 and No. 3 reactors, and the Guangdong No. 1 and No. 2 reactors, the technology for which is being introduced from France, are under construction. All of those are PWRs. There is also a plan underway to build a nuclear power plant in Liaoning Province based on a nuclear power plant construction cooperation agreement with Russia. That will also use a PWR. However, limiting all nuclear power to PWRs apparently was judged as not good for national policy. China's route is to provide about 10% of its electricity with nuclear power by 2010, and for that it will need 20 to 30 nuclear power plants. There is a high possibility that China will become a huge market for the nuclear power industry.
