Foreign Minister Kooijmans called for this position in a letter to his U.S. counterpart Warren Christopher. Kooijmans has also called on his European partners to end the continuing speculation about the withdrawal of their troops from Bosnia. Earlier this week Defense Minister Ter Beek said that the withdrawal of UN troops from Bosnia would mean the "moral bankruptcy" of the international community. So far Washington has only been an observer at the Geneva negotiations led by the mediators Owen and Stoltenberg. Greater U.S. involvement and pressure is vitally important in getting a settlement accepted by the warring parties, Kooijmans said. In the letter to Christopher, Kooijmans said that in his opinion the negotiations had entered a critical phase. The threat of failure in Geneva brings the danger of a total war with far more victims ever closer. The minister said that the absence of the United States from the negotiations could be an alibi for the warring parties to back out of an agreement on the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Bosnian Muslims attach great importance to U.S. participation in the implementation of a possible peace settlement. Kooijmans wants to discuss the Bosnia question on Monday [7 February] in Brussels with his 11 EU [European Union] colleagues. He wants at any cost to prevent the withdrawal of the UN peacekeeping force from Bosnia-Herzegovina. The United Kingdom and France in particular are constantly making veiled threats to withdraw their troops after this winter. Kooijmans pointed out to his colleagues that the presence of the UN peacekeeping force was still serving a purpose. The UN troops were making the life of the Muslim population in the so-called safe areas bearable, he said. Kooijmans hoped that the 12 EU members would declare unanimously on Monday that there will be no possibility of the withdrawal of UN troops from Bosnia. The Netherlands minister also presented plans to his European colleagues for additional EU commitments to encourage the peace talks which are to be restarted on 10 February in Geneva. Under the plan, the Union would administer some areas which are sticking points between the warring parties until arbitration had found a solution. In fact that is an expansion of a previous offer by the EU: In case of a peace settlement, it would manage the contested town of Mostar on a temporary basis. Most representatives of the 12 member states in Brussels have little enthusiasm for sanctions against Croatia, which is said to be intervening with its own army units in the struggle for Bosnia. Denmark will request sanctions on Monday. But even Kooijmans is reserved on the issue. Like Germany, he wants to wait for concrete proof that Croatia is intervening massively in Bosnia-Herzegovina. If it were proved that Croatia is intervening massively in Bosnia-Herzegovina, then virtually all the governments seem to be prepared to impose sanctions. Greece, currently president of the Union, is an exception. Athens is calling for the embargo against Serbia to be lifted, but has no support for this position among its European partners. Up to now the EU has been "punishing" Croatia by withdrawing additional economic support to the country, which the Croats are entitled to under a trade agreement with the EU. Brussels could further reduce trading relations with Croatia. Kooijmans warned that great care was necessary. Croatia is very important as an interim post for aid to Bosnia. European diplomats in Brussels do not believe that the EU will take a hard line on Monday. It is very probable that Kooijmans will be able to achieve the "gain" of a commitment to the maintenance of UN troops in Bosnia. British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd has at least said that he agrees with Kooijmans's vision. The Netherlands has given two million guilders to Slovenia to handle refugees from the Bosnian civil war. Slovenia will use the money, to be sent via a Council of Europe emergency fund, to set up refugee centers.
