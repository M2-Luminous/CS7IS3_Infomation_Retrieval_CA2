The Japanese Government is studying ways for Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to pay an early visit to China. The Japanese and Chinese Governments, which have agreed to further strengthen their relations, plan to promote a brisk exchange of visits by their leaders. The Chinese Government, which sees Japan-China relations as the centerpiece of China's foreign policy strategy, is placing increasing importance on Japan. China wants to keep the United States in check and this is one of the major reasons why China has reaffirmed its policy of attaching importance to Japan. China has used its big market as a trump card to promote the economic diplomacy. Major European nations, which imposed sanctions on China following the Tiananmen incident, have competed with each other in mending their fences with China. The United States, however, has kept its sanctions against China in place. Both China and the United States have begun to move toward improving relations following Sino-U.S. summit talks in November 1993, but there has been no change in the U.S. attitude toward China. The Chinese side believes that as long as forces that loathe the dictatorship of the Communist Party are active in the United States, U.S. policy toward China will continue to waver. As an Asian and Pacific nation, China places the greatest importance on relations with Japan and the United States. It is quite natural for China to attach importance to Japan while its relations with the United States remain unstable. China is seeking more aggressive cooperation from Japan. A Chinese source said: "It is not good for China to stay in the same place indefinitely." China hopes Japan will distance itself from the United States and adopt its own foreign policy. Both Japan and China have a common interest in the stability of Asia. China believes its best bet at the moment is to emphasize the importance of cooperation with Japan. An example is North Korea's suspected nuclear development. China's position is that "North Korea's military strength poses no threat to Japan, the United States or South Korea, and China will seek to settle the issue through dialogue rather than risk the danger of war on the Korean peninsula by joining the United States in threatening North Korea." China asserts its position is in the interests of all Asian nations, including Japan. China hopes for economic cooperation from Japan and this is a primary factor in its policy of promoting relations with Japan. Japan's aid and investment, including its transfer of high technology to China, are indispensable for the development of China's economy, energy and infrastructure, such as railroads and irrigation. China needs Japan's know-how to promote its market economy. China is seeking Japanese cooperation in gaining the membership of GATT. China believes both China and Japan need to understand each other more deeply and this is another reason for China approaching Japan. In the past few years, awareness has grown in Japan of the threat from China. With China's economy growing rapidly, China has been modernizing its military and paying attention to the sea, thereby heightening awareness among Asian nations of the threat of China. Japan has pointed out its concern over China's military buildup at every opportunity and linked its aid to China's military buildup. China has tried to allay concerns about China's military buildup, citing the low level of China's military spending. There is also the issue of Taiwan. A high-ranking official of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry visited Taiwan last year. China reacted by expressing concern over the visit. China is increasingly jittery about the issue of Taiwan. Taiwan is moving toward becoming an independent nation and the United States has continued to sell weapons to Taiwan. In addition, Taiwan and the ASEAN are making conspicuous rapprochement. If the United States and the ASEAN support Taiwan's position, it would become a major stumbling block to the reunification of China. As China sees it, it is necessary to drive a wedge between the United States and ASEAN. China is concerned that if China and Japan do not deepen each other's understanding of the issue, it will destroy the foundation of Japan-China relations. China believes the two countries need to hold more discussions to that end. While China thinks there are some outstanding issues with Japan, it feels friendly toward Japan. One of the reasons for China feeling friendly toward Japan is Prime Minister Hosokawa's attitude toward Asian nations. During his visit to South Korea, the prime minister expressed the forthright remorse for Japan's war of aggression that China has long sought. China sees the Chinese and Japanese as Orientals. The Chinese leadership appears to be a little weary of U.S. attacks on China's abuse of human rights. China firmly believes it is Japan that fully understands China's assertion that "China needs stability." China has remained silent about the breakdown of the framework talks at the recent Japan-U.S. summit talks. China appears to be appraising Japan's action in its heart. A Chinese official expressed sympathy to Japan, saying, "The United States is adopting a heavy-handed method in the economic field." China appears to be hastily analyzing how the breakdown of the framework talks will affect Japan-U.S. relations, Japan-China relations, and China-U.S. relations.
