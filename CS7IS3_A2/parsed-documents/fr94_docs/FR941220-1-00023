ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: By this action, EPA is reproposing a maximum contaminant level goal (MCLG), and a National Primary Drinking Water Regulation (NPDWR) including a maximum contaminant level (MCL) for sulfate. There is a potential for an adverse health effect for infants, travelers, and new residents in areas that have high sulfate levels in their drinking water. The objective of this rule is to ensure that sulfate levels in drinking water provided by public water systems are reduced below levels of concern. The proposal contains alternatives that allow public water systems the flexibility to select compliance options appropriate to protect the population served. DATES: Comments must be received on or before March 21, 1995. Comments received after this date may not be considered. A public hearing on the proposal will be held in Washington, DC on February 2, 1995 at the address listed below under ADDRESSES. ADDRESSES: The Agency will hold a public hearing on the proposal at the following location: EPA Education Center Auditorium, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460, on February 2, 1995.
