According to Ibragimli, the situation in the country for the past period became more complicated and the country is on the edge of social explosion. He noted that the opposition submitted to leadership a pact of anticrisis proposals, but has not received an answer yet. "Leadership reinforced repressions against opposition", said he. Ali Kerimov, APF deputy for political issues noted that one of the reasons of coup d'etat in the republic was a fraud of the public. "An opinion, that if Geydar Aliyev comes to power, all the problems in the country will be settled, was formed prior to the coup d'etat, that is why the attitude of public to such change of power was quite indifferent" said he. According to Kerimov, over the past year, Azerbaijan on many positions was trown back, due to that political and economic life of Azerbaijan was damaged. "Azerbaijan's entering the CIS and joining the Agreement for collective security was the reason for location of foreign troops in the counrty, transformed state border of Azerbaijan into the border of CIS. And involvment of Russian company "Lucoil" to the unitised project for the development of offshore oil reserves means the owning by Russia the treasures, totalling several billion dollars", said Kerimov. Kerimov noted that inconsistency and contradictoriness of foreign policy brought to the loss of West's support in peaceful settlement of Armenian-Azeri conflict. "After the new leadership came to power, Azerbaijan had lost 20 percent of its territories and more than million people became refugees", he noted. According to Kerimov, loss of professionalism in the government brought the country to economic chaos; corruption and bribery increased greately. "Present hard situation is not the result of economic reforms, they have not begun in Azerbaijan yet. It is the result of slovenliness and nonprofessionalism", said Kerimov. Kerimov said that Azerbaijan will not take part in the demonstration, scheduled for June 25 by the Alliance of National and Democratic Forces. According to him, the social and economic situation in the country is so hard and tensitive that there are a lot of facts which can drive the population and separare groups to participate in the demonstration.
