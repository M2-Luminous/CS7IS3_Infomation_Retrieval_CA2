The dispute after the remarks from the EU commissioner responsible for agriculture, Rene Steichen, is now over -- at least as far as the Norwegian authorities are concerned. At the end of last week Steichen told several Norwegian newspapers that the criteria applying to northern agriculture would only remain in force for a transitional period. He also claimed that support for farmers south of the 62d parallel would only apply to farms at least 800 meters above sea level. In its presentation of the results of the negotiations the Agriculture Ministry, headed by Gunhild Oyangen, has given the impression that national support for "northern agriculture" can be provided for large areas south of the 62d parallel as long as these are affected by special growing conditions. Norway asked for a clarification of the EU's position after Steichen's remarks. Yesterday evening his press spokesman issued a short statement on the view taken of the results of the negotiations. The notes states, for example, that "Nordic agriculture" will apply to regions north of the 62d parallel. In addition "it will be possible to include similar regions with mountainous or hilly terrain south of this line of latitude, with a low population density, a low agricultural profile, and where proportion of land devoted to food growing is small" (unofficial translation). The note also states that there is no time limit on agricultural support for these regions. It states that national support can be given to these regions where the EU Commission has given the go-ahead. Agriculture Minister Gunhild Oyangen is now interpreting this as a satisfactory clarification after the row surrounding Steichen: "It clarifies what we have said are the results from the negotiations, in a situation in which many people have questioned more or less every aspect of this agreement. In this respect it was a much needed clarification," she said. But is there not still a difference in interpretation about how far south of the 62d parallel the "northern regions" can stretch? "No, we do not think so. Nothing that we have heard indicates that the EU side is working on the basis of facts different from those we have." But if everything is settled, why is it necessary to continue looking at this in further negotiations after Easter? "We will make available more detailed information about these regions, and that is what we will be putting forward. We have taken 20-30 years to develop a system of differentiated support in Norway and in the light of this I am hoping for patience for a few weeks more." One sigh did, however, escape the agriculture minister: "At some point or other we must start to look at areas for new developments in agriculture, and not just at what subsidies people can receive."
