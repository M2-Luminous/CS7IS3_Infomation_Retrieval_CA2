[MAGYAR HIRLAP] On the basis of the results of the first round of elections, do you see any chance of the MSZP obtaining more than half of the mandates? Would you accept governing alone? [Gal] I only see principled and mathematical chances for obtaining an absolute majority. In that case, we would probably not find coalition partners, because the parties would choose the easier solution of opposition. At the same time, we would still seek a partner in that situation too, because the tasks faced by Hungary require broad social support. I am confident that there will be responsible political forces in this country. The parties that based their programs on replacing the current coalition have the moral and political obligation to accept the burdens of government. In addition, the possible party policy maneuvers should be explained to the voters. The socialists would also accept the government task alone, because we would be able to solve the tasks along with an adequate opposition attitude. I am convinced that there will be no minority government here. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] It was said on the election night that, in addition to the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], you are again considering the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] too.... [Gal] The MSZP said constantly that there are several meeting points between these two parties on the level of program coordination. The subjective condition of the MSZP-Fidesz cooperation has become extremely difficult in the wake of the change in the Fidesz attitude. If a correction takes place in the Fidesz, with all its consequences, a new situation might emerge between the two parties. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Do you take into account the possibility that Hungarian society will be slightly surprised at the superiority of the MSZP and a balance will take place in the second round of elections? [Gal] In principle, I do not completely exclude the possibility of such considerations in the broad strata of voters. The MSZP continues to conduct its campaign correctly, and no change in our style is expected. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Do you see any danger to yourselves deriving from the considerable advance of the MSZP? [Gal] A party that won such a high percentage of votes must think its past and future over thoroughly. Self-restraint is a desirable attitude, both within the party and toward society. There can be no revenge or purge of any kind. Obviously, the party will be threatened by the careerists appearing in the wake of its success, but this must be avoided with internal democracy. From a certain point of view, the MSZP is dividing society, and those who voted against us did this deliberately. The party has only one argument to convince these people, namely the coming four years.
