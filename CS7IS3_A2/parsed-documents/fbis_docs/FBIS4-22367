The purpose of the trip was to study the possibility of and prospects for Armenian-Egyptian cooperation. The Armenian delegation met with Egypt's deputy minister of foreign affairs, minister of industry, minister of the economy, and minister of foreign trade, chairman of the Egyptian parliament's permanent commission for economic and energy issues, members of this country's business circles, and bankers. These meetings were in a way a continuation of the agreement signed between Armenia and Egypt in 1992. Questions discussed in the course of the meetings with Egypt's officials and members of business circles went beyond the boundaries of the sphere of light industry of both countries (cooperation in banking, trade agreements, etc.). In the course of the visit, a protocol was signed with the Egyptian Ministry of Industry which elaborates in detail economic cooperation between the two countries. In particular, the Armenian side undertook an obligation to set up in Yerevan an Egyptian commercial center where samples of Egyptian products will be displayed. This will provide an opportunity for Armenian industrialists, trade organizations, and all businessmen to learn about them and discuss on the spot the possibility of starting up joint enterprises or simply organizing sales of these goods in Armenia. It is envisaged that the center, which will be set up with the direct participation of the Republic of Armenia Ministry of Light Industry, will begin operations as early as May. An agreement was also reached on setting up a similar center in Egypt where Armenia will be able to demonstrate its products. Also discussed were issues of signing an interbank agreement and setting up a direct air link between Yerevan and Cairo. As to the package of issues within the purview of the Ministry of Light Industry itself, the first steps have already been taken. The question of purchases of cotton in Egypt was discussed in detail, and an agreement reached on prices. The agreements have not yet been signed for purely technical reasons: It has not yet been determined which organization will be delivering raw materials from Alexandria to Yerevan. "I hope that this matter will be resolved in the near future," said the minister. "We are planning to host a visit of Egyptian experts within a month, who will study the capacities of our spinning factories. In short, the first steps have been made. I am convinced that Armenian-Egyptian cooperation will prove mutually beneficial and has great prospects."
