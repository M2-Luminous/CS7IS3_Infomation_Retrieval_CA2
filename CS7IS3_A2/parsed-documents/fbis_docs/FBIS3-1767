Latest statistics show that last year a total of 150 million U.S. dollars in contractual volume came from American investors, pushing the total investment Dalian has attracted from overseas to 4.65 billion U.S. dollars, up 96.8 percent over the previous year. Officials said that favorite investment fields cover real estate, commerce, the entertainment business and information services. So far, a number of modern ventures involving science and technology, industrial production, telecommunications, transportation, posts and farming produce processing industries have been established. Infrastructural facilities were greatly improved last year to create a better investment environment, local officials said. Tours to Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore and Malaysia to invite investors proved fruitful. In addition, local officials issued bonds worth 10 billion Japanese yen in Japan. They were sold off within eight days and were labeled "A Plus" in terms of credibility. There are now more than 3,000 foreign-funded enterprises in the port city. The 1,439 enterprises which have started production have generated 10.97 billion yuan in output value and made 980 million U.S. dollars in exports.
