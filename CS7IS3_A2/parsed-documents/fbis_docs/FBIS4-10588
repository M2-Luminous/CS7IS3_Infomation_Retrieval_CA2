In this regard, he expressed his government's willingness to seek alternative repayment methods. The diplomat, who is paying a 48-hour official visit to Argentina, also denied negotiations for a meeting between President Carlos Menem and Cuban leader Fidel Castro during an upcoming Ibero-American summit in Cartagena de Indias. In remarks made in the Senate, Robaina added: "The possibilities are always open. It depends on the activities each one of them has during the summit. My visit's goal, however, is not to prepare a meeting. Thus far, there is nothing on this issue."
