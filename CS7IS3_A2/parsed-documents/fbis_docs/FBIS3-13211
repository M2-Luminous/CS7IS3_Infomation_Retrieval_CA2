The president greeted us with manifest warmth and modesty. Despite the grief over the death of his son, he gave us an extraordinary reception. He stood up and kissed each one of us, and upon our departure he walked me out of the hall and bid farewell to each of us. In the meeting, we extended our condolences and discussed the peace process. He lectured us at length about the Syrian position on the peace process. He also welcomed our initiative to come to Syria to extend our condolences, and said he regarded us as part of the Arab world. At the same time, he emphasized that Syria's strategy is one of peace. He said: We are prepared to embrace the formula of full peace in exchange for full withdrawal, and we already know what kind of peace we want. We want full peace in all its senses, but the Israeli Government has not yet defined the kind of withdrawal it has in mind. The prime minister speaks about a withdrawal on the Golan, rather than from the entire Golan. [end recording]
