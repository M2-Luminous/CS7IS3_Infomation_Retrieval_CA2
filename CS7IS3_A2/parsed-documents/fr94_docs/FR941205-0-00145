FR941205-0-00145 FR941205-0-00027 (d) Analyses for sodium shall be conducted as directed in §141.23(k)(1). 9. Section 141.42 is amended by removing and reserving paragraphs (a) through (c). 10. Section 141.74 is amended by revising paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2), and removing paragraphs (a)(3) through (a)(7) to read as follows: §141.74 Analytical and monitoring requirements. (a)␣*␣*␣* (1) Public water systems must conduct analysis of pH in accordance with one of the methods listed at §141.23(k)(1). Public water systems must conduct analyses of total coliforms, fecal coliforms, heterotrophic bacteria, turbidity, and temperature in accordance with one of the following analytical methods and by using analytical test procedures contained in Technical Notes on Drinking Water Methods, EPA&hyph;600/R&hyph;94&hyph;173, October 1994, which is available at NTIS PB95&hyph;104766. ␣ 1Organism 1Methodology 1Citation1 Total Coliforms Total Coliform Fermentation Technique/3,4,5/ 9221A, B, C ␣ Total Coliform Membrane Filter Technique 9222A, B, C ␣ ONPG-MUG Test6 9223 Fecal Coliforms Fecal Coliform MPN Procedure7 9221E ␣ Fecal Coliforms Membrane Filter Procedure 9222D Heterotrophic bacteria2 Pour Plate Method 9215B Turbidity Nephelometric Method 2130B ␣ Nephelometric Method 180.18 ␣ Great Lakes Instruments Method 29 Temperature 2550 Footnotes : 1Except where noted, all methods refer to the 18th edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, 1992 , American Public Health Association, 1015 Fifteenth Street NW, Washington, D.C. 20005. 2The time from sample collection to initiation of analysis may not exceed 8 hours. 3Lactose broth, as commercially available, may be used in lieu of lauryl tryptose broth, if the system conducts at least 25 parallel tests between this medium and lauryl tryptose broth using the water normally tested, and this comparison demonstrates that the false-positive rate for total coliforms, using lactose broth, is less than 10 percent. 4Media should cover inverted tubes at least one-half to two-thirds after the sample is added. 5No requirement exists to run the completed phase on 10 percent of all total coliform-positive confirmed tubes. 6The ONPG-MUG Test is also known as the Autoanalysis Colilert System. 7A&hyph;1 Broth may be held up to three months in a tightly closed screwcap tube at 4 ○C. 8``Methods for the Determination of Inorganic Substances in Environmental Samples'', EPA&hyph;600/R&hyph;93&hyph;100, August 1993.

(2) Public water systems must measure residual disinfectant concentrations with one of the analytical methods in the following table. The methods are contained in the 18th edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, 1992. Other analytical test procedures are contained in Technical Notes on Drinking Water Methods , EPA&hyph;600/R&hyph;94&hyph;173, October 1994, which is available at NTIS PB95&hyph;104766. If approved by the State, residual disinfectant concentrations for free chlorine and combined chlorine also may be measured by using DPD colorimetric test kits. Free and total chlorine residuals may be measured continuously by adapting a specified chlorine residual method for use with a continuous monitoring instrument provided the chemistry, accuracy, and precision remain same. Instruments used for continuous monitoring must be calibrated with a grab sample measurement at least every five days, or with a protocol approved by the State.
