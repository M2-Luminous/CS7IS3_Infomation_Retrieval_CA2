People in the republic use any methods to evade service, and the most widespread of them is bribery. Plus desertion, which is not subject to any record-keeping at all. Even the Republic of Georgia Defense Ministry headquarters is 15-20 percent undermanned. Nevertheless, Major General Guram Nikolayshvili, chief of the General Staff, yesterday delivered a statement abolishing the drafting of reservists for service. According to him the 20,000 personnel at the Defense Ministry's disposal are quite sufficient to solve any problems of this department and the country as a whole.
