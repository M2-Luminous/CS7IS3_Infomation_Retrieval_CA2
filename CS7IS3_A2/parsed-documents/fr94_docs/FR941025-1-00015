FR941025-1-00015 FR941025-1-00004 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;CE&hyph;07&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Beech Aircraft Corporation Models 34C, T&hyph;34C, and T&hyph;34C&hyph;1 Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) that would apply to certain Beech Aircraft Corporation (Beech) Models 34C, T&hyph;34C, and T&hyph;34C&hyph;1 airplanes. The proposed action would require replacing the eight wing attachment steel bolts and hardware with Inconel bolts and hardware. A report of the right lower aft wing attachment nut assembly separating in two pieces on a Model T&hyph;34C&hyph;1 airplane prompted the proposed action. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent the wing from separating from the fuselage because of failure of this assembly. DATES: Comments must be received on or before December 30, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;CE&hyph;07&hyph;AD, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106.
