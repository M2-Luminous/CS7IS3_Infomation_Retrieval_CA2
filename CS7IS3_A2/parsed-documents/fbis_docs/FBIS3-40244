[Lukic] It is truly difficult to be a great optimist after the news from Geneva. However, I am nevertheless convinced that the forces in the world, and also on the Muslim side, who want peace will strive to put an end to this unfortunate war on these territories. I am deeply convinced that [Bosnia-Herzegovina President] Mr. Alija Izetbegovic will also realize that he is truly a great loser in this war and that he will be an even greater loser if he continues with it. [Vojvodic] You have recently stated that the purpose of the defense of the Srpska republic is to prevent the spread of war from these territories. What does this mean in practice? [Lukic] This in practice means bringing this war to an end as quickly as possible and preventing it from spreading further. I would really be very happy if the war confined itself to these territories only, because I am deeply convinced that our recovery tomorrow would be much faster if the war stopped where it is raging nowadays. Namely, a war devastates and destroys all assets, not to mention human lives. [Vojvodic] However, in these conditions the government is striving for the survival of the people. Recently, you launched a plan to return 70,000 to 100,000 people to production. What does this plan involve and how to realize it? [Lukic] We have many plans. One of the priorities is definitely the revival of the economy and the return of 70,000 to 100,000 people into production, the return of our emigres, better to say, refugees, who are outside our republic, and finally, what is definitely very important, the strengthening of our front, in other words, the defense of our territory and our residents. Beside all this we are now also working on the introduction of a social program to protect all the residents who have problems with food, accommodations, and so forth. [Vojvodic] Production of food is one of the priorities, to my knowledge. Can it be accomplished in a shorter period of time, also through direct partial demobilization of soldiers who are currently on the front? [Lukic] Yes, our last harvest was truly successfully. Unfortunately the sowing did not go as planned, actually, it under-performed significantly due to a shortage of gas. However, we are preparing for the spring sowing, when we would like to compensate for what we missed this autumn. We are making plans according to which the entire population would be engaged. Therefore, everything that is not on the front should work and all capable people must work. [Vojvodic] And secure existence through production? [Lukic] Naturally. The resources have been considerably exhausted in the war and we have no other choice but to strive for greater production. All our plans are aimed in this direction. [Vojvodic] How much do you cooperate with Serbia and Montenegro, that is to say the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia], and how do you assess their assistance in production and survival under the war conditions? [Lukic] Well, I am taking this opportunity to sincerely thank all our brothers from Serbia and Montenegro, that is to say Yugoslavia, for all the assistance that they have offered us, and continue to offer, as this assistance has been truly outstanding, and for everything that we have endured we can definitely thank this assistance. Cooperation with our brotherly republics, that is to say our brothers from these two republics, is really at a high level and I can say that it is getting better and more successful every day. I hope that we will soon be one political territory.
