This is the high hope placed on comrades working on the propaganda and ideological front by the chief designer of China's reform, opening up, and socialist modernization drive. Reform and opening up over the past decade and more have greatly emancipated and developed China's social productive forces, while socialist economic construction has attained world-renowned accomplishments. The building of socialist spiritual civilization has also made new headway. Judging from the present situation of our practical work, however, we can see that many localities have failed, to varying degrees, to pay close attention to or make solid efforts in the building of spiritual civilization. Moreover, malpractices such as money worship, hedonism, and ultra-individualism have spread in society, the party style and the general social mood are not satisfactory, and corrupt phenomena have multiplied. A failure to put a resolute end to this situation and build a high degree of socialist spiritual civilization would lead to our failure to build up socialism with Chinese characteristics. Therefore, molding people with lofty spirit means cultivating a new generation with lofty spirit. This is an arduous yet glorious task for the propaganda and ideological front. What is the lofty spirit we are talking about? It is the spirit of serving the people heart and soul, which was advocated by Comrade Mao Zedong long ago; it is the spirit of "having ideals, moral standards, education, and discipline," which has been repeatedly stressed by Comrade Deng Xiaoping; it is the pioneering spirit summarized by Comrade Jiang Zemin, which reads: emancipating the mind, seeking truth from facts, making positive explorations, having the courage to open up new paths, carrying out hard struggles, pressing forward in the face of difficulties, learn from foreign countries, persistently relying on ourselves, being modest and prudent, guarding against conceitedness and rashness, working with concerted efforts, taking the overall situation into account, practicing thrift, being honest in performing official duties, devoting great efforts to making the country prosperous, and making selfless contributions. All of these spirits have not only given expression to the fine traditions of the communists, but have also carried forward the traditional virtues of our nation. As an embodiment of our valuable experience gained from the building of our country over a long period of time and marked by the distinctive features of our era, these spirits serve as powerful spiritual pillars for the building of socialism with Chinese characteristics. In the future, we will strengthen ideological and moral education, which centers around patriotism, collectivism, and socialism; carry out education on building our country through hard struggle and thrift, on professional ethics, social morality, and basic national conditions; and do a good job in mass ideological work. To mold people with lofty spirit, we need to integrate the work closely with realistic conditions, as well as with the goals and tasks of struggle put forward by our party. At present, the whole party and the people of the entire country are making vigorously efforts to implement the resolutions of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, seize favorable opportunities, deepen reform, expand opening up, step up development, maintain stability, and strive to build up a socialist market economic structure and bring about a fairly comfortable life by the end of this century. Ideological and moral education should obey and serve this overall situation. We are now cultivating people of a new type under open, not sealed, conditions. To reach our goal, we must carry out the spirit of patriotism, enhance the self-respect and self-confidence of our nation, and learn to recognize and resist the dross while using for reference and assimilating the essence of foreign cultures. To mold people with lofty spirit, we need to deal with different people in different ways and should refrain from treating people with a fixed pattern. Because children, teenagers, and the youth are the hope and future of our motherland, we must further strengthen and improve education on their ideals, morality, and discipline. We should uphold the general direction while using different methods for different people. The concrete content and forms of education should suit the age and psychology of the young; in others word, we need to integrate practical with abstract concepts, history with reality, guidance with criticism, and words with action. By so doing, we can, on the one hand, help them gradually establish a correct outlook on the world, life, values, and morality, and take a correct road in life, and on the other hand, bring up reliable successors for our great socialist modernization cause. Molding people with lofty spirit is a long-term and complicated social systematic project, which cannot be fulfilled with a little efforts by one or two departments; instead, the success of the work relies on the well-coordinated cooperation of all departments and links. As for the propaganda and ideological front, all departments concerned, including theoretical studies, education, press, publication, and literature and arts, should all give full play to their own unique functions and roles and make contributions to molding socialist people of a new type. Besides, strong coordination from law-enforcement departments is also indispensable. Without the coordination of law and discipline, education will be spiritless. Therefore, strict enforcement of law and discipline is an indispensable means of molding people. Educators should first receive education. Leading cadres at all levels and the vast number of propaganda and ideological workers should first mold themselves with lofty spirit, make an exemplary role, and be honest in carrying out official duties. We should keep in mind the repeated exhortations of Comrade Deng Xiaoping: "The greater efforts our party and government are making to implement various policies on economic reform and opening up, the greater attention our party members, especially the party's high-ranking cadres, need to pay to setting an example on cultivating Marxist ideology and morality. If we have disarmed ourselves ideologically, how can we educate the young generation and lead the country and people to build socialism?" The building of a rich, democratic, and civilized modern socialist country is based on the struggle of many generations of socialist new people who have ideals, sound moral standards, education, and disciple. Through their arduous, solid, and fruitful labor, comrades on the propaganda and ideological front should be able to turn more party members into "four-have's" party members, more cadres into "four-have's" cadres, and more young people into "four-have's" youth, with the aim that they can commonly undertake the heavy tasks of history.
