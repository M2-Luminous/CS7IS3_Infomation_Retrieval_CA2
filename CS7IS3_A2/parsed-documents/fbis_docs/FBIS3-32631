These sources indicate that the meeting is planned for the end of April -- a meeting between members of the Cuban community living abroad and common citizens -- to discuss topics that are of interest to both sides in an effort to broaden current exchanges. Representatives from the powerful Cuban-North American community will attend the meeting between Cubans, in addition to representatives from other Cuban communities living in Latin America, Europe, and other areas. Meanwhile, ultraconservative sectors excluded from this meeting are doing everything in their power to stop it. To this end, they are using everything from threats against the participants to a intensive defamation propaganda campaign against the meeting. In fact for the past 48 hours, radio stations broadcasting to Cuba from U.S. territory as well as television stations broadcasting from the United States which are received in Havana, have transmitted false reports, like the alleged closure of the U.S. Interests Office in Havana, to cause unrest among the people who go there everyday to wait for visas, which the U.S. State Department hands out sparingly as a way to encourage illegal departures. This week, Radio Rebede reported from outside the U.S. Interests Office on the irritation of the people who wait in long lines for a visa they very seldom receive.
