FR940812-1-00012 FR940812-1-00004 Section 400.106 is amended to clarify that a State may provide additional medical services to refugees who are determined eligible under §400.94 only to the extent that sufficient appropriated funds are available to enable ORR to reimburse costs for refugee Medicaid recipients. Beginning in FY 1991, ORR had to cease reimbursements to States for the costs of assistance to refugee recipients of AFDC, SSI, and Medicaid due to insufficient appropriated funds. We want to make clear that additional services under §400.106 may not be provided to refugee Medicaid recipients with refugee funding as long as appropriated funds continue to be insufficient to enable ORR reimbursements to States for these costs. Section 400.107 is amended by replacing the words ``health assessments'' with the words ``medical screening'', the term used in the INA. Subpart I_Refugee Social Services Section 400.140 is amended to clarify that the requirements in subpart I apply only to formula allocation grants to States. Section 400.141 is amended by removing references to title XX social services. We have removed references to title XX services in this section and in §§400.152, 400.153, and 400.155 in order to limit the scope of services allowable under refugee social services to those services that are most in keeping with the goals and priorities of the refugee program. Section 400.145 is amended by adding the requirement that a State must insure that women have the same opportunities as men to participate in training and instruction. Section 400.146 is revised by removing the current requirement that a State must use at least 85 percent of its social service grants to provide employability services if a State's dependency rate is 55 percent or more and by replacing it with a general requirement that a State must use its social service grants primarily for employability services designed to enable refugees to obtain jobs with less than one year's participation in services in order to achieve economic self-sufficiency as soon as possible. The proposed revision is intended to provide States greater flexibility in determining how to best allocate refugee resources to keeping with refugee service needs. Social services may continue to be provided after a refugee has entered a job to help the refugee retain employment or move to a better job. Social service funds may not be used for long-term training programs such as vocational training that last for more than a year or educational programs that are not intended to lead to employment within a year. Section 400.147 is revised by establishing client priorities for services in the following order of priority: (1) All newly arriving refugees during their first year in the U.S., who apply for services; (2) refugees who are receiving cash assistance; (3) unemployed refugees who are not receiving cash assistance; and (4) employed refugees in need of services to retain employment or to attain economic independence. Section 400.152 is amended by removing references to title XX services and by revising paragraph (b) to limit the provision of social services to refugees who have been in the U.S. for 36 months or less, except that refugees who are receiving employability services, as defined in §400.154(a), as of September 30, 1995, as part of an employability plan, may continue to receive those services through September 30, 1996, or until the services are completed, whichever occurs first, regardless of their length of residence in the U.S. As of the effective date of this requirement, the time-limitation on services will apply regardless of which fiscal year of funding is used to provide the services. Section 400.153 regarding the provision of title XX social services is removed and reserved. Section 400.154 is amended to clarify under §400.154(g) that day care as an allowable service means day care for children. Section 400.154 is further amended by removing the note after paragraph (j) which allows case management costs to be charged against the CMA grant; because of funding limitations, such costs may not currently be charged against the CMA grant. Section 400.155(b) is amended to clarify that outreach services may include activities designed to explain the purpose of available services and to facilitate access to these services. Section 400.155(c)(1) is amended to clarify that assessment and short-term counseling may be provided to families as well as individual persons.
