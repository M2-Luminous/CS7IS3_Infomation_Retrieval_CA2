On its front page, GRANMA carries remarks by Pedro Ross Leal, who says the response to the Parliaments in the Workplace assemblies cannot be just explanations but must be solutions. These assemblies sum up the workers' political line and the spirit that must be implemented, said Ross Leal at the end of the provincial assessment of the recommendations that will be submitted to the National Assembly [of the People's Government] by the workers movement. The national committee of the Cuban Workers Federation [CTC] will meet this afternoon to analyze the ensemble of proposals made by Cuban workers throughout the country. Another GRANMA article reports that the Republic of Cuba will decorate a group of outstanding youngsters from throughout the nation. These young people will receive the Order of Julio Antonio Mella and the Abel Santamaria and Jose Antonio Echeverria medals. This activity is part of the homage paid on the 32d and 33d anniversaries, respectively, of the Union of Young Communists [UJC] and Jose Marti Pioneers Organization. This ceremony will be held in San Pedro, Havana Province, the place where Jose Marti died. Also, the objective of the Zambian foreign minister's visit to our country at the invitation of his Cuban counterpart is to prepare the forthcoming visit to Cuba by Zambia's president and to develop ties of cooperation between the two countries.
