A. Lupynis alleged that Ukraine's military agency had prepared, for the talks between L. Kravchuk and B. Yeltsin, a draft document on the creation on Ukrainian territory of military bases where Russian Federation laws are to be in force. The denial says that A. Lupynis' statement has nothing in common with reality because "such a thing contravenes Ukraine's current legislation, and therefore even a supposition that the military agency was preparing or considering the possibility of such drafts is groundless." The Defense Ministry press service explains the appearance of Lupynis' statement by the acute election struggle, where "some political leaders are trying to increase their political capital by compromising the Armed Forces."
