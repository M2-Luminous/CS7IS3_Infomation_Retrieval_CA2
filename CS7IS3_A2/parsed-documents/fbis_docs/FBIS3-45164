Chiu was responding to reports that the Vatican will establish formal diplomatic relations with the mainland, but will not sever existing relations with Taiwan. Chiu claimed that the problem of dual recognition for the ROC and the PRC will have to be determined largely by Peking's attitude. He said that if the PRC approves of the scheme, there will be no reason why other countries should cut their diplomatic ties with the ROC. Some people are worried that this could encourage other countries with formal ties with Taiwan to recognize the mainland and down- grade their envoys here. Chiu said that perhaps more countries which previously did not recognize Taiwan would decide to follow the Vatican's example in setting up an official office here without breaking ties with the mainland.
