FR940128-2-00134 FR940128-2-00088 This case concerns the proper timing of an application for attorney's fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) in a Social Security case. Under 42 U.S.C. 405(g), a claimant has the right to seek judicial review of a final decision of the Secretary of Health and Human Services denying Social Security benefits. One possible outcome of such a suit is that the district court, pursuant to sentence four of section 405(g), will enter ``a judgment *␣*␣* reversing the decision of the Secretary *␣*␣* (and) remanding the cause for a rehearing.'' The issue here is whether the 30-day period for filing an application for EAJA fees begins immediately upon expiration of the time for appeal of such a ``sentence-four remand order,'' or sometime after the administrative proceedings on remand are complete. In 1986, respondent Richard Schaefer filed an application for disability benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act, 49 Stat. 622, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 401 et seq. (1988 ed. and Supp. III). He was denied benefits at the administrative level, and sought judicial review by filing suit against the Secretary as authorized by section 405(g). Schaefer and the Secretary filed cross-motions for summary judgment. On April 4, 1989, the District Court held that the Secretary had committed three errors in ruling on Schaefer's case and entered an order stating that ``the Secretary's decision denying disability insurance benefits to [Schaefer] is reversed, that the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment are denied, and that the case is remanded to the Secretary for further consideration in light of this Order.'' App. to Pet. for Cert. 27a. In accordance with this order, Schaefer's application for benefits was reconsidered at the administrative level, and was granted. On July 18, 1990, Schaefer returned to the District Court and filed an application for attorney's fees pursuant to EAJA. In response, the Secretary noted that Schaefer was required to file any application for EAJA fees ``within thirty days of final judgment in the action,'' 28 U.S.C. 2412(d)(1)(B), and argued that the relevant ``final judgment'' in the case was the administrative decision on remand, which had become final on April 2, 1990. The District Court stayed action on Schaefer's EAJA application pending this Court's imminent ruling in Melkonyan v. Sullivan, 501 U.S. XXXX , 111 S.Ct. 2157, 115 L.Ed.2d 78 (1991). Melkonyan was announced shortly thereafter, holding that a final administrative decision could not constitute a ``final judgment'' for purposes of section 2412(d)(1)(B). Id ., at XXXX , 111 S.Ct., at 2162. In light of Melkonyan, the Secretary changed positions to argue that EAJA's 30-day clock began running when the District Court's April 4, 1989 order (not the administrative ruling on remand) became final, which would have occurred at the end of the 60 days for appeal provided under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a). Thus, the Secretary concluded, Schaefer's time to file his EAJA application expired on July 3, 1989, over a year before the application was filed. The District Court, however, found Schaefer's EAJA application timely under the controlling circuit precedent of Welter v. Sullivan, 941 F.2d 674 (CA8 1991), which held that a sentence-four remand order is not a final judgment where ``the district court retain[s] jurisdiction *␣*␣* and plan[s] to enter dispositive sentence four judgmen[t]'' after the administrative proceedings on remand are complete. Id. , at 675. The District Court went on to rule that Schaefer was entitled to $1,372.50 in attorney's fees. The Secretary fared no better on appeal. The Eighth Circuit declined the Secretary's suggestion for en banc reconsideration of Welter, and affirmed the District Court in an unpublished per curiam opinion. The Secretary filed a petition for certiorari, urging us to reverse the Court of Appeals summarily. We granted certiorari, 506 U.S. XXX , 113 S.Ct. 594, 121 L.Ed.2d 532 (1992), and set the case for oral argument. II The first sentence of 28 U.S.C. 2412(d)(1)(B) provides: ``A party seeking an award of fees and other expenses shall, within thirty days of final judgment in the action, submit to the court an application for fees and other expenses which shows that the party is a prevailing party and is eligible to receive an award under this subsection, and the amount sought, including an itemized statement from any attorney or expert witness representing or appearing in behalf of the party stating the actual time expended and the rate at which fees and other expenses were computed.'' (Emphasis added.) In Melkonyan v. Sullivan, we held that the term ``final judgment'' in the highlighted phrase above ``refers to judgments entered by a court of law, and does not encompass decisions rendered by an administrative agency.'' See 501 U.S., at XXX , 111 S.Ct., at 2162. Thus, the only order in this case that could have resulted in the starting of EAJA's 30-day clock was the District Court's April 4, 1989 order, which reversed the Secretary's decision denying disability benefits and remanded the case to the Secretary for further proceedings.
