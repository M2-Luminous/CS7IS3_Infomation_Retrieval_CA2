On the afternoon of 20 January, when strong icy winds were blowing on a very cold day, Comrade Yang Shangkun came to the city government building. He wore a gray overcoat and walked with firm steps. He smiled and shook hands with people in the welcome crowd one by one and then talked cordially with the Shenzhen City leaders. Comrade Yang Shangkun said: I have special feelings toward Shenzhen. When Comrade Xi Zhongxun and I worked in the Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee, the central authorities decided to adopt special policies in Guangdong. In particular, after the establishment of the special economic zones, they played a great role in leading and promoting reform and opening up. I have visited the special zones often since then. In general, I found that there were changes every year in Shenzhen. Last year, from the Shenzhen Airport to Zhuhai via Shekou, I saw large stretches of empty land along the roadside, but, this year, new buildings have cropped up there, and the road has also been improved. I am really glad to see all this. Making a gesture, he said: The city party committee has just held a meeting to decide the principles and policies for future development, and this is very good. Yesterday, I read an interview with Comrade Liu Tianfu in SHENZHEN TEQU BAO. He hoped that Shenzhen would make further progress. This is also the common hope of all of us old comrades. This year, the state will adopt many major reform measures and the pace of reform will be quickened, meaning that the tasks will be pressing and will cover a broad scope. Efforts should be made to deal with new issues and overcome new difficulties. New experience should be summed up. Reform, opening, and economic construction in the special economic zones should be carried out positively and prudently. Last year, Shenzhen experienced fires and floods, but you nevertheless have made great achievements in your work. Comrades, you should make greater efforts this year, continue to carry forward the spirit of hard struggle, and do a better job than last year. Comrade Yang Shangkun particularly appreciated the appearance of a large number of competent young cadres in Shenzhen. He said that he had come into contact with some cadres in Shenzhen, including some entrepreneurs. They are all quite young -- some are just in their thirties. This shows that our cause has no lack of successors and is full of bright hopes. Li Youwei said: Two years ago today, Comrade Deng Xiaoping was inspecting Shenzhen and made some important speeches. At that time, Comrade Yang Shangkun was also in Shenzhen to help promote our country's further reform and opening. Today, after an interval of two years, Comrade Yang Shangkun has once again inspected Shenzhen. This gave great encouragement and support to the special economic zone. He said that the people in Shenzhen would never let down the proletarian revolutionaries of the old generation and would certainly build the special economic zone into a more beautiful place. Li Youwei extended a new year greeting to Comrade Yang Shangkun on behalf of the entire people in Shenzhen and wished him good health. On the morning of 21 January, Wang Zhongfu and other principal city leaders once again reported their work to Comrade Yang Shangkun. Comrade Yang Shangkun arrived in Shenzhen by special plane from Beijing on the morning of 8 January. Huang Huahua, Fu Rui, and Li Youwei met him at the airport. On the morning of 12 January, accompanied by Wang Zhongfu, Comrade Yang Shangkun, full of zest, visited the wild animal zoo in Shenzhen. That afternoon, Xie Fei, secretary of the Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee, particularly came to see Comrade Yang Shangkun. On the morning of 16 January, accompanied by Yuan Geng, Comrade Yang Shangkun inspected Shekou. On the morning of 17 January, accompanied by Li Youwei and Li Po, Comrade Yang Shangkun, full of zest, visited Shenzhen's Golf Club. In Shenzhen, Comrade Yang Shangkun also paid special attention to the development of the high-tech industries. On the morning of 19 January, accompanied by Huang Liman, he inspected two high-tech companies, Anke and Huawei, and expressed satisfaction with the remarkable achievements and technological breakthroughs made by these two companies in the fields of sophisticated medical equipment and programmable digital telephone exchanges. In Anke, Comrade Yang Shangkun wrote: "Developing high technology, promoting the new development of the national economy." On the morning of 20 January, being accompanied by Yang Guanghui, he inspected the Kaifa Science and Technology Company. There, he inquired about the details of the production process and encouraged the company to make new progress in the new year. Yesterday, Comrade Yang Shangkun finished his inspection and left Shenzhen.
