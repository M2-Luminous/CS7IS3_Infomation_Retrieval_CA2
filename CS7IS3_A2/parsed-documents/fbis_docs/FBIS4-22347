The image of the foreign enemy, whether it is a person of Caucasian nationality, American thrice-cursed imperialism, or the Afghan mujahidin wandering from place to place in an area that is rather remote from the average Russian zone, temporarily unites society and distracts from local disorders. It is the same with economic battles. The VPK [military industrial complex] can hardly brag about important successes. Affairs in the fuel and energy complex are far from excellent. Metallurgists and machine builders are having difficulties. After uniting, Russian industrialists have mounted a campaign against the joint-stock company Unified Energy System of Russia [YeES]. February was a time of especially massive attacks. First Deputy Prime Minister Soskovets, a VPK favorite, demanded the removal of the president of YeES, and Minister of Fuel and Energy Shafranik proposed changing the structure of the joint-stock company, dividing it into two--the producers of energy and its suppliers to consumers--and Minister of Labor Melikyan cited the average wage of power engineers of 130,000 rubles [R], which exceeds that in other industries. But the reason for the beginning of combat operations was the steady increase in rates for electric power. The reason, incidentally, is rather well-thought out. It is not the power engineers who are increasing the rates. The Yeltsin edict "On the Liberalization of Prices" of 1 November 1991 states clearly that prices were being dropped for products of all branches except electricity. The state retained the right to regulate rates in this branch. In practice, 75 regional and one federal power commission give the "OK" for any change in rates for electric power. At the same time, the cost of a kilowatt is really increasing. The power industry itself is in a difficult financial position. Consumers owe it R3.2 trillion. The effort to eliminate the joint-stock company is understandable: There is a joint-stock company, it is necessary to pay off debts, and if there is no company, of course, there also are no debts. Price formation is a special and sore subject. Last year, coal prices increased by a factor of 14, gas--by a factor of 23, and fuel oil--by a factor of four. For this reason also the cost of electric power increased by a factor of 6.5. But even with this, our rate amounts to only 20-30 percent of the level of most developed countries. In the United States, for example, the rate for industry is about 5 cents per kilowatt hour, for the population--8 cents. The Russian price of electricity for industry vacillates from 1 to 2.5 cents, and for the population on average approximately 0.3 cents. Thus, Russian rates are lower than world rates by a factor of three to four. And, very likely, it is not the fault of the power industry that the prices for products of Russian industry and agriculture reached, and in many ways exceeded, world prices, but there has been no success in stopping the drop in production. However, the idea itself of strict price regulation is meeting the resistance of consumers, especially those that are energy-intensive, such as metallurgy with its obsolete technologies. And, as a result, the size of the established subscriber payment does not allow the conduct of investment in the development of a federal power industry. But, after all, a number of krays and oblasts of Russia have ended up today without their own sources of electric power. Kaliningraders are dependent on Lithuania, Pskov residents receive their heat and light entirely from Estonia and Belarus, and Omsk and Novosibirsk rely on Kazakhstan. The northern Caucasus is generally deficient in capacity. The stubborn resistance of the power engineers in March stopped the general campaign. But this does not at all mean that the military operations have been stopped. It is simply that a respite has been declared, after which new summons to the branch war are possible, and pogroms, and fierce battles. The sides are gathering strength.
