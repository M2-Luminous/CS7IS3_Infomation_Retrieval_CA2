In our humble estimation, the U.S. secretary of state wrote his article, which was full of the usual stupid U.S. fallacies and allegations, in order to reassure his allies and "hosts," the Saudi rulers, and possibly the Kuwaiti rulers as well, to convince them that another article published by THE NEW YORK TIMES, following the shooting down of the two U.S. helicopters in northern Iraq, which called for a revision of the entire U.S. policy toward Iraq, did not express the opinion of any of the U.S. decisionmaking institutions but merely the opinion of the writer himself. When the secretary of state writes in THE NEW YORK TIMES he definitely expresses the official U.S. viewpoint and the U.S. position on the blockade. It seems to us that the Saudi and Kuwaiti rulers, who must have paid a handsome political and financial reward for the Christopher article, were not reassured and did not believe that what Christopher alone writes really expresses the U.S. position. In fact, they are justified in not feeling reassured, because they are not ignorant of the fact that what is written in this paper is not very far from the viewpoints of the U.S. decisionmakers, or some of them at least!
