The puppet clique is planning to carry out operations on the ground, in the air, and in the sea -- including a battle exercise; a chemical, biological, and radiological war exercise; an exercise on transporting troops and equipment; and a takeoff and landing exercise on emergency airstrips -- in the north of Kyonggi Province near the Military Demarcation Line [MDL], South Kyongsang Province, and the West Sea of South Korea. The puppet clique is also planning to mobilize many domestic reserve troops for this war exercise. The U.S. imperialists and South Korean puppets should think deeply about the grave consequences as a result of their criminal act of driving the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war by repeating armed reinforcement and war exercises.
