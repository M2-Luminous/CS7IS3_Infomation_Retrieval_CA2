FR941213-0-00028 FR941213-0-00008 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Amy Platt, 8ART-AP, Environmental Protection Agency, Region VIII, 999 18th Street, suite 500, Denver, Colorado, (303) 293&hyph;1769. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background The Missoula, Montana area was designated nonattainment for PM 10 and classified as moderate under sections 107(d)(4)(B) and 188(a) of the Clean Air Act, upon enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. 1 See 56 FR 56694 (Nov. 6, 1991); 40 CFR 81.327 (Missoula and vicinity). The air quality planning requirements for moderate PM 10 nonattainment areas are set out in subparts 1 and 4 of part D, title I of the Act. 2 The EPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing EPA's preliminary views on how EPA intends to review SIPs and SIP revisions submitted under Title I of the Act, including those State submittals containing moderate PM 10 nonattainment area SIP requirements (see generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992)). Because EPA is describing its interpretations here only in broad terms, the reader should refer to the General Preamble for a more detailed discussion of the interpretations of title I advanced in this action and the supporting rationale. 1 The 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act made significant changes to the Act. See Pub. L. No. 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399. References herein are to the Clean Air Act, as amended (``the Act''). The Clean Air Act is codified, as amended, in the U.S. Code at 42 U.S.C. Sections 7401, et seq. 2 Subpart 1 contains provisions applicable to nonattainment areas generally and Subpart 4 contains provisions specifically applicable to PM 10 nonattainment areas. At times, Subpart 1 and Subpart 4 overlap or conflict. EPA has attempted to clarify the relationship among these provisions in the ``General Preamble'' and, as appropriate, in today's action and supporting information. Those States containing initial moderate PM 10 nonattainment areas such as Missoula were required to submit, among other things, several provisions by November 15, 1991. These provisions are described in EPA's final rulemaking on the Missoula moderate PM 10 nonattainment area SIP (59 FR 2537&hyph;2540, January 18, 1994). Such States were also required to submit contingency measures by November 15, 1993 (see 57 FR 13543). These measures must become effective, without further action by the State or EPA, upon a determination by EPA that the area has failed to achieve reasonable further progress (RFP) or to attain the PM 10 National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) by the applicable statutory deadline. See section 172(c)(9) and 57 FR 13510&hyph;13512 and 13543&hyph;13544. On November 15, 1990, the Missoula area was also designated nonattainment and classified as a moderate area for CO by operation of law. See section 107(d)(4)(B) of the Act; 56 FR 56694 at 56705&hyph;56706, 56790 (November 6, 1991); 40 CFR 81.327 (Missoula and vicinity). Unlike PM 10 nonattainment areas, moderate CO areas with a design value of less than or equal to 12.7 parts per million (including Missoula) are not required by the Act to submit a SIP demonstrating attainment of the NAAQS. Rather, these areas are required to submit certain SIP elements, including an oxygenated fuels program, an emissions inventory, and contingency measures. Section 172(c)(9) of the Act requires the State to submit contingency measures for implementation in the event that the area fails to reach attainment by the applicable attainment date (December 31, 1995). EPA has established November 15, 1993 as the deadline by which the contingency measures must be submitted to EPA as a SIP revision. II. This Action Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565&hyph;13566). The Governor of Montana submitted revisions to the SIP for Missoula with a letter dated March 2, 1994. The revisions address contingency measures for PM 10 and CO, and they also amend several of the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program regulations. EPA approved a large portion of the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program on January 18, 1994 (59 FR 2537&hyph;2540). Some of the local regulation amendments, which are included in the March 2, 1994 submittal, were made to satisfy commitments made by the Governor with the original PM 10 SIP submittal. In the January 18, 1994 rulemaking, EPA delayed action on the regulations related to the Governor's commitments.
