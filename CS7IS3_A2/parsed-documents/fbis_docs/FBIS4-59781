Yasir 'Arafat's statements in Johannesburg drew angry reactions from the political leadership in Jerusalem, particularly the prime minister. What is your comment? [Sha'th] My comment is that there is sometimes exaggeration, even in interpreting what President 'Arafat meant. Jihad in Islam is dual -- minor and major jihad. When Prophet Muhammad, may God's peace and blessing be upon him, conquered Mecca, he said: Minor jihad is now over and major jihad begins. The major jihad is the jihad of soul, work, construction, and all forms of struggle, not only the military jihad as, I believe, was understood in various places. Jihad for Jerusalem means struggle for the sake of insistence on presenting what we demand, that is, to have East Jerusalem as the capital of the Palestinian state. However, this will take place through various forms of peaceful struggle that will end with negotiations on the final status, an important part of which should be on Jerusalem. Our position on these negotiations is clear right now. This, I think, is what President 'Arafat meant. [Mu'addi] One question, after the last, doctor. Was there a letter from Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin to Yasir 'Arafat on the status of Jerusalem? [Sha'th] The letter Prime Minister Rabin exchanged with President 'Arafat, which was signed with the agreement as you may recall, stated that negotiations on the final status can begin as soon as possible but not after the beginning of the third year or the end of the second year after the start of the implementation of the Declaration of Principles. This means not later than 13 October 1995, namely, after one year and four or five months. These negotiations on the final status, as is clear in the Declaration of Principles, emphasize that Jerusalem is one of the five most important topics that will be discussed at these final negotiations. [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, member of the Palestinian National Authority, thank you very much. [Sha'th] Thank you.
