A member of the All Burma Students Democratic Front (ABSDF) told AFP by telephone that the group's leader, Moe Thee Zun, and 11 others had been held briefly by the KNU last week and freed unharmed. But a Bangkok spokesman for the National Council for the Union of Burma (NCUB), the umbrella organization of the dissident groups, said the Karens had not held the students and a NCUB statement denying reports of the detention was accurate. The statement said the students were holding talks with the Karens to "prevent...any misunderstanding...in connection with the KNU's decision to hold talks individually with the SLORC [State Law and Order Restoraion Council]. There is no serious problem between the KNU and the Student Army or any other ally." The Karen National Union and the student's group are apparently at odds over the Karens' decision to seek separate peace talks with the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), as the Rangoon junta is called. The students want to maintain a united front, but other opposition groups have backed the Karens, the oldest and most powerful opposition group. [passage omitted]
