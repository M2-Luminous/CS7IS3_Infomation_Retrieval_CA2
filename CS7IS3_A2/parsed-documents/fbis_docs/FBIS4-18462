In an interview with NEUE OSNABRUECKER ZEITUNG (Wednesday edition), Karl Lamers, foreign policy spokesman of the CDU/CSU Bundestag group, stressed that membership in the European Union, which Turkey is striving for, is becoming increasingly impossible in view of Turkey's way of dealing with the Kurdish problem. Of course, it would place a serious strain on German-Turkish relations if it could be proved that German weapons are used against the Kurds. From the moral point of view and because of the Turkish Government's promise to the contrary, it would then certainly be justified to stop arms deliveries. On the other hand, Germany would thus give up any possibility to influence Turkey and its behavior toward the Kurds. Therefore, the Kurdish problem can be solved only by political means, by having us and others convince Turkey that there cannot be any solution without, at least, far-reaching cultural autonomy. "The excessive use of weapons against parts of the Turkish people is a bad thing -- no matter where the weapons come from," Lamers stressed.
