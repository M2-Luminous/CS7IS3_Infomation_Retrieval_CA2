The police should be replaced with retired KGB officers, said Zhirinovskiy. In his opinion, the federal counter-intelligence service is also unable to suppress crime since it "assists foreign secret services". The latter, in their turn, concentrated on the Russian Liberal-Democratic Party. Zhirinovskiy thinks that the border should be partially closed and citizens of former Soviet republics should be prohibited to visit large Russian cities for six months in order to make anti-crime measures efficient. "We demand to start anti-crime measures with cleansing of the Interior Ministry itself, removal of corrupted officials and their replacement with retired officers of the KGB, the armed forces and the Military Procurator's Office. If the high-ranking officials are not replaced, the presidential decree (against crime) will become an instrument against political opponents and not criminals," Zhirinovskiy told a news conference here today. He also demanded to stop "predatory privatization", do not hold joint exercises with NATO, do not send Russian peace-makers outside the Russian Federation and raise the minimum salary to 50,000 rubles per month.
