[Mock] Thank you. The operation on the vertebral disk was successful. Yesterday I walked a few steps, and today I will walk a few more. I hope I will be able to leave the hospital at the end of the week. [Hopfmueller] Disk problems are generally very painful. Are you still in pain? [Mock] No. Before the operation I was in great pain which was sometimes distracting. Since the operation, I have not felt any pain at all. I am still a bit suspicious. I was surprised that I have not had any pain since the surgery. After all, I had been warned that it would be unlikely that I would not feel any pain afterwards. [Hopfmueller] Is the matter over with this treatment or will you need further treatment? [Mock] The doctor told me that if I follow his instructions, everything will be fine. He is very satisfied with me. Occasionally, he seems to have some doubts, but I hope I will be able to dispel them in time. [Hopfmueller] You mean the doctor doubts that you will take good care of yourself? [Mock] Yes. I promised him that he will be pleasantly surprised. [Hopfmueller] Foreign Minister Mock, there is only 14 days until the referendum on European Union [EU] membership. At the moment, there is the impression that the mood might swing toward a majority of EU opponents. Do you share this view? [Mock] I am not so much worried about whether or not the mood is going to swing over, because, in the end, it will be the citizen who will make the decision on 12 June. For me, it is important to provide information -- as far as I can do here, via the telephone and via the letters that I get and that I can dictate -- about what is at stake -- namely, not the fate of any party or any person, but Austria's position in Europe for the next 50 or 80 years, whether we will have our say and participate in decisionmaking or whether we remain an appendage outside. [Hopfmueller] You say you are still trying to provide information. Have we not meanwhile reached a point where emotions on all sides have in effect replaced material arguments? [Mock] One can certainly note this. However, this does not change the fact that one still has to provide information, especially since emotions have replaced arguments. One must try to clarify misunderstandings, and to get rid of such abstruse arguments, such as that our water will be taken away and that the National Bank will export our gold to Brussels or some other place, and to get rid of such nonsense, which often frightens older people, in particular. [Hopfmueller] Is it really possible to change something over these last 14 days before the referendum? [Mock] Look, the matter is so important that one cannot constantly ask whether or not something is useful. If one is convinced of something, one must work until the very end, and then the voters will decide.
