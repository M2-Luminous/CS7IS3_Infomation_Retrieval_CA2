A newspaper reporter in Seoul, while having a conversation with his colleagues about the situation, said: European and American big powers are conspiring with each other in putting pressure upon North Korea under the pretext of the fictitious "nuclear issue" in an attempt to stifle the socialist system of the North, but the North is braving it. The North is demonstrating the might of the Republic entirely thanks to the outstanding guidance of the leader Kim Chong-il, the great statesman, he noted, adding: The leader Kim Chong-il who has literary and military accomplishments is an iron-willed brilliant commander with firm faith, a distinguished great politician with correct judgment and outstanding leadership ability and a prominent leader of the international socialist movement who is guiding the movement for rebuilding socialism, standing in the centre of world politics. A university professor in Seoul told his students: Mr. Kim Chong-il is a man with gifted qualification. He is not only a great man of learning, a great master of idea and theory but a master of political art who is leading people to social progress by applying knowledge and theory. This is eloquently proved by the course of dramatic changes in political, economic and cultural domains of the North. It is good luck of our fellow countrymen to have held such a peerless great man as Mr. Kim Chong-il in high esteem as the lodestar of the nation. A certain Yi in Kangso District, Seoul, told his villagers: I firmly believe that as Mr. Kim Chong-il looks after our people, the country would be reunified before long and people would be well off under his leadership. It is General Kim Il-song and Mr. Kim Chong-il who we should believe and follow.
