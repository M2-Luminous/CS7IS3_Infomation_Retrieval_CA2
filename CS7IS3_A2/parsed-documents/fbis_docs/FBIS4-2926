Otherwise, how could so many people be taken in and such a huge amount of money accumulated by illicit means within such a short period of time? Today, this newspaper publishes a report about Sun Shuxing, who was found guilty of giving and receiving bribes, and Cai Yuanjiang, who was found guilty of taking bribes, revealing another aspect of Changcheng's illegal fundraising activities. A lesson should be drawn from such cases and journalists in particular, should give deep thought to such cases and thus raise their vigilance. In the course of developing the socialist market economy, it is natural that economic entities of all types are certain to pay attention to using the news media and enlisting their help. Journalists should also actively orient their work toward the economy, the market, and toward the enterprises, and should serve the purpose of more quickly establishing the socialist market economy. However, they must observe the ethical norms of journalism, strictly separate news reporting from advertising, and never engage in "paid news reporting." They must not do such things as lavishing praise on somebody who pays them money or exaggerating the achievements of such bribe-givers, thus misleading the public. Otherwise, they may: Go against the principle that news reporting must be objective, authentic, and fair; sully the reputation of the journalistic undertakings led by the party; and they may also disrupt the economic order and social stability. It is a regrettable fact that in recent years, a small number of journalists have failed to withstand the corrosive influence of money fetishism, gave up their principles while being lured by pecuniary benefit, and even became accomplices of some economic criminals and became bogged down in the mire of evil. Last year, the CPC Central Propaganda Department and the State Press and Publications Administration jointly issued the "Circular on Strengthening the Trade Ethics of the Journalists and Banning `Paid News Reporting.'" After that, anticorruption was taken seriously in journalistic circles. Various journalistic institutions banned "paid news reporting" and took this as an important point in their efforts to consolidate trade ethics among their personnel. They formulated a series of concrete measures according to their specific conditions and intensified education, management, and inspection. The vast numbers of journalists also strictly practiced self-discipline. Through such efforts over the past year, marked results have been achieved. However, anticorruption is a long-term task and opposing "paid news reporting" is also a long-term task. We should not overestimate the results achieved in the previous stage and should not underestimate the arduousness of the struggle in the future. We must never relax our efforts by even the slightest bit. Vigilance must always be maintained, the fundamental purpose of serving the people and the socialist cause must always be borne in mind, and the fine style of working hard and remaining uncontaminated amidst temptations must always be kept up. In Shen Taifu's illegal fundraising activities, a very small number of reporters did things which were incompatible with their trade ethics and in violation of the law. This is a painful lesson to learn. The editorial committee of this newspaper has laid down anticorruption regulations and has set strict demands on our colleagues. We have also established a complaint hotline and we welcome strict supervision from people in all walks of life. We are willing to join comrades in other journalistic institutions in improving the ideological consciousness, moral integrity, and work style of the journalists and are making efforts for this purpose. Comrade reporters, let us learn a profound lesson from the negative experience of Sun Shuxing and Cai Yuanjiang. Always bear in mind the great trust placed in us by the party and the people, always bear in mind our glorious and sacred mission, and always apply the pens, microphones, and cameras in our hands properly!
