About 75 Akash missiles are expected to be inducted in the initial phase. The Akash is to replace the Russian Pechora SAMs which comprise the bulk of the IAF's air defence missile system. The IAF has about 35 squadrons of the Pechora or SAM-III squadrons. The Pechoras first inducted into IAF in 1974, would be ready for a phase out in another ten years. The indigenously developed Akash is meant to replace the Pechora missiles. While the Pechora has a kill range of 18 km, the Akash has an enhanced range of about 25 km. Apart from other aspects of technological superiority, the development of Akash saves foreign exchange. The defence research and development organisation (DRDO), the developing agency, successfully test-fired the Akash on February 3. Significantly, the Akash is to be integrated with the multi-target handling Rajendra phased array radar system which will enhance the IAF's air defence capability. The Akash will have a wider attack cone thereby enabling it to neutralise more than one aircraft at a time. The concept involves exploding the missile's warhead close to the targeted aircraft and hitting it with shrapnels which spread in a conical form. The Akash and the Rajendra radar combine to provide a state-of-the-art air defence system to the IAF. Though the Akash has been tested on an earlier occasion, the February 3 test marked a breakthrough in the technology of "integrated two-stage rocket-ramjet." While a normal rocket has an inbuilt oxygen (oxidiser) supply, the ramjet rocket draws air during flight for combustion in conjunction with a fuel rich propellant. The integrated rocket (booster)-ramjet (sustainer) technology has weight and range advantages over conventional missile systems.
