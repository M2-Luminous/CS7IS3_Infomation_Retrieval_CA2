African National Congress [ANC] and government negotiators emerged shortly before midnight to announce that the Freedom Alliance had requested, and been granted, until Monday to examine a set of proposals devised by the ANC. "The talks are proceeding and the deadline could be said to be extended," Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer said. Instead of promulgating the April election on Friday as expected, the announcement was being delayed for what were described as "technical reasons". It is understood, however, that the anticipation of progress in the trilateral talks prompted the delay. This will in effect give the Alliance the opportunity to declare its participation in the election before the actual announcement of the April 27-29 dates decided on by the ANC-dominated Transitional Executive Council earlier this week. Thursday night's trilateral talks coincided with two other sets of negotiations, the first involving the Afrikaner Volksfront (AVF) [Afrikaner National Front], the government and the ANC on an Afrikaner "volkstaat" [homeland] and the second involving government and a delegation of the kwaZulu king. The three sets of talks may result in at least two changes to the constitution. Although there is no direct link between the different talks, the "volkstaat" and Zulu monarchy talks address the concerns of key alliance partners, namely the Afrikaner right wing and, indirectly, Inkatha. Mr Meyer said the Zulu talks could involve the addition of a constitutional principle on the role of traditional leaders, among them the Zulu king. He said the trilateral negotiations had taken note of progress in the talks on a "volkstaat". However, an earlier expectation of substantial progress on a "volkstaat" failed to materialise. Mr Meyer said a new hitch had arisen which the negotiators were trying to resolve. In the trilateral talks, Mr Meyer said the same issue that surfaced earlier in the week had arisen again. This involved the definition of regional powers which the Alliance wanted characterised as "exlusive". In agreeing to this, the ANC had added, however, that such exclusive powers would, if granted, have to be exercised within a centrally-directed legislative framework. ANC negotiator Mohammed Valli Moosa said the addition of a new constitutional principle had arisen in the trilateral talks. The principle dealt with the integrity of regional constitutions. He said the anc was discussing a package of agreements with the Alliance. The package included provisions on the powers, functions and fiscal independence of regions. He said the ANC's proposals took into account most of the Alliance's legitimate demands. "We are hoping at this late stage that the Freedom Alliance will realise that it is in their best interest to become part of the political process. "The fact that negotiations are continuing indicates that there is a possibility that they may well accept the interim constitution. "Our proposals were not rejected out of hand and that indicates the show is still on the road," Mr Valli Moosa said.
