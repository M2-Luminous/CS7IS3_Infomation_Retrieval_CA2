Peasants' per capita net income stood at 880 yuan, increasing by 2 percent over the previous year. The peasants' burden began to be lightened. The sales income, net profit, and total value of products of town and township enterprises increased by more than 60 percent. The situation in agriculture is encouraging. We must be aware, however, that there exists quite a number of deep-rooted contradictions in the development of agriculture and rural economic work. The first is the low comparative effectiveness of agricultural production, especially grain and cotton production. The price scissors between industrial and agricultural products keep increasing, while the income of peasants increases at a slow pace. The second contradiction is that there is no sign of improvement in the system to promote agricultural technology, which has broken down, with its personnel scattered. The phenomenon of "unhooking and weaning" is quite common. The third controduction is that agricultural science and technology lags behind the development of production. It lacks fine species, as well as new, low-cost, highly beneficial breeding and cultivation technology for the purpose of upgrading agriculture. The rate at which current scientific research is promoted and transformed is comparatively low. The fourth contradiction is the increasing employment pressure caused by the surplus labor force. The fifth is that state agricultural regulation and control measures are insufficient, while the agricultural foundation is weak. These problems seem commonplace, but many new developments have taken place in each of these areas. Our task is to analyze these new developments, study the new problems, and be determined to solve these deep-rooted problems in the development of our agriculture and the rural economy. Information from an authoritative department shows that 1994 is to be the year for major breakthroughs in our economic restructuring. The state will adopt important measures in finance, taxation, banking, planning, investment, foreign trade and the reform of state-owned enterprises. Beginning this year, the reform will shift from the surface to a deeper level, from breakthroughs in single items to overall coordination, from paying attention to the benefits brought about by comparatively independent reform measures to the formation of a comprehensively new economic relationship. It is inevitable that this reform situation in China will have a profound impact on rural reform bacause it is an important part of the economic restructuring of our country. On the one hand, it will give a vigorous boost to agriculture and the rural economy. In the past, we used to say that it was difficult to deepen agricultural reform. The key problem was that the external reform was not coordinated with rural reform. This year, now that the entire economic restructuring has come to a crucial phase of overall advance, it will create an excellent external environment for rural reform and development. We should grasp this opportunity firmly. On the other hand, the reform will readjust the present pattern of interest distribution in a big way. It is also inevitable that it will affect agriculture and the rural economy in a disadvantageous way. Take the reform of the financial and taxation system for example; the practice of the new circulating-tax system and the unification of enterprise income tax will have a considerable effect on the tax load of town and township enterprises. Moreover, these enterprises also have to undertake many social burdens and tasks to develop agriculture through industry. As a result, their profit retention will be less, which will affect the capacity of these enterprises for further development. Raising prices for crude oil, refined oil, and electricity, as well as completely deregulating prices for centrally distributed coal and farm chemicals, will bring about price increases for the means of agricultural production and will increase the cost of agricultural products. In short, the nation's in-depth reform provides a good external environment for solving the deep-rooted contradictions in agriculture and the rural economy. We should say that it is high time for us to seize the opportunity to solve these deep-rooted contradictions in agriculture and the rural economy. In actual practice, of course, these deep-rooted contradictions cannot be solved overnight, nor can they be solved altogether at the same time. The competent state department should take them into consideration as a whole and should make overall arrangements. A locality, a department, or a system first should solve whatever problem for which the conditions for its solution are ripe. Now confronting us are contradictions and difficulties, as well as potential and opportunities. However, the opportunities we have are greater than the difficulties. Therefore, we must take hold of the situation, grasp the opportunities and meet the challenges so as to make our agriculture and rural economy take off again.
