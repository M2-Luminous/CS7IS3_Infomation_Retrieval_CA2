When I decided to propose German-Baltic consultations I was well aware of the fact that Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are in many respects quite different from one another. Nevertheless, I think that there are a number of important issues that concern all of the Baltic states and that are also of special importance to Germany. There are four areas in particular that we should discuss in detail today: -- The relations of the Baltic states with Russia; -- Moving closer to the European Union [EU] and the Western European Union [WEU]; -- Moving closer to the European-Atlantic security structures; -- Baltic cooperation. Let me make a few introductory remarks before we begin the discussion. One: Germany has a particularly close relationship with the Baltic states and Russia in many respects. For this reason and because the Baltic have always been a yardstick for European stability, we are interested in consolidating Baltic-Russian relations. Germany, together with its Western partners, has always advocated an unconditional withdrawal of former Soviet troops from the Baltic. We have recently reiterated this commitment by participating in the U.S.-Latvian negotiations to achieve a compromise on the Russian radar station at Skrunda. There must be no further doubt about the final withdrawal of Russian troops by 31 August 1994, leaving only the troops required for operating the Skrunda installation. There is no reason for making the withdrawal subject to any conditions, either. Another open question is the status of the Russian-speaking population, especially in Estonia and Latvia. This aspect is of utmost importance for future relations with Russia. The Baltic states deserve credit for their human rights policy, which has been acknowledged by the CSCE and the Council of Europe. On the other hand, the CSCE and the Council of Europe have found open points regarding the future status of the Russian-speaking population, which must be solved by a flexible and pragmatic approach. We are well aware of the historic reasons for the existing problems. Yet: Political reality tells us that there is no alternative to integrating the Russians who want to stay in Estonia and Latvia. This requires, however, that the Russian-speaking population demonstrates its will to be integrated by behaving accordingly. Together with its Western partners, Germany supports all measures contributing to a long-term stabilization of Baltic-Russian relations. With this in mind, I do hope that both sides will make use of the opportunities for consolidation that will arise after the troops have pulled out. This also applies to the restructuring of trade relations. There are good opportunities for the Baltic states to act as a link between the Central and North East European states on the one hand, and Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine on the other. Two: Since they regained independence, it has been a special concern of German foreign policy to get the Baltic states closer to the European Union and the WEU. This policy is based on the insight that the Baltic is part of Central and North Eastern Europe in political, geographical, and cultural terms. On the other hand, by moving the Baltic states closer to the European Union and WEU we want to emphasize that they are irreversibly linked to Europe and we want to open up new markets in the West for them. Urged by Germany, the EU Council gave the Commission a mandate for negotiating a free trade agreement with the Baltic states on 7 February, which is to contain a perspective for membership. During its EU presidency in the second half of this year, Germany will do everything it can to create the right conditions for concluding an association agreement. At the same time, we are trying to get the Baltic states closer to the WEU, the European Union's defense policy component. It is our aim to include the Baltic states in an improved security policy status. Three: We are working toward an all-European security structure based on trust and cooperation between equal partners. It is to safeguard security, including that of the Baltic states. An important step in this direction is NATO's Partnership for Peace offer, which you immediately accepted. The CSCE is also of great importance. The opportunities offered by preventive diplomacy within the CSCE have been shown by the activities of the CSCE Commissioner for National Minorities and the CSCE long-term mission to Estonia. We are, therefore, pleased that such a mission will also open in Latvia shortly. An important precondition for the functioning of the CSCE and the all-European structure is the inclusion of Russia. Taking account of Russian security interests and Russia's active participation in the CSCE does not mean that the idea of special spheres of interest is accepted. Such concepts are by no means acceptable to us and are expressly rejected by us and our partners in the alliance. Four: The Baltic Sea links Germany, the Baltic states, and Russia in a special way. After the end of the Cold War, chances for a cooperation creating peace and prosperity in the Baltic Sea area are better than they have been for a long time. Cooperation within the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Baltic Sea States, chaired by Estonia, has developed in a very positive way. With the third meeting of foreign ministers of the Baltic Sea Council approaching, we should consider ways of making future Baltic Sea cooperation as vivid and full of perspectives as it has been up to now. Dear colleagues, I suggest that we now start the discussion on your countries' relations with Russia and I ask colleague Adrejevs to open the discussion.
