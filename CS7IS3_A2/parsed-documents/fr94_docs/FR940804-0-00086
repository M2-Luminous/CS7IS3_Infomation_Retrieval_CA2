FR940804-0-00086 FR940804-0-00023 Section-by-Section Analysis Section XX .1 Purpose and Application Section XX .1 of the final rule, ``Purpose and application,'' explains that the rule establishes the coordination procedures to be followed by the Federal agencies responsible for processing complaints of employment discrimination filed against recipients of Federal financial assistance and arising under section 504 and title I of the ADA. In addition to establishing those new procedures, the rule also restates and integrates into one comprehensive regulation those provisions of the Department's existing title II regulation that established the procedures for coordinating the processing of complaints covered by title II of the ADA and either title I or section 504, or both. The rule does not amend the title II regulation, but simply locates all of the applicable regulations regarding coordination in a single source. Section XX .2 Definitions Section XX .2 defines a number of terms used in the rule. A definition of the term ``due weight'' has been added, supplementing the discussion in the preamble. The definitions of Federal financial assistance and program or activity , both of which relate to the determination of whether jurisdiction exists under section 504, have been revised from those contained in the NPRM. The NPRM originally contained a detailed definition of Federal financial assistance. However, in recognition of the fact that this definition may vary among section 504 agency regulations due to the nature of financial assistance provided by each agency, the new definition simply refers to the definitions adopted by each section 504 agency in its regulation implementing section 504 for Federally-assisted programs. The definition of program or activity under section 504 was modified by the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987, Pub. L. 100&hyph;259, 102 Stat. 29, for all section 504 agencies. Therefore, to avoid any inconsistency between this rule and any agency regulations implementing section 504 that may not have been amended to reflect this change to the Rehabilitation Act, the new definition references the statutory definition. Section XX .3 Exchange of Information Section XX .3 requires the agencies responsible for enforcing the ADA and section 504 to share information. Section XX .4 Confidentiality Section XX .4(a) states that the confidentiality obligations applicable to the EEOC under the ADA also apply to section 504 agencies and designated agencies when information obtained by the EEOC is transmitted to such agencies, except when the agency receives the same information from a source other than the EEOC. Section XX .4(b) states that when the EEOC receives information from section 504 or designated agencies, the EEOC shall comply with any confidentiality requirements applicable to that information. Section XX .5 Date of Receipt Section XX .5 states that a complaint or charge of employment discrimination is deemed to be filed, for purposes of determining timeliness, on the date the complaint or charge is first received by a Federal agency with jurisdiction under section 504 or the ADA, regardless of whether it is subsequently transferred to another agency for processing.
