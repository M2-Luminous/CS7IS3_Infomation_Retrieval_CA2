FBIS4-9108 "dreeu077_i_94006" FBIS-EEU-94-077 Daily Report 21 Apr 1994 BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA Situation in Gorazde -- Apr 20 Situation in Gorazde -- Apr 20 More on `Aerosol' Missiles AU2004193394 AU2004193394 BFN [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1700 GMT on 20 April carries in its regular 45-minute newscast three reports on the situation in Gorazde. The first item is compiled by Mediha Colo, who summarizes the contents of several "radio bridges" established today with Gorazde. In these reports, Gorazde Mayor Rijad Rascic and a group of local doctors in the war hospital describe the situation in the city. Colo says that "during the realization of the radio bridge, the communications center in Gorazde managed to establish a telephone line with the hospital, where doctors joined in the conversation." One unidentified doctor says that "just in front of the hospital, a smoke bomb landed, which did not make a lot of noise on impact, and some white smoke came out of it. Then there was something like a firecracker, which burst through a concrete surface. There were people under [words indistinct], the four of them were burnedt. One got away with horrendous burns. He keeps talking about some kind of air [words indistinct]." The doctor says "there are some missiles that are parachuted in. They fire the missile from above the city and it does not go over.... [pauses] It lands with a parachute on the street. The explosions are tremendous. They have even been firing Maljutka missiles at civilian targets, at apartments, at people." Another doctor says that "they are demolishing the hospital, there are people buried under the ruins, the hospital is almost totally in ruins." Mediha Colo says that "in the next radio bridge, Rijad Rascic gave us information about missiles with aerosol fillings, which the chetniks have been firing today at Gorazde." Rascic says that "these missiles are intended to destroy fortifications and clear mine fields. They were used in the Vietnam War. They create pressure in the place of impact and kill within a radius of 80 meters and inflict serious injuries within a radius of 300 meters. We have some shrapnel from one of these missiles, and there is this mark on it: (SAD-275) and something else, but I do not have the part with the other mark in my hand here." Enes Musovic then reports from Gorazde that "no one here knows what to say to yet another blatant lie launched by the fascist scum from Pale. The chetniks have neither halted the attacks on Gorazde nor has it even occurred to them to have a unilateral cease-fire. Just at a time when Belgrade Radio in its own fashion lied to its servile listeners about an alleged cease-fire by the chetniks and the invented constant provocations from Gorazde, Gorazde came under cross fire from all the Chetnik artillery from all their positions." He says that "28 people were killed in just one hour today, 12 of them children." He says that "the chetniks are intensifying their attacks as the evening approaches. Attacks by strong infantry forces of Karadzic's murderers on the defense lines in the city center are supported by dozens of tanks from the direction of Kopaci and Jabuka." Gorazde Mayor Rijad Rascic reports that "the chetnik criminal Radovan Karadzic says that only the left bank of the Drina River should be protected by the UN Protection Force. However, the public should know that there is no left and right bank in Gorazde. Gorazde is a city that cannot be divided, that will not be allowed to be divided. The people on the right bank have to know that they will not be betrayed; they should have absolutely no doubts about that. Everything on the right bank will be defended in the same way it is defended on the left bank. Anyone who might think that one or the other bank is safer is wrong. Both the left and the right bank are under a very serious attack, but our defenders are successfully organizing the defense with what they have, which is mostly their bodies."
