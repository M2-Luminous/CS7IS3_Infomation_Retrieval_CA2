The deals accepted by Austria, Finland and Sweden on Tuesday [1 March] -- with Norway expected to follow suit next week -- prepare the way for the inclusion of countries with strong democratic traditions and economies which will make a net contribution to EC funds. Their accession, scheduled for January 1 next year, will open the door to the East European applicants, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia. The widening of the Community, espoused by successive British governments, is on the verge of taking place. There is, however, a furlong or two to go before the finishing line. First, the Commission and Oslo must resolve their differences over access to Norwegian waters for Spanish fishermen. Second, the Community has to decide whether to change the current system of qualified majority voting when the new members join. Third, the agreements reached in Brussels are subject to referenda in the applicant countries. According to the opinion polls, those in favour of membership outnumber opponents in Austria and Finland, but not in Sweden and Norway. If all goes well, by next year the Community will form the largest economic unit in the world, a market of 372 million people with a combined gross domestic product of $6,700 billion. As the date approaches for the Maastricht review conference in 1996, those countries, such as Britain, which remain sceptical about the treaty's goals should find in the new Scandinavian members useful allies in curbing federalist ambitions. The enlargement, the first since Spain and Portugal joined in 1986, is to be welcomed.
