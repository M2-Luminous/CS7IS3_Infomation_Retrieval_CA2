FBIS4-13324 "drnes076dd_94008" FBIS-NES-94-076 Daily Report 15 Apr 1994 Palestinian Affairs PFLP-GC Leader Attacks `Reactionary' Arab Regimes PFLP-GC Leader Attacks `Reactionary' Arab Regimes JN1604112694 (Clandestine) Al-Quds Palestinian Arab Radio in Arabic 1630 GMT 15 Apr 94 JN1604112694 (Clandestine) Al-Quds Palestinian Arab Radio Arabic BFN [Excerpts] Under the slogan of "With Bullets We Fight, With Rocks We Resist, and With Gliders We Fly to Palestine" the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC] held a speech rally at al-Yarmuk Camp at 1600 today, 15 April, on the occasion of the 29th anniversary of the front's establishment. The rally was attended by Ahmad Jibril, secretary general of the PFLP-GC; Dr. 'Ala'-al-Din 'Abdin, secretary of the Damascus Branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party; Staff Brigadier General Tariq al-Khadra', chief of staff of the Palestinian Liberation Army [PLA]; leaders of the Palestinian Forces Alliance; leaders and representatives of patriotic parties in Lebanon; leaders and representatives of the National Progressive Front in Syria; a number of ranking PLA officers; representatives of Arab and friendly liberation movements; members of the Arab and friendly diplomatic corps; relatives of the martyrs and prisoners; and members of the PFLP-GC's Political Bureau and Central Committee. [passage omitted] PFLP-GC Secretary General Ahmad Jibril delivered the speech of the Palestinian revolution and the PFLP-GC. He began his speech by asking: How far have we reached and when will we get there? He said: It is the right of our people and the martyrs of our revolution and front to ask: How far have we come, and what have we accomplished throughout this long militant march. He added: From the very beginning, since 1959, we have laid the first stones of the armed struggle. We have said the road to the liberation of Palestine is difficult and long and the battle against the Zionist enemy is an open one because we are not just fighting a Zionist group, but are fighting colonialism and its agents, represented by reactionary Arab regimes and the renegades and deviants in the PLO leadership. Jibril touched on the issue of independent Palestinian decisionmaking and said: Those who have called for this want to separate the national cause of the Palestinian people from the pan-Arab cause in order to reach what they have now reached. The deviations that have occurred, the last of which the Oslo Accord, are the natural outcome of this idea, which is aimed at isolating the Palestine question from pan-Arabism. He described those who have called for independent Palestinian decisionmaking as the owners of the separatist veto in the Palestinian community. He said: The real Palestinian decisionmaking is the decisionmaking of the Arab and Islamic nation and the Muslim Arab people. [passage omitted] Ahmad Jibril dealt with the current political situation and strongly criticized the visit to Oman and Qatar by the Zionist delegation led by Zionist Deputy Foreign Minister [Yosi] Beilin. He said: The enemy's penetration into reactionary Arab regimes is not new. This time, however, it not only aims to achieve public and direct normalization but also to find new cards to pressure the forces hostile to the settlement and to give the Tunis leadership and 'Arafat a new dose of strength now that they have become exposed and fragile before Arab and Palestinian public opinion. He said: The Zionist political course at this stage aims at dissolving the unified Arab position in order to force Syria and Lebanon to accept what Clinton and the others seek. Ahmad Jibril says: Today, there is a current called peace that has its own way to reach agreements -- in Oslo, Washington, Muscat, and tomorrow Bahrain. Jibril says: The 'Arafat-Rabin agreement has been concluded in two files -- security and economy. He noted that the security file calls for stopping and ending the intifadah through 'Arafat's police now that the Zionists have failed in confronting the intifadah. He said that 'Arafat's task is now to go to Gaza and Jericho to foil and destroy the intifadah instead of the Zionists. The Zionists aim at infiltrating the Arab world through the economic file. Jibril says: If the Zionists and 'Arafat succeed in stopping the intifadah, it means opening the door wide open for Jewish-Zionist immigration into Palestine, reinforcing Zionist settlements in Palestine, and imposing a siege on the Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. Ahmad Jibril said that the heroic intifadah has aborted the schemes of 'Arafat and Rabin and will continue to resist them. In his speech Jibril praised the firm and solid stands of Syria, Libya, and Iran.
