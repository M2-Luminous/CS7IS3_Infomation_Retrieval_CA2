With a growing number of overseas-funded enterprises in China, disputes between labor and capital have increased and infringement upon workers' rights and interests has also become a severe issue, Hong Kong deputies said at a group discussion of the Guangdong provincial delegation at the ongoing NPC session. Cheng Yiu Tong, chairman of the Federation of Trade Unions of Hong Kong and an advisor on Hong Kong Affairs, made an investigation in labor-capital disputes before he came to attend the NPC session in Beijing. He said, infringement upon workers' rights and interests by overseas-funded enterprises includes withholding workers' wages, extending work hours, insufficient facilities for safety production, lack of labor contracts, harsh factory rules and regulations, arbitrarily encroaching on personal rights and depriving workers of the right to organize trade unions. After listing a number of facts and figures, he summed up that 70 percent of the disputes belong to the violation of economic contracts by the capital side and infringement on workers' rights; 20 percent are cases that the capital side encroaches on democratic and personal rights of workers; and only 10 percent cases belong to unreasonable demands by workers. Hong Kong deputies raised suggestions on protection of workers' interests and rights with reference to relevant regulations of Hong Kong and in accordance with domestic reality. It is necessary to strengthen supervision and strictly abide by law in handling the disputes, they said. They suggested that workers have the right to ask for liquidation of enterprises which withhold workers' wages for more than one month; those that extend work time arbitrarily, violate industrial safety regulations and endanger workers' health shall be punished; those that refuse to sign labor contracts or allow workers to organize trade unions shall be ordered to stop operation until they accept the demand. They also suggested that the labor law being drafted shall protect rights and interests of workers in all types of firms -- state-owned, collective, overseas-funded or private enterprises -- just the same.
