Antilleans Voting Government Parties Out"] [Text] Willemstad/The Hague -- The cabinet and all major parties in the House of Representatives believe that the outcome of the elections on Curacao and on the other islands, will have a favorable impact on relations between the Netherlands and the Antilles. According to Antillean and Aruban Affairs Minister Hirsch Ballin, a "wind of change" will blow across the islands with the new party PAR [Antillean Restructuring Party]. VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] Representative Wiebenga, chairman of the Permanent Chamber Committee on Antillean Affairs, also believes that dealings with winner and presumable President Miguel Pourier will be better than with his predecessor Mrs. Liberia-Peters. Just like the VVD, the PvdA [Labor Party], D66 [Democrats 66] and CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] are also pleased with the outcome. All parties consider Pourier to be a competent and reliable politician. According to Wiebenga, the opposition's victory, including on St. Martin, is no reason to lift Netherlands control over St. Martin right away. "Problems are still too big to do so. Improvements will have to take place on St. Martin itself. In addition, we will first have to wait for the elections for the island councils, which are only scheduled for next year." In the island councils, the parties who have won now, are still in the minority. The new party PAR, which won a historic victory on Curacao last Friday during the elections for a new Antillean Parliament, is only two months old. The party won eight of Curacao's 14 seats, and overwhelmingly defeated Maria Liberia-Peters' governing PNP [National People's Party], which fell back from seven to three seats. On the other Antillean islands, the governing parties were also defeated. The governor will charge the PAR with forming a new government, with Party Leader Miguel Pourier as presumable president. After consultation with parties from the other islands, he will see which national coalitions can be formed. Until then, Paula's resigning interim cabinet will stay on. Last October, the PAR started as a movement which stood up for "the preservation of the Antilles" during the referendum on Curacao's political future. Former President Maria Liberia-Peters admitted the PNP's loss. "The population has spoken, and we will respect its decision. Apparently, we failed to express our views clearly enough." The MAN [New Antilles Movement], under the leadership of Don Martina, kept its two seats, and the Democratic Party its only seat. In Curacao, two parties will disappear from Parliament: FOL [Workers' Liberation Front] had three seats, Our Country one. On St. Martin, the rule of the Democratic Party (DP) of controversial Leader Claude Wathey, has come to an end. The opposition party SPA [St. Maarten Patriotic Alliance] won three out of the Windward Island's three parliamentary seats. Two years ago, the SPA had already defeated the DP during the elections for the island council, but was nonetheless kept out of the island's government. On Bonaire, the UPB [Bonaire Patriotic Union] had to cede two seats to the oppositional Democratic Party-Bonaire headed by Jopie Abraham. The governing parties, the Democratic Party, and the WIPM [Windward Islands People's Movement] respectively, only remained in power on the smallest islands of St. Eustatius and Saba.
