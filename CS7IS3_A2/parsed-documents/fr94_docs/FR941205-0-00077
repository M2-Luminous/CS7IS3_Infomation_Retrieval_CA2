FR941205-0-00077 FR941205-0-00021 EPA's actions under section 502 of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply address operating permits programs submitted to satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR part 70. Because EPA's disapproval of the Commonwealth of Virginia's request under section 502 of the CAA for approval of its operating permits program does not impose any new requirements, it does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.
