Here is a report by Nedzad Leko: [Begin recording] [Leko] General Michael Rose was first received by Presidency Member Ejup Ganic. After the talks, Dr. Ganic told foreign and domestic journalists the following: [Ganic in English fading into Serbo-Croatian translation] Speaking on behalf of the Presidency, I informed General Rose that we are going to do everything with a view to helping his mission here. Everybody knows that the humanitarian situation is very tragic and we hope that the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] troops headed by the general will act efficiently, protect the humanitarian convoys, and deliver food to the population, and we ourselves are going to do everything to help. We do not want UN troops to be treated badly and are encouraging Gen. Rose to act efficiently and do everything necessary. We also touched upon other issues such as Tuzla Airport and other details. Of course, peace negotiations were one of the topics and we stressed that if clear political principles for negotiations are not formulated, Geneva will continue being a mere media zoo. Therefore, we hope that the clear political principles that were defined at the London conference will be confirmed in order for us to be able to continue political talks. [Leko] Gen. Rose commented very briefly on the talks he had with Dr. Ganic: [Rose in English fading into Serbo-Croatian translation] We had a very useful conversation. We initiated a large number of issues. I told Dr. Ganic that UNPROFOR will do the best it can with a view to continuing to help the delivery of humanitarian aid and to help the peace process in this country. [Leko] One of the questions for Gen. Rose was whether one can expect some change in the UNPROFOR mandate with his arrival. [Rose in English fading into Serbo-Croatian translation] I do not think that we are going to see any changes in the mandate I received in the near future. [Leko] Today, Gen. Rose also talked with Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic and with Hasan Muratovic, chairman of the State Commission for Relations with the United Nations. After the formal part of Gen. Rose's visit, Dr. Silajdzic told the journalist the following: [Silajdzic] I will say only one thing: The most important thing is the humanitarian convoys, that is, how are we to clear the corridors for humanitarian convoys. I think that this is the key question and we are going to talk about it now. Everything else is of marginal importance at this moment. Therefore, freeing corridors for humanitarian convoys is the basic thing we are talking about. We are now going to continue the talks. [Leko] In reply to the question asked by foreign journalists on whether he expects essential changes in UNPROFOR activity with Gen. Rose's arrival, Dr. Silajdzic said the following: [Silajdzic in English fading into Serbo-Croatian translation] As far as I can understand, the mandate has not changed and unfortunately, as much as they would like to help, they do not have the mandate to do so. Therefore the problem is that the aggression on Bosnia-Herzegovina is taken for granted. We are just the other side in the conflict. The victim and aggressor are equal. The killed and the killer are the same. Why? Because nobody wants to interfere. The West has become a group of noninterfering countries. Democracy and morality are attacked in Bosnia, if that means anything to anybody. Our principles are attacked and we are seen only as a side in a conflict. The guns around Sarajevo and civilians waiting to be shelled are seen as one and the same thing. I think I have said enough. [Leko] Would you like to see the roads for the passage of convoys freed by military action, foreign journalists asked Dr. Silajdzic. [Silajdzic in English fading into Serbo-Croatian translation] We would like to see convoys pass because people are hungry, people are dying, while some other people are blocking the convoys' passage. Therefore, whoever is blocking convoys -- be it Bosnians, Serbs, or Croats -- should be attacked because they are killing people with starvation. [Leko] During their meeting today, Army General Rasim Delic informed Gen. Rose about the situation on the battlefield, the humanitarian situation, and the cause of the conflicts in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The two generals also talked about the problems of implementing the agreements signed so far, as well as resolutions that have been adopted without instruments for their implementation being developed. Gen. Rose presented the aim of his mission, as well as activities he is planning for the coming period. I want to help the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina, particularly in the delivery of humanitarian aid. In doing so I will do everything with the means and forces I have at my disposal, Gen. Rose stressed at the end of today's talks. [end recording]
