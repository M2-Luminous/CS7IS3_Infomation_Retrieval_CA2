The leader of the main governing party emphatically stated that "we have felt no pressure, and if they were to exert any we would flatly reject it because we are not going to tolerate any form of pressure from anyone, either in favor or against it." In June Martinez will head a PDC delegation to Cuba with the purpose of personally learning about the current situation in Cuba. Asked about the problems preventing the full restoration of diplomatic ties, Martinez answered: "We cannot continue to live in the past, either at a national or international level." Among these obstacles is the support granted by Cuba to Chilean armed groups that struggled against the Chilean military regime, especially the massive and illegal introduction of weapons into Chile in 1986. Martinez also stated that the current situation in Cuba is far from what it was a decade ago and important progress can be seen on the island. He commented: "During our visit we will see what changes have taken place." After the visit, the delegation will give the PDC leadership a report on its findings so that the latter may then give the government its opinion. [passage omitted]
