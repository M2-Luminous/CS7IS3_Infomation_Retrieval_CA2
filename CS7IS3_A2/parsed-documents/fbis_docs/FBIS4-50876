China has pledged to disband such a body. During the week-long visit, his third in five months, Mr Patten will also respond to fears raised recently by the British parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee over Hong Kong's future. The row between Britain and China over a human rights commission peaked earlier this month when Beijing's most senior official in charge of the territory, Lu Ping, vowed to disband any such commission after 1997. The Executive Council has already had a broad discussion on the proposal and will make a final decision next month, according to the Governor. While in London, Mr Patten will meet Prime Minister John Major, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and the minister with special responsibility for Hong Kong, Alastair Goodlad. He will once again press for UK citizenship to be granted to the wives and widows of British ex-servicemen and ethnic minorities living in the territory. Meanwhile, Mr Patten has hit out at two former governors, Lord MacLehose and Lord Wilson, who have criticised his constitutional reforms for provoking confrontation with China in the runup to 1997. The criticisms were made during a House of Lords debate on Hong Kong on Wednesday [18 May] night. Mr Patten accused the two men of being out of touch with today's Hong Kong. "What may have been suitable and appropriate in the 1970s, I am not sure is as appropriate in the 1990s," he said. "This is a community which does have political aspirations." He maintained his political reform had been endorsed by the Foreign Affairs Committee and Britain's political parties. Mr Patten has also criticised some of the proposed amendments to the remainder of his political blueprint, which will be debated in the Legislative Council next month. He said they were contrary to the interests of the public. "We believe that our bill is the best one...and is in the best interests of Hong Kong." Mr Patten said the government had not blocked independent legislator Emily Lau's ambitious amendment for fully direct elections in the Legislative Council, which was ruled out of order by council President John Swaine on Thursday. During his visit to Britain, the Governor will fulfil a number of engagements, including addressing a parliamentary group on Hong Kong and the Conservative Party's backbench committee on foreign affairs. He will also meet Hong Kong communities living in the northwest of England.
