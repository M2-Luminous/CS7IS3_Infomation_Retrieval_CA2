He said the view that the high-ranking officials of Slovakia's Hungarian parliamentary parties are some sort of "lone runners" without any background seems to be unsound, as current opinion polls indicate that the Egyutteles Hungarian minority movement and the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement (MKDH) each represent 20 percent of the ethnic Hungarian population. Kanis said the worst shortcoming lies in the conceptlessness of the Slovak Government and parliament in their approach to ethnic minority issues. He said this approach should be changed and these problems solved "comprehensively and definitively," since the failure to do so was constantly giving rise to new Hungarian demands. He said the SDL had long pointed to the necessity of solving national minority problems with a constitutional law, but that this had not been done. That Hungarian representatives submitted such a bill to Parliament Chairman Ivan Gasparovic last summer and that this bill was "swept off the table," as they said, was unfortunate, Kanis said. The problems of Hungarian and Slovak co-existence in southern Slovakia has become an international one, he said. That is why it should be seen with "European eyes." That the SDL was a representative of the forces which "want to reach a compromise" is proved by its exemplary relations with the Hungarian Socialist Party, Kanis said.
