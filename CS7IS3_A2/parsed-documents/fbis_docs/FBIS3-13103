[Rabin] Times are not easy, but that is the way it is, and we have to deal with the problems and solve them. [Barqay] Do you fear acts of retaliation? Do you have information regarding expected acts of revenge for the Hebron massacre? [Rabin] Look, terror groups which were active before may have greater motivation to exacerbate their acts following the massacre in the Cave of the Patriarchs. Had they been able to carry out murderous terror acts even before the events in Hebron, they would have done so, because this is their way, this is their aim. They want to kill Israelis and the peace process. The murder in the Cave of the Patriarchs may have increased their motivation. That is why we imposed a closure banning entry into the territory of sovereign Israel, including united Jerusalem. [Barqay] My question, sir, was whether you have information on preparations, new squads, something that.... [Rabin, interrupting] We have reports that there is growing motivation for retaliation. Terror organizations have announced that they intend to take revenge. In view of this, we are getting ready. [Barqay] How long will you keep the residents under closure? [Rabin] We reconsider the closure on a daily basis or every few days, in order to determine whether the territory has calmed down and the threat diminished. Furthermore, we will not lift it all at the same time. The most important factor in our considerations is security. [Barqay] The uneasy security situation has led you to try to expand the coalition, among other things. Will Tzomet's joining the government give the government legitimacy in terms of the right wing? [Rabin] I sought to expand the basis of the coalition even before the tragic event in Hebron took place. We started initial contacts with Tzomet before the Hebron massacre. I initiated them, and I will not discuss how they were conducted. They did not follow the incident. The same holds true for SHAS [Torah Observing Sephardim]. [Barqay] What are the chances of Refa'el Eytan's joining the coalition, in view of the opposition from Meretz? [Rabin] I will not deal with speculation. The Labor Bureau and caucus approved negotiations with factions that accept the government's guidelines and will not dispute agreements we have made with the PLO. This opens the door to negotiations with SHAS, as well as with Tzomet. [Barqay] Will you summon Eytan and others from Tzomet...? [Rabin, interrupting] He will know when I decide, and not from you. [Barqay] Over the past few days, Eytan has made some remarks that contradict the government guidelines. [Rabin] That may be. I also heard some cabinet ministers making remarks that I do not believe to always be in accordance with the government policies. I distinguish remarks from.... [pauses] Tzomet and its leader are not in the coalition today; therefore, there is no reason for him not to say whatever he wants. If and when he joins the coalition, it will be a different story. [Barqay] You say that ministers made remarks contradicting the government platform and guidelines. Do you mean remarks favoring the evacuation of settlers from Hebron? [Rabin] I will not elaborate on this. I would rather speak personally to any such minister. In general, I can tell you that such things happen. [Barqay] Let me ask you directly: Are you in favor of evacuating the settlers from Hebron? [Rabin] I will not answer this. According to the Declaration of Principles [DOP], all settlements remain in place. On the basis of the negotiations with the PLO, I do not have to do this. Hence, this is currently not on the agenda. [Barqay] Personally, do you not think that their being there is a provocation? [Rabin] Look, the last time I was prime minister, I supported settlement in Qiryat Arba' and opposed settlement in the heart of Hebron. The previous government did many things -- not only in Hebron but also in other settlements in areas densely populated by Palestinians -- to which I opposed. Today, we are facing a reality, and our problem is to deal with it. The important thing today is to resume the negotiations with the PLO as soon as possible. I believe this would be the best answer to those who oppose the Cairo agreement and the DOP. [Barqay] We hear that 'Arafat wants to bring in armed observers as a precondition for resuming the negotiations. [Rabin] I do not conduct negotiations with him through you. [Barqay] Do you accept this demand? [Rabin] I do not conduct negotiations with him through you. [Barqay] Can you estimate when the parties will return to the negotiating table? Days, weeks, months? [Rabin] I would not like to engage in estimates when I do not have data that would justify making such estimates. There has been no agreement by the PLO and the Palestinians to resume negotiations. [Barqay] Newspaper columnists these days describe you as someone who is very uncertain, wavering between the dovish attitude of Yosi Sarid and Meretz and the hawkish stands of Refa'el Eytan. Do have any second thoughts regarding the agreement you made with the PLO? [Rabin] I have no second thoughts. The government and I determined stands and the path we will follow. I adhere to them. I also want to expand the basis of the coalition in order to make their implementation possible. Naturally, in a coalition, there is a broad spectrum of stands and attitudes. I believe that the government policy -- as expressed in the way the peace talks have been conducted -- expresses the line to which I adhere. I feel the pain of terror acts. I condemn every act of terror, and I hurt twice as much when a loathsome Jewish murderer carries out a despicable act. [Barqay] As we speak, the Shamgar inquiry commission is beginning its deliberations. We know that you had some reservations about setting it up.... [Rabin, interrupting] A commission of inquiry was set up. I respect it, and I believe it will shed light on the truth. [Barqay] In view of this, do you not believe the time has come for you to appoint a full-time defense minister? [Rabin] Two previous commissions of inquiry -- one set up after the Yom Kippur War and one after the war of Lebanon -- were established when there was a full-time defense minister. Such events take place regardless of whether the post of defense minister was separate from that of the prime minister. I neither believe this is necessary nor am I in any way considering it. [Barqay] You will stay on as defense minister and prime minister? [Rabin] Yes. [Barqay] And you have full confidence in Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq? [Rabin] I have full confidence in the defense establishment, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and its commanders, the security services, and the Border Police. This does not mean that a mishap can never happen here or there. I have full confidence in the IDF high command, from the chief of staff down, and in the Shin Bet men. Regrettably, the public does not know enough about the burden the IDF, Shin Bet, the Border Police, and the Israel Police are shouldering; neither does it know how many terrible things were prevented thanks to their efficient activity. I wish to state here: The IDF and the security services deserve our every praise. [Barqay] Despite some mishaps here and there? [Rabin] I made my point clear. [Barqay] Mr. Rabin, how will your coalition look in two weeks? [Rabin] I will not engage in nor do I have need of prophecies. You may need to interview me, but this does not compel me to answer every question, especially when things are not yet finalized. I will only say definite things when I am able to bring them before the Knesset, and then you will know them anyway.
