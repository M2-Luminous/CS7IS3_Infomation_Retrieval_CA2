The foreign minister said that consultations are under way at the UN Security Council to issue a resolution about the Hebron massacre. He noted the need to prevent a recurrence of such a hideous incident by disarming the settlers in the Hebron area. He added: If the settlers are going to have weapons for self-defense, the Palestinians must be given the same right. If the occupying power protects both the settlers and the Palestinians, this will be another matter and in that case the settlers' weapons must be removed. Musa said such a measure would serve the interests of the Israelis and the Palestinians.
