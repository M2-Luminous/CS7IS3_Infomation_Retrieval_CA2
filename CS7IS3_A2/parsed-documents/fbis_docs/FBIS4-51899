FBIS4-51899 "dreas086_d_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-086 Daily Report 4 May 1994 South Korea ROK: Take 2 of 3--Unification Minister on Nuclear Issue ROK: Take 2 of 3--Unification Minister on Nuclear Issue SK0405060594 SK0405060594 BFN [Text] [Minister Yi continues] Although the focal point is the nuclear problem, an even more important issue for North Korea is whether it makes an appropriate decision that corresponds to the trend of the international community and of international history. [Reporter Yi] Reports noted that there are two different lines--hardline and moderate--in the United States, our ally, toward the North Korean nuclear problem. On the other hand, the people put forward the line of stick and carrot. I understand that our government is maintaining a position that it will not push ahead with economic cooperation with North Korea unless the North Korean nuclear problem is solved. Do you intend to maintain this policy in the future, too? [Minister Yi] Yes. The nuclear issue, unlike other ordinary issues, is one which decides the destiny of the nation. This issue, regardless of whether one has one, two, or five nuclear weapons, is indeed fearful. Therefore, one should not evade the main point of the issue. We have a number of plans for economic cooperation to be carried out when a significant progress is seen. In addition, we also have a plan to form not only the economic common body but also a national commonwealth through economic cooperation. However, these plans can begin when a significant progress is seen in resolving the nuclear problem. Our situation is, in a sense, that we are waiting while making preparations. I believe that this is well understood by the North Korean side. [Reporter Yi] We declared that we will not push ahead with the exchange of North-South special envoys, which was put forward as a precondition for a third round of U.S.-North Korea talks. I understand, however, that this does not mean that we exclude North- South dialogue. What is your view on the prospect for North-South dialogue? [Minister Yi] This is similar to the case of economic cooperation. In other words, this is up to the North Korean decision. The Korean peninsula should not remain as an exception to the trend of international history. This is what we and our neighboring countries wish. It is a principle that problems should be resolved by the parties concerned. We have a framework called the basic North-South agreement. We also have a framework called the joint denuclearization declaration for the nuclear problem. Based on this, various joint committees were formed. We should begin dialogue through these channels. All this will work as an excellent occasion for North Korea to resolve national issues and to evade its isolation. We hope that North Korea, keenly aware of this situation, will make a good decision. We also urge North Korea to do so. [Reporter Yi] The people pointed out that the unification policy by the diplomacy-security team of the government was confusing and inconsistent in the past. Thus, there were problems in its team work. People also pointed out that the Unification Board failed to play its role and functions properly. What is your view on this? [Minister Yi] I do not think that there was serious confusion. As you know, each government office has its own characteristic in deciding important works assigned to it. The Defense Ministry is devoted to defending the nation and the Agency for National Security Planning places priority to security of our system and nation. The Foreign Ministry thinks of our international image and international cooperation. The Unification Board is the one that should push ahead with works pertaining to unification in a progressive way.
