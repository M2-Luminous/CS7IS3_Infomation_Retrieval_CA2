The 18-man committee, chaired by Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, is discussing the political situation and the developments in the occupied territory following the issuance of the Security Council resolution on the massacre of the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. President 'Arafat called for the meeting the day before yesterday. A number of the Fatah Central Committee members, including Salim al-Za'nun, also known as Abu-al-Adib; 'Abbas Zaki; and Muhammad Jihad, left Amman yesterday morning to attend the meetings. In a statement to AL-RA'Y one hour before leaving Amman for the Tunisian capital, Salim al-Za'nun -- one of the founders of Fatah in 1964 and acting speaker of the Palestine National Council -- said: What has been achieved on the political level and the [Palestinian-Israeli] talks will top the agenda of this meeting, especially following the issuance of the recent Security Council resolution. Al-Za'nun said: There will be no going back on the Palestinian participation in the coming Arab-Israeli talks, and the Palestinian leadership has recently made a decision to participate in the talks. He added: We should not be over optimistic. Israel is trying to absorb the anger following the blatant Hebron massacre; however, the Israelis will return to their old methods. Therefore, it is necessary to hold a quadripartite meeting comprising Syria, Jordan, Palestine, and Lebanon as soon as possible to unify the stand of the countries involved in the Arab-Israeli talks. Al-Za'nun described U.S. reservation about the issue of Jerusalem in the last Security Council resolution as a blow to the Oslo accord. He added: I consider the U.S. reservation about the paragraph related to Jerusalem and the occupied territory a retreat on the part of Washington from its previous stand vis-a-vis these two issues. This negativeness weakens the Security Council resolution. Al-Za'nun said: It is true that Security Council Resolution 904 on the massacre of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron is positive with regard to the condemnation of the massacre, but there is negativeness in it. The resolution exposed the U.S. stand which has delayed the issuance of the resolution all this time. Salim al-Za'nun said: The U.S. reservation on the issue of Jerusalem together with the statements made by Rabin and the U.S. representative at the United Nations -- that Jerusalem is the eternal capital of Israel and that it is not a subject to discussion -- is a serious matter. This is considered a blow to the Oslo accord which placed the issue of Jerusalem on the agenda even if after two years. Concluding his statement to AL-RA'Y, al-Za'nun said: Jerusalem is of special importance to the Arabs and Muslims. Therefore, an Arab and Islamic move is needed to discuss this issue as an integral part of the Arab territory occupied in 1967.
