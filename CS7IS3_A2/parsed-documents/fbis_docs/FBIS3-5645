Custodio said that the Philippines should be concerned over the United States' move in reviving a provision of the U.S. law known as Super 301 which if not settled could erupt into a trade war. Custodio said the "U.S. move is a discordant note of the emphasis in the conclusion of the Uruguay Round (UR) negotiation." [passage omitted] The United States will come out with a target list of countries which it deemed to have erected trade barriers against the United States. Apparently, the Clinton administration's decision to revive the Super 301 came after its failure to settle trade disputes with Japan, where the U.S. has a $59.3-billion trade imbalance. Although the issue is bilateral in nature, Custodio said the situation may reach to a point where "every man has to fend for himself." "The point of the matter is that we are entering a stage under the Uruguay Round where most unilateral action based on national objective is subject to multilateral obligations and multilateral disciplines," Custodio stressed. He added that the conclusion of the UR signals that it is now ready to give powers to international trading which provides a forum for settling disputes. "There is no room for unilateral action in adversarial manner," Custodio stressed. If the United States pursues the trade sanction against Japan, Custodio said "we cannot prevent other countries from picking the same tool where countries have to defend themselves." But if the U.S. and Japan dispute is taken up in the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) a trade war can be prevented but if not then a trade war looms. "We are voicing our concern," Custodio said noting the Philippine concern is also a very valid concern of other developing countries. The Philippines was once subjected to the U.S. Super 301 for alleged rampant violations of intellectual property rights but we have come to successful arrangement last year," Custodio said. Aside from being a trade tool, the United States is also using Super 301 as a political tool where the United States may impose trade sanctions against countries.
