Members of the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) are already voicing concerns over the positions of the chief executive and principal officials of the post-1997 Special Administrative Region (SAR) because the posts must be filled by Chinese nationals without right of abode elsewhere. They believe that with the high proportion of foreign passport holders in senior civil service ranks, few senior civil servants in Hong Kong will meet the eligibility criteria. Hong Kong leader of the Government and Administration Group for the PWC, Leung Chun-ying, said: "(Up to) 50 to 60 per cent of the heads of department are expatriates. The remainder -- Chinese nationals -- hold either foreign or British passports. We are facing the problem of finding enough competent people to fill these SAR positions and still be compatible with the Basic Law," Mr Leung said. "It is an issue the PWC has identified as important to the smooth transition of Hong Kong to an SAR." The 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, which stipulates the terms under which Hong Kong will revert to Chinese rule, and the Basic Law, the territory's post-1997 constitution, state the chief executive -- the position which will replace that of colonial governor -- and principal officials must be Chinese nationals without right of abode elsewhere and must be appointed by China. The posts of Secretaries and Deputy Secretaries of departments, Directors of Bureaus, Commissioner Against Corruption, Director of Audit and Commissioner of Police, would be filled by Chinese citizens. Mr Leung articulated PWC members' fears, saying the possibility of a through-train for senior civil servants to retain their posts beyond 1997 was becoming difficult because of the high number of foreign passport holders. Concerns over the eligibility and number of candidates for top civil servants follows PWC recommendations late last month that the chief executive be chosen 18 months early because of increasingly fractious relations with Britain over Hong Kong's future. That advice, also voiced by Mr Leung, would see a shadow governor to Chris Patten before British rule ends. Mr Leung carried his criticisms of the civil service further, claiming senior officials lacked the necessary knowledge of China affairs to aid a smooth transfer. He called on the Hong Kong Government to delegate a number of high-ranking officials to be posted in Beijing to enhance liaison and understanding between both administrations. Mr Leung said local officials' knowledge of China "lagged behind" by at least 20 years and called on the Hong Kong administration to catch up to ensure a smooth transition.
