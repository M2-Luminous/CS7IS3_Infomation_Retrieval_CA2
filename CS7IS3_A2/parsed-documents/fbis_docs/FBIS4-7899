He is probably the first Russian politician ever to have said anything like that, the paper adds. In short, Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus has scored a big success in Russia, the paper writes, adding that besides a largely routine agreement on the support and protection of investments and a 1994 bilateral trade agreement, Klaus's mission to Russia is notable for achieving a visible turnabout in the Russian approach to bilateral relations. If until now Russia has been accepting Czech payments for oil and other raw materials while allowing Czech imports go unpaid for, this policy has now probably come to an end. The two countries' finance ministries have until the end of May to draw up a document which would set out terms for the Russian debt repayment. The Czech Republic has at long last been deemed to be a country with which it pays to have good long-term relations instead of shortsightedly abusing Czech dependence on oil from Russia, the paper writes. In recent years, Russia has acquired a bad image in general, but especially as regards the economy. The Russian economy is incredibly inefficient and the limping reform is not expected to improve noticeably in the years to come. In view of the lack of recovery factors it comes as no surprise that quality of goods does not improve. And yet in some respects Russia has remained an economic superpower, the paper writes. Russian trade balance registered a $19.5 billion surplus in 1993 with the balance of payments running even. The country, therefore, has not run further into debt, the paper says. Russia's overall foreign debt has attained the $80 billion mark but even so, its value per head remains lower than, to give an example, the one for the Czech Republic, not to mention other former Warsaw Pact countries except Romania. Russia, then, does not belong to countries hopelessly in debt which should or must be allowed some write-offs. Such an approach would be mistaken both in logic and the assessment of reality, the paper says. The lasting quality of what has been achieved, however, is to be doubted as it depends on Russia remaining stable. In any case, the Czech negotiating position will improve markedly once the Ingolstadt oil pipeline has been built, doing away with the dependence on its pipeline from Russia. That said, the Czech Government's fundamental policy should aim to recapture the Russian market. The partial capitalization of Russian debt, meaning that Russian firms are sold to Czech investors, would be a meaningful contribution to that end. The question is, however, the paper asks, whether Czech companies are capable yet of such an expansion. LIDOVA DEMOKRACIE, writing on the same theme, says that during his two days in Moscow, Klaus presented himself as being on an equal footing with his counterparts and as someone who does not even shrink from telling unpalatable facts. Klaus's thoroughly pragmatic or even utilitarian approach found expression in shifting the emphasis from the past, exemplified by the Russian debt and the vassal-like attitude of the former COMECON countries to the Soviet Union, to the future, ideally conceived as one of standard trade relations between two countries with equal rights. In contrast to the former "mutually unprofitable cooperation" Klaus proposed "business as usual," the paper says.
