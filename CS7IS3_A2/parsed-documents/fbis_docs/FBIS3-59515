Budgets are swelling in every country. Water treatment is taking the lion's share. The Regional Institute of Environmental Technologies (RIET) was inaugurated in Singapore at the end of July with a budget of 5 million ECU's (32.5 million francs). It is a joint project between the European Community and Singapore. The purpose of the institution is to provide expertise and serve as a data bank. "Establishment of the RIET comes at a crucial time for the countries of Southeast Asia, where the effects of industrialization have two sides: the growing economic importance of this part of the world and the other side of the coin, which is the rapid accumulation of problems linked to the environment," says Philippe Bergeron, the institute's director. Beyond that, the institute is also a response to Singapore's ambition to become a model "green city" and a regional center of expertise on environmental matters. The island state with 2.8 million inhabitants has already positioned itself in that market by establishing the Semes firm, an indirect subsidiary of the Ministry of Environment that specializes in environmental protection projects in the regional market. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Rapidly Expanding Investments: ASEAN Country Commitments to Water, Air and | |Waste Treatment (in billions of francs) | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Area |1990 |1995 |2000 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Water |21 |30 |46 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Waste |10 |15 |28 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Air |10 |16 |26 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Source: Helmut Kaiser Research Center. | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 110 Billion Francs in Year 2000 The fact is that the size of the regional market is far from negligible: activities linked to environmental cleanup, waste treatment, and air pollution are expected to be worth 66.5 billion francs in 1995 and over 110 billion francs in the year 2000 (promising figures even when compared to the European market, which is 10 times as large). Air and water pollution are expected to increase tenfold over the next 15 years -- a result of the 300-percent increase in the number of vehicles and an increase of from 150 to 200 percent in industrial activity. Within ASEAN (a free trade agreement among Southeast Asian countries), Singapore has had the strictest air and water quality standards and solid waste regulations for the past 20 years. The annual budget for the environment was close to 2.5 billion francs in 1991. "In the other countries in the area, priority is assigned to the supply of drinking water, and wastewater treatment has only begun within the past six months to a year," says Hubert Broux of Degremont, a subsidiary of the Lyonnaise-Dumez firm. In Malaysia, the 1991-1995 plan calls for investing 13 billion francs in the quality and distribution of water. For its part, Thailand has announced a 1.7 billion-franc program for building a water treatment plant in Bangkok to combat pollution. In both Indonesia and the Philippines, awareness is a more recent phenomenon. Indonesia, for example, is spending about 3.5 billion francs annually to protect its environment. With its six sewage plants, the incineration of 60 percent of its refuse, controls on the number of vehicles, and the relocation of certain polluting industries, Singapore presents real opportunities for specialized Western firms. The principal areas are the modernization of existing systems using more sophisticated technologies, especially to solve the problem of odors from wastewater treatment plants; the introduction of a telemetering system for controlling air quality; the treatment of sludge from the unloading of oil tankers; and waste recycling. Desalination of Seawater Sidem, a subsidiary of the Serete group, has obtained an 800 million-franc contract from the Shell Oil Company for supplying a seawater desalination plant. Sita, a subsidiary of the Lyons Water Company specializing in the collection and treatment of waste, has signed several contracts with Singapore hospitals to sort, transport, and incinerate hospital waste. Whether expressed or not, those needs in the region are considerable. In Selangor, Malaysia, Degremont is helping to build the largest drinking water facility in Asia. In Indonesia, where France is active as the third-largest lending country with aid totaling 800 million francs in 1993, Degremont has won three contracts for water treatment plants on Java, Bali, and Lombok. For its part, the Lyons Water Company is not present in Singapore, where water distribution is a monopoly of the state, which has signed supply contracts with Malaysia and, just recently, with Sumatra (Indonesia). In Malaysia, on the other hand, the French firm operates three concessions for the supply of drinking water: in Taipeng (300 million francs), Johore Bahru (4.6 billion francs), and Kota Kinabalu (1.8 billion francs). Last year the General Water Company won a contract worth about 10 million francs to build a water ozonization plant in Malaysia. The market is likely to expand even more now that privatization programs are about to get underway. Nowadays governments are no longer able to finance the distribution and treatment of water, so they are turning to private groups. The Northwest firm of Great Britain, for example, is about to obtain the contract for wastewater in Bangkok.
