FR940906-1-00039 FR940906-1-00017 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, hereinafter referred to as CITES or the Convention, is an international treaty designed to control and regulate international trade in certain animal and plant species which are or may become threatened with extinction, and are listed in Appendices to the Convention. Currently, 122 countries, including the United States, are CITES Parties. CITES calls for biennial meetings of the Conference of the Parties which review its implementation, make provisions enabling the CITES Secretariat in Switzerland to carry out its functions, consider amendments to the list of species in Appendices I and II, consider reports presented by the Secretariat, and make recommendations for the improved effectiveness of the Convention. The ninth regular meeting of the Conference of the Parties to CITES (COP9) will be held in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, November 7&hyph;18, 1994. This notice is part of a series of notices which, together with public meetings, encourage the public to participate in the development of the U.S. positions for COP9. A Federal Register notice published on July 15, 1993 (58 FR 38112) requested information and comments from the public on animal or plant species the United States might consider as possible amendments to the appendices. A Federal Register notice published on November 18, 1993 (58 FR 60873) requested public comments on possible revisions to the criteria for listing species in the CITES Appendices. A Federal Register notice published on January 27, 1994 (59 FR 3832) requested additional comments from the public on animal or plant species that the United States was considering submitting as amendments to the appendices. A Federal Register notice published on January 28, 1994 (59 FR 4094): (1) published the time and place for COP9; (2) announced a public meeting for February 22, 1994, to discuss the 31st meeting of the CITES Standing Committee; (3) detailed the provisional agenda of the COP; and (4) requested information and comments from the public on possible COP9 agenda items and resolutions that the United States might submit. Five proposed species amendments, three resolutions and two agenda items were submitted by the Service and received by the CITES Secretariat on June 10, 1994, the deadline for consideration at COP9. Additional information on these topics will be published in a separate Federal Register notice. This notice announces proposals submitted by Parties other than the United States for consideration at the forthcoming meeting of the Parties and sets forth tentative negotiating positions of the United States on foreign proposals. CITES regulates import, export, re-export, and introduction from the sea of certain animal and plant species. Species for which trade is controlled are included in three appendices. Appendix I includes species threatened with extinction that are or may be affected by trade. Appendix II includes species that although not necessarily now threatened with extinction may become so unless trade in them is strictly controlled. It also includes species that must be subject to regulation in order that trade in other currently or potentially threatened species may be brought under effective control (e.g., because of difficulty in distinguishing specimens of currently or potentially threatened species from those of other species). Appendix III includes species that any Party nation identifies as being subject to regulation within its jurisdiction for purposes of preventing or restricting exploitation, and for which it needs the cooperation of other Parties in controlling trade. Any Party nation may propose amendments to Appendices I and II for consideration at the meetings of the Conference of the Parties. The text of any proposal must be communicated to the CITES Secretariat at least 150 days before the meeting. The Secretariat must then consult the other Parties and appropriate intergovernmental agencies, and communicate their responses and the Secretariat's own findings and recommendations to all Parties no later than 30 days before the meeting. Amendments to the Appendices are adopted by a two-thirds majority of the Parties present and voting. Information Sought The Service solicits comments on its tentative negotiating positions on proposed species amendments submitted by Parties other than the United States. Information is also sought on the biological status of the affected species, on the amount and type of trade in specimens of the species, and on the impact of trade on their populations, especially as it relates to any potential effects on survival of the species in all or parts of its range. Comments that provide this information based on the criteria for adding or removing species from the appendices would be especially helpful. The Service will solicit comments on U.S. positions for the remaining items on the agenda for COP9, other than proposed amendments to the appendices, in a subsequent Federal Register notice.
