Aleksakhin (All)Russian Agricultural Radiology and Agroecology SRI; received April 23,1993; UDC 577.539.12.04+581.539.12.04] [Abstract] Because of high radiation sensitivity, high radio nuclide entrapment and slow self-cleansing capacity of trees, forest biogeocenoses are natural objects that are most vulnerable to exposure to ionizing radiation. The article examines possible radiation effects of releases of Novovoronezh AES on forest planting, because in the AES vicinity there are forests with various tree species, including coniferous species (at a distance of about 2 km from the AES). Estimates of the spectrum of probable AES effects on the forests can be considered typical for the majority of AESs in Russia and Ukraine, as well as in other countries. Dose loads on forest biogeocenoses located within a 30 km zone were calculated. The calculations took into account the forecast of changing radionuclide content in the near-ground atmospheric layer near the AES due to scheduled decommissioning of its 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th power units and several other engineering facilities and commissioning of the 6th and 7th power units. It was concluded that at present the Novovoronezh AES meets ecological safety requirements during normal operation. Effects of ionizing radiation from the maximum possible accident under the design conditions and the heaviest accident exceeding design conditions are analyzed. It is concluded that under certain AES accident scenarios radiation damage of adjacent forest planting is possible. This calls for conducting appropriate assessment during the design and construction of new AESs and for ecological control of operation of the existing AESs.
