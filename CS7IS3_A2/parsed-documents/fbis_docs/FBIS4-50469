After the meeting, Wu Bangguo, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and secretary of the Shanghai municipal party committee; Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju; and Chen Zhili, deputy secretary of the Shanghai municipal party committee, met with Zhu Kaixuan, minister of the State Education Commission, who had come to inspect work in Shanghai. Both Zhu Kaixuan and Shanghai Vice Mayor Xie Lijuan spoke at the meeting. Of the nearly 50 universities and colleges in Shanghai, 28, or more than half of them, are under the jurisdiction of central departments or commissions. These universities and colleges have made important contributions to Shanghai's economic and social development. Of course, in the course of their development, these central-department- and commission-run universities and colleges have met with new problems. To explore new reform paths, gradually remove the barriers between different departments or regions, strengthen local governments' right to make overall plans for universities and colleges, and give stronger support to the development of universities and colleges under central departments or commissions, the State Education Commission and the Shanghai Municipal Government have decided, as a result of investigations and coordination over the past year, to make the three key national universities under the commission -- Fudan University, the Shanghai Communications University, and the Shanghai Foreign Language University -- pilot universities for conduction an experiment in "joint development." The major features of "joint development" are: After "joint development," the three universities will still be under the State Education Commission, but a dual leadership will be introduced for them. The original investment channel for the three universities will remain unchanged. The State Education Commission will continue to provide funds for administrative expenses and capital construction, including special appropriations and subsidies, to the three universities, and it will increase investment according to the ratio of ownership of the three universities. Beginning this year following the signing of the contract, the Shanghai Municipal Finance Department will provide a sum of "joint development" subsidies to the three universities every year. In case the three universities want to hire highly trained professionals from other countries or from other parts of the country, relevant municipal government departments will give them the same treatment that they give other local universities and colleges in the following areas -- residence quotas, reductions and exemptions of urban development funds, and land requisition. In accordance with the requirements for Shanghai's economic and social development and for reforming and developing the three universities, the Shanghai Municipal Government and the State Education Commission will decide some "joint development" projects for the three universities each year. For example, in the near future the municipal government will continue to help Fudan University to develop its department of postgraduate studies and establish a biology and medicine base; help the Shanghai Communications University to establish a Chinese-foreign joint venture facility for training high-quality managerial personnel; and help the Shanghai Foreign Language University to improve its management and to accelerate the training of foreign-language personnel. The State Education Commission will support the three universities to gradually enroll more students from Shanghai and increase the proportion of graduates remaining in Shanghai to work. The State Education Commission will support the three universities to take advantage of their trained personnel and science research facilities and to take part in developing Shanghai's new high-tech industries including automobile engineering, modern telecommunications, computers, and bioengineering. When drawing up or revising its economic and social development plan, Shanghai will include the development of the three universities in its general urban development program.
