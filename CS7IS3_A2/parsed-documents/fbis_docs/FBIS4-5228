"Diet business has been at a total halt, for which his responsibility is considerable. It apparently led to his intention to resign," said Kono, president of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Kono did not say whether the LDP will now aim to take over power. The LDP surrendered its 38-year grip on power to the seven-party coalition led by Hosokawa in August last year. "I am now anxious about the life of the people," Kono said, adding that the LDP wants to deal with the situation responsibly. Following Hosokawa's remarks that he intends to resign, Kono called senior LDP officials for a meeting at the LDP headquarters in Tokyo. Fiscal 1994 budget bills were submitted to the Diet in early March, but the Diet has not been able to begin deliberations for over a month because of wrangling between the ruling coalition and the opposition camp over Hosokawa's alleged shady fund-raising. Hosokawa rejected the demand by the LDP to summon as a witness his former aide, who was in charge of Hosokawa's finances when he borrowed 100 million yen from Sagawa Kyubin, a scandal-tainted trucking business group. Top LDP officials refused to take part in the budget committee debate unless the seven-party coalition promised to bring the witness before the Diet. Sadatoshi Ozato, the LDP's Diet Affairs Committee chairman, called Hosokawa's resignation an "ultimate decision." "His resignation has been expected, but it is too early," Ozato said. LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori canceled his scheduled trip to Kyoto aimed at supporting an LDP-backed candidate for the Kyoto gubernatorial election. Mori said Hosokawa will resign because he could not answer the allegations over his funds. Earlier in the day, Hosokawa suddenly summoned the leaders of the coalition partners to his official residence and told them he intends to resign. Hosokawa said he bears responsibility for the row between the ruling coalition and the opposition camp over his loans from Sagawa Kyubin.
