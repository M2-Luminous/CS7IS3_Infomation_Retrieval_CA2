In his greetings to the participants of the conference, President Boris Yeltsin noted that "a tight knot of contradictions" was created by the problem of refugees, and that it could be resolved only "on the basis of common sense, good will, sense of responsibility to the current and future generations, and through corresponding state agreements". Expressing the conviction that Russia's efforts in this direction would be crowned with success, the president wished the forum successful and fruitful work. The speakers, who took the floor during the conference, drew attention to the problem of guaranteeing human rights and liberties, to the lot of national minorities in Russia, in the CIS countries, and in the Baltic states. They focused on the need to ensure the property rights of refugees, to settle their housing problems, to provide them with jobs, and to help them adapt themselves to the new places of residence. The importance of the problem is borne out by the figures contained in the report delivered by head of the Russian Federal Migration Service Tatyana Regent. She said that there were already 500,000 refugees on the territory of Russia, in addition to one million displaced persons and half a million economic migrants, who are not of Russian origin. Four hundred thousand more people will arrive shortly from Transcaucasia, approximately the same number from the Baltic states, and about three million migrants from central Asia and Kazakhstan, provided the situation in Russia developed "smoothly". "They can be accommodated in Russia," Regent believes, "only if the state, the public organisations, and the rank-and-file Russians pool their efforts to achieve this end." This view is shared by representatives from the national peace foundations of 14 CIS countries and Baltic states, the Russian Federal Migration Service, the Department of the U.N. High Commission for Refugee Affairs, the International Migration Organisation, the Commission for Problems of Citizenship under the Russian president, the Russian Foreign Ministry, the Russian Orthodox Church, and other organisations taking part in the conference.
