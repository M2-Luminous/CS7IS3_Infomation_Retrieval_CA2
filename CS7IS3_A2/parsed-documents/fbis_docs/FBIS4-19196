This was announced by Government Spokesman Dieter Vogel. The small program headquarters with a staff of 100 people, which employs, however, 2,000 helpers all over the world, is currently located in Geneva. According to Vogel, Kohl and Butrus-Ghali stated that the NATO attacks in Bosnia against Serbian positions are necessary and stated that the peace process "must be energetically pushed ahead with the inclusion of the United States and the Russian Federation." Just like FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, at a prior press conference Butrus-Ghali had rejected as "unjustified" Russian complaints that Russia had not been informed about the attacks and pointed to UN Resolution 836, which authorizes such attacks and was also signed by Moscow. Kohl once again stressed Germany's readiness "to take over responsibility in the United Nations in the future also as a permanent member of the Security Council." In addition, he hopes for further transfers of UN organizations to Bonn, Kohl said. Subsequently Butrus-Ghali visited Development Minister Carl-Dieter Spranger (Christian Social Union).
