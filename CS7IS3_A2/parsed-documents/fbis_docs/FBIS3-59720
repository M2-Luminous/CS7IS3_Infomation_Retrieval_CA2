Develop Biotechnology Waste Treatment Machine 94FE0163E Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 16 Nov 93 p 11--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 94FE0163E Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:CSO [Text] JAC Company (Main office, Fukuyama City, Hiroshima-ken, Shintaro Takenaka, president, capital 430 million) which is developing a waste treatment machine for ship loading has announced on 15 November that they have developed a waste treatment machine jointly with the No. 6 District Maritime Safety Headquarters, Maritime Safety Agency, that is a biotechnology commanded raw waste treatment that at a glance appears as if the waste disappears. During the decomposition of waste, no carbon dioxide nor water is exhausted and the waste itself is decomposed into micron units which makes it appear as if the waste had disappeared. This type of waste treatment machine is the first in the world. The Company is applying for a patent on this waste decomposition method. The decomposition of waste is performed by mixing the waste with decomposition cultivator that looks like wood chips and the moisture from the raw waste causes a chemical reaction leading to decomposition into tiny particles. A large size decomposition machine that would treat 20 kgms of raw waste would be 1 m 20 cm wide, 1 m 8 cm high and 1 m 10 cm deep and completely made from stainless steel. Compared to the existing waste treatment machine, no water or organic solid residues remain and the decomposed particles soak into the decomposition cultivator making it appear to the eye as if the waste had disappeared. Past experiments have shown that egg shells have decomposed in a week. ``It is most appropriate for a crammed ship that will be sailing for over a month'', was quoted (The Co.). The desired retail cost is 44 million. A smaller machine that would treat one kgm would cost 499 thousand.
