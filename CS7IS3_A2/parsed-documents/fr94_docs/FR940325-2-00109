FR940325-2-00109 FR940325-2-00049 Finding Regarding Foreign Social Insurance or Pension System_Uruguay AGENCY: Social Security Administration, HHS. ACTION: Notice of finding regarding Foreign Social Insurance or Pension System_Uruguay. FINDING: Section 202(t)(1) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 402(t)(1)) prohibits payment of monthly benefits to any individual who is not a United States citizen or national for any month after he or she has been outside the United States for 6 consecutive months. This prohibition does not apply to such an individual where one of the exceptions described in section 202(t)(2) through 202(t)(5) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 402(t)(2) through 402(t)(5)) affects his or her case. Section 202(t)(2) of the Social Security Act provides that, subject to certain residency requirements of section 202(t)(11), the prohibition against payment shall not apply to any individual who is a citizen of a country which the Secretary of Health and Human Services finds has in effect a social insurance or pension system which is of general application in such country and which: (A) Pays periodic benefits, or the actuarial equivalent thereof, on account of old age, retirement, or death; and (B) Permits individuals who are United States citizens but not citizens of that country and who qualify for such benefits to receive those benefits, or the actuarial equivalent thereof, while outside the foreign country regardless of the duration of the absence. The Secretary of Health and Human Services has delegated the authority to make such a finding to the Commissioner of Social Security. The Commissioner has redelegated that authority to the Director of the Office of International Policy. Under that authority the Director of the Office of International Policy has approved a finding that Uruguay, beginning July 2, 1993, has a social insurance system of general application which: (A) Pays periodic benefits, or the actuarial equivalent thereof, on account of old age, retirement, or death; and (B) Permits United States citizens who are not citizens of Uruguay to receive such benefits, or their actuarial equivalent, at the full rate without qualification or restriction while outside Uruguay. Accordingly, it is hereby determined and found that Uruguay has in effect, beginning July 2, 1993, a social insurance system which meets the requirements of section 202(t)(2) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 402(t)(2)). This revises our previous finding, published at 33 FR 15679 on October 23, 1968, that Uruguay has in effect a social insurance system which is of general application in that country and which meets the requirements of section 202 (t)(2)(A) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 402(t)(2)(A)), but not the requirements of section 202(t)(2)(B) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 402(t)(2)(B)).
