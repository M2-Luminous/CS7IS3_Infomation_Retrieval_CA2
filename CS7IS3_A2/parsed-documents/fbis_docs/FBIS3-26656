According to estimates of departments concerned, there was an overall development in various spheres of production, circulation, distribution, consumption, and other social reproduction, and there were large increases in major economic targets compared with those of 1992. The GNP that reflected the development of social production reached approximately 3 trillion yuan for the whole year, an increase of about 13 percent compared with that of 1992. Industry, agriculture, post and telecommunications, and transportation achieved rapid growth. The scale of economic construction expanded, and production capacity increased. The scale of investments in fixed assets of the whole society in 1992 reached about 1.13 trillion yuan, an increase of 49 percent compared with that of 1992, of which the margin of increase in investments in capital construction and renovation and transformation of state-owned organizations was about 60 percent, and a number of key construction projects were built. Domestic and foreign markets further expanded, and the total volume of domestic and foreign trade greatly increased. The total amount of social commodity retail sales at home for the whole year reached about 1.35 trillion yuan, an increase of about 23 percent compared with that of 1992, the fastest increase in recent years. The total amount of import and export trade reached about 192 billion dollars, an increase of about 16 percent compared with that of the previous year. Social financial resources increased by a margin. The situation of state revenue was better than that of the previous year. It was estimated that revenue for the whole year would exceed budget. There were large increases in extra-budgetary revenue and expenditure calculated by comparable requirements compared with those of the previous year. As the residents' savings and various kinds of deposits continued to grow, the scale of bank loans was estimated to increase by about 20 percent compared with that of 1992. The living standard of the people was further raised and improved. Gross wages increased by about 21 percent compared with those of the previous year. The average wages of staff and workers grew by about 20 percent. There were some increases in the peasants' income following the growth of production and improvement in the work of purchasing agricultural products. II. Development Depends on Reform and Opening-Up and Macroeconomic Regulation and Control The reform of the transformation of operational mechanism of state-owned enterprises in China in the year 1993 was further intensified. China made the best use of time to implement the "Provision Regarding the Transformation of Operational Mechanism of Industrial Enterprises of Ownership by the Whole People," started carrying out the reform of the property rights system and its form of operation, thus strengthening the market principal position of enterprises, and took the first step toward building the system of modern enterprises. Pricing reform has made new development in the stage of storming fortifications. Over 90 percent of the counties (cities) in China have lifted restrictions on the selling prices of grain and edible oil, and on ex-factory prices of iron and steel products and some kinds of coal successively, increased railway freight transport prices, carried out agency prices of important commodities, and further expanded the role of market mechanism. The reform of government organizations was pushed ahead, the intervention by the government in enterprise operations was weakened, and the functions of macroeconomic management were strengthened. New progresses were made in other fields of reform, such as the rural reform, the social insurance system reform, and the housing system reform. The high-speed economic development in 1993 was achieved due to China's further expansion of opening to the outside world. There appeared new high tides of drawing foreign investments in 1993. Nearly 70,000 projects of investments by foreign businessmen were approved in the whole year, more than double that of the previous year, and direct investments by foreign businessmen actually drawn amounted to approximately 18 billion dollars, registering an increase of over 60 percent compared with those of the previous year. The rate of technological import quickened. The number of technological import contracts signed during the year increased by about 40 percent compared with that of the previous year, and a greater number of modern technological equipment and new raw and processed materials were imported. Moreover, open districts in China further increased, which created a new open pattern of multiple levels, multiple channels, and multiple directions. At the end of 1992 and in the first few months of 1993, some phenomena of overheating and confusion of economic order appeared in China's economic development, and the CPC Central Committee and the State Council adopted a number of measures for strengthening and improving macroeconomic regulation and control, which reduced the temperature of the real estate fever, the development zone fever, and the fever of fundraising by stocks that affected the overall situation, and relaxed the overall tension of funds and materials. Inflation was curbed to some extent, and the economy rapidly embarked on the track of high-speed and healthy development. III. Problems That Admit No Negligence Still Exist In 1993, China made achievements in the development of the national economy that attracted worldwide attention, but there were also problems that admitted no negligence. First, the situation of imbalance in the total amount of supply and demand still existed. After the strengthening of macroeconomic regulation and control, the imbalance took a favorable turn, but the balance of general supply larger than general demand for the whole year still deviated from the basically normal range. It was mainly due to the fact that the scale of fixed assets investments in the first half of the year grew by as high as 61 percent. Although there was certain control in the second half of the year, it still stayed at 40 percent. Therefore, the investment scale for the whole year still grew by 49 percent compared with that of the previous year. Moreover, there were excessive increases in some regions and among some strata, which exceeded the growth of production. In addition, there was an imbalance between import and export, and the deficit of import larger than export was too great. Second, structural contradictions still stood out sharply. It was mainly caused by a decrease in agricultural input, and little improvement in the conditions of agricultural production. Therefore, agriculture still could not meet the requirements of high-speed development of the national economy. Energy and communications remained extremely tense, the proportion of investments in these fields decreased, and certain processing industries were still developing too rapidly. Third, the increase margin of commodity prices remained somewhat high. After the strengthening of macroeconomic regulation and control in mid-1993, the price rises tended toward relaxation, but the impact caused by excessive monetary issue in the first half of the year still played a delaying effect. Therefore, the retail prices still increased by about 13 percent for the whole year, which lowered somewhat the actual living standard of a number of staff and workers. Fourth, the economic performance of enterprises was still poor. The economic performance of enterprises was gradually improved after the second half of 1991, but a declining trend again in 1993. It found expression in the reduction of profits realized by enterprises, the expansion of the extent of losses, and the decline in the composite indexes of industrial economic performance. Fifth, financial difficulties were not essentially overcome. The proportion of revenue in the GNP still decreased. IV. Prospects of Economic Development in 1994 If we make an analysis based on the present situation, there are undoubtedly many favorable conditions for speeding up economic development in China: 1) The implementation of the "Decisions" adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Congress and the in-depth study of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping will inevitably promote greatly the growth of the economy. 2) The strengthening and improvement in macroeconomic regulation and control, and the consolidation of the economic order have created favorable macroeconomic environment and microeconomnic basis for speeding up economic development. 3) The stock in storage is quite abundant. 4) There have been some improvements year by year in the conditions of communications and transportation and post and telecommunications. 5) With the growth of production and improvement in enterprise management, the decline in economic performance is taking a favorable turn, and it is estimated that there will be some increases in enterprise retained profits and state revenue. Moreover, the residents' income increases year by year, plus the development of banking business and improvement in work, the source of credit funds will further expand. All these will become important factors for speeding up economic development. 6) The international environment is favorable, China's opening to the outside world will further expand, the complementarity of international exchange is strengthened, and investments in China will further increase. Therefore, it is entirely possible to achieve a sustained, high-speed, and healthy development of the economy. It is an optimum rate to achieve a 9-10 percent GNP increase over 1993. However, to achieve a sustained, high-speed, and healthy growth, it is still required to do painstaking work: First, conscientiously implement various reform measures introduced in 1994, carry them through to the end, and guard against the phenomena of being slack and losing shape. Second, while continuing to maintain a basic balance in the total amount of social supply and demand, it is necessary to concentrate efforts on industrial restructuring, to strengthen agriculture in particular, and increase input in agriculture. It is necessary to ensure energy, communications, the production of raw and processed materials in shortage, the funds for construction, and the need for materials, and to continue the policies of limiting the production, and allowing the closing down, suspension, and bankruptcy of over-supplied products and long-term trades. Third, try hard to improve enterprise economic performance. The key is that enterprises should use their "inner skill," and change their operational methods of purely relying on blindly expanding production and price increases. Moreover, it is necessary to strengthen the technological transformation of enterprise equipment and the renewal of products, and to rely on technological progress to promote performance improvement. Fourth, speed up the coordinated development of social undertakings and the economy, and give better play to the role of science, education, culture, and other social undertakings in economic development. Fifth, while speeding up the growth of coastal areas, develop more rapidly the economy of the interior and outlying areas, and narrow the gap of development between regions. Sixth, continue to do a good job in macroeconomic regulation and control, and it is especially necessary that we should make new progress in strengthening the capacity of macroeconomic regulation and control, improving the regulation and control system, and giving play to various means of regulation and control.
