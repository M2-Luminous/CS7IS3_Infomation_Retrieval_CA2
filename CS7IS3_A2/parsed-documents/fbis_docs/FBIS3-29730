NODONG SINMUN today says this, commenting on the persistent struggle of South Korean people against rice market opening. Holding that if the Kim Yong-sam group has a shred of national conscience, it must promptly cancel the rice market opening as demanded by the South Korean people, the analyst says: The Kim Yong-sam group, however, schemes to legally finalize the opening of the rice market, twaddling about "the final plan for the implementation of the agreement" and "follow-up measures." Worse still, it brands the demand of the people for renegotiation concerning the rice market opening as a call for "isolation" of South Korea and their struggle as "violence," answering it with fascist suppression. The Kim Yong-sam group keeps all the repressive forces in full readiness for action to crack down on the people's struggle any moment. Its criminal intention is to suppress the people's resistance at the point of the fascist bayonet and hurriedly take follow-up measures by all means for the liberalization of rice import. The South Korean people, incensed against the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique, are now resolved to turn out in a mass struggle to foil its policy of rice market opening and overthrow the self-styled "civilian government." It will not be long before the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique meets its disgraceful doom.
