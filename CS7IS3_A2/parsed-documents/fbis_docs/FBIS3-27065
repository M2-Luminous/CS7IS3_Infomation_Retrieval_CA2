In coordination with the anticorruption struggle, courts at all levels in the municipality meted out sentences to over 2,700 criminals for embezzlement, taking bribes, and misuse of public funds, of whom over 1,000 were sentenced to more than five years of imprisonment, life imprisonment, or death. In the meantime, Beijing's courts at all levels persisted in promptly and strictly cracking down on criminal elements that seriously endangered public security. Over 4,900 such criminals were sentenced, including 160-odd murderers, 1,000-odd robbers, and 560-odd rapists. The courts at all levels also held over 100 rallies to pronounce sentences, thus maintaining the momentum of the strict crackdown activities and effectively frightening criminals. In trying economic cases, courts at all levels in the municipality received over 7,000 cases on economic disputes in 1993, up 27.9 percent from the previous year, and concluded over 6,900 of them. Money involved in these disputes totaled 1.69 billion yuan, up 122.4 percent.
