The Jordan News Agency, PETRA, Monday reported that the Ministry informed the secretary general of the party, Milhim al-Tall, of its decision. The party's constituent assembly last month authorised Mr. al-Tall along with members Ahmad al-'Awayishah, Shahir al-Rawashidah, 'Ali al-Talafih and Muhammad Khattab to apply for licensing. The party, which is almost exclusively made up of former adherents to the Syrian Ba'th Party, joins four other political parties on the pan-Arab spectrum. These parties are the Jordan Socialist Ba'th Party, the Progressive Arab Ba'th Party, the Jordan Arab Democratic Party and the most recently licensed National Action Front Party. The party's leader, Mr. al-Tall, ran for a Muslim seat in Amman's Third District in the 1989 parliamentary elections. During his campaign, he openly advocated Jordan's union with Syria.
