According to reports obtained from surgical hospitals, which treat war casualties, 1,000 individuals from Dostum's militia have been injured so far and sent to those hospitals. The report adds: During the second offensive alone, which took place in the area between Mirorayon and Pacha Pol, as a result of the counteroffensive of the Islamic army and mujaheddin, 300 of them were injured. Reports say that it can be concluded that during the one month of Karmal-Dostom's failure in fighting more than 1,000 people were killed and even more were injured. This number is very large, and it is a fact that enemy's combat morale has been sufficiently crushed.
