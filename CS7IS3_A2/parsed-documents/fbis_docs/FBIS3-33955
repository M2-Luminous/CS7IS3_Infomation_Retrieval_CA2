The militia of Hezb-i-Islami leader Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar suffered 43 dead and 50 injured after attacking state forces and being repulsed, the radio said. In another engagement with the Uzbek militia of General Abdul Rashid Dostam, allied with Hekmatyar, the pro-Rabbani forces wounded 300 rebels in the Microrayan area of Kabul, the broadcast said. The radio said the Dostam militia has lost 1,000 men during the month-long fighting, which erupted when the Uzbek warlord launched an offensive on January 1, in cooperation with the Hezb, to oust Rabbani from power. Meanwhile, Afghan sources in the Pakistani border city of Peshawar said a 100-member mission comprising mojhedin commanders, religious scholars and elders had launched a new initiative to end the bloodshed. The mediation team, led by commander Jalaluddin Haqqani, left the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad Tuesday for Kabul for talks with the warring sides. Last month, more than 40 commanders from the Kabul area made two attempts to bring about a ceasefire, but failed to bring Rabbani and Hekmatyar to the negotiating table.
