Kantor asked leaders of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) for their understanding in the trade framework negotiations, saying that without numerical targets in the automotive, insurance and other fields, the U.S. choices of action would be limited. Kantor met LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori and Ryutaro Hashimoto, a former finance minister and now chairman of the LDP's Policy Affairs Research Council. Mori, in response, explained Japan's efforts to open its markets but added the idea of numerical targets would have a negative effect on international free trade. The LDP leaders expressed support for the government's direction in the trade negotiations.
