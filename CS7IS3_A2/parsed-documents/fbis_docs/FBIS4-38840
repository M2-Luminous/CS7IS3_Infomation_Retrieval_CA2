In an exclusive interview with ITAR- TASS, Karadzic expressed the hope that a ceasefire agreement can be signed at these talks. "The Serbs, Karadzic said, "have been seeking such an agreement for the past two years." The talks were cancelled virtually a few minutes before their scheduled opening today. A decision to this effect was made by special U.N. secretary-general's envoy in Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi. He motivated his step by the Bosinan Serbs' failure to fulfil their obligation to withdraw troops from a 3-km zone around the Moslem enclave of Gorazde. Commenting on the situation in Geneva, the Bosnian Serb leader said that the Moslem side has once again succeeded in avoiding the talks. The Serb leader surmised that the complications, which have cropped up regarding the reported arrival of Serb units in the vicinity of Gorazde, can be settled. The Serb delegation intends to take part in the "contact group" session on Bosnia of which diplomats of Russia, United States, Great Britain, Germany and France are members. The session, to which the Moslems and the Croats are also invited, is scheduled to be held in the French mission in the European department of the U.N. It will resume discussions, which had begun at the previous similar meeting held in the French city of Talloires at the end of May. The Serb delegation will be led by Momcilo Krajisnik, chaiman of the parliament of the republic proclaimed by the Bosnian Serbs.
