Speaking to journalists before his departure from Prague, Kozyrev expressed hope that this would not be repeated. "We have now embarked on a better path of joined efforts and, in my opinion, it is extraordinarily important to concentrate on consolidating the success which was achieved within three days after Russian President Boris Yeltsin's initiative was announced," Kozyrev said. That was a reason why Russia was determined to join the United States, NATO and other partners in united actions and not in separate ones, Kozyrev said. He expressed hope that now at last there would be mutual friendly feeling between the peoples of the Russian Federation and the Czech Republic in full measure -- without pressure, without a totalitarian regime, without any attempts to maintain in this or that form of the former socialist camp, without "Brezhnev's doctrines." It is equality and mutual respect which are creating political trust and the political background for the renewal of close relations which existed between the cultures of both peoples, Kozyrev told CTK. After that, Kozyrev left the Czech Republic where he was on a working visit at the invitation of Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec. On Saturday [19 February] in Prague Kozyrev held talks with Zieleniec and was received by Czech President Vaclav Havel in his cottage in Hradecek near Trutnov, East Bohemia. On Sunday [20 February] he had lunch with Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus. Kozyrev's stay in Prague was part of his tour of the Visegrad Group (the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland). From Prague Kozyrev made his way to Hungary from where he will travel to Poland. His planned visit to Slovakia which was due to have been first in this series was canceled because of the government crisis in Slovakia. According to diplomatic sources, nothing is known about a replacement date for his visit to Slovakia.
