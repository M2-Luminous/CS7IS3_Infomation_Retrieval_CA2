It was found that the effectiveness of field penetration at nighttime is far greater than during the daytime and is highly dependent on the extent of the region of localization of the vertical E[.sub]z[/] field. The strength of the electrostatic field at ionospheric altitudes has an appreciable value � 0.3-0.7 mV/m only for large-scale seismic sources (a � 100 km) under the condition that |E[.sub]z[/]| at the epicenter is � 1000 V/m. A study of the effect of the electric field of a seismic source on the background ionosphere also was made. The greatest effect is observed in the middle part of the nighttime E layer where the Pedersen drift of ions is maximum. The nature of the ionospheric disturbance is determined by the direction of E[.sub]z[/]. With positive E[.sub]z[/] the electron concentration experiences an appreciable decrease over the region of localization of E[.sub]z[/] and when the E[.sub]z[/] field is directed downward there is an increase in N[.sub]e[/]. The degree of ionospheric disturbance is determined by the |E[.sub]z[/]| value at the epicenter and the extent of localization of the E[.sub]z[/] region.
