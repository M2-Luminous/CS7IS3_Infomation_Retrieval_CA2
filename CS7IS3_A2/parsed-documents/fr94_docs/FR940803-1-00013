Advertisements include commercial messages in visual, oral, or print media that invite, offer, or otherwise announce generally to members and potential members the availability of member accounts such as: Telephone solicitations Messages on automated teller machine (ATM) screens Messages on a computer screen in a credit union's lobby (including any printout) Messages in a newspaper, magazine, or promotional flyer or on radio or television Messages promoting an account that provided along with information about the member's existing account at a credit union, such as on the periodic statement Examples of messages that are not advertisements are: Rate sheets published in newspapers, periodicals, or trade journals, provided the credit union (or share and deposit broker that offers accounts at the credit union) does not pay a fee to have the information included Telephone conversations initiated by a member or potential member about an account An in-person discussion with a member about the terms for a specific account Information provided to members about their existing accounts, such as on IRA disbursements or notices for automatically renewable term share accounts sent before renewal (c) Annual Percentage Yield. 1. General. The annual percentage yield (APY) is required for disclosures for new accounts, oral responses to inquiries about rates; disclosures provided upon request; disclosures for existing members (if the credit union chooses to provide full disclosures instead of the shorter periodic statement notice); notices prior to the maturity of a term share account, if known at the time the notice is sent, and in advertising. The annual percentage yield shows the total amount of dividends on an assumed principal amount as a percentage of the principal, based on the dividend rate and frequency of compounding for a 365 day period (for accounts such as share or share draft accounts) or for the term of the account for term share accounts. The annual percentage yield assumes the principal amount remains in the account for 365 days or for the term of the account. 2. How Annual Percentage Yield differs from Annual Percentage Yield Earned. The annual percentage yield (APY) differs from the annual percentage yield earned (APYE). The annual percentage yield earned is required for periodic statements only. The annual percentage yield earned shows the total amount of dividends earned for the dividend or statement period as a percent of the actual average daily balance in the member's account. Unlike the annual percentage yield, the annual percentage yield earned is affected by additions and withdrawals during the period. The annual percentage yield and the annual percentage yield earned must be calculated according to the formulas provided in Appendix A to this rule. (d) Average Daily Balance Method. 1. General. One of the two required methods (the daily balance is the other) of determining the balance upon which dividends must be paid. The average daily balance method requires the application of a periodic rate to the average daily balance in the account for the average daily balance calculation period. The average daily balance is determined by adding the full amount of principal in the account for each day of the period and dividing that figure by the number of days in the period. (e) Board. 1. General. The NCUA Board. (f) Bonus. 1. General. Bonuses include items of value offered as incentives to members, such as an offer to pay the final installment deposit for a holiday club account. Bonuses do not include the payment of dividends (including extraordinary dividends), the waiver of reduction of a fee, the absorption of expenses, non-dividend membership benefits, or other consideration aggregating $10 or less per year. 2. Examples. The following are examples of bonuses. A credit union offers $25 to potential members for becoming a member and opening an account. The $25 could be provided by check, cash, or direct deposit. A credit union offers $25 to a member with only a regular share account to open a share draft account. The $25 could be provided by check, cash, or direct deposit. A credit union offers a portable radio with a value of $20 to members and potential members for opening a share draft account. The following are examples of items that are not bonuses: Discount coupons distributed by credit unions for use at restaurants or stores. A credit union offers $25 to a parent or custodian if the parent or custodian opens an account for a minor. The $25 is not a bonus because the parent or custodian is not opening the account in his or her own name. A credit union offers $20 to any member if the member is responsible for convincing a potential member to open an account. The $20 is not a bonus because the $20 is not paid to the individual opening the account. Any item, including cash, given or offered to a third party in exchange for a member or potential member opening (or a member renewing or adding to) an account is not a bonus. A credit union offers $25 to a member if the member if the member can locate his name in the body of a newsletter. Life savings benefits. Many credit unions offer life savings benefits to beneficiaries of deceased members. Because the benefit accrues to a third party, such life savings plans offered are not bonuses. 3. De minimis rule. Items with a de minimis value of $10 or less are not bonuses. Credit Unions may rely on the valuation standard used by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to determine if the value of the item is de minimus. (See 26 CFR ยง1.6049&hyph;5(a)(2), which discusses the fair market value of property received.) Items required to be reported by the credit union under IRS rules are bonuses under this regulation. Examples of items that are not bonuses are: Disability insurance premiums that are not connected to a loan account paid by the credit union in an amount $10 or less per year Any insurance premiums paid by the credit union in connection with a loan account Coffee mugs, T-shirts or other merchandise with a market value of $10 or less per year 4. Aggregation. Credit unions must aggregate per account per calendar year any items given to a member that are individually valued at $10 or less and must consider them to be a bonus if their aggregate value exceeds $10.
