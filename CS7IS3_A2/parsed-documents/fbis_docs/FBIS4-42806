Upon his return from Moscow, Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias said the following about his talks with President Boris Yeltsin and the Russian ministers: "In both the political and economic sectors, we have achieved what we both -- Greeks and Russians -- wanted. That is, we agreed on the big economic plans that the two governments are making in such things as alumina, gas, and oil." The most important plan, which also has political significance, is the plan dealing with the construction of a big pipeline for the transfer of Russian oil from Burgas, Bulgaria, to the port of Alexandroupolis. This project will make it possible to bypass the Canakkale Straits and to address Turkey's threat to ban the passage of tankers through the straits. At the same time, the pipeline for the transfer of Russian natural gas to Greece as well as the further development of economic relations with Russia, Bulgaria, and the other Black Sea countries to Alexandroupolis port will acquire international importance and become an interesting transit center. All these facts strengthen the possibilities for success of the Thrace development program, which would make the region Greece's third economic focal point, as was proposed in the feasibility study by the Athens Academy's Research Center. Thrace can and must become Greece's third economic focal point, it must become an economic and cultural center in the Balkans. The government must consider the Athens Academy's proposal and utilize it. It would be a mistake to shelve it. The development and improvement of Thrace is a task of national significance. The Greek-Russian cooperation projects will help in both the development and defense of this sensitive border region.
