FBIS4-67319 "jptdd022__l94084" JPRS-TDD-94-022-L JPRS Narcotics 27 April 1994 WEST EUROPE REGIONAL AFFAIRS European Drug Observatory Established European Drug Observatory Established Report on Opening Session 94WD0347A Lisbon DIARIO DE NOTICIAS in Portuguese 27 Apr 94 p 18 94WD0347A Lisbon DIARIO DE NOTICIAS Portuguese CSO [Text] Yesterday, the European Observatory for Drugs and Drug Addiction (OEDT) was opened officially in Lisbon, to determine a strategy for the Twelve to combat drugs, with a budget of 906,000 contos. "We are here today to take a decisive step toward the practical implementation of a major project of the European Union." This was the opening statement made by Marques Mendes to the 16 members of the OEDT board of administration: 12 from the member states, two from the European Commission, and two specialists designated by the European Parliament. In his official speech, the deputy minister greeted those present in the name of the government, guaranteeing Portugal's "total commitment and its best effort" in support of the observatory's installation: a task that he wished to be "rapid." Marques Mendes stressed the fact that, "Combating the scourge of drugs and drug addiction requires determination, cooperation, and solidarity." He gave a reminder that, "It is impossible to do effective work based on mere amateurism." As for the informational role that this observatory will assume in the future, that member of the government claimed that "paths for cooperation" are being opened for action on a European scale, which could result in "more effective intervention." Two Candidates for Future Director At yesterday's meeting, the first convened by the OEDT board of administration, and held at the Belem Cultural Center, the members debated topics related to the start-up of this first Community agency with headquarters in Portugal. They discussed the organization of internal regulations, the selection of a president, and various possibilities concerning the observatory's installation. The session was chaired by Vanden Abeele, the Commission's general director for budget, who, during a brief press conference, announced that the observatory's budget for this year will be 4.6 million ecus [European currency units], nearly 906,000 contos. He commented: "However, only half of that sum has been made available." The second meeting will take place before the end of July, at which time a director will be designated, as well as a genuine work program. The profile of the future director was debated yesterday, with emphasis on two candidates: Father Feytor Pinto, the high commissioner for Project Life, and George Stievenard, in charge of the Drug Department of the Commission of European Communities' Secretariat General. DN [DIARIO DE NOTICIAS] published an interview with the latter yesterday. According to the regulations establishing the OEDT, its purpose is to provide objective, reliable, and comparable reports, on the European level, regarding drugs and their respective consequences, not only from the social and health standpoint, but also from that of trafficking and repression. However, the observatory cannot adopt any measure extending beyond the specific realm of information and respective treatment. It has a computerized network available, establishing the infrastructure for collection and exchange of information and documentation. The system has been designated the European Network for Information on Drugs and Drug Addiction (Reitox). It is intended to create a link between the national information networks, the specialized centers in the member states, and the information systems of international organizations and agencies cooperating with the observatory. Taking Europol Into Account In this respect, stress should be placed on the third article of the regulations, which states that the observatory shall take into consideration activities carried out, specifically, by the European Police Service (Europol), and make an effort to evaluate them. Dealing with a rather sensitive issue, the regulations stipulate that the observatory shall not collect data that would make it possible to identify persons or small groups of persons. It must also refrain from any informational activity relating to concrete cases and specific names. It must take into account the Council of Europe's Convention 108, on protection of persons, insofar as the computerized treatment of data of a personal nature is concerned.
