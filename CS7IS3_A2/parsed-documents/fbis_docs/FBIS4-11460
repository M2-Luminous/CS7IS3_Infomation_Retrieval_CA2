He also denied that he would comment on the murder of conscript Omar Carrasco, arguing that "clairvoyance is not my business, I manage a ministry." During the Adad & Longobardi television program, the minister compared today's rumors regarding his resignation with "last week's reports which assured that President (Carlos) Menem had undergone an operation." Camilion stressed that the rumors regarding his resignation "are far from true," adding that "maybe they are being floated by some internal faction" unknown to him. [passage omitted] Answering a question on a possible deterioration of the image of the Armed Forces and civilian disobedience against compulsory military service, Camilion said: "If something like that happens, it would be due to a compounding of many involved factors." "If a deterioration of the Armed Forces image is encouraged, then those who encourage it are active participants or, of course, it would not be spontaneous," he emphasized. The minister compared this topic "to political factors and campaigns," like what happened "during the recent march in Neuquen Province, when the slogans were clearly political." [passage omitted]
