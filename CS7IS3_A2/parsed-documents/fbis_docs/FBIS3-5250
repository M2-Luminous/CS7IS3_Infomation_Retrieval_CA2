Your Majesty: Immediately after the UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia]-organized elections, some people hoped that the bloody war would come to an end and that our country would have achieved national reconciliation and peace and embarked on national reconstruction. But, the flames of the war continue to flare up, burn our country, and cause massive destruction to our nation and people. Our nation and the world community have been aware that immediately after it was formed in July 1993, the government with two prime ministers began to show its force in August by mobilizing the forces of both the Vietnamese communist puppets and para [Khmer People's National Liberation Front] groups to attack the regions of Phnum Chhat [Battambang Province] and Stoung [Kompong Thom Province], inflicting untold suffering to the local people. Entire family members were either shot dead, arrested, or beaten on their heads; old and young women were brutally raped; hundreds of houses or villages were burned down; cattle were shot at and farm tools were destroyed. Starting from September 1993, the government with two prime ministers boisterously mobilized 70 percent of troops and 90 percent of military commanders out of their total forces in the country with 80 percent of their total arsenal, including tanks, artilleries, and multiple rocket launchers, to launch operations aimed at destroying the forces of Democratic Kampuchea [DK] in the region of Anlung Veng. Foreign radio and newspapers kept reporting on this operation against Anlung Veng from mid-September 1993 through to 21 February 1994. Some countries even have gone so far as to expose their arrogance because they have directly given orders for the launching of those large-scale military operations at the Anlung Veng battlefield. On the one hand, the people and DK national resistance forces have held to their unwavering position to abide firmly by the banner of national reconciliation of Your Majesty so Cambodia can achieve independence, peace, and neutrality within its territorial integrity. On the other hand, the people and DK national resistance forces have kept their good grasp of the situation knowing that these operations to continue kindling war is a part of the plan and strategy of the Vietnamese communists and the alliance aimed a seizing Cambodia for their respective strategic and political interests. The people know they cannot evade their sacred duty and have done their utmost to resist and smash this strategic criminal scheme. The people and the DK national resistance forces, with the support of the Cambodian people from all walks of life both at home and abroad, have been able -- despite all kinds of difficulties and obstacles -- to inflict one defeat after another on the large-scale operations by the Vietnamese communists, the alliance, and the two- headed government after many months of arduous struggle carried out in wave after wave of high spirits, patriotism, and responsiblity toward the destiny of our nation, people, and race. This continued until they were totally and completely smashed on 24 February. I raise this Anlung Veng issue with only one thing in mind, that is, to inform your Majesty that the flames of war in Cambodia are still burning and seething. It is a war that the Vietnamese communists and the western alliance wage through the government with two prime ministers against the Cambodian nation, people, and DK national resistance forces. This is not a problem between Cambodians. On the surface, it seems that the forces of the government with two prime ministers are fighting against the DK forces. But in fact, the government with two prime ministers is just an instrument of the Vietnamese communists and western alliance with the U.S., France, and Australia as chief perpetrators. They have provided money and war materiel to the government with two prime ministers for fighting in Cambodia in order to keep the flames of war burning and to block national reconciliation and national unity. In that way, the Vietnamese communists can carry on their strategy to annex Cambodia while the Western allies can have their hands in the internal affairs of Cambodia and turn it into their forum. All of this is as clear as day light. At present, dignitaries from ill-minded countries have come one after another to Phnom Penh to talk only about providing military assistance to the government with two prime ministers. Chea Sim went to Hanoi at the beginning of this month and, using his capacity as acting head of state, signed with communist Vietnam the so-called military cooperation between Cambodia and Vietnam as in the 1979-90 period to allow communist Vietnam to send its troops, weapons, and ammunition to Cambodia in what they claim is a legal manner to continue the war for the destruction of Cambodia. At the same time, Hun Sen talks only about the plan to expand the army and attack, attack, attack. The fact that the Vietnamese communists together with the alliance have used the forces of the government with two prime minister to launch large-scale operations against Anlung Veng and other zones in an attempt to destroy the DK forces is merely a dirty excuse. What is more important, however, is that deep down, they oppose national reconciliation, national unity, and peace in Cambodia. The forces fighting against those major operations are those of our nation and people both in the countryside and in Phnom Penh who have been united in the struggle by all means through all forms, each one with his or her own possibility, because what everybody wants the most is national reconciliation, the end of the war, national unity, and the harmony of all national forces in all aspects. In the past, that is, from the end of 1978 to 1991 or during the implementation of the Paris agreement, the DK party has done its utmost to put an end to this war as soon as possible. National and international public opinion have been aware of the political stand and attitude of the DK party. Your Majesty has most graciously come up with the five-point proposal dated 21 November 1993. The entire Cambodian nation and people welcomed it. The DK party also welcomed and fully supported this proposal and has taken it as the political basis and key for resolving the Cambodian problem. The DK party agrees to a cease-fire, to return all its liberated zones to the Kingdom of Cambodia, and to dismantle its own army. It calls for nothing more than the implementation of His Majesty's five-point guideline for national reconciliation and unity so our country will have sufficient forces to jointly solve national and social problems now and in the future. Despite this, the government with two prime ministers, especially Hun Sen and the people's party of the Vietnamese communists, disagree. They have opposed the five-point proposal and keep demanding that the DK party fulfill the three-point ultimatum and they carry on the war to scorch Cambodia. So far, the national problems have not been resolved while social problems worsen with each passing day. If this situation is to continue, if they continue to kindle war, what will the destiny of our nation and people and of our Kingdom of Cambodia be? Cambodia will face the same fate as the frog swallowed up by the snake. Your Majesty has already been aware of this situation and these problems. Your Majesty has even raised your voice for the benefit of our nation and people ever since December 1992. Your Majesty has successively paved the way for a solution, especially with your sacred five points. Experiences in the past more than eight months have led the entire Cambodian nation and people to share the same view that under the present circumstances, Your Majesty is the only one who can come up with the decisive answer to remedy this situation by resorting to the celestial medicine that Your Majesty had applied in the 1952-53 period. There is indeed no one else than Your Majesty. Otherwise, Cambodia will turn into a chaotic abyss where there is only fighting and strangling at each other's throat under the evil claws of the Vietnamese communists and the allies until our nation disappears like Kampuchea Kraom [former Cambodian territory annexed by Vietnam]. Our nation and people from all walks of life in the countryside, in Phnom Penh, and abroad are waiting to support and to zealously and firmly march under Your Majesty's five-point banner for national reconciliation and unity which has now become that of our entire Cambodian nation and people. Our entire nation and people are clearly aware that by making comparison of the forces, the forces of our nation and people with Your Majesty's five-point national reconciliation banner are by size the strongest that will certainly have the five points materialized. As for the Vietnamese communists and the alliance, they are the foreign forces with, on their side, only a handful of Cambodians who are rejected and opposed by the Cambodian people everyday. The foreigners might have money and weapons, but they do not have the people. The people categorically oppose them. They are sinking lower and lower into the ground. I would like to beg permission to sincerely submit the above for the consideration of Your Majesty out of a lofty sense of responsibility for the faith of the Cambodian nation and race with no consideration whatsoever of the interests and power for myself and my own party. Please permit me and all members of the DK party to extend best wishes to Your Majesty for a quick recovery and perfect health so as to continue upholding your national salvation banner to achieve national reconciliation and rally all national forces to defend and perpetuate the Cambodian nation and race. We wish the revered Queen good health so as to effectively stay beside the king, especially on this historic period. Please forgive any inappropriateness. [Dated] 5 March 1994 [Signed] Khieu Samphan, head of the DK party
