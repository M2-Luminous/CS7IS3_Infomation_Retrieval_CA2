On this occasion, Comrade Nguyen Manh Cam, member of the Party Central Committee Political Bureau and minister of foreign affairs granted SAIGON GIAI PHONG an exclusive interview. [Correspondent] Dear minister: Our leaders have visited all countries in the Southeast Asian region, and many leaders in the region have also visited us. Through all these high level visits, what can we say about Vietnamese-Southeast Asian relations, and particularly Vietnamese-ASEAN relations? [Nguyen Manh Cam] The implementation of the foreign affairs policy in the direction of diversification and multilateralization has rapidly boosted our relationship with countries in the Southeast Asian region and this will certainly be developed even more rapidly in the period to come. The recent visits exchanged between Vietnamese leaders and leaders of ASEAN countries reflect the common aspiration of countries in the region as well as ourselves to speed up the expansion of our multifaceted cooperative relations. The fine relations between Vietnam and Southeast Asian countries are evidence that the current trend in the region is cooperation for development. In parallel with the development of bilateral relations between Vietnam and each of the Southeast Asian countries, all ASEAN countries also wish that Vietnam will soon become an official member of the ASEAN organization. On our part, with positive support from ASEAN, we are taking practical steps to prepare for full membership of ASEAN soon. When Vietnam becomes an official ASEAN member, it will not only consolidate and develop the bilateral and multilateral relations between Vietnam and ASEAN, but will also contribute positively to the trend of cooperation and development in Southeast Asia in particular, and Asia-Pacific in general. [Correspondent] How should Vietnam prepare to join this organization? [Nguyen Manh Cam] The cooperation among ASEAN members cover many fields, not only economy and trade, but also science and technology, culture, education, tourism, physical education, sports, and so forth. We need to study the activities of each of the committees and the features and magnitude of their projects, and from there we can prepare suitable steps for each field so that once we become a full member of ASEAN, we will be able to integrate immediately into the smooth-running cooperation mechanism of the organization. We also need to study more thoroughly the operational regulations of ASEAN in order to determine appropriate cooperation methods that will ensure efficiency and benefits for both our country and the countries in the region. In addition, we should consult with and learn from the experiences of ASEAN members -- from both their successes and failures during the cooperation process and in the operation of national committees, as well as the regulation and coordination of various domestic sectors so that we can arrange our activities in accordance with ASEAN requirements. [Correspondent] Vietnam has become an observer of ASEAN. What are the next steps from now until we become an official member of ASEAN? [Nguyen Manh Cam] Some ASEAN countries have suggested that we choose either one of the two following ways. The first option is to gradually join in committees and cooperation projects, and once we have joined all the committees and projects we would become an official member. The other option is to join selectively a number of committees and cooperation projects in certain fields, then we would become an official member and could continue to join in the remaining committees and projects. Many friends in ASEAN countries have advised us not to pursue perfection, and to choose the second option. I agree with that advice. So far, as an observer, Vietnam has joined six committees and five specific cooperation projects of ASEAN. We will soon be able to officially join the organization and then we will continue to join other cooperation projects. [Correspondent] What will be the effects in the event of Vietnam obtaining full ASEAN membership? [Nguyen Manh Cam] The cooperation between Vietnam and ASEAN in general, and with each ASEAN member country, will become closer once we become an official member of ASEAN. It will be beneficial for both Vietnam and ASEAN, the development of our country, and the region. It will also be an important contribution to the trend of peace, stability, and cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region. [Correspondent] Is it true as somebody has suggested that if Vietnam joins ASEAN in the current situation, it will suffer some difficulties caused by the unequal development levels and the different economic structures in Vietnam and ASEAN member countries? [Nguyen Manh Cam] It is true that there is an inequality in economic development between Vietnam and ASEAN member countries, but within the ASEAN organization itself the development levels of member countries are also unequal. ASEAN member countries, therefore, do not see it as an obstacle. In fact the comprehensive cooperation will create conditions for complementing each other, helping slow countries to catch up with fast developing ones, thus boosting development in the whole region. For that reason all ASEAN member countries have made it clear that they wish Vietnam to become a full member of ASEAN soon. [Correspondent] ASEAN will become a free trade (AFTA) region in the next ten years. How would that effect the Vietnamese economy if by then Vietnam were still not a ASEAN member? [Nguyen Manh Cam] When ASEAN member countries complete the establishment of the free trade region (AFTA), all merchandise exchanged among the countries concerned will be subjected to low tax or be free of tax. The tax scale will be reduced to about 5 percent to nil. If by then Vietnam is still not a member of ASEAN, we will not have those privileges, and our trade activities will face certain difficulties as our exported goods to ASEAN will be taxed at a higher rate, thus reducing their competitiveness. If Vietnam is then a member of the free trade region, the trade relations between Vietnam and ASEAN member countries will benefit and expand speedily, thus contributing to the development of Vietnam and other countries in the region. [Correspondent] Dear minister, what is the role of ASEAN in resolving common problems in the region? [Nguyen Manh Cam] Honoring the principle of "unity in diversity" the ASEAN member countries cooperate but respect each other, implement joint decisions and work together but respect the sovereignty of each country. Thanks to that principle, ASEAN has become a regional organization, the voice of which has carried more and more weight in international and regional forums. It surely has a decisive role in resolving common regional problems. [Correspondent] Thank you, dear minister.
