If by any chance something like this had been happened a year ago, it would have hit the headlines of many newspapers with obvious surprise: Why is Alija Izetbegovic discharging his top man? However, just as Izetbegovic's policy has both formally and officially moved from the declarative striving for a civic state to striving for his own national state, so the ranks of his most prominent men have been diminishing and changing. Following the prewar departure of the show-biz darling Muhamed Cengic, vice chairman of the Party of Democratic Action [SDA], one after another of those people have disappeared from the political stage: Irfan Ajanovic, SDA secretary and the party's first man in the former federation [of Yugoslavia] and the republican assembly; Omer Behmen, the grey eminence of the SDA and Izetbegovic's colleague from prison (both of them were members of the Young Muslims organization long before the war); Jusuf Prazina, the petty criminal who became a myth and hero of the Bosnian Army overnight; Armin Pohara, Izetbegovic's closest confident, and his personal envoy in the mission to do away with civic Tuzla; Sefer Halilovic, the face on the fighters' T-shirts, the so-called "seferovka" shirt, and formerly the undisputed commander of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina; Hadzo Efendic, reportedly the legend of the defense of Gorazde, and a principal actor in the Bosnian Government for many months; and finally, SDA ideologist Rusmir Mahmutcehajic, who left quite silently, or so many people believe. From Singer to Tactician Getting rid of Cengic probably came as a great relief for Izetbegovic. In the broader public Cengic was a very popular politician (until the war he was identified with the famous Surrealists [a group of comedians] from Sarajevo), more and more frequently assisting the opposition in its attacks on the ineffective and nationally divided Government of Bosnia-Herzegovina, whose vice-chairman was Cengic himself. A large amount of money that this Foca entrepreneur collected from local Muslims for the foundation and work of the SDA still kept him in place as Izetbegovic's deputy until the beginning of the war. Thereafter Izetbegovic sent him, reportedly with the appropriate credentials (which later proved invalid), to Istanbul, appointing him representative of Bosnia-Herzegovina in that country. Today, on his way from Turkey to Slovenia, Cengic is trying to get in touch with Bosnia-Herzegovina and Izetbegovic, but Izetbegovic is no longer interested in that. Ajanovic, the last [Bosnian] delegate in the Federal Assembly and SDA representative in the Parliament of Bosnia-Herzegovina, former folk singer, and later one of the most radical people in the SDA, became the first legitimate tactician by order of the president, using the bar of the Zagreb hotel Panorama as his office for many months. Nevertheless, after Ajanovic's arrival in Zagreb, various logistics centers started to mushroom throughout Croatia, under the patronage of the powerful Zagreb lobby (H. Cengic, Tankovic, Sabic), in which there was no place for the SDA secretary, or rather there was no possibility for war profiteering. Thereafter Ajanovic was seen to take part in various panel discussions throughout Europe on the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in which he fervently advocated a Muslim Bosnia. Nonetheless, he decided to return to Bosnia, but he was captured by Karadzic's men. And while part of the SDA was calling him a captive in the Serbian prison in Banja Luka, the Serbian media reported that Ajanovic had already been walking the streets of Belgrade for months, and quite freely at that. On one occasion Izetbegovic stated that he would sacrifice the entire party for his former prison-mate Behman. All the time Behman represented a truly grand character in the party, having the halo of being the greatest martyr of the communist system. Behmen's untouchability, which emanated from his most severe treatment in communist penitentiaries, frequently, while perhaps unjustifiably, also carried the burden of the strongest national intolerance. Behmen became the pillar of the nationalistic policy of the Muslim party. At the parliamentary session on 14 March 1993, during the debate as to whether the Vance-Owen plan should be signed, Behmen stated: "We are the losers! We have to sign what has been offered to us. We have no other choice. What we must do actually reflects the situation on the front. The regions where we are stronger are ours; those where we are weaker are not ours.... The proposal is our fate, and it awaits us!" Whether Behmen's words disturbed Izetbegovic, who was attempting to win several percent more territory for the Islamic Bosnia, both at the negotiating table and militarily, is still unknown; nevertheless, after that Behmen was appointed Bosnian ambassador to Iran. Today, Behmen is writing letters to Sarajevo, begging to be recalled, because he has had hardly any contact with either Bosnia-Herzegovina or anybody from Bosnia-Herzegovina! At the time when Juka [Jusuf Prazina] was a hero, the Sarajevo media, such as OSLOBODJENJE, were describing him as a fearless hero of the time, while editors were boasting about having the privilege of drinking coffee with Juka! Juka, who had been a criminal before the war, acquired the reputation of a Robin Hood, a protector of the poor, by stealing hundreds of cars, and tons of oil and food, so that the humanitarian donation of part of his fortune was no problem to him, while on the other hand it drew the media's attention to his personality. Encouraged by the media attention (authors were writing books on him, musicians were composing songs about to him), Prazina started to consider himself a genius, predestined to be the new Bosnian leader. For that reason he soon fell into disfavor among both the authorities and the media, so he left town, and on Mount Igman played a local boss, arbitrarily stopping or letting vehicles through from and into Sarajevo. He soon joined the Croatian Defense Council, and for a certain time served Mate Boban as an additional argument against Izetbegovic. After that he fled first to Germany, then to the Netherlands, Austria, and finally Belgium. Several days ago all the international press carried the news that he had been killed in Liege! Leader of Mixed Marriages Armin Pohara entered politics in 1990, before the first multiparty elections, as the chairman of the tiny Party of Mixed Marriages from Bosanski Brod, with "brotherhood and unity" [a slogan from Titoist times] being as main platform, committed to the federation of former Yugoslavia. His party stood body and soul behind [former Yugoslav prime minister] Ante Markovic's movement of reformists, while Pohara even reproached the former prime minister for insufficient support for the unity of Yugoslavia. In the first days of the war he was actively involved in defense, wearing a uniform of the Defense Command of Bosanski Brod, which soon silently surrendered to Karadzic's army without a fight. The sudden recollection of his Muslim origins made the leader of Mixed Marriages offer his services to Izetbegovic, who promoted Pohara to coordinator of the Armed Forces of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and his special envoy in the operation "Eliminating Red Tuzla." Since the citizens soon banished the envoy from Tuzla, and in the meantime the Croat-Muslim conflict had broken out, this political chameleon ran away to seek protection under Boban's wing, looking for his chance in the politics of a Croat-Muslim Party. Today, this anonymous pre- war journalist is finally accomplishing his dream -- he is the chairman of a party, editor in chief of an independent newspaper, ZAPADNA BOSNA [WEST BOSNIA], writing editorials and aspiring to be a new Geneva negotiator. A captain in the former Yugoslav People's Army, Sefer Halilovic entered the Bosnian political stage quite grandly, obsessed with his mission to defend the integral Bosnia-Herzegovina. Originally from Sandzak, the captain rejected the introduction of ranks in the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina, justifying that with the slogan "we shall all prove ourselves in fighting," which provoked a reaction among the more experienced and qualified army officers. Given the needed media attention, Halilovic more frequently behaved like a politician than as a soldier, and thus soon raised the question in the foreign media as to who the real authority in Bosnia-Herzegovina was -- Izetbegovic or Halilovic. The abandonment of the idea of an integral Bosnia-Herzegovina, as well as the negotiations for additional percentages of the territory for the so-called Bosnian state, forced Izetbegovic to suspend Halilovic and replace him with Rasim Delic, who is a professional soldier and quite disinclined toward politics. At the beginning the official explanation was that the shift reflected Halilovic's reappointment to some other post, rather than suspension, but now the information is much more exact -- Halilovic is under house arrest. Loyal Personnel Hadzo Efendic is a man of rather moderate intellectual abilities, but for that reason extremely loyal to Izetbegovic, whom the SDA, while the discredited leaders were in charge, suddenly launched as a promising new party man. The SDA created a new image for Efendic as the man who defended Gorazde. However, this Muslim enclave in eastern Bosnia, having been declared a UN protection zone, is today a synonym for the suffering of Bosnian Muslims. Having been appointed deputy prime minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina, in the absence of [prime minister] Mile Akmadzic, Efendic was considered to be the government's strongest man, although his utmost level of action is the repetition of hackneyed phrases about the Bosnian peoples' unity, so long as Izetbegovic supports the concept of integral Bosnia under his authority. Today, when a miniature Muslim state is being publicly advocated, Efendic has been removed from Sarajevo, and following the proven method, sent to Vienna. The latest silent removal of one of the leading SDA people, Rusmir Mahmutcehajic, is still the most indicative example of Izetbegovic's policy in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In the times of peace, when Izetbegovic did not even think about publicly advocating his Muslim state, Mahmutcehajic was considered to be a radical nationalist in SDA. Today, when Izetbegovic is finalizing his Islamic political options, Mahmutcehajic is a persona non grata for such a job. His removal proves that Izetbegovic's goal -- a Muslim Bosnia -- has long outgrown Mahmutcehajic's nationalism. These days the former SDA ideologist is in a way protected by the intellectuals of Sarajevo, because in comparison with others, his politics are regarded as quite moderate. The struggle for as close a position to Izetbegovic as possible is now going on between Ejup Ganic and Haris Silajdzic. In the last couple of months Silajdzic has won a considerable advantage over Ganic, and he is more and more frequently seen in Izetbegovic's company during state visits of increasing importance. Nevertheless, Ganic, as a constant political claimant to a more important position in the administration, will hardly allow Silajdzic to get too far ahead. Be it as it may, the struggle of various of Izetbegovic's aides for the second most powerful position in the administration again confirms the same thing: Izetbegovic's undisputed dominance on the throne of the Bosnian Islam.
