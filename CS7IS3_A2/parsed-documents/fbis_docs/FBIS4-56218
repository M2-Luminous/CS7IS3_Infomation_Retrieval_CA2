The proposal was made by (Peggy Antrobus), general coordinator of the Alternative for Women's Development, who recognized Cuba's strong emphasis on social development and the prioritization of investments in health care, education, and social security. As part of that conference, on 4 June, a minisummit will be held to create the Association of Caribbean States, which will encompass not just English-speaking states but the entire Caribbean community, including Cuba. At that meeting, the heads of Caribbean states and governments will sign the constitution that will govern the association, whose goal is the establishment of a solid development program for the whole region. Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas underscored the current and historical importance of Caribbean union: [Begin Burelli recording] Once again the entire Caribbean community is united in a single body and in a single assembly. In the last 30 years, despite Cuba's historical and political weight, those abroad, specifically European countries, have viewed the Caribbean as exclusively English-speaking countries. Of course, those countries are very important; but the Caribbean includes much more than only those countries. The Caribbean has great importance historically, politically, and strategically. [end recording] Foreign Minister Burelli added that the Association of Caribbean States will have goals identical to those of other international organizations, such as the Organization of American States. [Begin Burelli recording] Except, in this case, the [words indistinct] is official. It will echo all aspects, languages, and interests of the Caribbean, which until now have always been divided.
