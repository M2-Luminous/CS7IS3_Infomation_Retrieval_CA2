As a matter of fact, this Israeli pressure is nothing new. These statements are as old as the peace process launched by the Madrid conference. For, similar statements have continued to be made since the start of the Washington bilateral talks up to date. Their pressure has taken the form of evasion and maneuvering. However, they have now begun to take the form of threatening aggression since the conclusion of distorted and flawed agreements, such as the Gaza-Jericho agreement. The entire world community has seen Israel attempting to kill the peace process, and to preoccupy it with formalities and procedural matters in a bid to circumvent any discussion of substantive issues. This has been meant to evade the requirements of peace; namely, complete Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories in compliance with the well-known UN Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, and 425. In the wake of this evasion and these maneuvers, Israel posed insincere questions about the kind of peace Syria is offering. It is to be recalled that the peace Syria is offering is crystal clear. It has to be just and comprehensive. This was well put by His Excellency President Hafiz al-Asad when he said that Syria is offering full peace in return for complete withdrawal. Since then, we have heard statements by Yitzhaq Rabin about withdrawal on the Golan, rather than from the Golan. Then, we heard provocative Israeli statements regarding an Israeli referendum on the future of the occupied Golan, as if the UN Security Council did not pass a resolution providing for Israeli withdrawal from the Golan in 1967; namely, Resolution 242, which was later augmented by Resolution 338. Israel has behaved as if withdrawal from the Arab territories is an issue that must remain hostage to Israeli whims. As a matter of fact, this withdrawal is required in compliance with the aforementioned UN resolution to vindicate right and achieve peace in the interest of the region and the world at large. It is necessary to note here that the international community's position, which has not thus far been firm enough, has encouraged Israel to hold the peace process in disregard. As for the Israeli evasion, it has produced flawed and partial solutions, which run counter to the just and comprehensive peace that is required. By contrast, the international community has seen Arab Syria augmenting its desire for just peace with a clear and strong position grounded in adherence to Arab rights, which are at the heart of just peace, taking care to safeguard the peace process. This has frustrated Israel's goal of thwarting the peace process. The world community has praised this Syrian position, as demonstrated at the Geneva summit between His Excellency President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton. For the U.S. President declared that peace must be comprehensive, noting that Syria holds the key to peace, and that there can be no peace without Syria. Throughout the peace talks, the world community has seen a Syrian Arab eagerness to safeguard the peace process. Likewise, it has also seen a firm Syrian Arab position, as manifested in the working paper Syria submitted to the Israeli negotiators at one of the rounds of Washington bilateral talks. There is no denying that there are many things Israel can do. Nonetheless, there are two things Israel can do nothing about. First, Israel cannot undermine Syria's firm and noble quest for just and comprehensive peace, which must be grounded in complete Israeli withdrawal from the Golan, southern Lebanon, and the occupied Arab territories, for this quest is attested to by the world public. Second, Israel cannot weaken the firm Syrian Arab position, which is, indeed, the position of all Arabs. This is a fact that is widely known to all those engaged in peace efforts, headed by the cosponsors of the peace process.
