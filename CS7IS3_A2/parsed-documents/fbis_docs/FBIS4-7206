He replaced Kozo Igarashi of the Social Democratic Party (SDP). Morimoto, 52, has been elected to the House of Representatives four times by his Nara Prefecture constituency and has served as an executive on the lower house's Steering Committee. Since the launching of the previous coalition government last August, Morimoto has been in charge of the party's Diet management. Morimoto's post has put him in a position to confront the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in negotiations. He is a close ally of party Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa, a coalition strategist. Morimoto speaks in an undisguised Kansai dialect that characterizes the natives of the Osaka-Kyoto-Nara district and has been described as a gentle, considerate type in interpersonal affairs. His gentle demeanor and refusal to utter any complaints should not be confused with a lack of resolve, however, since Morimoto is an honorary fourth degree black belt holder in nihon kenpo, a modern version of kung fu. In the residence for Diet members, Morimoto's room is crowded with physical training machines and the Kansai University graduate also swims regularly to stay in shape.
