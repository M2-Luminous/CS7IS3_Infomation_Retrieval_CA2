FR940711-2-00038 FR940711-2-00023 The OHA has applied these procedures in numerous cases since the April Notice, e.g., New York Petroleum, Inc., 18 DOE ¶85,435 (1988) ( NYP ); Shell Oil Co., 17 DOE ¶85,204 (1988); Ernest A. Allerkamp, 17 DOE ¶85,079 (1988) ( Allerkamp ), and the procedures have been approved by the United States District Court for the District of Kansas as well as the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals. Various states filed a Motion with the Kansas District Court, claiming that the OHA violated the Stripper Well Agreement by employing presumptions of injury for end-users and by improperly calculating the refund amount to be used in those proceedings. On August 17, 1987, Judge Frank G. Theis issued an Opinion and Order denying the States' Motion in its entirety. In re: The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation, 671 F. Supp. 1318 (D. Kan. 1987), aff'd, 857 F. 2d 1481 (Temp. Emer. Ct. App. 1988). Judge Theis concluded that the Stripper Well Agreement ``does not bar [the] OHA from permitting claimants to employ reasonable presumptions in affirmatively demonstrating injury entitling them to a refund.'' Id. at 1323. He also ruled that, as specified in the April Notice, the OHA could calculate refunds based on a portion of the M.D.L. 378 overcharges. Id. at 1323&hyph;24. The general guidelines which the OHA may use to formulate and implement a plan to distribute refunds are set forth in 10 C.F.R. Part 205, Subpart V. The Subpart V process may be used in situations where the DOE cannot readily identify the persons who may have been injured as a result of actual or alleged violations of the regulations or ascertain the amount of the refund each person should receive. For a more detailed discussion of Subpart V and the authority of the OHA to fashion procedures to distribute refunds, see Office of Enforcement, 9 DOE ¶82,508 (1981), and Office of Enforcement, 8 DOE ¶82,597 (1981). After reviewing the records submitted in support of the three Petitions, we have concluded that a Subpart V proceeding is an appropriate mechanism for distributing the $521,200.64 in funds obtained from Western, Gray and Valentine. We therefore propose to grant the ERA's Petitions and assume jurisdiction over distribution of the funds. III. Proposed Refund Procedures A. Refund Claims We propose to apply the procedures discussed in the April Notice to the crude oil Subpart V proceedings that are the subject of the present determination. As noted above, the monies deposited with the DOE in settlement of the alleged crude oil violations totalling $521,200.64, plus accrued interest, are covered by this Proposed Decision. We have decided to reserve the full twenty percent of the alleged crude oil violation amount, or $104,240.13 plus interest, for direct refunds to claimants, in order to insure that sufficient funds will be available for refunds to injured parties. The process which the OHA will use to evaluate claims based on alleged crude oil violations will be modeled after the process the OHA has used in Subpart V proceedings to evaluate claims based upon alleged overcharges involving refined products. E.g., Mountain Fuel Supply Co., 14 DOE ¶85,475 (1986). As in non-crude oil cases, applicants will be required to document their purchase volumes of covered products and prove that they were injured as a result of the alleged violations. Generally, we will presume that an applicant incurred a crude oil overcharge in the purchase of a product if the product was either identified as a covered product in the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973, 15 U.S.C. §§751&hyph;760, or if the product was purchased from a crude oil refinery or originated in a crude oil refinery and was purchased from a reseller. Notice of General Interest Concerning DOE's Crude Oil Overcharge Refund Program, 57 Fed. Reg. 30731, 30732 (July 10, 1992); Great Lakes Carbon Corp., 22 DOE ¶85,248, at 88,662 (1993). Applicants who were end-users or ultimate consumers of petroleum products, whose businesses are unrelated to the petroleum industry, and who were not subject to the DOE price regulations are presumed to have been injured by any alleged crude oil overcharges. In order to receive a refund, end-users need not submit any further evidence of injury beyond the volume of petroleum products purchased during the period of price controls. See, e.g., A. Tarricone, Inc., 15 DOE ¶85,495 at 88,893&hyph;96 (1987). However, the end-user presumption of injury can be rebutted by evidence which establishes that the specific end-user in question was not injured by the crude oil overcharges. See, e.g., Berry Holding Co., 16 DOE ¶85,405 at 88,797 (1987). If an interested party submits evidence that is sufficient to cast serious doubt on the end-user presumption, the applicant will be required to produce further evidence of injury. See, e.g., NYP, 18 DOE at 88,701&hyph;03. Reseller and retailer claimants must submit detailed evidence of injury, and may not rely on the presumption of injury utilized in refund cases involving refined petroleum products. They may, however, use econometric evidence of the type employed in the OHA Report to the District Court in the Stripper Well Litigation, reprinted in 6 Fed. Energy Guidelines ¶90,507. Applicants who executed and submitted a valid waiver pursuant to one of the escrows established in the Stripper Well Agreement have waived their rights to apply for a crude oil refund under Subpart V. Mid-America Dairyman Inc., v. Herrington, 878 F. 2d 1448 (Temp. Emer. Ct. App. 1989); accord, Boise Cascade Corp., 18 DOE ¶85,970 (1989). As we have stated in previous Decisions, a crude oil refund applicant will only be required to submit one application for its share of all available crude oil overcharge funds. E.g., Allerkamp, 17 DOE at 88,176. Any party that has previously submitted a refund Application in the crude oil refund proceedings need not file another Application. That previously filed Application will be deemed to be filed in all crude oil refund proceedings as the procedures are finalized. The DOE has established June 30, 1994 as the final deadline for filing an Application for Refund from the crude oil funds. Anchor Gasoline Corp., 22 DOE ¶85,071 (1992); 58 Fed. Reg. 26318 (May 3, 1993). It is the policy of the DOE to pay all crude oil refund claims filed before June 30, 1994, at the rate of $0.0008 per gallon. However, while we anticipate that applicants who filed their claims within the original June 30, 1988 deadline will receive a supplemental refund payment, we will decide in the future whether claimants that filed later Applications should receive additional refunds. See, e.g., Seneca Oil Co., 21 DOE ¶85,327 (1991). Notice of any additional amounts available in the future will be published in the Federal Register . B. Payments to the Federal Government and the States Under the terms of the MSRP, the remaining eighty percent of the alleged crude oil violation amounts subject to this Proposed Decision, or $416,960.51, plus interest, should be disbursed in equal shares to the states and federal government, for indirect restitution. Refunds to the states will be in proportion to the consumption of petroleum products in each state during the period of price controls. The share or ratio of the funds which each state will receive is contained in Exhibit H of the Stripper Well Agreement. When disbursed, these funds will be subject to the same limitations and reporting requirements as all other crude oil monies received by the states under the Stripper Well Agreement. It Is Therefore Ordered That: The refund amounts remitted to the Department of Energy by Western Asphalt Service, Inc., W.F. Moore and Son, Inc., Gibson Oil and Refining Co., and Wilfred Paige van Loben Sels, pursuant to the Consent Order signed on May 30, 1984; by Gray Trucking Company pursuant to the Consent Order signed on March 29, 1982; and by William Valentine and Sons, Inc., Valentine Construction, Inc., Dale L. Valentine, Verna Valentine, and James L. Marchant, pursuant to the Settlement Agreement signed on January 24, 1990, will be distributed in accordance with the foregoing Decision.
