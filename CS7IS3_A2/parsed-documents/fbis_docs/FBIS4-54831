Upon his return to Sarajevo, President Izetbegovic gave a statement to Radio Television Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Izetbegovic] I have made two visits: Last week I visited for four days. This was primarily a visit to the army, and I did not make any civilian tours. I thought that after Gorazde, I ought to tour the fronts, so I went to (?Niksici), the front near (?Niksici), for the first time. After that I toured the front in Olovo, and then went on to Tesanj and Maglaj. On the second occasion -- after I returned -- [words indistinct] three days, I visited the Kladanj front, which is a very important and hot front. Then I visited the Brcko front, which has recently been frequently mentioned as the probable scene of a future offensive, a massive Serb offensive, and finally, yesterday I visited Mt. Vlasic, the Mt. Vlasic front. [Words indistinct] on the hills themselves, on the 1,700-meter and [word indistinct] high peaks. So, if I were to talk about my impressions, I could say that on the one hand, the morale of the troops is extremely high, considering the circumstances under which the people are fighting. My aim was actually to [words indistinct] under which our units up there are living, because I had been informed that there were great problems with food, accommodation, clothing, ammunition, and so forth. Such problems do exist, but my conclusion -- after analyzing the situation in the General Staff, as we did late last night -- is that the problems can be solved and we shall begin solving them immediately. Some of the issues we have already solved. Actually, the problem of caring for the families of our troops needs to be solved in a definite and systematic way [words indistinct]. We need to solve the problem of nutrition [words indistinct] of our troops. This problem has so far been more or less solved in a satisfactory way. It is only lately that certain problems have arisen. After the subject was broached and it was discussed whether this was the obligation of the commune or the Defense Ministry. [sentence as heard] Then we have the issue of attire -- clothing and footwear. I believe that we shall soon solve these issues in a satisfactory way, that is, in the conditions under which are troops are fighting. I met many of them, I personally listened to them, I saw what they were being fed, and I visited their sleeping quarters -- I believe, for example, that those on Mt. Vlasic are cold in the night, and so forth. Therefore, these problems do exist but we will solve them.
