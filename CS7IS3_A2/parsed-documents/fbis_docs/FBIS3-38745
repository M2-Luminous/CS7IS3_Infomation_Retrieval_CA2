The state-owned fuel reprocessing company has been trying for four years to conclude long-term deals to treat waste fuel from the UK's two nuclear power utilities. But Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear are refusing to agree unless the government protects them against unforeseen cost increases. The contracts hold the key to the future of BNF, which recently received the government's go-ahead to start up its controversial Thorp reprocessing plant in Cumbria. BNF's auditors, Ernst and Young, said in the company's annual report yesterday that the company "regards government financial support in the form of underwriting to be a prerequisite to the completion of these contracts." The accounts were drawn up on the assumption of a government guarantee. The Department of Trade and Industry, which a year ago withdrew an earlier commitment to underwrite the contracts, said yesterday that it was considering BNF's request. Greenpeace, the environmental group, said it may challenge BNF's accounts on the basis that the government may not agree to the underwriting. The accounts also revealed that the year-long delay in approval for Thorp helped depress BNF's 1992-93 profits to less than half their previous year's level. BNF reported profits of 76m pounds for the year to March 31, against 161m pounds for the previous year. Turnover was marginally down at 1.05bn pounds from 1.08bn pounds. The results were at the lower end of analysts' expectations. The dividend to the government was halved to 26m pounds. Mr John Guinness, chairman, said he expected profitability in 1993-94 to be similar to that of last year, with the Thorp delay playing an even greater role in the result. He said the Thorp effect last year was 18m pounds but this year it would be about 90m pounds. Mr Guinness said next year's profitability would rebound significantly as Thorp would play a full role. BNF said Thorp was not the only reason for the profit downturn. Profits had been depressed by 30m pounds as a result of the nine-week shutdown in 1992 of Magnox reprocessing at Sellafield, Cumbria. A further 40m pounds depressant was an advance writedown of costs associated with the merger of BNF's enrichment assets at Capenhurst, Chester, into a company, Urenco. The company put restructuring costs, including staff cuts, at 20m pounds.
