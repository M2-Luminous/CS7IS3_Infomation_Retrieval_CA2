The PLO leader immediately informed the members of the intifadah higher central committee, the West Bank committee, and three of his aides for occupied territory affairs of these statements. These aides are Ziyad Abu-Ziyad, Mahmud al-'Alul, and Jibril al-Rujub. The statements were extensively distributed during the three days that followed the massacre. The issuing side described itself as the Fatah committee inside the occupied territory. One of these statements, which carried the heading: "Appeal to the Fatah Leaders," was addressed to Faruq Qaddumi, 'Abbas Zaki, Sakhr Habash, Muhammad Jihad, Muhammad Ghunaym, and Khalid al-Hasan, which the statement described as the Fatah leaders in the absence of a collective leadership. A copy of the statement was sent to 'Arafat by one of his aides who said that it was distributed on a large scale in the al-Baq'ah refugee camp [in Jordan]. The statement demanded that an emergency leadership be formed to put reform programs in effect and asked that Fatah return to the field to carry out all kinds of struggle, especially the armed struggle. In conclusion, the statement addressed the abovementioned Fatah leaders by saying: Your response or lack of response to this appeal will gauge the extent of our dealing with you. Another statement addressed to the Fatah leaders described the negotiations and the peace process as a tool for circumventing the Palestinian people's struggle and sacrifices. The statement leveled sharp criticism at the Palestinian leadership, describing its members as leaders who can only commit themselves to implementing instructions from the White House, which did not allow them to react to the Hebron massacre except with condemnations and denunciations. In another statement attributed to the Unified National Leadership of the Intifadah--Qawim [resist], an appeal was made to reconstitute the intifadah's strike forces in all parts of the state of Palestine, restore the state of popular Palestinian unrest and direct it toward the occupation and settlers, and begin a comprehensive and responsible national dialogue to unify efforts and confront the current phase. Other statements of similar import studied by 'Arafat and his aides are attributed to the western sector in the Fatah Movement. One of these statements carried a warning to the settlers that the time for retribution has come. Similar statements were also issued attributed to the Fatah cadres in Jordan and Tunisia, rejecting the negotiations and calling for a change in the Fatah and PLO readerships, which 'Arafat took very seriously. He demanded information on who stands behind these statements and the weight they could carry on the way to creating an organizational coup on the highest level within the Fatah Movement.
