To be more specific, from the very beginning of the drive to contribute suggestions to the draft political report to be presented to the conference, party committee echelons, cadres, party members, scientists, and veteran cadres already expressed their views on this issue. They all aired heartfelt and many-sided opinions, thus reflecting their deep concern for this decisive and important task. The conference ascertained that party leadership is an issue of principled character and constitutes the most decisive factor guaranteeing success for our country's national development based on socialist orientations. This concept is also one of the most important lessons drawn from implementing the reform process over the past many years. As our country shifts to a market- oriented economy, implements democratization to benefit society, and broadens relations with the outside world, there is a greater need to strengthen and renovate the party's leadership. We renovate the party's leadership but do not distance ourselves from those issues of principled character or negate past achievements. We renovate the party's leadership through rational policies and steps, taking into account dialectical and many-sided relations. The practical experiences drawn from a number of countries in the world indicate that just a little bit of faltering faith and lax leadership by the Communist Party will instantly create loopholes for hostile and opposition forces to move forward to disintegrate the party leadership system, seize power, and shift the country to a different path. As far as our country is concerned, the Communist Party of Vietnam [CPV] is the only ruling party. This is a mandate of history. The party itself has undergone a protracted and arduous struggle full of challenges and sacrifices. The administration and achievements we have today are brought about by tens of thousands of outstanding sons and daughters of the party and people who have lost their lives. As far as Vietnam is concerned, our party's leadership is an objective requirement and a necessary condition for guaranteeing social order and political stability for the cause of national construction and development. Being the ruling party that directs society in shifting to the market-oriented economy and given the current complicated international situation, the CPV realizes very clearly its honor and responsibility toward the country and people. In its capacity as a ruling party, our party exerts leadership over and consolidates the administration to make it firm and strong. It also directs society and takes responsibility before the country and people. As a ruling party, the party represents not only the interests of the working class, but also fights for the interests of laborers as a whole and becomes the vanguard political brigade of the entire nation. Let us pose the following question: Over the past 60 years or more, who has led the people through the ups and downs of an arduous struggle and sacrificed everything for national independence and freedom as well as for the people's well-being and happiness? Today, who has worked night and day on ways to help the country overcome challenges, firmly safeguard national independence and sovereignty, make the people rich and the nation powerful, bring about justice and civilization in society, and reduce poverty in urban and rural areas? It is crystal clear that nobody other than the CPV by following the Marxist-Leninist path and Uncle Ho's ideology has constantly worked and made sacrifices for the country and people. Under present conditions, the party's leadership role is reflected through the formulation of national development orientations and goals aimed at bringing about prosperity for the nation and people. Based on the aforementioned orientations and goals, the party directs the overall political and social systems, first of all the state apparatus, in materializing at all costs set goals and tasks. It also directs work aimed at institutionalizing and legalizing party resolutions, planning and organizing the mechanisms, training and managing cadres, overseeing the implementation of party policies and lines, and reviewing experiences drawn from real life situations and supplementing or perfecting policies and lines.... All of the aforementioned tasks have but a single objective, namely guaranteeing correct political orientations for national construction and development. In the economic area, we must ensure that there are political characteristics in the development of our economy to ensure that the economy enjoys both a high development rate and productivity with an increasing production force, and that it moves correctly in the socialist direction to limit injustice and exploitation and protects the interests of laborers. This must be manifested not only at the central management level, but also in each party cell. Each party installation and every cadre and party member is responsible for a thorough understanding of the party's political direction in the all-around socioeconomic activities. This is a function that cannot be done by anybody else. The paramount responsibility of party committees at all levels is to lead, control, and strive for efficient implementation of party lines and policies to ensure that the activities of all economic sectors and social organizations are in line with the socialist direction. Party committees, primary party organizations, and party members in joint ventures and private business are responsible for leading the people and public organizations in bringing party resolutions and state laws into life. They must protect the legitimate rights and interests of workers and laborers. Any party committee or party organ which does not fulfill these tasks is not correctly carrying out its functions and duties. After several years of reform process, our party's leadership and working attitude, from the central to grassroots levels, have improved greatly in the direction of becoming more democratic, principled, attached to the grassroots, and practical. They have ensured both a close and efficient party leadership and have also developed the positive role of state organs and mass organizations. However, we must admit that the management quality and operational efficiency of many party committees are not on par with requirements in the new situation. Their organizational mechanism is still heavy, bulky, and overlapping and they are slow to improve their management and working attitude. Many places, especially in the grassroots, are having difficulties differentiating the functions and duties of the party from the government. In addition to the tendency to heighten the party role to cover everything, there is also a tendency to lighten and lessen the party role. In the current situation, renovating the party's leadership role means that it must correctly carry out its leading role at the same time as efforts to strongly develop the role of state organs, economic units, and mass organizations. The party committees must not cover and perform the administration management and coordination tasks. The party's leadership over the government is to make sure that our government is a government of the people, by the people, and for the people and to make it strong and efficient in which it will actively operate in accordance with the functions and authorities outlined by law, correctly implement the party line and conception, and closely associate with the public. A socialist government is basically different from a bourgeois government to the point that the former is not the boss standing above and dominating the people. It is the highest organ under the leadership of the Communist Party to represent the right to mastery of the people, who fundamentally consist of workers, peasants, and intellectuals. The leadership of the party does not mean that the party will substitute for the government in performing state management and executing administration work, or on behalf of the people to exert a mastery role over the government. The party is there to develop all creative public potential and educate and organize the people to build their own government and to use that government to transform society and engage the country in the socialist construction undertaking. The party and state guarantee and implement the people's right to mastery and to work for the public interest according to their functions and methods. At present, there are conspiracies to divide the party and state, as well as oppose the party and state against the public in order to eliminate the party leadership, overthrow the government, and annihilate our socialist regime. We must heighten our vigilance against these conspiracies. We cannot separate or oppose the party and state, nor can we identify the party with the state. The party leads the state and the political system, but, at the same time, it is a part of the political system and a member of the Fatherland Front. The party provides guidance for forming the Constitution and the law, and at the same time it operates in conformity with the Constitution and the law. Party cadres and members are not above the law and they do not work outside the bounds of the law. The party leads other organizations in the political system not only by its lines, but also in organizational structure under the principle of democratic centralism and the principle of collective leadership and individual responsibility. The party exerts its leadership through the party organization -- not through individual party members -- by collective decisions and by keeping watch, providing guidance, and checking to encourage the good and correct wrongdoings. The party provides concrete guidance, but it does not get into the details of official duties and it does not issue orders. It leads by democratic methods, not by totalitarianism and arbitrariness. The party also needs to renovate the content of its activities and working method to become more democratic, disciplined, and active. It must reduce the number of meetings to intensify its control work, mingle at the grass roots, and stay close to the masses. Party members are deployed in state organs, economic units, and mass organizations to work according to the party's platform and lines and by the principle of democratic centralism. They must implement party resolutions in an exemplary way, strictly observe state law, and regularly motivate and persuade the public to follow suit. The party mechanism also needs to improve to make it lighter and more active, efficient, and suitable to the new management structure. This can be carried out satisfactorily only when it is done carefully on the basis of reviewing all organizational models and further concretizing the management method in each level, sector, and different form of grassroots organization. This should be done only after careful study and calculation to avoid unsound "separation" and "integration," which causes waste and chaos. With a thorough understanding of the reform principle and direction outlined by the seventh national party congress and the midterm national party conference, and the active and uniform execution of measures to renovate and reorganize the party, we will definitely enhance the leadership role and fighting power of the entire party, thus meeting the goal of reforms and the expectations of the public.
