FBIS4-53833 "dreas100_c_94010" FBIS-EAS-94-100 Daily Report 23 May 1994 North Korea Committee Letter Cites ROK Nuclear Development Committee Letter Cites ROK Nuclear Development SK2305151994 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1507 GMT 23 May 94 SK2305151994 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, May 23 (KCNA) -- The Korean Committee for Asian-African Solidarity sent a letter to the tri-continental people's solidarity organization on May 18 calling upon it to expose to the international community the truth behind the criminal nuclear development of the South Korean authorities. The letter calls attention to the fact that the South Korean authorities have stepped up their own nuclear developmant behind the facade of the anti-DPRK campaign of the U.S. over its "nuclear issue. According to it, the pressurized heavy water reactor (PHWR) in Wolsong camouflaged as a "commercial" reactor and the multi-purpose reactor in Taedok disguised as one for "research" constitute the backbone in the production of fissionable material in South Korea at present. The Wolsong PHWR which started operation in 1983 has so far yielded plutonium enough to make more than 370 nuclear warheads. As South Korean experts of nuclear development have already confessed, in introducing the PHWR from Canada the South Korean authorities sought to obtain high-grade plutonium from natural uranium by their own efforts. And they considered that with this heavy water reactor they could evade an international inspection because spent nuclear fuel could be abstracted from it any moment without stopping its operating. It is not fortuitous that a South Korean official dealing with atomic energy said "like businesses keeping a double account-book, one can register 10 kg of nuclear fuel after dealing with 1,000 kg daily." The multi-purpose research reactor in South Korea also is one for the development of nuclear weapons, not for the "peaceful development of atomic energy". It is so designed as to be remodelled without difficulty for the production of plutonium and to produce spent nuclear fuel containing high-grade plutonium in a shorter period than the PHWR. Now, South Korea has not only the PHWR and the multi-purpose research reactor but even post-irradiation test facilities capable of abstracting plutonium by reprocessing spent nuclear fuel therefrom. This notwithstanding, the United States and the International Atomic Enery Agency [IAEA] have connived at the PHWR in Wolsong and the multi-purpose research reactor in Taedok, South Korea, used for military purposes, while taking issue with the North's 5-megawatt experimental nuclear power station, and magnified the fictitious "nuclear suspicion" against the North and used it as an excuse for implementing their policy of stifling the DPRK. This is an outrage and act of aggression which must be allowed on no account either in view of peace on the Korean peninsula or in view of international justice and impartiality. The ever more undisguised nuclear racket of the United States is a product of its strategic ambition to bind not only the DPRK but other non-nuclear states and developing countries to the nuclear chain for ever and dominate them by the nuclear stick. We believe that your organization will widely organize unity and joint action of the peoples on the three continents to expose to the international community the truth behind the U.S. imperialists' nuclear racket against the DPRK and behind the criminal nuclear development of the South Korean authorities stepped up behind the scene and contribute to the creation of an international environment favorable to peace and reunification of Korea. At the same time, we call for a joint struggle to accuse the IAEA of its partiality in defending nuclear powers and encroaching upon the sovereignty of non-nuclear states and to establish a new nuclear control order based on international impartiality.
