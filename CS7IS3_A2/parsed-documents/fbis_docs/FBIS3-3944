Advocated by the Chinese Government since the late 1980s, the program has focused on building water conservancy projects, introducing new and advanced agro-techniques, setting up commodity grain production and animal-breeding centres and training farmers technically. "It has proved a successful way to rejuvenate China's agriculture," a government official in charge of agriculture said. With the program, according to a recent survey, China has transformed 7.33 million hectares of low-yield farmland into high- yield land, reclaimed more than one million hectares of waste land, planted trees on 1.04 million hectares, and improved 306,000 hectares of grassland over the past decade and more. As a result, it has obtained 17.16 billion additional kilograms of grain, 2.52 million kilograms of cotton, 700,000 tons of oil- bearing crops, 9.77 million kilograms of sugar and 620,000 tons of meat. Farmers in areas included in the program have earned 200 yuan extra per capita a year. One example is the Huanghuaihai Plains, which covers the valleys between the Yellow, Huaihe and Haihe rivers in part of Anhui, Hebei and Shandong provinces. In the past this area was frequently hit by natural disasters. By introducing the overall agricultural development measures, farmers have transformed 3.368 million hectares of low-yield fields into high-yield farmland, improved water irrigation facilities and introduced new farm varieties and scientific farming through five years of hard efforts. The grain output in the plains area of Shandong and Hebei Provinces now accounts for 33 percent of the provinces' total and that in Anhui for 65 percent. Known as a granary, the Northeast China Plain has increased its grain output between 2,250 kilograms and 3,000 kilograms per hectare as a result of employing scientific farming methods and transformation of the lower-yield land. Liaoning Province in northeast China is a key industrial centre, which used to buy at least 1.5 billion kilograms of grain every year from other parts of the country to feed its population. The overall agricultural development has helped this province to become self-sufficient in grain and non-staple food over the past five years. East China has more people with less farmland. With farmland averaging only 0.04 hectares per capita, the coastal Zhejiang Province has dammed tidal land to use as farmland to boost its grain output over the past five years. Western China, which has adverse natural conditions, has built a number of farm capital projects to improve the ecological environment. Sichuan Province has improved and expanded irrigation facilities; Guizhou and Yunnan provinces built terraced fields; the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region constructed water pumping projects to help transform its poor land; and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region upgraded its grassland. In addition, all the areas involved have studied agro-techniques. One example is the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which has earned 7.5 million U.S. dollars by exporting a new variety of grape. Anhui, Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces in the middle and lower reaches of the Chang Jiang River, have applied more than 3,000 new techniques and fine varieties to farming in recent years. Training courses and technical schools for farmers are mushrooming across the country. A survey shows that China still has 60 million hectares of low- yield farmland, 300 million hectares of low-yield grassland, 828,000 hectares of low-lying coastal land and 67 million hectares of sandy wasteland, which are ripe for transformation.
