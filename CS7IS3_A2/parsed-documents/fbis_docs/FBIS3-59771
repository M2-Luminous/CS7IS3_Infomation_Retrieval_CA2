The Mach-5 engine is being developed as a joint effort by aerospace engine makers from Japan, the U.S., Britain and France. The design calls for an engine which combines a turbojet, like those used on conventional subsonic aircraft, with a ramjet, like those used on missiles. The turbojet would accelerate the aircraft up to Mach-3, after which the ramjet would kick in. A one-third scale model of the turbojet part of the engine has been constructed which is capable of withstanding temperatures of 1,600 C--a temperature at which conventional engines melt. To achieve this high heat resistance, the engine blades were made from a special nickel alloy and a more effective air-cooling system was designed. This model was then loaded with fuel and fired up for the first time to verify the engine's power characteristics and its ability to withstand shaking. The tests were carried out on 15 November at a plant operated by Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co. The small-scale model engine did not reach an internal temperature of 1,600 C during the tests, but the international research group does not plan to test the heat-resistant characteristics of the engine until fiscal 1995. The goal is to develop a practical Mach-5 engine by the year 2020.
