The officials said the Transport Ministry will extend licenses for five U.S. airlines, due to expire on March 26, until June 9, instead of October 31 as requested. The step involves seven routes operated by the U.S. carriers, including Chicago-Tokyo flights operated by United Airlines, the officials said. The action followed a similar move taken by the Department of Transportation against three Japanese airlines, extending licenses for their Trans-Pacific operations which expired last December 13 for only 179 days instead of one year, they said. The U.S. decision applied to six routes, including Japan Airlines flights between Tokyo and Chicago, a Tokyo-New York route by All Nippon Airways and a cargo service between Tokyo and Los Angeles via San Francisco by Nippon Cargo Airlines, the officials said. Friday's development will escalate a drawn-out civil aviation dispute between Japan and the United States over Washington's demand for the beyond rights for American commercial carriers. The Japanese officials said Japan will revoke permission for the U.S. airlines to extend their service to Japan beyond June 9 if the United States take similar action against Japanese carriers.
