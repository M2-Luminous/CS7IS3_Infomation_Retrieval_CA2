UN Dutch Major Rob Annink said one shell hit an empty building and another fell on the runway. He said the shelling came after U.S. jets in central Bosnia shot down at 0548 GMT four Serb warplanes who were defying the NATO no-flight zone over the former Yugoslav republic. He did not specify the time of the shelling in Tuzla. Annink said he could not say if there was a link between the two incidents or if the shelling of Tuzla was by Serb forces. Tuzla airport is, however, surrounded by Serb forces who have said they oppose a UN plan to open the airport in March to receive humanitarian aid flights. A French UN officer separately told AFP that a mortar shell fell on Sunday near Sarajevo airport, which is held by UN troops. He said the shell fell at 10:00 p.m. (2100 GMT) Sunday, 500 metres (yards) north of the airport, in what would be a clear violation of the NATO ban on heavy weapons in the Sarajevo area. [passage omitted] The officer, who asked not to be named, said he could not identify where the mortar shell came from. He said three Serb tanks were seen from the airport moving northwest at about midnight (2300 GMT Sunday), in what would be another violation of the NATO ban.
