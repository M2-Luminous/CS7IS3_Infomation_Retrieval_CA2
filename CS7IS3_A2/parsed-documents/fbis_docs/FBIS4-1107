He is the prime minister-designate and should lead the next transition government in Rwanda. He narrowly escaped arrest and death. Today he is at a secure place. He spoke this evening for the first time. The extract we chose to broadcast tonight is about the possible outcome of the inter-Rwandan peace talks scheduled for 23 April in Tanzania. Christophe Boisbouvier asked Faustin Twagiramungu what conditions the rebels may set before any agreement can be reached: [Begin Twagiramungu recording] There will be no negotiation with the interim government. This government has not respected the peace agreement, which is the basic law ruling our country today. Today we must take a political decision through contacts between officers of the General Staff and the RPF. As for the government, there can be no contact with them as the government does not exist. This solution needs a pre-condition: do the military agree to denounce the presidential guard and pacify the Rwandan people? Do they agree to demand that the massacre they themselves started be stopped in the whole country? If these conditions are accepted and if they take the decision of stopping the broadcasts of the famous Milles Collines independent radio, then I think that a political solution could be found.
