In his words, the situation was critically destabilised by a recent statement by Nikolay Mikhalchenko, aide to the Ukrainian president, who said that Leonid Kravchuk is currently considering introduction of direct presidential rule not only in the Crimea but on the entire territory of Ukraine. Tomorrow is the last day of the deadline set by Kiev for the Crimean Supreme Soviet to reject the Constitution of 1992. To date, noted Mr. Chernyatevich, the working group of the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet, which is scheduled to settle the most acute problems together with their Crimean counterparts, has not yet arrived in the Crimea. Stability in the Crimea is continuedly hampered by the fact that all first deputies of the Ukrainian power ministries remain on the peninsula. To cap it, the Ukrainian armed forces started moving again this morning, said Pyotr Chernyatevich, who saw in person a column of armoured personnel carriers moving to Sevastopol. He failed to identify whom they belonged to and what was their destination. In all appearance, these were combat vehicles of the Ukrainian National Guard, since the commanders of the 32nd Ukrainian Army Corps vehemently deny their involvement with any moves of personnel or hardware, emphasised Mr. Chernyatevich.
