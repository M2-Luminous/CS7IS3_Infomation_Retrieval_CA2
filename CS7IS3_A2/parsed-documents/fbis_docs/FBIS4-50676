Venetiaan today agreed to further mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries. During a two-hour talk at the state guesthouse here this afternoon, Jiang said that both China and Suriname -- which lies on the north coast of South America -- are developing countries, shared similar sufferings in the past and have a solid basis for future friendly cooperation. Jiang said that under the leadership of the Surinamese president, the Surinamese people have made unremitting efforts to safeguard their domestic political stability and boost their national economy. In regional affairs, he said, in recent years Suriname has been actively involved in promoting the progress of Caribbean integration and playing an important role in promoting regional stability and development. "The Chinese Government appreciates this." Jiang said the establishment of a peaceful, stable, fair and reasonable international political and economic new order is an urgent demand of the world community, especially of the developing countries. He noted that the developing countries are longing for peace and state development and progress. The developing countries making up a large proportion of the world were the main forces for maintaining world peace, he said. Venetiaan, after reviewing the traditional friendship between the two peoples, expressed his appreciation of the rapid development of China's economy and his desire for strengthening bilateral economic ties and trade. He said that to enhance bilateral cooperation in every field conformed to the interests of the two peoples, and Suriname was willing to do so, he said. Referring to the Caribbean regional situation, Jiang gave a high appraisal of the roles of the countries in this region, saying that the Caribbean region is an important component part of the Third World and also a "bridge" linking the south and the north of America. Over the past few years, he said, remarkable achievements have been made by the Caribbean countries in promoting the regional peace and stability and pushing forward economic cooperation. Jiang said: "What we appreciate is that the Caribbean countries are united and positively promote the progress of Caribbean integration." He said China is concerned about the development of the Caribbean regional situation and desires to strengthen its friendly ties and cooperation with the Caribbean countries, contributing to safeguarding world peace and development. Venetiaan said Suriname, as part of America and the Caribbean, and a non-aligned country and member of the United Nations, stands for Caribbean integration and non-alignment, for safeguarding state sovereignty and the principles of equality and non-interference in other countries' internal affairs, and also for the principles of peaceful co-existence between the nations and solving international conflicts through negotiation. Venetiaan reaffirmed the "one-China" policy. Jiang expressed his appreciation of this. Wang Zhibao, chairman of the Chinese Government Reception Committee and vice-minister of forestry, and Liu Huaqiu, vice-minister of foreign affairs, participated in the talks. Also present were S.Ch. Mungra, minister of foreign affairs, F.R. Demon, minister of natural resources and energy, and J. Sisal, minister of agriculture and fisheries, who are accompanying the Surinamese president on his China visit.
