They will become a basis for drafting a programme of work with the Crimea and specific directions of the consultative, economic and humanitarian assistance," Emil Payn, member of the Presidential Council of Russia, told ITAR-TASS today. He is now on a working visit in the Crimea as a member of the CSCE expert group. Speaking about Russia's policy with regard to the Crimea, Payn said that a new conceptual framework, under which the Russian-speaking population in the former USSR republics should be given assistance, is set forth in President Yeltsin's address to the Federal Assembly. "The Crimea is a source of concern for Russia as a potential conflict area. Russia is also concerned over the fact that Russians and representatives of the nations, historically linked with Russia, are living there. The problem of the Black Sea Fleet, which is important both for Russia and the Crimea, will also be tackled," Payn said.
