Mr. President, after the departure of [the Italian humanitarian operation known as] Pelican, there were rumors that our relations with Italy were deteriorating. Is this true? I would like to ask another question, if I may: For some time now, the events of the Democratic Prosperity Party in Macedonia have attracted the attention of the Albanian public and have been commented on in various ways. The newspaper RILINDJA of Kosova wrote yesterday about a distinction in your attitude and that of Mr. Rugova regarding this party. What exactly is your opinion? [Berisha] [passage omitted] Regarding the rumors that our relations with Italy have deteriorated, I consider them to be completely false. Our relations with Italy are of a friendly nature. Italy is a country that has helped Albania, and I am convinced that the Albanians are and will be grateful to the Italian people for the noble assistance they have rendered to Albania. We should keep one thing in mind though: Friendship and speed are two different things. When establishing a friendship, it is important to base it on a solid and strong foundation. We are determined to develop and maintain friendly relations with Italy and the Italian people. As for Pelican, it left because its mission was over. I think the Pelican operation felt the greatest pleasure of all of us. After performing its large humanitarian mission, Pelican saw that the friendly country, with which it was related, had reached its required level of efficiency. [passage omitted] Therefore, Pelican finished its mission and left. There is no room for a shadow, and it did not leave any trace of one. Pelican came as a humanitarian mission and left after honestly performing its work. There is no distinction between Rugova and Tirana regarding the assessments and attitudes toward developments in Macedonia's main political force. Our ideas and concessions are identical. [Ndrek Gjini, ATA] Ndrek Gjini of ATA. How do you feel about the attacks from the left? [passage omitted] [Berisha] If you are referring to the press, I can openly say that I do not like it if I am attacked by the press. [passage omitted] The press is a very important institution of freedom and democracy. If the press abuses its freedom, do not think that it goes without being judged. There is a judge for the press, and the most powerful judge for the press is the public. [passage omitted] [Edi Paloka, RILINDJA DEMOKRATIKE] Edi Paloka of RILINDJA DEMOKRATIKE. In the extremist leftist circles, a new idea is circulating about early elections. The idea is that PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement], who won the elections in Greece, wants to overthrow the Meksi government. What do you think about this? [Berisha] This is a constant idea in the minds of some leftist leaders. In another meeting with you, I reiterated that this idea is being expressed by one of the main exponents of the Albanian left that we would like to hold elections on 23 March. This formula clearly shows their extraordinary zest for power and a conversion of power into an aim. This expresses old careerist ambitions and a non-adaption to the loss of power. As for the relation to and victory of this or that party, I think that they are completely... [changes thought] First, every victory of a party is determined by votes from the people. I am sure that with Mr. Papandreou's government, we will develop normal and friendly relations. Albania has been and will remain outside ideological friendships. [Unidentified correspondent] How do you assess the results of Ibrahim Rugova in France, and what role do you think Albanian policy has played in this framework? Do you think that the Zhirinovskiy phenomenon is spreading in East Europe as it is presented or is it part of a temporary phenomenon in the Soviet crisis? [Berisha] I have always greeted and continue to greet the invitation that the French foreign minister, Mr. Alain Juppe, forwarded to Mr. Rugova. I consider as very important the establishment of a dialogue between the legitimate representatives of the people of Kosova with the EC member countries and the EC main countries, as well as with other countries. I think that the French Government, the government of Mr. Balladur, has already given new dimensions to the problem of Albanians in the former Yugoslavia and the Balkan crisis. Concerning Zhirinovskiy, this phenomenon is as invented as it is dangerous and as mystic as it is real. In my opinion, Yeltsin won in the last elections. Through the Russian Constitution, President Yeltsin was able to mark a historic victory for the Russian people. The Russian political scene, however, has historically had its mystic aspects. [words indistinct] Thus, even Zhirinovskiy in this [words indistinct] is a mystic phenomenon in politics or rather [words indistinct] in a posttotalitarian society. What exactly does he represent? He represents the displacement from one extreme to another of a large psychology or rather a large mass of people with a totalitarian psychology -- that is, a mass of people who, unfortunately, have been embodied with and are still not liberated from the totalitarian psychology. They were transferred from supporters of, let us say, the left-wing extreme into supporters of the right-wing extreme. Despite the present results, I think that Zhirinovskiy is and should be a strong political signal for the West. This farmer is seeking more powerful support from the democratic forces. To be honest, the Zhirinovskiy phenomenon has more of an emphasis in Russia than in another country because in every kind of situation, rich or not, Russia is a very powerful factor, not only in Europe but worldwide. Russia is a large country that plays a great role. It cannot be judged simply on whether it produced wheat this year or not. Thus, the development of democracy in Russia is extremely important for Europe, as well as the world. Is it possible that the Zhirinovskiy phenomenon could be repeated in Eastern Europe? It could be repeated but not in a Russian context. If we were to analyze or take the moment [words indistinct] from the left to the right of a mass of people who are still preserving the totalitarian psychology, this is justifiable because the totalitarian society in Russia was the oldest in Europe; it was 70 years old. That is why the liberation from the totalitarian psychology is more slow. In this aspect, I do not think that the Zhirinovskiy phenomenon will gain any strength, not even in Russia. The gradual liberation of people from the totalitarian psychology will cause Zhirinovskiy to rely on them. This phenomenon will not develop in other European countries. It can appear, but it will not develop. [Pellumb Baci, Deutsche Welle] Pellumb Baci of DEUTSCHE WELLE. Mr. President [words indistinct] you are insisting that the embargo against Serbia is essential. On the contrary, several Western political circles have asked that the embargo be lifted, almost to the point of completely abolishing it. What are the real chances of both attitudes, and what will be the consequences if the embargo is abolished? [passage omitted] [Berisha] We are insisting that the embargo against Serbia be maintained in order to prevent the conflict from spreading to the Balkans. The truth is that the embargo is, perhaps, the only Security Council resolution to be carried out, not exactly in full but in approximately full efficiency. For all analysts, there is no doubt that this embargo plays a role in weakening Belgrade's aggressive potential. To reward Milosevic by abolishing the embargo and asking him to give back the occupied territories would, in my opinion, create the precedence of occupying other territories and setting up another chain of rewards and compromises that could be dangerous for the Balkans and Europe. The embargo was inflicted as a result of Belgrade's aggressive policy. It was not an expression of revenge by a country against Serbia or the Serbian people. It was a punishment for the aggressive policy that the Serbian leadership followed in the Balkans. What are the chances? It is difficult to determine what the chances are. However, the danger and the consequences of abolishing the embargo could be very serious. [passage omitted] [Unidentified correspondent] As BBC reported, Mr. Papandreou greeted Albanians on the New Year. How do you feel about this? The second question concerns foreign investments. How is the present situation and what are the prospects? [Berisha] In response to the first question, although it is a news [word indistinct] a wish from a friendly country or a country with which we should develop friendly relations is always welcomed. Of course, there is no doubt that we have had our problems, but the neighboring countries and all other countries are important for us. We will be loyal to the principle of reciprocity in our policies. This is and will be the main principle of our foreign policy. We are offering honest cooperation and sincere relations to our neighbors. This is a confident road of cooperation with Albania or enhancing cooperation with Albania. Every other attempt will only fail. All those who, through other forms or methods, tried to condition or impose their ideas on Albania have made and are still making mistakes and have failed and still continue to fail. Albania has been and will be open. On the basis of this principle, it will establish relations with all countries and will consider as a friend the one who is interested in a sincere friendship. It will know to be neutral toward the one who wishes to be neutral, and it will know to disgust everyone that will try to disgust her. Thus, in our relations with neighbors and far-away countries, the main principle will be that of reciprocity. We offer honest cooperation to the others and we ask the same thing from them. As for foreign investments, I think that this extremely important knot is heading toward a solution. There were difficulties concerning the legislative, psychological, and regional orders. On this occasion, I am appealing once again to Albanians to demonstrate that friendly potential they have in their soul to foreign investors. We should keep in mind that forming partnerships with foreigners is a very important when it comes to accelerating the country's development. In this respect, we will further improve our legislation next month. The Law on Foreign Investments is among the best, and parliament recently passed two very important amendments -- the price of land, and I hope parliament will approve the sale of land, and the price of agricultural land. Finally, a great possibility for investments will be the application of securities and the creation of markets. They will grant the opportunity to Albanians to become partners and participate in these processes, either in creating joint ventures with them or buying the enterprises. Thus, the creation of securities and their application will bring about a powerful stimulus in attracting foreign investments, because foreign investors definitely prefer the individual more than the state. This is quite normal. The private individual in Albania has had many limited opportunities. The securities will increase these opportunities by a certain percentage. Thus, this year cannot end with forecasts; the successes are much better than can be imagined. We have $200 million worth of investment. In fact, we have already signed contracts for next year, which can possibly double this amount in ore industry and other fields. [Unidentified correspondent] [passage omitted] What concrete successes has Albania achieved this year in domestic and foreign fields? What main goals do you plan to achieve next year in domestic and foreign policy? [Berisha] Regarding Albania's concrete successes this year, I can summarize them and say that politically, Albania has made confident steps toward its integration in international institutions and countries of Europe and toward a further affinity with other countries, including your country [as heard] as well. The visit of your foreign minister is a remarkable event and has rendered an indisputable contribution and in the new relations we plan to establish with your big country. I can say that there were great achievements in the legislative field as well. The greatest of all is undoubtedly the Charter on Human Rights and Freedoms. It is a monument of the right in European standards. Of the same importance are laws on foreign investments, banks, privatization, the status of persecutees and prisoners, and a series of other institutions. Another achievement is the increase of production. I think that this marks a great success for Albania. Considering next year, we hope to wisely use the impetus of freedom. Albania is experiencing a moment of impetus, and this should be used as wisely and rationally as possible. Thus, next year, we hope to achieve good results concerning the large-scale privatization of medium and large enterprises. Privatization marked new achievements last year and this year. Out of 600 enterprises, more than 500 have been privatized. The land is privatized as are the houses. However, the use of securities will grant great possibilities to the enterprises privatized on a large scale. I consider this to be the most important problem next year. Of course, the opening and integration of Albania in Europe and the international community is and remains another constant goal of ours. I have stressed over and over that Albania will strictly adhere to the principal of reciprocity. The solution of the Balkan crisis and national question is another priority of our foreign policy. In this framework, I think that 1992 marked another level concerning the issue of Albanians in the former Yugoslavia and the Albanian national question. Europe is finally convinced that the problem of Kosova is an international question. Thus, it is necessary that Albanian political forces and the Albanian Government be more active and more energetic in their dialogues with international community governments in explaining the truth that was darkened by history and half a century of Greater Serbian propaganda. At the same time, while solving this problem, it is necessary for Albania to remain loyal to the agreements it has signed and show that it is a serious constructive partner. The acceptance of Albania's stabilizing role in the Balkans is undoubtedly the one proof that Albanians carry more weight in the dialogue with the international community in solving these problems.
