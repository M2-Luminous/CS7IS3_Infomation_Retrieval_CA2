Protection Force (UNPROFOR) against the local Moslems' violations of the February 25 ceasefire agreement. Moslem forces have disregarded the Monday noon deadline for withdrawal and have not placed their heavy weapons under control, Zagreb-based Croatian radio quotes a statement released by the Croat command as saying. The radio said that Moslem troops had torched six Croat houses in the vicinity of Vitez on Monday. Fierce fighting between Moslems and Croats, erstwhile allies against Bosnian Serbs, has been raging since early 1993 in the central and southern parts of the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Representatives of Bosnian Croats and Moslems and of neighbouring Croatia, acting under strong U.S. pressure, signed a framework agreement in Washington on March 1 undertaking to form a Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, the agreement has failed to curb the Moslem-Croat war.
