Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev speaks about the goals that the emerging comprehensive European security system must focus on and how such a system can be established. [Kozyrev] There may be too many seemingly efficient "simple" solutions. The bases for these proposals are mostly two factors that are regarded as axioms of a modern European policy. First of all, there is talk of a "security vacuum and gray zone" in Central Europe, an area that will most probably become a region of Russian expansion. It is also to be feared that "Russia will embark on a nationalist-empire policy" following the recent Russian parliamentary elections. [PESTI HIRLAP] Should one fear the revival of Russian imperialism? [Kozyrev] One should not fear that Russian tanks might advance toward the West, because a Russian "performance" of the Yugoslav drama is much more plausible. Such a development would have dire consequences, such as several million refugees, large-scale industrial catastrophes, and the use of tactical nuclear weapons. [PESTI HIRLAP] In this case, what could NATO do to defend its Eastern European partners? [Kozyrev] A few Chernobyl-type catastrophes could destroy all Europe, and the advanced positions could not save anyone. This worst-case scenario could be caused precisely by a hasty expansion of NATO, because this would strengthen the "threat concept" of the Russian extremists. The strategy of "counting on the worst" is also dangerous because it involves the possibility of a self-fulfilling prophecy. The fears of an "Eastern danger" could be mostly dissipated if the European countries set up partnership relations with a democratic Russia that is building a constitutional state and a market economy. Russia has no territorial claims on any country in the world, and its military doctrine is clearly defensive. [PESTI HIRLAP] What is your opinion about the recent parliamentary elections? [Kozyrev] Fascism has no grounds in Russia. The voters did not vote in favor of a "Western campaign" or the forced revival of the Soviet Union and the socialist camp. They voted against the personal ambitions and stubbornness of some reform politicians and against misery and crime. Several factors must be taken into consideration in establishing a new Europe. The so-called shock diplomacy and the policy of accepting events that have occurred should be excluded from the political methods. Russia is in favor of broad consultations among interested parties. Russia does not have the right to tell NATO which country it should accept; at the same time, however, Russia is justified in demanding that NATO take into consideration the particularities of the naturally extended interim period and, in the long term, it confirms the basic principles in its documents, principles according to which NATO is an open organization that offers free access to every democratic country in Europe. There can be no "first- and second-class security," or "special influence zones." Nor can be "isolated regions" or any "cordon sanitaire."
