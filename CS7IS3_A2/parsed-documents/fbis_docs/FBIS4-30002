In Japan, automakers have always asked their keiretsu [affiliated subsidiaries] auto parts makers to reduce the cost of auto parts by setting numerical targets. So far, Japanese automakers have not set any cost-cutting targets for U.S. auto parts makers because of the need to place importance on improving the quality of U.S. auto parts. The automobile and auto parts sector has been one of the priority sectors at the Japanese- U.S. economic framework talks, and each Japanese automaker is in a hurry to expand its purchase of U.S.-made auto parts. The Toyota Motor Corporation intends to expand its purchase of U.S.-made auto parts by formulating a long-term tie-up with U.S. auto parts makers, like the one it has built in Japan. The major Japanese automaker announced at an annual meeting of U.S. auto parts manufacturers held earlier this week in San Francisco that it would set the cost-reduction targets for U.S. auto parts suppliers. The cost-cutting targets vary from automaker to automaker, but each Japanese automaker sets them at 2 percent a year or 5 percent over five years, and then asks its auto parts suppliers to meet these targets. Some Japanese automakers have already notified their auto parts suppliers of their targets. In Japan, the formula has long been adopted whereby numerical targets are set for reductions in the cost along with improvements in the quality of auto parts, and automakers and auto parts makers work together to design auto parts and to choose materials with which to manufacture auto parts. Only some automakers have set numerical targets for cutting the prices of parts, but automakers have come to seek cost-cutting targets as the quality of auto parts has improved. In March, the Toyota Motor Corporation announced plans to boost its combined purchases of U.S.-made auto parts -- which consist of imports and local purchase in the United States -- to $6.45 billion in 1996 (from April 1996 to March 1997), an increase of 38 percent over the total combined purchases in 1993. The major Japanese automaker has judged that it is important to promote a long-term reduction in the cost and improvements in the quality of U.S.-made auto parts by adopting the Japanese-style keiretsu deal method to expand the purchase of U.S.-made auto parts. While U.S. automakers are criticizing the closed Japanese automobile and auto parts market, they are vigorously embracing the Japanese-style keiretsu method in a bid to bolster their competitiveness. Ford and Chrysler have already pressed their auto parts suppliers to cut the price and improve the quality of their parts. They have succeeded in improving their competitiveness in the cost and the quality of auto parts by strengthening their business ties with selected auto parts suppliers in the areas of development and production.
