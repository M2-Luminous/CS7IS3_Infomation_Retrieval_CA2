Under a policy that economic sanctions led by the United States are an inevitable choice for blocking the North Korean nuclear development, the government is carrying out many-fold diplomatic efforts to seek more effective sanction methods, and has strengthened the alert posture of the entire Armed Forces, thus assuming the emergency work system. Under this situation, President Kim Yong-sam, now visiting Russia, held a news conference on the spot and stated that "both the ROK and the United States not only grasped the North Korean movement 100 percent but also retained sufficient capabilities to cope with the an emergency. Therefore, the people may feel easy about a series of changes in the situation." Since the situation at home and abroad surrounding the North Korean nuclear problem has been strained rapidly, people from all walks of life at home, who used to be insensitive to security, began to gradually realize the seriousness of the situation. With the increased number of stocks put on sale by foreign investors at domestic stock markets, indications show that the cold wind has begun to blow surrounding the North Korean nuclear issue. Reports also point out that business firms which have been pushing ahead with economic cooperation with North Korea in the past are taking pains to work out proper measures to cope with economic sanctions against North Korea when they actually take place. In particular, for some large business groups that have processing-on-commission [imgagong] plants in North Korea and have brought considerable quantities of North Korean materials to the ROK, sanctions on North Korea mean the overall discontinuation of North-South economic exchanges. Thus, it is urgent for them to work out appropriate measures to minimize the business deadlock anticipated after sanctions are imposed. What we must keep in mind regarding sanctions against North Korea, to be pushed for as part of international efforts to block North Korea's nuclear development, is that our economy must not be left wavering. The method and time of sanctions on North Korea have not been concretely decided. However, even if details of sanctions are announced, the direct impact of such sanctions to our economy would be insignificant and may even be ignored. North-South economic exchanges pushed ahead by some business firms still remain in such an extent as to operate merely a certain number of processing-on-commission plants in North Korea and to bring in a certain quantity of North Korean materials. Moreover, these materials are merely plain consumer goods. The amount of their transactions was $4.38 million last year, and $4.63 as of the end of April this year. Compared to the scale of our imports amounting to $100 billion a year, this amount is, in a word, indeed negligible. This being the case, what we should be on the watch for is psychological uneasiness about sanctions against North Korea and negative economic effects. In other words, our business firms and enterprises should not tuck themselves up in uneasiness without any grounds, and should not cause any economic unrest. In view of this, the government should inform economic organizations and business firms rapidly and correctly of changes in the situation at home and abroad lest they fall into a sense of uneasiness. In addition, the government should realize that the building of an economic cooperative system based on the understanding between business firms and the people is as important a task as ensuring the military security posture.
