[RN leader Leonardo Zeledon, alias Chispero] "The CIAV-OAS, as guarantor of the verification of the agreements signed with the RN, take us out of here, gentlemen." Simultaneously, six persons led by Luis Arguello Ortiz, known among the former RN members as 02 [Cero Dos], entered the Colombian Embassy to demand political asylum. [Arguello] "We are requesting political asylum because the approval of the military code would lead to the total extermination of the RN." Colombian diplomatic authorities are reviewing the situation of the six persons, who remain at the South American diplomatic mission. [Colombian Ambassador Jorge Villamizar] "We are evaluating everything, the information given to us and the request they are making. There are six persons. They entered peacefully, there has been no act of violence. Everything is normal inside the embassy. We can come and go as we please as you can see. There is no repressive action at this time. Everything is peaceful." In view of the situation, Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal said that in Nicaragua there is freedom of expression. [Leal] "I believe that if they are members of the RN party, the party will be able to make its demands civically. If they are from the Sandinist National Liberation Front [FSLN], the FSLN will be in charge. I believe we Nicaraguans must begin learning how to do things. We do not see any need to request political asylum because there is and there will be no political persecutions here at least while the government of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro is in power." Luis Arguello Ortiz, who is now at the Colombian Embassy, has a case pending in the justice system. [National Police Chief Fernando Caldera] "One of the persons, who is now at the Colombian Embassy, had been arrested for committing a crime. These people are really not [word indistinct]. I believe there are dark elements in this organization. There are dark interests that must be [words indistinct] so that we can have an idea of [passage indistinct]." It all seems to indicate that the occupation of the CIAV-OAS and the Colombian Embassy is part of a plan and that is why the National Police have conducted operations in certain parts of the capital. How does the National Police chief view this situation? [Caldera] "There is obviously an attitude against the Nicaraguan Government, but it is not only against the Nicaraguan Government. We must remember that the Colombian Embassy and the CIAV-OAS offices have been occupied and that the next secretary general of the OAS will be the current Colombian President, Cesar Gaviria, who will replace Joao Baena Soares. There is obviously a manipulation [words indistinct]." [Unidentified speaker] "What measures will be taken to...[words indistinct]?" [Caldera] "We are currently conducting measures aimed at preventing further incidents from taking place. We have adopted measures. We have already taken to the streets. We have set up checkpoints, and we are patrolling the streets." Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo said the individuals who entered the Colombian Embassy and the CIAV-OAS are citizens who are violating the country's laws and international agreements. They cannot be members of the former RN because the former members of that organization have their dialogue channels with the government open. [Lacayo] "The members of the RN have their legitimate representatives. These are Nicaraguan citizens who are violating the law. I do not see any RN member there. The young man called Luis Arguello was apparently not even a demobilized member of the RN. He is the one called Chispero. You know him. I do not think they have to [words indistinct] within the framework of the law. We have contacted the Colombian Government and the OAS to take coordinated action. They are Nicaraguan citizens, who are violating international agreements. No one has the right to occupy a diplomatic mission [words indistinct]."
