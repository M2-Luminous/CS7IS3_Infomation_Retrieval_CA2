Jiang Zemin and other leading cadres of the CPC Central Committee and Central Military Commission cordially met Xu Honggang and praised him warmly for his heroic deeds. The General Political Department and the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League jointly issued a circular calling on the whole nation to emulate Xu Honggang. Why did the deeds of an ordinary soldier produce such a strong reaction and evoke such extensive echoes? In the final analysis, it is because his magnificent feats reflect the people's aspirations and respond to the call of the times. Our era is a great one in which we have initiated the brilliant cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. The themes of our era comprise Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; the party's basic line; the ideology and spirit of patriotism, collectivism, socialism, and revolutionary heroism; an ideology and spirit that is beneficial to reform, opening up, and modernization and national unity, social progress, and the people's happiness; and the ideology and spirit of striving for a happy life through honest labor. The noble thoughts and heroic deeds of Xu Honggang are precisely a resounding song with the main melody of the times. He rushed to help comrades in danger or difficulty, earnestly practiced what he advocated for the socialist cause, is irreconcilable towards ugly phenomena, and persistently performs the duties of a soldier. His thoughts and actions reflect the traditional virtues of the Chinese nation, shining with the glow of socialist ideology and morality, and mirror the fine traditions of our party and Army, which shimmer with the brand new spirit of the times. He boasts the common valuable character of the heroes of the older generations as well as the distinguishing features of a hero of the current generation. He is a brilliant model of a soldier because of his courage in devoting himself to a cause which is of universal significance to building up a healthy social atmosphere. This is the basic reason why Xu Honggang's deeds produced such a great appealing effect. If any nation wants to be rejuvenated and any society wants to make changes, it should portray heroes and heroic images suitable to the requirements of the times so that people can be inspired and motivated. Just as the years of the revolutionary war called for heroic fighters to break through the brambles and thorns and to charge and shatter enemy positions, today, the accomplishment of the magnificent cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics likewise calls for heroic people to lead the broad masses to forge ahead and the advanced elements in society to take the lead in developing the "five kinds of revolutionary spirit" advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and the "64-character pioneering spirit" emphasized by Comrade Jiang Zemin. They must have lofty ideals, take the overall interests into consideration, be ready to dedicate themselves to a cause, abide by social ethics, and have a high sense of responsibility, a healthy tendency of fostering justice and combating evil, the noble character of supporting those in danger and assisting those in difficulty, and the pioneering spirit of keeping on fighting in spite of all setbacks. With these, they can bring about a fundamental improvement of social morality and promote the constant advance of socialist spiritual civilization, so that our undertaking of reform, opening up, and modernization can march from victory to victory. This is precisely the social cause of heroic people emerging in great multitudes, who, singing the resonant songs of righteousness, have lived up to the earnest expectations of the broad masses. The hero Xu Honggang sprung up in response to the times. Marxism tells us that the growth of a hero is closely connected with the times he is in and the cause he takes up. The great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is one that calls for heroes, and the practice of pioneering a cause to build socialism with Chinese characteristics is a vast arena for bringing up heroes. In tracing the footprint of Comrade Xu Honggang's growth, we can clearly note that Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics was the most valuable nourishment for his mind; the fiery life of reform, opening up, and the drive for modernization is an exceptionally fine environment for his growth; the People's Army that boasts the true character of the veteran Red Army and the tradition of revolutionary heroism is a revolutionary furnace in which he is tempered; and the spirit of the masses who work hard to change the world in heading for a relatively comfortable life is the source of strength that urges him to make advances. In short, the spirit of our times, the fine tradition of our party, the heroic character of our Army, and the traditional virtues of the Chinese nation are all vividly reflected in him. It is an essential demand of our times to bring up group after group of heroic people like Xu Honggang. This represents the mainstream of our times. In the high tide of reform and opening up, those who indulge in money worship and pleasure- seeking and those extreme individualists will certainly be eliminated by the times, as they run counter to the historical trend. In emulating Xu Honggang, we must act like him in responding to the call of the times with our practical actions. Every comrade should think over such a serious question: Can we do what Xu Honggang has done under the same blue sky and on the same earth? The great era of reform and opening up and the magnificent practice of army modernization have provided everyone with more or less the same environment for growth and the same arena of life, but each person's performance in response to the call of the times is entirely different. Why? There are many aspects, and the most fundamental is whether he can sincerely and realistically put into practice the spirit of the times. Xu Honggang has done it honestly. He has armed his own mind with the great theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, nurtured himself with the glorious traditions of veteran Red Army men, portrayed his own image with the noble spirit of serving the people with heart and soul, and trained himself through his dedication to the arduous practice of the national defense undertaking. Instead of uttering heroic words, he cherishes lofty aspirations and is ready to be devoted and to make sacrifices. It is precisely this spirit that makes Xu Honggang a hero. When we learn from Xu Honggang, we should particularly emulate this kind of spirit. With such a spirit, anyone can be another Xu Honggang when he is called to take up the cudgels for a just cause, another Su Ning when he is called for to devote himself to the modernization of national defense, another Huang Jiguang or Dong Cunrui when he is called to charge the enemy lines, and another Lei Feng when he is called to make contributions in an ordinary post. Heroes are the pioneers of the times and models for the masses. The more heroes like Xu Honggang we have, the more cohesive our society will be, the stronger our Army's combat capacity will become, and the more our cause will flourish. We must enthusiastically respond to the call of Chairman Jiang and the Central Military Commission; conscientiously put into effect the guidelines of the circular jointly issued by the General Political Department and the Communist Youth League Central Committee; extensively and profoundly conduct activities of emulating the hero Xu Honggang; bring up more new socialist personalities with lofty ideals, moral integrity, education, and a sense of discipline; and repeatedly push forward the building of a revolutionized, modernized, and regularized Army!
