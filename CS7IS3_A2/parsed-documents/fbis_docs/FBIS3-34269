Indian High Commissioner S.K. Lambha was summoned to the foreign office in Islamabad yesterday and was told that the assault on the person of the prime minister is not only unjustifiable but is also against the civilized norms of behavior between sovereign nations. The Pakistani foreign office has also said that the campaign launched by India to malign the Pakistani prime minister cannot misguide world public opinion, which has openely held India responsible for the human rights violations in occupied Kashmir. The government of Pakistan very much regrets that the Indian president also has involved himself in the campaign.
