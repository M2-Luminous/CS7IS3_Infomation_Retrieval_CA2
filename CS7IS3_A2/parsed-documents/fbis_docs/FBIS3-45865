The minister was replying to a question as to how he viewed the U.S. future role in the region just before the visit of former U.S. President George Bush who is scheduled to arrive in Bangkok tonight as the guest of business tycoon Charoen Pokphand. Prasong was quoted by the local newspaper "THE BANGKOK POST" as saying that there would be no official discussion between Bush and himself on regional security, but adding he would brief the former President on the situation if asked to do so.
