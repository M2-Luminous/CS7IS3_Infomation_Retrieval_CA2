FR940505-1-00194 FR940505-1-00012 (2) VMT Estimates. VMT estimates for Sacramento were derived mostly from an August 1993 draft of the Sacramento Area Council of Governments (SACOG) Metropolitan Transportation Plan (MTP). That draft included only 1990 and 2015 estimates, so intermediate years of 1999 and 2005 were estimated by linear interpolation. Also, SACOG does not currently include Solano County, which is partially within the FIP area. VMT for Solano County were calculated from the 1992 CalTrans MVSTAFF report using a CARB estimate of the portion of Solano County VMT in the FIP area. The final SACOG MTP includes specific VMT estimates for 2000 and 2005 which are somewhat higher than the interpolated values used by EPA. EPA plans to use the final MTP values in analyses for the final FIP rulemaking. Ventura VMT estimates come directly from the August 1993 JHK & Associates report done for the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District. South Coast VMT are based on an August 1993 draft Southern California Area Governments (SCAG) analysis. While EPA believes these are the most appropriate VMT estimates and projections for the FIP, comments are invited on the merits of other VMT estimates. (3) Nonroad vehicles and engines. A full range of nonroad engines and vehicles are addressed in this NPRM, from small hand-held gasoline lawn and garden equipment to heavy duty diesel engines used in farm and construction work. The inventory for some of these categories is taken directly from CARB estimates, but for the categories listed below EPA either adjusted the CARB inventory with different growth rates or used a totally different basis for the inventory. In the first three categories listed (HD engines greater than 50 hp, lawn and garden equipment, and recreational boats) the base-year estimate comes from CARB. However, to be consistent with the national rulemakings for these categories, the growth rates are modified by EPA based on the most recent available population growth estimates for each area. Whereas CARB grew these inventories at roughly a straight line 2 percent of the base-year's inventory per year, EPA uses a straight line 3.4 percent per year for Sacramento, 3.0 percent per year for Ventura, and 1.8 percent per year for the South Coast. (i) Heavy duty engines greater than 50 hp. EPA started with the 1990 CARB inventories for diesel and gasoline farm and construction equipment (Mobile Equipment). As discussed in the technical support document, the CARB inventory was then adjusted by a factor of 0.975 to account for engines less than 50 hp which are estimated to represent 2.5 percent of the emission inventory. The population growth assumption described above was then used to grow the heavy duty engine inventory. (ii) Spark ignition engines less than 25 hp (lawn and garden). EPA started with the 1990 CARB inventory for residential and commercial utility (lawn and garden) equipment. The population growth assumption described above was then used to grow the inventory. (iii) Recreational marine engines. EPA started with the 1990 CARB inventory for recreational gasoline and diesel boats. This was modified for Sacramento using new data obtained from California on boat registrations and navigable water area. This resulted in a greater 1990 inventory than CARB had been using. The EPA population growth assumptions described above were then used to grow the inventory from 1990. For Ventura and South Coast, the ratio of CARB's Ventura and South Coast tons to CARB's Sacramento tons was multiplied by the corrected Sacramento inventory to obtain consistent inventories for all three areas. (iv) Locomotives. Inventories developed by Booz-Allen Hamilton for CARB show locomotive No x contributions per summer day in 1990 of approximately: Nine tons in the Sacramento area, one ton in Ventura, and over thirty tons in the South Coast. These contributions constituted approximately 5 percent, 1 percent, and 2 percent of the total No x emissions for Sacramento, Ventura and South Coast respectively. These inventories are summarized in the following table. EPA refers readers to the Booz-Allen reports entitled: Locomotive Emissions Study and Report on Locomotive Emission Inventory: Locomotive Emissions by County, presented as a supplement to the Locomotive Emission Study. 1990 NO X Inventories (Booz-Allen) 1FIP area 1NO X tons per day 1Percent of total inventory Sacramento 9.0 5 Ventura 1.2 1 South Coast 30.5 2 Systems Applications International (SAI), under contract to EPA, recently completed a draft report entitled 1990 Emissions from Diesel Locomotives in Three California Federal Implementation Plan Areas. There are large differences between the emission estimates developed by Booz-Allen and SAI. As a result, EPA requests comment on the appropriate inventory and methodology for calculating inventories to use. Emission inventories calculated by SAI are summarized in the table below.
