Perry, who was scheduled to leave for Tokyo and Seoul Friday to discuss the North Korean nuclear crisis, decided to postpone his trip because of the tragedy in which American F-15 fighters enforcing the "no-fly" zone over northern Iraq mistakenly shot down two U.S. Army choppers, killing more than 20 people, the sources said. The Department of Defense notified the South Korean Embassy here of the delay, saying Perry's visit to Seoul will be rescheduled next week when the downing is cleared up, they said. The diplomatic sources, however, did not rule out the possibility that the visit could be delayed for a longer period if the mishap triggered a political and military uproar in and outside the United States. The U.S. defense secretary was scheduled to meet with his South Korean counterpart Yi Pyong-tae to tackle the North Korean nuclear problem in Seoul from April 17-19.
