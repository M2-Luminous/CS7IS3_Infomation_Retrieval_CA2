The letter of appeal was signed by 350 people and involved the largest number of people to sign a petition since the 4 June incident in 1989. The signatories include many prodemocracy activists. The petition was sparked by the following event. On 2 July 1992, Yan Zhengxue, "head" of an artist's village near Yuan Ming Yuan, who is also a deputy to the Jiaojiang City People's Congress, Heilongjiang, was involved in a dispute with a bus conductor. He was then detained by the public security organ of Beijing's Haidian District and was attacked by the security officers with electric batons. Yan later brought an administrative suit against the public security office, demanding that the public security organ be charged with such illegal behavior. The letter of appeal pointed out that if a deputy to the people's congress could be treated in such a rude way, then ordinary people would be less protected. The letter of appeal supported Yan Zhengxue's suit and demanded that the authorities act in accordance with the laws and that the law courts try cases independently and affix responsibility to those who should be blamed. The signatories will continue to pay close attention to the development of the event. The petition was caused by a dispute between the police and civilians and it was on the largest scale since the 4 June incident. The petition signatoriess included scholars, artists, reporters, lawyers, workers, cadres, members of the provincial people's congress standing committee, and ordinary people. Such prodemocracy activists as Wang Dan, Liu Xiaobo, and "Peace Charter" members Liu Nianchun and Zhou Guoqiang also signed the letter. The appeal letter was drafted in August 1993 but, as the drafters said, in order to prevent further complicating the event, they did not make it public. However, as the authorities did not take action to correct the wrong, and even continued to threaten Yan, they were forced to make public the letter and submit it to the National People's Congress Standing Committee, the Supreme People's Court, and the Supreme People's Procuraterate.
