Beshkov expressed alarm with the "recent statements of the `Great Romania' Legion, which considers Dobrudzha a native Romanian land." "We expect the Bulgarian authorities not to keep silent any longer regarding those `innocent jokes' on the part of certain nationalistic circles in Romania." For his part Teodor Tolea, press secretary of the Romanian Embassy, expressed indignation with those "attempts to artificially exacerbate tension in bilateral relations," while Mr. Gherceanu, first secretary of the Romanian Embassy, said over the telephone: "What was published in the Bulgarian press about certain territorial claims, Greater Romania, and so forth, is not only falsehood but also a crude provocation. Our country has repeatedly declared that it has no territorial claims vis-a-vis Bulgaria. We have always adhered to good-neighborly relations and mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries. However, we encountered already on several occasions such publications in certain Bulgarian newspapers. It appears that TRUD uses a double standard. If the Bulgarian minority in Romania has its organization, newspaper, and representatives in the parliament, does that mean that it also has separatist intentions?"
