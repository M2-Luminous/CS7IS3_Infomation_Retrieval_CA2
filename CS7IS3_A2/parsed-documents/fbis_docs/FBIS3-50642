He said that the patrolling of Guatemala's border with Chiapas is normal and that no one can cross the border illegally. In leaving Los Pinos Residence, where Mexican President Carlos Salinas received new year greetings from the diplomatic corp accredited to Mexico, Maldonado said that Guatemala cannot cooperate with Mexico in resolving the armed conflict in northern Chiapas State. Let's hear what he had to say: [Begin Maldonado recording] The Guatemalan Government has to protect its own borders, Guatemalan territory. Regarding cooperation, nothing has been said about that, and we do not think it is necessary, because we believe that the Mexican state has complete and absolute control over its actions. [end recording] The diplomat denied that there are Guatemalans involved in the Chiapas conflict and that the problem there could extend beyond the border and become a regional problem.
