FBIS4-9025 "dreeu076__a94043" FBIS-EEU-94-076-A Daily Report 14 Apr 1994 ANNEX Hungary Foreign Ministry Sends Note to Slovak Embassy Foreign Ministry Sends Note to Slovak Embassy AU1404182294 Budapest MTI in English 1516 GMT 14 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU1404182294 Budapest MTI English BFN [Text] Budapest, 14 April (MTI) -- The Hungarian Foreign Ministry on Thursday [14 April] sent a note to the Slovak Embassy in Budapest, foreign affairs spokesman Janos Herman told MTI. The document says, "The Government of Hungary is, as proposed in its earlier Note of March 28, 1994, ready to engage in immediate negotiations which will lead to the rapid implementation of a satisfactory temporary water management regime along the lines of the recommendations of the experts of the European Commission of December 1, 1993. This presupposes that the Government of Slovakia accept these recommendations, as Hungary has done. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Hungary did not receive yet any information of such an engagement on behalf of Slovakia neither from the EC, nor from Bratislava. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs would therefore be grateful if the Slovak side could, at its earliest convenience, inform both the European Commission and the Hungarian Government on the acceptance of the recommendations on the basis of which immediate negotiations could start. "In this connection the Ministry of Foreign Affairs wishes to point out that, far from being a 'categorical refusal' of the recommendations of the Experts of the EC, the resolution of the Hungarian Parliament of March 29, 1994, is entirely consistent with those recommendations. A copy of the (as yet for technical reasons unpromulgated) resolution is attached to this Note Verbale for the information of the Slovak Republic. As is quite clear from its terms, the resolution deals only with the posititon pending the conclusion of an agreement on the temporary water management regime. The Parliament's consideration was that in this period an underwater weir shall not be built at river kilometer 1843. This was precisely the view of the EC Experts themselves, as expressed in the letter written on their behalf by Professor Schreiner on February 8, 1994, to Mr. Pablo Benavides, director of the European Commission. The experts had recommended the construction of two weirs at different places, in connection with and subsidiary to a substantial increase in the discharge regime. Such an increase was, as the EC Experts have pointed out, 'the main factor' in the recommendations." "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs wishes to inform the Embassy of the Slovak Republic that the Government of the Republic of Hungary remains fully prepared to implement the recommendations of the Experts of the EC, as explained in its letter of January 14, 1994, and would like to express its earnest hope that the Government of the Slovak Republic will do likewise," the document says.
