"It seems that meetings at the political top level are needed to make this clear," the premier said during the discussion of a bill on the relations between Estonia and Russia. Laar assured that, in order to solve problems between the two countries, the Estonian Government has chosen a path that doesn't rule out mutually advantageous agreements and compromises but presumes that the Estonian-Russian relations are based on mutual respect and equality of rights. Laar said the implementation of such a policy has forced the government to develop and strengthen the country's state and security institutions, work towards Estonia's economic independence from Russia, secure internal stability, and achieve as quickly as possible Estonia's integration into the Western community. "Whereas 18 months ago the card of human rights was an ace in Russia's hand and a year ago the situation in eastern Virumaa and Narva was truly explosive, by now the human rights card has been beaten on the international arena and the power in eastern Virumaa is in the hands of entirely different principles and of local governments that support Estonian statehood," the premier claimed. "Tension has clearly been reduced in Estonia, this is what both foreign experts and local Russian organizations think."
