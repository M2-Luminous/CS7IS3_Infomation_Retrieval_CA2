This evening Mr. Peres met Dennis Ross, the head of the U.S. peace team, and U.S. Ambassador Edward Djerejian. Prior to entering the meeting Mr. Peres said the discussions by the Israeli delegation in Cairo are serious, but we should not jump to conclusions. Our correspondent Yiftah El'azar reports that Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin, who also participated in the meeting this evening, said that the evacuation of the Jewish settlers from Hebron is not on the agenda at the present time. Beilin hoped that the talks with the Palestinians would resume next week.
