Ibadete Hajrullahu has more details: [Hajrullahu] To settle the controversy about the number of Albanians in Macedonia -- which according to Macedonian officials is approximately 21 percent, while according to Albanian politicians is 40 percent, Macedonia agreed under international pressure to carry out a new census because the exact number of Albanians is needed to determine their status in this republic. The date of the census has already been postponed more than once because disputed issues have not yet been resolved. Council of Europe experts have asked that some articles of the Census Law be amended since the Macedonian side did not take into consideration remarks made by the Council of Europe when drafting this bill. On this and other problems, we interviewed the chairman of the Party of Democratic Prosperity, Arber Xhaferri: The census is about to be carried out. Have the necessary preparations for a real and objective census been concluded, and how is the situation regarding the procurement of personal documents of Albanians for the census? [Xhaferri] This problem is real and objective. The Macedonian Government is attempting to have the census carried out according to their standards and needs. We, however, are not satisfied with these preparations, which is why we are trying to organize the census ourselves. We have already contacted some experts on statistics and demographic censuses from Kosova and the United States. We intend to maintain our stance. We have our demands and we will not give up. We are also having a number of difficulties helping people obtain personal documentation. In my opinion, this strategy is aimed against the Albanians or against peoples who should be marginalized in the system. No matter where they are, particularly in the postcommunist states, these peoples are having problems obtaining personal documents and with property. These difficulties have been fabricated so that a majority of the population will not be able to register. [Hajrullahu] The coalition government prepared the election laws some time ago. What is your view on this? [Xhaferri] Even under these election laws, a political result will emerge on the Albanians' political strength. It is anticipated that Albanians should in no way obtain one-third of the deputies in the parliament. If they were able to reach this number, they would become a relevant political factor because they could then oppose any law or constitution that could be introduced in Macedonia. Thus, the weight of their vote would have some political significance. Meanwhile, with the percentage they occupy in parliament, they cannot influence the polls and the election process. This election law that is approved or proposed has this in mind -- the Albanians should in no way obtain one-third of the parliament members. [Hajrullahu] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [Xhaferri] You are welcome.
