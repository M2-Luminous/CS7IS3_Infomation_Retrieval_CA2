V.I.: The matter is that a regional council will elect one head, and voters -- one more head, and I understand this is as unsatisfactory to us. There is something alike presidential emissaries in it. And it will cause unnecessary parallelism. We have already had it and the system has not proved to work. For strong power this power must be concentrated with one organ -- regional council. We are worried that the heads of regional councils elected by the direct voting in regions may not volunteer to be subordinate to the Supreme Council. A deputy is elected in electoral district, and a head of regional council -- in the respective region, so the latter may claim to have more powers. VYBIR: What is your forecast as to the elections for the president? V.I.: We were against the post of President, but the election campaign is already going on, and we will support Oleksandr Moroz as we consider he has the best chances. Nowadays people understand that the life has become worse, that is why they hope for us -- communists and socialists. VYBIR: Why was the President's proposal to postpone the elections rejected? V.I.: To wait today with a hope that it will become better in future and connect it with the presidential elections is a mistake. Presently Kravchuk is trying to postpone the elections hoping that the popularity of the left-oriented forces will subside, and his chances will grow. VYBIR: How necessary is it to limit the presidential powers? V.I.: It is necessary to cut them down as much as possible. In general, presidential model hardly suits Ukraine. VYBIR: Thank you.
