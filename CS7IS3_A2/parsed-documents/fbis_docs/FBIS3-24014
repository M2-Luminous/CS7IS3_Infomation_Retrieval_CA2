Young people's social-conflict potential and the basic spheres of conflict development It shouldn't be necessary these days to argue how urgent the problem of social conflicts is. You don't need to be a sociology expert; all you have to do is live in this society to sense a growing mass dissatisfaction, irritation and fatigue, an erosion of values and loss of faith in the future. For at least a year we have felt a foreboding of social disasters and catastrophes, which makes it essential to study and forecast the development of conflicts in society. Of course, our research (the Scientific-Research Institute of Youth Problems Sociology Laboratory, in a representative republic-wide sample, surveyed 1,475 respondents age 15 to 29 in 10 regions of Ukraine) cannot pretend to solve all the problems of social conflicts, especially considering the almost complete lack of conflictological traditions in the old Soviet sociological literature. The authors' goal was not just to analyze the conflict potential of young people, who are the most active social group, and explore the basic spheres of future conflict, but also to ascertain the extent to which the conflicts that are typical of our society are similar to or different from those of civilized democratic societies. This is important in establishing our own national conflictological theory. Our society's crisis is reflected in young people's dissatisfaction with nearly everything--their status in society, material security, and life in general; these are reliable indicators of social conflict. Some young people have adjusted to the situation, but they are not very numerous. Only 27.3 percent are happy with their living conditions, 24.3 percent are happy with the food situation, 13.2 percent are happy with available clothing, 15.9 percent are happy with working conditions, 12.5 percent are happy with recreation facilities, 9.8 percent are happy with medical services, 5.8 percent are happy about the ecology, and 12.3 percent are happy about their security. Only 9.8 percent are happy overall with living conditions, while almost half--44.5 percent--are unhappy (the remainder didn't have an unequivocal answer). Another serious indicator of society's conflict potential is the public's subjective "foreboding" of conflicts. One third of our young respondents thought them possible in the near future, another 12.5 percent think social disturbances could erupt in Ukraine in a year, 13 percent think it could happen in two or three years, 17.1 percent relegate that prospect to the far future, and only 22.2 percent maintain that in principle it is impossible here. Hence, there is a definite syndrome of expectation of conflict in society. Analyzing the concerns of today's youth and the problems that worry them most in the present crisis [Table 1], we conclude that the main sphere of potential conflicts will be the economy, the sphere of material concerns. Problems of human rights, also the ecology, are quite important. The "forcible Ukrainianization" that has been used here and there to scare people, especially in traditionally Russian-speaking areas, does not especially worry young people, any more than a return to the communist past, which is obviously unrealistic. 2. Subjects of conflicts and youth's readiness to take part in protests Who is the "face of the enemy," who personifies the main cause of our troubles, and how strongly is it imprinted in the mass consciousness? The mass media seem to have done everything they can to shape that image. At first, right after the collapse of the Soviet Union, it was the party apparatchik; then, after the restoration of the Ukrainian state, it was the Russian (or disguised local) chauvinist; now the national radicals are named most often. It is a rather specific factor that prompts the search for "the enemy"--namely, the level of material security. It is those who belong to the lowest level of prosperity and have limited food who tend to blame certain social forces, in particular those of a nationalist bent. National radicals are seen as the enemy by 14.9 percent of those who have limited food and 14.9 percent of those who barely make it from payday to payday, but only 4.7 percent of those who can afford anything they want. Great-power chauvinists are blamed by 15.7 percent of persons in the lowest material stratum but only by 6.3 percent of those in the highest. Incompetent careerists in the government are blamed by 37.2 percent in the lowest group and by 26.6 percent in the highest. This is natural, because those who have adjusted to the present difficult economic situation and have pulled themselves up by their bootstraps tend more to rely on themselves, their own efforts, and pay less attention those who are in power or striving for it. Still, representatives of all social, professional, and property groups think that the main cause of potential conflicts is not the schemes of enemies but difficult living conditions, which are also the main cause of social tensions. Young people's social dissatisfaction is reflected directly in their assessment of all links of state authority--legislative, executive, and judicial. The performance of the presidential branch is assessed somewhat more positively. Although representatives of the President were rated positively by only 6.7 percent (versus negatively by 39.9 percent), the President himself was rated positively by 14.5 percent and negatively by 38.8 percent. Hence, the basic subjects of present-day social conflict are the public, on the one hand (in this case, young people), and structures of authority, on the other. Could mass dissatisfaction with the authorities, forebodings of conflict, and a relatively high conflict potential really turn into civil disobedience and political disturbances? The well-known thesis of the particular radicalism of young people and their readiness to engage in open conflict has not been confirmed. It was found, in fact, that young people are even less inclined than other age groups to engage in conflicts. [Table 2] 3. Forecasting conflicts and problems of solving them Young people do not accept but rather condemn violent, extremist forms of protest; they prefer lawful and moderate means [Table 3]. We may predict that the chief kind of struggle will take the form of economic strikes. A greater tendency to use lawful forms of social protest was shown by young people in Kiev, the Republic of Crimea, and the Lvov and Transcarpathia regions, while violent methods are favored by the young people of the Donetsk, Zaporozhye, Odessa, and Kirovograd regions. Strikes are preferred primarily by those in the worker professions, while more radical methods are favored by younger persons who are not working or in college--that is, today's older highschool students; among social groups it is workers of various kinds, and owners. Respondents were asked directly what factors might prompt them to take part in active forms of protest. More than half of them--54.4 percent--are not willing to do so under any conditions. The scenarios were designed to be extreme ones--the disappearance of basic food staples from store shelves, inflation, poverty, rampant crime, and so on. Hence, along with sharp deterioration of the situation in society we find a substantial gap between expectations of conflict and dissatisfaction with various aspects of social and economic life today, on the one hand, and young people's readiness to protest actively against these things, on the other. For young people who can still conceive of factors that might prompt them to take part in acts of protest, the main one is the impossibility of earning a decent living. The best way to prevent youth's conflict potential from turning into active forms of protest, in particular, is to carry out economic reforms that will give young people the chance to solve their most urgent problems--basically, material problems. In our opinion, it is not social protection in the form of miserly social assistance that ought to be the core of youth policy, but instead, prompt reforms toward a market economy in which young people, thanks to their greater mobility, energy, and their ability to upgrade their skills and adjust to new conditions, have a good chance of solving their problems on their own. A major role in averting social conflicts is played by young people's enthusiasm (especially the younger set) for modern arts, in particular movies and music. Unsound policies toward mass culture can only worsen and stimulate social conflict. One important element of a civilized mechanism of resolving conflicts in developed democratic countries is a multi-party system, where parties serve as intermediaries between the public and the state authorities and express the interests of various social groups and strata. The parties are the basic mechanism for institutionalizing conflicts, moving them out of the sphere of possible direct clashes and into parliament. Moreover, parties enable groups to reconcile their interests with those of society's, otherwise a party cannot win in general elections. But besides the fact that our society has yet to form a real multi-party system, this is hindered by young people's political apathy (a trend that has been observed in recent years) and their loss of faith in political parties. Only 3.5 percent of young people now are members of youth associations, and only 1.6 percent belong to political parties. Moreover, 1.1 percent of the respondents reported taking part in events put on in 1993 by Ukraine's youth organizations, and another 2.7 percent took part in a few. We can see, then, that the existence of supposedly numerous youth associations (both political and non-political--for example, the MZhK [unidentified]), for all their apparent vigor, actually involves a rather narrow segment of young people, primarily the leadership apparatus of the organizations. They do not enjoy much support from young people and do not arouse much enthusiasm. Young people still prefer student organizations as well as sport, tourist, and ecological groups. Political youth associations rank in last place on this list, their members numbering only 15.8 percent, and are outranked by religious associations, which 24.1 percent of the respondents called worthwhile. So in the event of conflict relations with the authorities, today's youth associations are hardly likely to be effective advocates of young people's interests. As for the political parties, if the elections had been held last year, only three political forces would have won over 5 percent--Rukh (5.2 percent), the Democratic Party of Ukraine (5.8 percent), and the Greens (6.2 percent). Most of the young people--74.3 percent--could not name their favorite party; 37.7 percent answered that they didn't know which party to vote for; 18.2 percent stated they would not vote for any of the parties, on principle; and another 16.4 percent said they would vote for the candidate, not the party. This can bring it about that if it comes to a conflict, it will not take place in institutionalized forms, where group interests are represented by parties, trade unions, and civic organizations, but in the form of disorderly actions enabling political forces whose interests do not really coincide with those of young people, to use them. But if market reforms are carried out, conflict in society will come more and more to resemble the classic form prevailing in the developed Western countries, namely between rich and poor. Yet it will not be in the nature of inter-class conflict; rather, it will be manifested in pressure on the government by the poorest segments of society to redistribute the social product. A major problem of the conversion to the market will be unemployment, which will be condemned by almost all social groups except the owners. Unlike older groups, young people will not be willing to live on social assistance or be content with low-paying employment.
