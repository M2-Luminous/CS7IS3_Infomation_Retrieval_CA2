As a result, the crusade begun by the authorities has ended in their total defeat. This is the conclusion reached by Alain Labrousse and Alain Vallon, respectively director and coordinator of the geopolitical center on narcotics. Following the murder by the Medellin cartel of the main candidate for the post of Colombian president in 1989, the United States and other Western powers, the authors note, announced a campaign on an unprecedented scale against drugs and against the laundering of capital obtained from their sale. Four years on, however, drugs production in the world has doubled. In the "golden crescent" (Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran), it has leapt from 800 to 2,200 tonnes. It is growing at an even faster pace in the "golden triangle" formed by certain regions of Thailand and Burma. Cocaine production in Latin America has risen from 800 to 1,500 tonnes. Whereas previously only Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru engaged in the drugs trade, now the entire continent has become involved in this lucrative business. Finally, the former Soviet Central Asian republics are becoming an exceptionally important drugs production zone and staging post. Alain Labrousse warned me last year that a great new drugs power is emerging from the ruins of the land of the soviets. It looks as if his prediction is starting to come true. He feels the explanation for the unprecedented drugs boom is that the West has no intention of sacrificing its economic interests in the war on the "white death." For example, 70 percent of heroin enters France from Pakistan, several of whose ministers have been involved in the drugs business. When Francois Mitterrand received the Pakistani premier last year, however, he expressed concern about human rights violations but said absolutely nothing about heroin. This diplomatic silence brought dividends: In September 1992, Pakistan signed a contract with Paris to buy three submarines worth 3.7 billion francs. The same applies to Burma, which French experts describe as the world's main "drugs dictatorship." However, France certainly is not inclined to boycott this country, which is a major producer of opium and therefore of heroin. The petroleum concern Total has signed a contract with the local authorities, who are mixed up in the drugs business. If drugs, as Charles Pasqua, head of the Interior Ministry, rightly points out, are the most terrible scourge in the whole world, why then does France not boycott Morocco, which, on the admission of King Hassan II himself, has 50,000 hectares of hemp? The French experts describe the United States as the "champions of hypocrisy." In order to aid the Nicaraguan Contras, the CIA and the famous Colonel North did not simply cover up the drugs dealing in which the Contras engaged--they actually organized their delivery from Colombia to the United States. Afghanistan deserves special attention. When the Soviet Union was Washington's main enemy, any method of supporting the mujahidin was acceptable. The CIA used the Pakistani special services to supply the Afghan rebels with arms. On the return journey, the trucks carried opium, which was made into heroin at 200 underground laboratories in Pakistan. As a result, opium production in Afghanistan has risen from 200 tonnes to 3,000 tonnes in the last 15 years. The West essentially ignores the serious problem of laundering money obtained from the sale of drugs. The sum is estimated at $300 billion, 90 percent of which is invested in industrially developed states. Labrousse warns that Russian and Italian drugs dealers are beginning to invest their "gains" in the privatization of Russian enterprises. Neither Paris, nor London, nor The Hague is in any hurry to close down banks in Bermuda, Gibraltar, and the Caribbean, where drugs dollars are kept in total safety. For many "Third World" countries, the only possibility of somehow paying for credits lies in the production and sale of drugs. The IMF demands that they pursue such a tough economic policy that they have no choice but to cultivate poppies and hemp or offer their money-laundering services.
