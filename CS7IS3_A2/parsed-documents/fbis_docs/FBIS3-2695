So far more than 12,000 Tibetan children have been enrolled in 86 state-funded secondary schools or classes in 26 provinces and autonomous regions of the country, according to a deputy to the current session of the Eighth National People's Congress. Yang Chuantang, vice-chairman of the Tibet autonomous regional government, said today that more than 1,000 graduates of such schools have returned to work in Tibet and have been playing an important role in the region's economic construction and some have become leaders at various government levels. Moreover, Yang noted, some 500 graduates have been enrolled in universities both in Tibet and in inland areas. Yang said that such a way to get more Tibetan children educated has also greatly eased educational problems in agricultural and pastoral areas of the region where children have difficulties to go to school.
