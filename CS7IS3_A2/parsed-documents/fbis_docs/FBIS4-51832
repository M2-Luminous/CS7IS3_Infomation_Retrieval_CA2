Participating in those events were civic groups and political parties defending the Constitution and those advocating its revision to open the way for collective defense and a greater role in U.N. Peacekeeping operations. Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), which ardently opposes any constitutional amendment expanding the scope of Japan's Self-Defense Forces (SDF), addressed followers in front of the main entrance of Tokyo's Ueno Park. "Some in the new cabinet are arguing that introducing collective defense should be reconsidered, but we owe it to our pacifist Constitution alone that Japan has not participated in a war during the almost 50 years since World War II," Murayama said. Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai have expressed support for legislation to deal with emergencies including possible international sanctions against North Korea for its suspected nuclear weapons development. Prominent constitution experts discussed the pros and cons of a revision at a rally organized by an SDP-affiliated citizens group at Hibiya public hall in the afternoon. Pacifist citizens' groups demonstrated at several places in Tokyo, while representatives of the Buddhist-backed Komeito [Clean Government Party] and the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) delivered speeches in support of the current Constitution in front of Shinjuku Station. Two groups supporting a greater military role for Japan held rallies and panel discussions at different venues in Chiyoda Ward.
