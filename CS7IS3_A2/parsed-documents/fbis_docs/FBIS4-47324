P. Fedosov, Institute of Optico-Neuron Technologies, Russian Academy of Sciences; UDC 621.383-181.48:621.3.049.77] [Abstract] This article obtains analytical expressions for the optical transfer function of a matrix of backlit photodiodes (a ``flip chip''), with a consideration of cross-interactions and the discrete positioning of sensitive matrix elements. A method of solving the problem of converting the spatial frequencies of an optical image with a multi-element photoreceptor matrix is developed. The method is based on construction of an effect function. Figures 2; references 3 (Russian).
