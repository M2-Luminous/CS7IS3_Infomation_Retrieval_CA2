SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping told journalists in Berlin on 24 May that the Bonn coalition had only had an interest in "demonstrating power" in this connection. The selection of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] candidate was not marked by the will to find the best president for the Germans, "but by Helmut Kohl's power policy calculation." He said the SPD was in agreement with most Germans that Johannes Rau would have been the better choice. The SPD chairman said the SPD would cooperate loyally with the new head of state. However, the Social Democrats expected Herzog to conduct his office "in an absolutely impartial way" and to orient himself at the line pursued by his predecessor, Richard von Weizsaecker. His first official speech on Monday evening [23 May] had, however, failed to create this impression, said Scharping. The SPD chief also sharply criticized the FDP. By their attitude in the Federal Convention, they had abandoned their role as an independent political force. What they presented as loyalty to the coalition, was complete subjugation, said Scharping. It was typical for FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel to virtually have to ask for a vote of confidence, in order to push through his line. Despite his defeat, Johannes Rau had met with broad support in the Federal Convention and above all from the people. The SPD would make use of this impetus for the upcoming elections and would make the European elections in three weeks a "fourth ballot," said Scharping.
