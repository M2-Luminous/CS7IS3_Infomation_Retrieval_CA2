Defense Minister Datuk Sri Najib Tun Razak said the media should see the injustice that prevails there, namely the continued arms embargo faced by the Bosnians, while Serb terrorists continue to receive arms from Belgrade. This is the current injustice the Bosnians face and the media must fight against it. The minister was speaking to reporters after he met local UMNO [United Malays National Organization] leaders in Johor Baharu today. He was commenting on a CNN report, the effect of which was that Malaysia had been providing arms to Bosnia. The minister also reiterated Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir's denial of the report. He said he could not understand why CNN carried the incorrect report. He added that 50 million ringgit has been allocated to upgrade military camps nationwide.
