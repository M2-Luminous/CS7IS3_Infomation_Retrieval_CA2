At a news conference it was said that: This publication is very likely to have been ordered and inspired by those who are interested in introducing additional complications into the negotiations that are likely to be started between the two states on the issues of nuclear weapons, and a search for mutually acceptable decisions on a parity basis, taking into account mutual benefits. Zhukeyev voiced the opinion that the Russian military and industrial complex can be such a party, because it aims at enhancing its influence on the elaboration of the policy in the corridors of power of the Russian Federation and wants to take upon itself individual decision-making, though it has succeeded in this too much already. It practically has disavowed the agreement between the CIS nuclear states about mutual control over nuclear stocks, and the strategic designation troops are completely under the Russian military leadership's command. The state adviser said further: Probably, the fact that Kazakhstan has suspended the export of intercontinental ballistic missiles, which has been done entirely through Kazakhstan's own goodwill, is causing this displeasure among certain forces. [passage omitted] Zhukeyev said: It makes us think that the Russian military and industrial complex is counting on the possibility that the world community would apply additional pressure on Kazakhstan in connection with the nuclear weapons problem.
