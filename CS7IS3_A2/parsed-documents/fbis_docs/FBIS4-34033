Take the case of a robbery at the enterprise supplying sugarcane harvesters that was reviewed by the Fourth Havana Provincial Court. The chief custodian testified that he realized only on Sunday morning that the storehouse had been robbed of merchandise in high demand, including ballpoints, brake fluid, battery acid, work boots, and work clothes for the sugarcane workers. The defendant testified that he had found the key to the storehouse, opened it, entered, and took all he could. The custodian who testified said he had trouble seeing what was going on because he was at the other station, 200 meters away. The stolen material was listed at the trial, and everything was recovered. Meanwhile, authorities at the same storehouse have come up 17,000 pesos short of goods during their inventory. The investigating authorities are trying to pinpoint what is missing. It is important to note that while the robbery led to the defendant's appearance before the judge even though the stolen merchandise was recovered, the shortage involving thousands of pesos is merely being investigated. I mention this because today's TRABAJADORES editorial insists that our country's so-called undergound economy thrives on state-owned merchandise and that the stolen merchandise ends up on the black market. The two situations violate the law in the same way. Yet, which do you consider more important to society, if we recall that life is the law and the law is life?
