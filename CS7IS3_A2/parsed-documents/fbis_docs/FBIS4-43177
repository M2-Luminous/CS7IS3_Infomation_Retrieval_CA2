The clearest support for Swedish membership is found in Scania. On that point the opinion polls have been unequivocal so far. It is therefore not a coincidence that the EU opponents have chosen to flex their muscles precisely in Lund; yesterday they presented their message during a demonstration, and their top figure and Scanian Per Gahrton gave a speech. During the ongoing No to EU weekend, SVENSKA DAGBLADET went to Landskrona to feel which way the EU wind is blowing. Landskrona -- In June the ferries will resume crossing Oresund between Landskrona and Copenhagen, and for the first time in several years Landskrona residents will be able to take a return trip to Denmark in about an hour. The municipality has stepped in as a guarantor for the traffic, since it is hoped that Danes will be enticed to come and live on the Swedish side of the sound. Already 50 Danish families have found a home in the little Scanian town where rents and taxes are lower than in Denmark. The nonsocialist municipal government, which took over in the last election from the Social Democrats who had governed the municipal district for 70 years with simple majorities, is working with determination to tie Landskrona more tightly to Europe. "EU is a future opportunity for Landskrona, and membership could help us solve some of our problems," explains municipal councillor Inga Jansson, Liberal Party. Has Had a Difficult Time The once so prosperous industrial city of Landskrona has had a difficult time in recent years. The high unemployment began with the shipyard crisis in the 1980's. Oresundsvarvet was shut down and 3,000 employees were laid off. It was a hard blow for a municipal region of 30,000 to lose that many jobs in one blow. Other industrial enterprises followed suit and unemployment rose. But after a long period of pessimism, life is beginning to brighten for the municipality. The shipyard is operating once again on a small scale; a new industrial area is growing up along the E6 highway; Landskrona BOIS [football club] has managed to climb into the all-Swedish league after many years; and the Strandpaviljongen dance restaurant, which burned down last year, has been rebuilt. The interesting Skanska Teatern recently went bankrupt, to be sure, but it is hoped that the activity can be reconstructed. And -- as was mentioned -- the ferries are beginning to operate again. Vision of Orestad But another push forward is needed; unemployment is still high and the belief in the future is badly dented. The municipal politicians and the employers' association are hoping that an EU membership will supply the longed-for miracle. Down by the beach, with the back toward Landskrona castle, built by Christian III in 1549 at the time Landskrona was still Danish, and with the eyes aimed at Oresund, this area near Denmark is tangible. The houses of Copenhagen are visible and the old vision about an Orestad, which was to link Copenhagen, Malmo, and the municipal regions around them, does not feel strange. But now Landskrona's politicians are aiming more toward becoming a vital part of the Scania-Sealand region. The EU has a positive attitude toward regional cooperation, and in Scania many are convinced that Scania-Sealand will be able to compete with other European regions. [passage omitted] But his criticism is more serious than that. He fears the EU will mean that the rest of the world is closed off from Europe. "We should trade with the whole world." He does not believe that the Scanians are more favorable toward the EU because of their vicinity to Denmark: "Mind you, it has been 10 years since I have been to Denmark. Sure, I have taken trips, gone back and forth with the boat across the sound and had a beer and a little food. But I have not gone ashore in 10 years." On a ladder leaning against one of the beautiful stone houses on Queen Street stands Lars Persson cleaning windows. He is one of those favoring membership in the EU opinion polls. "Even if there is a lot of nonsense with the EU, we have to belong. Sweden cannot close itself off," in his opinion. Retirees Tora Persson and Greta Svensson are walking down by the harbor, on their way to take the boat to Ven for a day trip and a picnic. That is something the two friends have done each spring for the last 20 years. The short boat trip is "just right for us landlubbers." They say that they have actually taken a little EU course, but they do not think they learned much from it. Nevertheless, the outcome was that EU membership is inevitable. "We must probably participate. A country as small as Sweden cannot manage otherwise," says Tora Persson. Greta Svensson has not detected any brightening for Landskrona. It is only the municipal politicians who want it to look that way, she believes.
