The expectations that the Serbs would stop their artillery attacks on the city because of that was naive, since they have had encouraging experiences with the United Nations and the Western powers. They have waged their war of conquest since 1991. Only at the beginning of 1994 did the United Nations and NATO decide to take action; four Serbian planes were shot down. But that was not a sign to the aggressor that if he does not stop the war, he will be forced to do that. Rather, this was only a sanction because the Serbs had ignored the no-fly zone. The bombs last Sunday evening were dropped to protect the UN observers in Gorazde, which had been bombed to rubble by Serbian artillery. The matter can be presented in such a way that the observers were sent to protect the people, which means that protecting the blue helmets also means protecting the civilian population. The Serbian leadership, however, must feel encouraged that the United Nations still did not want to explain a minor, symbolic intervention with the intention to put an end to the Serbian massacres. It did not even take a day for the Serbian artillery to start shooting at Gorazde again. Now, it is as if the United Nations and the Western powers were awakening from their self-hypnotized sleep. They see that further action is necessary. But what can be done now since the Serbs in Bosnia have practically achieved their war goal? There is still help for Gorazde, but it is probably too late for Bosnia. President Milosevic in Belgrade is complaining about losing the illusion that the community of states is neutral in Bosnia. This was not an illusion, it was reality. So far, the United Nations and the Western powers watched the Serbian war as neutrals between aggressor and victims. However, it was a limping neutrality; the arms embargo against Croatia and Bosnia made the war of conquest even easier to Serbia, which is far superior anyway. At a late time, the civilized world is now nerving itself up to intervening haltingly. However, it cannot make good what it missed at the beginning of the war.
