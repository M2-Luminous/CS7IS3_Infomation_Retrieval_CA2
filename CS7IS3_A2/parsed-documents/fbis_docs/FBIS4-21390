The World Bank has allocated $320,000 to elaborate an investment plan for cleaning the Poti and Batumi shorelines (the construction of new water and sewage works and the reconstruction of old ones and the liquidation of heaps of toxic waste that constitute a danger to the environment). "The water treatment plants in the cities of Poti and Batumi are currently not in operation. The regions adjoining these towns are claiming the status of ecological disaster zones," stated Zurab Nogaideli, chairman of the Commission for the Protection of the Environment. According to Nogaideli, a minimum of $10-15 million will be needed in order to implement the projects aimed at cleaning the Black Sea coastline in the regions of Batumi and Poti.
