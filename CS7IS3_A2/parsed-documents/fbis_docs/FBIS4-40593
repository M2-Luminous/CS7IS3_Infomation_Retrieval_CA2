The stir about diplomat-spies was caused by misinterpretation," head of the Federal Counterintelligence Service's public relations center Aleksandr Mikhailov told ITAR-TASS today commenting on media reports about the expel of North Korean Embassy staffers from Moscow. In the words of Mikhailov, currently on a Far Eastern trip together with service head Sergey Stepashin, the latter has noted the recently-boosted intelligence activities of some secret services, including those of North Korea, China and Japan. Stepashin thinks a reason for this is the location of Russian nuclear-powered submarine fleet in the region. As for the North Korean diplomats expelled for the attempts to purchase materiel, it was really so, said Mikhailov. The Russian counterintelligence, intelligence and border guards held an operation to prevent drug trafficking from the DPRK to Russia before the arrival of Stepashin in the Far East. Some could mix the two events which resulted in misunderstanding, said Mikhailov.
