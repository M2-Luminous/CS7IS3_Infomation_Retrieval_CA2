FBIS4-45192 "jptdd023__l94036" JPRS-TDD-94-023-L JPRS Narcotics 27 April 1994 LATIN AMERICA MEXICO Two-Thirds of Accused Facing Drug Charges During Past Five Two-Thirds of Accused Facing Drug Charges During Past Five Years Reportedly Released 94WB0038B Mexico City EXCELSIOR in Spanish 27 Apr 94 pp 4-A, 34-A 94WB0038B Mexico City EXCELSIOR Spanish CSO [Article by Rafael Medina Cruz] [Excerpts] Over 45,000 warrants for arrest, rearrest, presentation, and appearance before federal courts, including those issued against drug traffickers, tax evaders, defrauders, and ex-civil servants, are still awaiting implementation by Federal Judicial Police [PJF] agents. Moreover, during this administration, the Attorney General's Office [PGR] has remanded to district judges of criminal proceedings over 90,000 persons involved in crimes against health, at least 60,000 of whom have been released. Based on reports provided by the PGR, it was learned that no fewer than 45,000 court orders issued against traffickers and killers, including Luis Hector Palma Salazar, aka "El Guero," Amado Carrillo Fuentes, Juan Garcia Abrego, and the Arellano brothers, Francisco, Ramon, Javier, and Benjamin, have not been implemented by the PJF. This is said to have "unquestionably fostered the atmosphere of violence and insecurity being experienced in the majority of the country's federative states." Agents from that department assigned to the Arrests Directorate maintained that the delay in implementing orders for arrest, rearrest, appearance, and presentation "has declined considerably." Observing that it was reduced as much as 50 percent within the past two years, they nevertheless admit that the number of unfulfilled orders "may still be considered large." Among those yet to be implemented are warrants relating not only to drug traffickers, but also to ex-civil servants who took advantage of their positions to gain large sums of money. [passage omitted] The investigative agents acknowledged that the lack of personnel, as well as the limits imposed on them, "play a major role in the possible deficiencies occurring in the implementation of court orders. Therefore, efforts must be redoubled to end the delay." The Federal Judicial Police agents themselves expressed the view that the Attorney General's Office high command, which is aware of the delay, should order an increase in the number of personnel to implement those warrants. They remarked that it should not divert personnel to "pursue those selling counterfeit video and audio cassettes," a task that they claim might well be performed by crime prevention police under orders from the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office. Moreover, investigations conducted in the PGR itself and in the courts reveal that, during the past five years, the social representative's office has remanded to district judges throughout the country some 90,000 persons presumed guilty of crimes against health. At least 60,000 of them have regained their freedom. It is believed that the release of those implicated in crimes against health has been due to deficiencies in completing the preliminary investigations. It was also found that a large percentage of the orders not yet implemented by the PJF have been issued against criminals who were released after having been remanded, in whose cases the judges failed to find evidence of guilt.
