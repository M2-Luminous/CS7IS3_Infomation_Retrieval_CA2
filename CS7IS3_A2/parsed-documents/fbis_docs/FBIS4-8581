The current cabinet has included "their shoe sizes" in many economic accounts, he said. For the first quarter of this year personal consumption as well as investment grew, prices stabilized and gross domestic product also grew against the same period last year, he added. Kozlik described as confrontational the program of Moravcik's government and asked whether the current premier who formed the government as a non-confrontational one, was not "under the pressure of an artificially created opposition." Commenting on rumors about the possible withdrawal of further deputies from the HZDS deputies' group Kozlik said that he "could not see into deputies' mind." However, the deputies' group apart, the HZDS was the most stable political party in Slovakia, Kozlik said. Spokesman for the shadow cabinet Ondrej Hanko attacked Moravcik's government for its interference in the media and for exerting pressure on it. SNS Chairman Jozef Prokes said with regard to the pro-Meciar daily REPUBLIKA published by the state-owned Slovak news Agency TA SR, that there should exist a daily criticizing the government no matter who published it. "Because there where no criticism exists, objectivity ends," he added. Asked by CTK whether the state should finance the publishing of REPUBLIKA Kozlik said: "It does not have to but it can."
