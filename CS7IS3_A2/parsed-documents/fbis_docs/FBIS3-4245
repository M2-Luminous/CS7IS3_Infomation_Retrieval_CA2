This leader also said: We welcome foreign investment in the technical transformation of old enterprises and in infrastructural projects, but a project may not get underway until it is examined and approved according to required procedures following a rational evaluation of state property by a state-acknowledged appraisal institution, and after the financial authorities and state property management authorities have reviewed and confirmed the results. Promising a fixed investment-recovery rate without authorization is not permitted. The State Council has made it clear that in the future, it is necessary to strengthen guidance for foreign investments through industrial policies; to continue to encourage foreign investment in projects in infrastructure, basic industries, high- and new-technology industries, and the technical transformation of old enterprises; and to encourage the establishment of export-oriented enterprises. It is especially necessary to try to attract large enterprises and multinational companies to invest and set up high- and new-technology projects in China, and to open the domestic market to them selectively and to an appropriate degree. Such projects as automotive assembly and exclusive apartments, vacation villages, and deluxe recreational facilities which exceed the actual demand should be curtailed. Projects that cause a high level of pollution, require a high level of material consumption, and endanger the ecosystem and people's physical and mental health must be sternly forbidden. Retailers partnering foreign enterprises must emphasize balance of import and export and balance of payments in foreign currencies. As this is quite a sensitive field, in which we lack experience, prior approval must be obtained for pilot operations, so as to to accumulate experience and improve relevant laws and regulations before gradual expansion. At present, attention must be focused on introducing experience in the operation and management of chain stores abroad, so as to activate the production and export of China's convenience articles and raise the standards of commercial management and service. In other fields of opening up where experience is also lacking, pilot operations are also necessary before gradual popularization. The joint-venture projects in the tertiary industry to be set up now should concentrate on fields that directly serve production. This year, China will continue to let special economic zones and the Shanghai Pudong New Zone act as pacesetters in the reform and opening up; encourage these places and coastal open areas to create a better investment environment; accelerate the upgrading of products; and concentrate energies on developing high- and new-technology industries and fund- and technology-intensive tertiary industries. In order to gradually narrow the gap between the eastern and western regions in economic development, China will make a point of giving more support to the central and western regions in the use of foreign investment to exploit and utilize resources. As for the development zone rush in recent years, the central authorities also have come to see a clearer picture in the process of adjustment and rectification. The construction of development zones should follow the principle of overall planning, rational layout, acting according to capabilities, gradual development, overcoming blindness, and raising the efficiency of development. It is necessary to make a conscientious effort to run well the economic and technological development zones and bonded zones that have been approved. For setting up new development zones and bonded zones, it is necessary to conduct feasibility studies well and to secure approval according to the required procedures. Development zones that have been set up with approval should concentrate on high- and new-technology and export-oriented projects, integrate with the adjustment of industrial structure and the transformation of old urban areas and old enterprises, and integrate with the adjustment of industrial structure and product mix. It is necessary to avoid the practice of neglecting the transformation of old urban areas and old enterprises and setting up large numbers of new concerns in the development zones. Development zones should depend mainly on a well-developed and healthy investment environment to attract foreign investors, and may not formulate their own preferential policies at the expense of national interests.
