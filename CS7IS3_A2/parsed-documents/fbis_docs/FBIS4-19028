The announcement by the European Commission followed Greece's failure to lift the blockade, imposed on February 16, after the EU executive decided on April 6 to go to court unless the embargo was ended within a week. It was the first time that the European Union has taken a member country to court over an action which a member claimed was a response to a security threat. On February 16 Greece blocked all Macedonian trade through the northern Greek port of Salonika, which handles most of the Macedonia's imports and exports. Athens maintains that Macedonia robbed its name from the neighbouring northern Greece province of Macedonia. It says this, plus the use of an ancient Greek sun symbol in the Macedonian flag and a reference in its constitution to liberating enslaved Macedonia, implies territorial ambitions on the northern Greek province. The Commission objected because it said the embargo blocked trade of other EU countries with Macedonia, and could not be justified on the grounds that Macedonian actions had created international tension and the threat of war. The Commission is hoping that the ECJ will quickly issue a temporary order that Greece should lift the embargo pending the court's decision on its legality.
