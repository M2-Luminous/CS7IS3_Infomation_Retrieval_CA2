According to Kucherenko, the meeting focused on "the protection and security of a human being" as a new conceptual problem for Ukraine. Kucherenko quotes Deputy Internal Affairs Minister Yuriy Kravchenko as saying that, although no drastic increase in criminal activity occurred in Ukraine and there was even a tendency toward a declining crime rate, the one phenomenon that was "acquiring a bloody character" was contract killing with the use of firearms--the number of which has increased three-fold. Kucherenko says that the situation was particularly serious in Crimea and that, according to Kravchenko, even while the rate of crime detection has risen by 14 percent, the murder of militiamen has become more frequent, and a disproportionately small number of criminals have been convicted for this crime. Kucherenko says that both Ukrainian Justice Minister Vasyl Onopenko and Security Service chief Yevhen Marchuk criticized Ukraine's criminal law and insisted that, in particular, the law should be amended to apply the death penalty for the murder of militiamen. Kucherenko then quotes Viktor Medvedchuk, president of Ukraine's Lawyers Union, as saying that 25,000 people had disappeared in Ukraine in 1993. Kucherenko also describes Procurator General Vladyslav Datsyuk's address to the meeting as "quite expressive." According to Kucherenko, Datsyuk says: What we have is arbitrariness, rather than law; he says that there are delays in the handling of cases by the courts, isolation cells are overcrowded, people are taking turns sleeping, and there is not enough food for them. Datsyuk is quoted as saying that, at the same time, some "leading Mafiosi have now become real dollar millionaires." Kucherenko reports on President Kravchuk's address to the meeting and follows with a recording of Kravchuk's remarks. Kravchuk says: "Today we can say that our citizens--the citizens of Ukraine, the citizens of the state that exists, that is in the making--are not protected in full measure and cannot exercise their vital human rights and freedoms in full measure. I believe this is true. When we are talking about all those things that have been mentioned here today, however, we proceed from the basic principle that the life of an individual is secure. That is to say, there is peace, accord, and there are no encroachments on the most valuable thing--life. "On the one hand, we see the existing difficulties; on the other hand, we see that there is a possibility for an individual to feel he is not in a state of emergency. Many other such examples could be mentioned. However, I agree with what has been said here. This was said by the chief of the Security Service and by Vladyslav Datsyuk [word indistinct]. It is clear that the challenge has been launched, and now we cannot evade this. We have to respond to war with war. We should not be afraid of this terminology. That is to say, I formulate [word indistinct] as follows: not a state of emergency, but emergency measures to fight the criminal world--emergency measures built on law, on enforceable enactments. "This is why it is necessary to urgently submit such a package of documents--for example, on the initiative of the president--at least so they can be considered as soon as possible by the Supreme Council. However, we should immediately do what we can do on the basis of the already existing laws and the existing decrees. This includes both preventive detentions and the genuine protection, first and foremost, of employees of law enforcement bodies and other individuals who perform protective functions under the law. "This does not mean that we will encroach on some rights and freedoms of either an individual or groups of individuals while taking emergency measures. We will protect the rights and freedoms of the largest, the most representative, group of people who suffer as a result of impudence, armed attacks, and just [word indistinct] cruelty on the part of various wild--I say this without any exaggeration--formations and criminal groups. I believe we have the grounds to do it exactly this way." Kucherenko then reports that Kravchuk also reminded the meeting it became possible to prevent reprisals against the Communist Party and some of its leaders after the abortive August putsch of 1991 in Moscow. She reports that Kravchuk said that threats can be heard today from left-wing forces wishing to square accounts with their opponents, and they speak openly about concentration camps and crematoria. Kravchuk says very little is required to return to those times.
