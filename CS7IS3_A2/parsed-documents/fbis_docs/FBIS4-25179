It has made significant progress in developing the vast natural gas reserves in the western part of the South China Sea. Development and construction is being undertaken simultaneously offshore and on land, with well-drilling ships working day and night on the vast Beibuwan waters, a region that has become a principal battleground for China's natural gas exploration and development. Repeated evidence from Chinese and foreign experts indicate rich natural gas resources in Yingge Hai and Hainan's southeast basin, with reserves reaching 1.344 billion [as received] cubic meters [cu m], or about one-third of China's total natural gas resources. Of this total, about 2.5-3 trillion [as received] cu m are resources with economic value. The development of this vast natural gas reserves area is significant to altering the energy structure and alleviating energy shortages in the south as well as quickening economic construction in the southeast coastal regions. Since reform and opening up, the Nanhai West Oil Corporation of the CNOOC has signed 21 contracts and agreements with 26 oil companies from 10 countries to utilize foreign funds and advanced technology and equipment, thereby quickening the pace of exploring offshore oil and natural gas fields. By the end of last year, $956 million had been utilized. Meanwhile, through foreign cooperation, the company has trained a group of scientific and technological teams capable of exploring and developing offshore oil and natural gas fields independently in line with international practice and standards. The new discovery of natural gas reserves in the western part of the southern sea has interested many foreign oil companies. Since 1992, the corporation has signed five new contracts with ARCO Corporation, Crestone Corporation, and Esso Corporation of the United States to explore natural gas fields. While quickening exploration in the vast natural gas reserves region, China is now carrying out large-scale development and construction of the vast Ya 13-1 natural gas field project with ARCO Corporation and Kuwait Foreign Oil Exploration Corporation, with a total investment of $1.16 billion. According to the agreement, 2.9 billion cu m of natural gas will be supplied to Hong Kong annually via submarine pipelines for 20 years beginning 1 January 1996, while 500 million cu m of natural gas will be supplied to Hainan Province annually. Since the beginning of this year, operating contractors formed by Italy's (Shipeng) Ocean Engineering Corporation and the European Ocean Engineering Transnational Corporation used an advanced submarine-pipe-laying ship to lay over 700 km of 28-in diameter submarine pipelines from the Zhu Jiang estuary to Yingge Hai, and plan to complete the laying of over 70 km of submarine pipeline from the Zhu Jiang estuary to Hong Kong's receiving port in August. The 800-km long trunk pipeline is Asia's longest submarine gas pipeline. Further, the construction of a 14-in, 100-km submarine gas pipeline from the platform at Yingge Hai to Hainan's Sanya City began at the beginning of this month. According to plans, reserves of 550-700 billion cu m of natural gas and 240 million tonnes of crude oil will be added in the vast natural gas reserves area in 15 years. By the end of this century, an annual production capability for 10 billion cu m of natural gas and 1 million tonnes of crude oil will be developed.
