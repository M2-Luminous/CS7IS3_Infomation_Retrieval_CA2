Speaking to the business roundtable, an influential group of U.S. business executives, the U.S. president complained that Washington is "too partisan, too negative, too obsessed with process and conflict." The atmosphere still has been more hostile to change than he had imagined it would be, Clinton said, adding that the American people desperately wanted change, but U.S. Congress and business are often unwilling to listen to them. Seventeen months in office, Clinton said that he was still surprised by the opposition he has faced. The business roundtable has endorsed a less ambitious health care reform plan than the one Clinton has suggested. The President's version is now stuck in U.S. Congress. Facing predictions that Congress won't be able to enact universal coverage this year, Clinton said, "I refuse to declare defeat... let us not walk away." Just before Clinton spoke, another Democrat on the pivotal Senate Finance Committee, Bill Bradley of New Jersey, backed away from the employer-mandate that is a central ingredient of the President's plan and floated a proposal to substitute an individual mandate instead. Senate majority leader George Mitchell told the committee it would be mid-July before a bill could come to the floor. The U.S. president used his speech to the business roundtable to seek support also for his proposals to overhaul the welfare system, job-training programs and to win passage of major trade legislation.
