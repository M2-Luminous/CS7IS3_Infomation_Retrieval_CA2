Is Only Their Blood Sacred? A single individual committed a massacre, and an entire country went down on its knees asking for forgiveness. One person committed a horrendous crime, and each one of us feels the blood on his hands. When it comes to pogroms, we -- the experienced victims -- know all there is to know about them. When the government asks for the forgiveness of the families, the Palestinian nation, and the whole world, it really represents every Israeli citizen. We, however, do not make do with a stately, official apology and a willingness to compensate the victims' families. Public figures -- the chief rabbi, the president of the state, cabinet ministers, delegations, party representatives -- extended their condolences in person. It seems to me that this has gone as far as to be groveling. Although only one person committed the act, and although the situation could have been reversed, it is good that the Israelis, as individuals and as a collective, feel the need to apologize. So what is bothering me? I am disturbed by the fact that in the dozens of years in which Arabs have been slaughtering innocent Jews -- the Shafrir children (1956), the children of Avivim, the Munich athletes, the Coastal Road victims, the worshipers at the Istanbul and Paris synagogues, the passengers of planes and buses; all those innocent old men, women, and children who were shot, stabbed, slaughtered, and blown up in their homes, in market places, and while walking down a street -- not a single Arab has asked for our forgiveness. How could it be that through all those years there was not a single Arab on the other side -- leader, professor, spiritual leader, Arab "Peace Now" activist -- who expressed remorse for the murder of innocent Jews? Is their blood more sacred than ours? 2. Waiting for Slaughter Our asking for forgiveness may be good for our conscience and our international image, but I doubt that it will in any way change the Arabs' deep feeling of hatred for Jews. What transpired in the Israeli Arab sector will be dwarfed by the events that will take place when the closures and curfews imposed on the territories are lifted. Brace yourselves for bloody riots and a series of acts of revenge. We live in a part of the world where blood vengeance is the way to settle accounts. We must be prepared for a series of attacks against Jews. It is no accident that the authors of the Oslo agreement walk around with ashen faces these days. Suddenly it has become apparent that the conflict is twofold: political and religious. While we are handling the political aspect of the conflict, the abyss between the fanatics of both religions is widening. Arab statesmen are willing to recognize the existence of Israel. The problem is that the Muslim movements recognize neither Israel nor the Arab statesmen who do. Perhaps a major act of revenge -- something like a massacre in a synagogue -- will allow the resumption of the talks. Nevertheless, as long as the Islamic movement on the other side and the religious zealots on our side set the tone, peace will never come anywhere near being a profitable enterprise. 3. Is Yafo Burning? The U.S. State Department travel advisory recommending that U.S. citizens refrain from entering Nazareth and Yafo is surprising and annoying. I suggest that the U.S. Administration start showing concern for the wellbeing of Americans in Washington D.C., New York, and Detroit -- the main centers of violence in the United States -- before it fans the flames here and kills our tourism season. Yafo is not burning yet, but what took place among the Arab residents there is a time bomb. I must admit that I did not know they hate us that much there, that so much hatred has accumulated there. No one had expected the Israeli Arabs to be Zionists. It is only natural that they stage demonstration in sympathy for their brethren across the Green Line. But the fact that they smashed windows of Jewish shops, overturned and burned cars, threw rocks at the police, hoisted Palestinian flags, and chanted PLO slogans and songs of revenge against Jews -- and not just one day, but for four consecutive days -- calls for the following question: Do these Israeli citizens regard themselves part of the future Palestinian entity? One could even consider exchanging populations: bring in the settlers, and allow the Israeli Arabs join their brothers in the territories. After all, the idea of driving to Yafo for a seafood dinner only to find that your car has been gutted is not very appealing in the long run. It is enough that we are on the verge of a state-wide civil war; we do not need war between residents of central Israel in the heart of Tel Aviv. 4. And Now, a Defense Minister Yitzhaq Rabin -- prime minister, health minister, religious affairs minister, and interior minister -- is yet to regret that he also held on to the defense portfolio. The commission of inquiry, headed by Me'ir Shamgar, will most probably work along the lines of the letter of appointment it was issued. Coming from a security background of 20 years of Army service, Shamgar will most probably stay within the restricted limits he was given. He may stop at the sentry, the major, or the brigade commander. Such commissions of inquiry, however, have a vitality of their own, even after they end their work and disband. Such commissions may stop at a certain point, but the conclusions they reach keep growing branches and treetops. The Agranat Commission [which investigated the Yom Kippur War] stopped with the chief of staff, but after the commission broke up, the public ruled that the defense minister and the prime minister were to blame. Even if the current commission does not go as far as the defense minister, we will not be surprised if he finds himself in the shadow of his ministerial responsibility. Also, the stages of the arrangement with the Palestinians will be very complex because of the security arrangements, and so closely linked with clashes with the Jewish settlers and Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], that we will not only need a full-time prime minister; we will also need a full-time defense minister. Rabin had better part with the role he loves so much, and appoint a defense minister at this time to cut the link between the moves called for now and the Shamgar commission conclusions. 5. Home Alone Stopping the talks was an idiotic move by Yasir 'Arafat. Perhaps he wants to calm spirits in the territories, and perhaps he is waiting for a "counter massacre" which will allow him to return to the talks on a seemingly equal basis. Luckily for him, Rabin believes that when terror acts take place, the dialogue process must be accelerated because if we stop the talks after every painful attack, we will get nowhere. I hope 'Arafat is not serious in his demand that the Document of Principles be reopened; or in his call for an international force to be stationed in the territories; or in his demand that we agree to begin discussing the uprooting of the settlements and disarming the settlers as a precondition for his returning to the talks. Rabin does not accept any of the changes -- not because he does not want to, but because he cannot do this with the minority-based government he is heading. 'Arafat is also wrong in expecting a deeper U.S. involvement in the political process. The days of the Nixon-Kissinger, Carter-Vance, Reagan-Shultz, Bush-Baker point-by-point involvement are gone. Clinton only cares for the United States and so far, the administration has shown no desire to step in with both its feet into our swamp. There seems to be no strong secretary of state in sight who could push us to deal with our affairs. 'Arafat has no alternative: He and Rabin were left home alone.
