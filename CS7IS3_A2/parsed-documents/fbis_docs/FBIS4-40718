After negotiations at the NATO Brussels headquarters, Von Moltke told correspondents that the Russian-NATO cooperation is on a good path. In his turn, Churkin added that the negotiations on a broad range of issues were useful. Neither of them specified what progress has been achieved. In the words of Von Moltke, permanent representatives of NATO member-state in the rank of ambassadors will study the results of his negotiations with Churkin on Monday, and Churkin will hold consultations with his government. Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev is expected to sign a framework document of the NATO Partnership for Peace program on Monday. It is so far unclear whether the sides will adopt a bilateral document which, in the opinion of Russia, should provide for a broader political dialogue between Russia and NATO with due account of the Russian scale, the role in international affairs and the nuclear status. NATO recognizes the Russian right to special attitude but wants to hold this broader dialogue on the informal basis outside the partnership program that is equal for all.
