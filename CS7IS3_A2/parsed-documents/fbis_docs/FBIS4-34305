[Begin De Leon recording] We addressed a note to him expressing our concern regarding the agreements reached during GATT's Uruguay Round on 15 April, whereby the U.S. Government would apply a tariff on its beef imports. In our note, we pointed out that this decision would have a negative effect on economic reactivation and the consolidation of stability in our countries. For this reason, we emphasized in our note that the current concept of economic development and the United States' new foreign policy in Central America emphasize trade more than they do aid. We told President Clinton that, to be consistent with this policy, CBI benefits should continue to cover all of our beef exports without volume limitations, because, as we all know, cattle raising in Latin America plays a very important role in economic reactivation, job creation, and, of course, exports. We expect a favorable answer to this request. [end recording]
