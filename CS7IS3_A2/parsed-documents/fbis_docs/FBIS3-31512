After Thursday's [17 February] failure of the opposition to assert holding early elections in November, SDL Chairman Peter Weiss expressed doubts that a possible new government would enjoy stable support of a majority of deputies. The SDL is evidently reluctant to assume responsibility for the mistakes of Premier Vladimir Meciar's cabinet which the new government would have to be tackling until the early elections, some observers say.
