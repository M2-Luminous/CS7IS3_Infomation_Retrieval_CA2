FR941020-0-00048 FR941020-0-00015 40 CFR Part 272 [FRL&hyph;5076&hyph;8] Hazardous Waste Management Program: Incorporation by Reference of Approved State Hazardous Waste Program for Arizona AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Immediate final rule. SUMMARY: Under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended (RCRA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) may grant final authorization to States to operate their hazardous waste management programs in lieu of the Federal program. EPA uses Title 40, part 272 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) to provide notice of the authorization status of State programs, and to incorporate by reference those provisions of the State statutes and regulations that EPA will enforce under RCRA section 3008. EPA intends to incorporate by reference the Arizona authorized State program in 40 CFR part 272. EFFECTIVE DATES: This document will be effective December 19, 1994, unless EPA publishes a prior Federal Register (FR) action withdrawing this immediate final rule. All comments on this action must be received by close of business November 21, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain Arizona statutes and regulations was approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of December 19, 1994, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be sent to April Katsura, U.S. EPA Region IX (H&hyph;2&hyph;2), 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, California 94105, (415) 744&hyph;2030. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: April Katsura, U.S. EPA Region IX (H&hyph;2&hyph;2), 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, California 94105, (415) 744&hyph;2030. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Section 3006 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926 et seq. , allows EPA to authorize State hazardous waste programs to operate in the State in lieu of the Federal hazardous waste program. The purpose of today's Federal Register notice is to incorporate EPA's approval of Arizona's base hazardous waste management program and its revisions into 40 CFR part 272. On November 20, 1985, EPA published a Federal Register notice announcing its decision to grant final authorization for the RCRA base program to Arizona (see 50 FR 47736). Effective October 7, 1991 (see 56 FR 37290), September 11, 1992 (see 57 FR 30905 and 57 FR 41699), January 22, 1993 (see 57 FR 54932), and December 27, 1993 (58 FR 57745), EPA granted to Arizona additional authorization. Arizona is authorized to implement certain HSWA requirements in lieu of EPA. EPA has explicitly indicated its intent to allow such action in Federal Register documents granting Arizona authorization effective October 7, 1991 (56 FR 37290, August 6, 1991), September 11, 1992 (57 FR 30905, July 13, 1992; 57 FR 41699, September 11, 1992), January 22, 1993 (57 FR 54932, November 23, 1992), and December 27, 1993 (58 FR 57745, October 27, 1993).
