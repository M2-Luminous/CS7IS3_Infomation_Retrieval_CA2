House of Representatives President Alexis Galanos announced this upon his return this evening from Athens, where he headed a multiparty parliamentary delegation. The president of the House of Representatives and the parliamentary delegation also had a meeting with Theodhoros Pangalos, Greek Alternate Foreign Minister. Speaking after the meeting with Galanos, the Greek alternate foreign minister described the state of alert by the occupation forces and other Turkish actions as very impudent provocations. They think that they are powerful, Pangalos added, but this is not the first time someone has threatened Greece with his size and was later ridiculed. [passage omitted]
