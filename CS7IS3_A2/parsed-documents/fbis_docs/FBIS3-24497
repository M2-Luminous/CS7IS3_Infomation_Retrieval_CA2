Trofimov; UDC 681.325.5:621.3] [Abstract] Features of employing A[.sup]II[/]B[.sup]VI[/] semiconductor compounds, specifically cadmium sulfide-selenide, in a form of thin-film photodetector structures, are examined for different elements of optoelectronic processor. A technology was developed in the Belorus Academy of Sciences for obtaining thin-film photo- resistors based on cadmium sulfide-selenide, which includes: a cathode three-electron scattering on direct current and high frequency voltage of a cold-pressed target, activation of photo- sensitivity by thermal processing of films in the original batch, photo-lithographic operations for obtaining the required topology of micro-elements on thin-film of cadmium sulfide-selenide and In - A[.sup]II[/]B[.sup]VI[/], Al - Ti - A[.sup]II[/]B[.sup]VI[/] contact systems. Thin-film photo- resistor structures 0.5-2.0 ï¿½m thick can be formed with this technology on different substrates with a sufficiently high photoelectric quality. Experimental data are provided, supporting the feasibility of application of thin-film photo-resistors based on cadmium sulfide-selenide for modeling and development of three-dimensional opto-electronic processors.
