FR941028-2-00042 FR941028-2-00027 It is indicated that recently Panhandle and Anadarko Gathering Company (AGC) concluded negotiations concerning the sale to AGC of Panhandle's Hugoton System. Field Services states that the sale of the Hugoton System to AGC includes a portion of the Elkhart Compressor Station in Kansas. It is stated that Panhandle proposes to sell a part of the Elkhart Station facilities to AGC and the remainder would be transferred to Field Services with Field Services operating its portion of the Elkhart Station facilities in conjunction with the other gathering facilities it is acquiring from Panhandle. It is also stated that, as currently configured, the Elkhart Station is located in Morton County, Kansas immediately downstream of gathering facilities which are the subject of the Panhandle and Field Services' filings in Docket Nos. CP94&hyph;151&hyph;000 and CP94&hyph;152&hyph;000, respectively. Field Services indicates that the Elkhart Station is divided by a county road, but the two portions are currently integrated. It is also stated that, as a result of the sale of the Panhandle Hugoton System to AGC, Panhandle proposes to split the Elkhart Station between AGC and Field Services. It is indicated that Panhandle would transfer the portion south of the county road, consisting of four 1,028 horsepower two-stage skid-mounted compressors and six 1,100 horsepower single-stage block-mounted compressors, to Field Services. Field Services states that these facilities compress the gas gathered on the Elkhart Gathering System for delivery into the 24-inch line to be transferred to AGC. Field Services states that the portion of the facilities located north of the county road, consisting of one 3,162 horsepower four-stage compressor, would be transferred to AGC. Field Services states that, subsequent to the transfer of facilities by Panhandle, significant modifications would be undertaken to separate completely the operation of the South Elkhart Station from the North Elkhart Station so that the two would be operated independently and would no longer be integrated. It is also indicated that, upon the transfer of the Panhandle Hugoton Gathering System to AGC and the transfer of the remaining gathering to Field Services, the South Elkhart Station would not be contiguous with any other facilities owned or operated by Panhandle. Field Services argues that, as a matter of law, the facilities to be transferred to Field Services are within the gathering and production exemption of Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act because; and that, after the reconfiguration of facilities, the sole function of the South Elkhart Station would be to boost the pressure of the gas produced behind the station from a suction pressure of 50 psig to a pressure high enough (450 psig) so that the gas can be delivered into the 24-inch discharge line.
