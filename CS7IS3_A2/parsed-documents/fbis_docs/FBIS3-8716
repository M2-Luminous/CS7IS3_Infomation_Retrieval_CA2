[words indistinct] [Koljevic] There was no specific discussion about the division of Sarajevo. There were some ideas that everyone would have authority in his own Sarajevo, and it does not need to be called the Muslim Sarajevo or the Serbian Sarajevo. It is far more important for us that people enjoy their political rights on those territories that they control -- this refers to Sarajevo -- than what kind of a name this will bear temporarily. [Correspondent] Were there any demands for new territorial concessions, as it is evident that the issue of demarcation...? [Koljevic, interrupting] No, the demarcation issue will naturally be very difficult; however, the style of these mediators is different. They would not raise an issue that has not arrived on the agenda yet. Above all, they want to create a very solid basis in order to accomplish success and have the most difficult talks about demarcation come last, when it would no longer be possible to cross over into a different situation without an agreement. [Correspondent] How do you comment on the latest U.S. proposals about the possibility of an independent state of Serbian Republic? [Koljevic] I think that these are very interesting proposals, however, we must study their legal implications. [Correspondent] Thanks!
