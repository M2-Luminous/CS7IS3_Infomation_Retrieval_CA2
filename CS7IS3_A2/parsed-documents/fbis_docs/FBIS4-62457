Andrey Kozyrev told journalists in Geneva today that the first consultations of representatives of foreign policy departments was recently held in Italy. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov took part in them on the Russian side. "The sessions were positive, we have already put forward our proposals regarding the text of the document, and other countries have also presented their proposals," the head of Russian diplomats said. "Thus, practical work is under way to draw up the final document of the `G-8' regarding issues of the world's security policy. I think we are on the right track here." Commenting on the process for linking Russia to the new export control system intended to replace Cocom [Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls], the minister observed that in that respect the dialogue had not yet reached the necessary level. Russian experts "are not as yet directly involved in the work, although we do have assurances from the American side." "Additional complications have arisen" in this regard. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Georgiy Mamedov recently met his counterparts from the United States. The same question was discussed today during a conversation with Warren Christopher. "It was confirmed once more that the next meeting of experts to draft the new COCOM regime will take place with the direct participation of Russia," Andrey Kozyrev pointed out. "I said quite unequivocally: We shall be simply unable to join in a regime that has been drafted without our equal participation."
