The leader of the delegation, Mr. Masao Sawaki, informed President Moi that Japan would increase its funding of specific projects to Kenya by 50 percent in the next five years. Mr. Sawaki said Japan placed Kenya in high esteem, especially due to her rapid development. This, he said, was the reason the delegation came to reappraise its support for Kenya's development. President Moi thanked the government and people of Japan for their enormous contribution to Kenya's development since independence. He added that, because of this support, Kenya regarded Japan as a true friend and partner in development and, noting that he was committed to environmental conservation as it guaranteed the success of future development efforts, the president said he would appreciate assistance to construct several dams in the country. He informed the Japanese delegation that Kenya's rapid development was mainly due to the uninterrupted peace since independence and the participation of wananchi [citizens] in the harambee [communal fund-raising] self-help strategy. President Moi said he attached great importance to security and added that the issue would be given the attention it deserved. [passage omitted]
