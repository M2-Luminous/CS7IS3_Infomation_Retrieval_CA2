Mr. Mandela said the country needed massive resources, including foreign capital, to rebuild the economy. He said he expected foreign capital, much of it from the United States, to play a vital if not decisive role in helping to rebuild the South African economy. The ANC leader added that he believed the four days of voting last week had been free and fair, despite some problems that he said would not affect the outcome.
