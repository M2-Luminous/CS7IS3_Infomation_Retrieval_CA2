Shortly after the paper was published, it was strongly criticized by his own party. A coalition working group will now deal with the matter. The following is the paper describing the new tasks and the number of troops required. I. Introduction The changing security conditions and Germany's increasing international responsibility influence the Bundeswehr's role, task, structure, and equipment. In view of the fundamentally changing security situation and the limited resources available, we have to define the capacities and objectives of the Armed Forces that Germany has and wants to keep and adapt them in such a way that they can fulfill their tasks in the future. The government's 1994 white book is the planning structure for the future of the forces. The planning guideline is the necessary link between the white book and Bundeswehr planning. It defines specific basic figures for the forces' strength in times of peace and defense, as well as their structure and the size of crisis-reaction forces. It lays down the necessary number of regular soldiers and conscripts for the future Bundeswehr and defines the duration of basic military service under the future framework conditions. It sets goals for optimizing the forces and their operation -- this should achieve a better relation between costs and investments. Finally, planning aims at maintaining the necessary connection between crisis-reaction forces and the main defense forces. II. The Changing Strategic Framework Conditions An analysis of the current situation shows that the conditions for European, especially German, security have undergone basic changes in three respects: -- Germany is no longer a frontline state, but it is surrounded by allies and friendly partners; -- Germany is no longer within the reach of an adversary that is capable of large-scale strategic operations; -- at the same time, the danger of regional crises and conflicts in and outside Europe is increasing, which also affects Germany's security. The possible joint defense of German territory with the allies remains a necessity. Yet, conflicts are unlikely in Central Europe, and they are only imagineable if developments change completely. What is much more likely are crises and conflicts in other parts of Europe, which we must limit to a region, tackle together with the other allies, and thus keep away from Germany. The Bundeswehr today is best prepared for the most unlikely, if not the most dangerous, event, but it is least prepared for the most likely new tasks. This makes it necessary to adjust our forces to the future tasks. Germany needs -- Forces for ground defense that can be withdrawn in times of peace and are thus more dependent on mobilization, -- and forces for crises, which will be fully present in times of peace, ready to act, can be moved easily, and whose professionalism enables them to be used for a whole range of crisis operations. III. Tasks and Strength of the Forces Due to Germany's geographical situation, a special contribution to the main defense forces in Central Europe is a decisive factor for Germany's influence in the alliance. Main defense forces that can be mobilized are the basis for national defense and a crucial element of Germany's importance in a central task within NATO, namely collective defense. Main Defense Forces The main defense forces have to -- provide the necessary conditions in times of peace for full defense capacities to be reached in the event of a crisis, -- safeguard an increase in forces through mobilization in a crisis, -- defend NATO territory together with the alliance partners. The present strategic situation allows a significant cut in national defense forces. The militarily usable warning time in the event of a major aggression suggests that parts of the main defense forces should be released of the operation order in times of peace and their full training for operations should be moved to times of a crisis. For this reason, the main defense forces within the existing divisions of the Army, Air Force, and the Navy are to be structured differently from the crisis-reaction forces in terms of presence, training, equipment, operation, and supply. The main defense forces are structured in such a way as to maintain their combat strength envisaged for defense. Their full readiness for action will, however, only be achieved through gradual mobilization and intensive training within the militarily usable preparation time. These measures aim at two things -- first, at allowing an increase in the number of crisis-reaction forces, and second, at achieving an overall structure that allows flexibility within the given security situation. The necessary connection between main defense and crisis-reaction forces is also safeguarded by the units of the Army forming a continual supply of forces that become available on a step-by-step basis. The defense system that is based on conscripts and reservists has to safeguard that the forces can be increased to a defense strength of 650,000-700,000 troops. Intensive crisis training within a scheme of gradual mobilization shall provide full defense capacities within approximately four months. These conditions can be achieved by means of a strictly organized 10-month basic military service. Crisis-Reaction Forces The crisis-reaction forces will have the following tasks: -- in national defense, to deter potential attackers and thus prevent conflicts through immediately possible action; -- to contribute to crisis management and conflict prevention, as well as defense in NATO and the Western European Union [WEU], -- to carry out missions from humanitarian measures to military operations under the UN Charter for the United Nations and the CSCE. In order to fulfill these tasks, the capacity to use forces up to a maximum size of a division and appropriate contingents of the Air Force and Navy is appropriate and sufficient. To achieve this, the following forces, which can be used quickly and can be moved to other locations, must be maintained: -- In the Army -- as the German contribution to the NATO reaction forces and Eurocorps, a total of five mechanized and light air-movable brigades. This number is complemented by the necessary combat support and supply troops, as well as the German part of the German-French brigade; -- In the Air Force -- six flying squadrons for air attacks, air defense, reconnaissance, and nuclear support missions, as well as two mixed ground-controlled air defense units, as well as two or three air transport squadrons and a helicopter unit for rescue operations; -- In the Navy, two ocean-going operation groups consisting of two to three ships each, the appropriate components for explosives defense and underwater warfare, floating control and supply components, a squadron of naval fighter aircraft, naval reconnaissance planes, rescue helicopters, and a company of frogmen. The necessary availability and professionalism of the crisis-reaction forces require that they consist mainly of regular soldiers. Conscripts may serve in the crisis-reaction forces, if on starting service they declare their willingness to be available for all crisis-reaction missions. In order to be able to serve in such missions, it will usually be necessary for conscripts to serve for at least 12 months. Regarding the duration of basic military service, this opens up the possibility to choose between serving at least 10 months or a voluntary 12-month mission-oriented service. Basic Military Organization In order to control the Armed Forces, support their operation, enable training and supply functions, for civilian-military cooperation, and for support to the allies, a basic military organization is required. IV. Conclusions for Bundeswehr Size and Structure Staffing The correlation between crisis-reaction forces and main defense forces, the correlation between conscription and equity in conscription, and the correlation between presence and mobilization result in a peacetime force of the Bundeswehr of some 340,000 troops. It consists of -- some 200,000 regular soldiers and soldiers on a fixed-term contract, -- up to 135,000 conscripts, with a 10-month service; -- and approximately 3,000 military training grounds. 135,000 posts for conscripts at a service term of 10 months means that up to 155,000 conscripts can start their service every year. As a result of cutting back in military staff, the number of civilian personnel can also be reduced accordingly; the former target figure of 151,300 for the year 2000 can now be cut to under 140,000. This plan is based on the following assumptions: -- that, as in the past, the number of fit conscripts is used to the fullest extent; -- that, with basic military service being cut to 10 months, there will be no compensatory time off for soldiers doing basic service; -- that career prospects of the 370-personnel model are maintained, and finally, -- that the forces' structures allow for a peacetime strength of 370,000, if required; this also enables the internationally agreed upper limit of 370,000 to be achieved by partial mobilizations. Personnel cuts to reduce operating costs and changing of structures will lead to the stationing of troops being reexamined. Regional availability of personnel, training opportunities, infrastructure, and profitability of the individual facilities play a role in that, as does the quality of life for the Bundeswehr troops and their families. It is obvious that consequences for the stationing can only be worked out in the course of the planning process and can only be implemented over the next few years. Rationalization The Bundeswehr is short of funds right now. That is why the gap between its tasks and funds has to be closed; financial leeway is necessary for restructuring the Bundeswehr. This is the only way to make the urgently necessary investment toward suitable and modern equipment for the crisis-reaction forces, while, at the same time, maintaining a minimum degree of a competitive and efficient arms industry as part of Germany's security precautions. The profits derived from rationalizations and reduction of personnel costs due to cutting back the forces' peacetime strength must remain allocated to the defense budget. Only in this way will it be possible to increase the investment portion and find the original investment necessary for initiating the rationalizations. The planning guideline can, however, only be put into practice if the 1995 ceiling of 47.5 billion marks remains unaltered in the medium term and individual plan No. 14 is increased again as of 1997. V. Summary The envisaged reduction of the Bundeswehr's peacetime strength and the further development of the forces' capacities and structures constitute a moderate intervention in terms of quantity -- which is necessary with a view to the somewhat crisis-prone situation, and is, quite rightly, expected by our citizens and the alliance. In terms of quality, the comprehensive adjustment to new tasks and structural reforms is a fundamental change that will give our forces a new but also more up-to-date look. The approach described above preserves the defense power in alliances on the basis of forces that can be mobilized, while at the same time increasing Germany's political capacity to act within NATO, WEU, and the United Nations due to its ability to act quickly and in solidarity in times of crises.
