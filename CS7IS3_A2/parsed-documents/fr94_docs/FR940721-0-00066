FR940721-0-00066 FR940721-0-00014 Since the statute does not specify a particular method for making country of origin determinations for the components comprising an engine/transmission, NHTSA believes that this approach will provide appropriate flexibility. The agency notes that after country of origin determinations are made for each component comprising an engine/transmission, the ``greatest share of value added'' approach is used to determine the origin of the engine/transmission. The agency also notes that this approach will not have any effect on item one of the label. B. Format/Location for Label NHTSA proposed to require that the label be placed in a prominent location on each vehicle where it can be read from the exterior of the vehicle. The agency proposed three options for the format of the label: (1) A stand-alone label that is at least 5 inches wide by 3 inches long, (2) an addition at the end of the Monroney pricing label (15 U.S.C. 1232), or (3) an addition at the end of the fuel economy label (15 U.S.C. 2006). Under all three options, the label would be required to read as follows: For vehicles in this carline: U.S./Canadian Parts Content: XX % Major Source of Foreign Parts Content: [fill in country/countries]: XX % For this vehicle: Final Assembly Point: XXXXX Country of Origin: ␣Engine: XXXXX ␣Transmission: XXXXX In addition, the label would include the heading ``PARTS CONTENT INFORMATION'' at the top, and an explanatory note at the bottom. The second item of the label (i.e., ``Major Source of Foreign parts Content'') would be omitted if no individual country other than the U.S./Canada contributed a minimum of 15 percent of the value of a vehicle's equipment. NHTSA stated in the NPRM that to ease comparisons among various carlines and to make the information available to consumers in as clear and consistent a manner as possible, it believed it was appropriate to specify minimum requirements for label and letter size. The agency noted that the label, whether separate or attached to the price or fuel economy labels, must be large enough for all the content information to be easily read, yet small enough to avoid cluttering the limited window space on the vehicle. The agency proposed to require a separate label to be rectangular with a minimum dimension of 5.0 inches (125 mm) in width and 3.0 inches (75 mm) in length. The characters for items one through five of the parts content label would be required to be printed at a minimum height of 12 points (one-sixth of an inch) in boldface type. The required explanatory note at the bottom of the label would be required to be printed in characters two points smaller than the information for items one through five. If the information required by section 210 is attached to the price or fuel economy labels, the information would be required to be separated from the information required to be on those labels by a line that is a minimum of 3 points wide. The words ``PARTS CONTENT INFORMATION'' would be required to be printed in bold, uppercase letters, centered, and in not less than 12 point type. AAMA stated that the agency should permit the label information on any prominently displayed window label. That organization stated that as various government agencies add more labeling requirements, many companies have been developing consumer labels containing information on several different issues. On the issue of format, AAMA stated that because of increasing labeling requirements such as bumper standards and CFC content, deviations should be permitted with the prior approval of the agency. GM stated that label space is at a premium, especially for labels which are required to be left in place until delivery. That manufacturer stated that the information required on the label is specifically set out in the legislation, and additional information should not be required. GM also argued that the label location, format, size, appearance and type style should be discretionary with the manufacturer to give the manufacturer the greatest flexibility. GM indicated that it intends to include this label information in a consumer information label combining several consumer notices on one label, including such things as bumper system performance information. GM stated that the regulation should allow consolidation of this label with other consumer notices as part of another window label displayed for consumer review at time of sale. GM stated that in its combined consumer information label format, a title size of 12 points with the label information printed in characters two points smaller would make the label consistent with the other information. That manufacturer argued that in no case should the type size be larger than 12 points. GM stated that type size changes and bolding are more practical for implementing emphasis than underlining. According to GM, to maximize use of label space, the format should be discretionary, not mandated. That company stated, for example, that various information should be allowed on the same line if width permits to save label space. GM also argued that the title line should be ``Content Information'' to comply with the disclosure intent of the Labeling Act. Toyota stated that a separate Labeling Act label should not be required to be placed on the same window as the Monroney label. That company stated that section 210(b) does not require such placement and provides only that the label appear in a prominent place. Toyota also stated that the proposed 3 x 5 inch minimum size requirement for a separate label would pose problems concerning placement on some vehicles for which available space is limited. It noted that a manufacturer choosing to place the information on the Monroney label will be able to devote less space to Labeling Act disclosures than the 15 square inches of a 3 x 5 inch label. Toyota stated that for the sake of consistency, a separate label should not have to be substantially larger than the available space on the Monroney label. NADA urged the agency to allow manufacturers to set out parts content information in the certification label required by 49 CFR part 567. That organization argued that a vehicle's right door frame is a prominent place and that nothing in the Act requires parts content labels to be affixed to vehicle exteriors. NADA also stated permanent attachment would provide information to subsequent purchasers. NADA stated that the agency should prohibit the affixing of any separate parts content labels on the vehicle window. That organization stated that new vehicle windows are already cluttered with the Monroney and fuel economy labels. It also stated that vehicles in demonstrator service must also have used car rule warranty labels affixed. NADA stated that, by law, only used car rule labels may be removed during test drives. It noted that many state laws regulate vehicle window obstruction, but Federal law requires Monroney and fuel economy labels to be maintained. NADA stated that the agency, consistent with its primary mission to ensure vehicle safety, must not exacerbate this concern by allowing the potential for an additional window label. After considering the comments, NHTSA has decided to require the label to be placed in a prominent location on each vehicle where it can be read from the exterior of the vehicle with the doors closed. NHTSA does not accept NADA's recommendation to permit the label to be included as part of the certification label on the door frame. The agency disagrees that the door frame would be a prominent location for a consumer information label, since prospective purchasers would need to open the door of a vehicle, and probably have to stoop down as well, to read the label.
