Speaking at the opening session of the Asia Society International Corporate Conference, which will run through Thursday [19 May] with the theme "Waves of the Future - ASEAN, Vietnam and China: Opportunities for World Business", Goh said if the West continues to see Asia as a threat and tries to slow its growth, both Asia and the West will lose. "If the West blocks the emerging Asian countries, especially China, from world markets, it will force them to turn inward. They will be less open and be less cooperative internationally," he said. As a consequence, the West will be threatened not merely by the loss of exports and slower domestic growth, but with global insecurity, including the risks of losing the assets it already has in Asia, the prime minister warned. In his speech, entitled "Asia - Opportunities, Not Threats", Goh said China's emergence will be the largest phenomenon in the world economy over the next few decades. The entry into the international market by countries like China, India and Vietnam has changed the pattern of world trade and investment, he noted. Unfortunately, as the prime minister said, the West was ambivalent in welcoming and encouraging the growth of these countries. Some Western leaders, politicians, trade unionists and opinion-makers see Asia's emergence as a threat rather than an opportunity. He said attempts to check imports from Asian countries, where wages were low, betrayed the West's fear of competition from Asia and its growing sense of economic insecurity. Referring clearly to the recent efforts by some developed countries to introduce social clauses on workers' rights and minimum wages into the international trade agreements, Goh said, "These thinly-veiled protectionist measures are short-sighted." He said that Asia's growth will be slowed, but it will not be stopped, given the region's diversity in natural resources, wage levels, skills and technology, and capital, as people in Asia save more than the rest of the world. He urged the United States to heed what Richard Nixon wrote in his last book, that the Chinese may one day threaten to withhold most-favored-nation status from the U.S. unless it does more to improve living conditions in Detroit, Harlem and South Central Los Angeles. "Whichever the scenario, the West would have much to lose by not being a partner in Asia's growth," Goh said. The conference, organized by the Asia Society, Dow Jones and Company, Inc. and the Institute of Policy Studies, Singapore, is attended by some 800 delegates from 21 countries and regions. In addition to Goh Chok Tong, New Zealand Prime Minister James Bolger, Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet, Senior Minister of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew, and Vice Premier of China Li Lanqing, and other high-ranking government officials from the participating countries are also scheduled to deliver their keynote speeches at the conference on Wednesday and Thursday.
