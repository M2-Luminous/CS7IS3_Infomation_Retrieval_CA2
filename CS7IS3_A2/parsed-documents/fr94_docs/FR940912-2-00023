FR940912-2-00023 FR940912-2-00020 Golden Field Office; Dallas Support Office Financial Assistance Award; Oklahoma State University AGENCY: Department of Energy, Golden Field Office and Dallas Support Office. ACTION: Notice of noncompetitive financial assistance award. SUMMARY: The Department of Energy (DOE), Golden Field Office, through the Dallas Support Office, announces that it intends to award a grant to Oklahoma State University (OSU)/International Ground Source Heat Pump Association (IGSHPA). The proposed award meets the criteria in 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(B) in addition to the type of factors listed in 10 CFR 600.14(d). The financial assistance is for support of the Geothermal Technical Development/Training Project. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Geothermal Technical Development and Training Project will be one of the most significant national efforts for developing and promoting the use of ground source heat pumps as an energy efficient and environmentally beneficial method of heating and cooling buildings. This project will integrate research, technology transfer and training to develop better hardware and software used to implement the technology, as well as the production of brochures, case histories, fact sheets, articles and related media activities to promote the use of geothermal heating and cooling. Advances in ground source heat pump efficiency and installation techniques, as well as reductions in installation costs, make the cost of this technology comparable with those of competitive heating and cooling technologies, while operating costs and energy usage are demonstrably lower. This is especially important for institutional and government facilities faced with budget constraints and increasing utility expenditures. The DOE anticipates providing funds in the amount of $295,000 for a project period of one year with possible funding, in varying amounts, for an additional two years contingent on the availability of funds.
