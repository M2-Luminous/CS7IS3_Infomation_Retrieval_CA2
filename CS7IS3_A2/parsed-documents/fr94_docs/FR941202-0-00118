FR941202-0-00118 FR941202-0-00012 This Order is concerned with the effects on competition from non-equity arrangements. In the current wireless marketplace joint marketing arrangements such as MobiLink and Cellular One can be beneficial to consumers. These types of arrangements facilitate roaming and brand identity without conferring the ability to set or significantly influence the price or service offerings of individual licensees. However, there may be other joint marketing arrangements that may confer the ability to significantly influence price and service offerings. In these cases, those arrangements will be considered attributable and would be prohibited if a party to the agreement exceeded the applicable caps. The Order is also concerned about the effects attributing such arrangements might have on the competitiveness of designated entities. It finds that considering management contracts attributable interests for purposes of spectrum caps will not harm competition or efficiency, nor will it harm the ability of designated entities to find suitable expertise should they wish to do so. Investor/manager agreements are one of many alternatives available to designated entities and the Commission does not believe that treating management agreements as attributable for designated entities in exactly the same manner for spectrum cap purposes as for other entities will hamper the competitiveness of designated entities. This does not mean, however, that these management agreements will be deemed ``attributable'' for purposes of the revenue thresholds in the entrepreneur's blocks. The Order points out that this decision in no way restricts designated entities (or other licensees) from entering into management or joint marketing agreements with entities with no attributable interests in the same market. The Commission concludes that it is not in the public interests to treat resale agreements as attributable interests for the purpose of applying CMRS multiple-and cross-ownership rules. However, the Commission has determined that joint marketing arrangements between competitors in the same geographic area and certain management agreements should be treated as attributable interests for purposes of spectrum caps and pursuant to the rules and criteria we adopt in the Fourth Report and Order.
