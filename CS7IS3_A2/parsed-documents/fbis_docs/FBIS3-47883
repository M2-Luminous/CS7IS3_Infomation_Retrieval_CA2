It would be a lie if we said we did not feel that way. However, reviewing the outline of the defense plan has been a pending issue since the end of the cold war. We would like to welcome the willingness Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa expressed at his New Year's press conference. The prime minister explained his idea to begin reviewing the outline one year earlier than the Defense Agency's schedule, and thus complete it during fiscal 1994. Because of this, it is said an advisory organization originally scheduled to be placed under the jurisdiction of the Defense Agency's director general will become an advisory body to the prime minister. It is a major political task to determine Japan's ideal future defense in line with a new ideology. It can be said that since the prime minister explained his intention to tackle the issue himself, that proves he accurately understands the importance of the new task. The outline of the current defense plan was formed under the Miki cabinet in 1976 as a guideline for building up the nation's defense capability when the cold war between East and West was moving toward detente. Its goal was to "single-handedly and effectively deal with limited and small-scale invasions." It was prepared on an idea called "improvement of fundamental defense capability." It is said the outline is not designed to deal with threats. However, due to the escalation of confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union during the 1980's, the outline actually strengthened Japan's defense capability in dealing with threats, mainly "potential threats from the Soviet Union." Following the 1989 conclusion of the cold war, the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, and the structure of East-West confrontation disappeared. Of late, a new source of apprehension is Russian rightists coming into existence. However, it is probably a political phenomenon. It does not mean Russia has begun reconstructing the strong military power of the former Soviet Union. Moreover, the Russian economy is so weak that Russia is unable to abruptly rebuild a strong military power even if it wanted to. If aforesaid views are true, then we can say the military threat has been reduced remarkably. Nevertheless, the Japanese Government so far has been delaying the process of reviewing its defense outline. We feel the government is trying to find a new threat. The DPRK's nuclear weapons project and its development of the Nodong-1 missile, which can be used to attack Japan, are indeed causes of anxiety. We may also need to keep our eyes on the modernization of Chinese naval force. It seems the frequent occurrence of regional conflicts will continue in the future. However, it is not a good idea to fuss over these issues, saying they are major threats. On the contrary, we think the quality of the threats has changed. The new world order which will take the place of the cold war is still unclear, and a sense of fear and uncertainly is growing. How we deal with these matters should be the basis of the new defense outline. To do this, military streamlining alone is not enough. As the prime minister said, Japan needs to "voluntarily lead the disarmament movement." This is the only way we can clearly show Asia that Japan does not intend to become a major military power, or will not use military power to back its diplomacy. Defense authorities have strengthened their idea to use a plan designed to reduce the full number of Self-Defense Forces [SDF] personnel from 180,000 to 150,000 as an answer to the "voluntary disarmament." However, the SDF has never maintained 180,000 members. Currently, it has only 153,000 personnel. Direct invasion by a foreign enemy is unlikely. Civil war is beyond imagination. We urge the government to seriously study the possibility of forming a UN cooperation team by venturing to reduce the scale of the Ground Self-Defense Forc. The new outline should serve as a guideline for building Japan's defense capability. At the same time, it should also become Japan's message to the world. In this sense, rather than relying on the knowledge of specialists, the government must study a new defense doctrine from broad perspectives, taking Japanese common sense into consideration.
