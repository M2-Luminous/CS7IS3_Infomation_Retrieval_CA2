Official sources in Amman said the two countries next month will start working out a peace agreement after having formed a committee to demarcate their joint borders. In a statement to our radio, a spokesman for the unified leadership of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] said the unified leadership of the two fronts has warned against the dangers of the Jordanian-Israeli agreement and said it opens the door wide for all forms of normalization at a time when Israel is still occupying the Palestinian and Arab territories, in addition to the fact that it is a violation of the principle of a comprehensive solution in accordance with international legitimacy, although it is hiding behind the first penetration represented by the Oslo-Cairo agreement. The central leadership of the two fronts warned against this agreement and called on the Jordanian House of Representatives and all national Jordanian forces, parties, and personalities to reject the agreement and not to allow it to pass on both the popular and official levels. The leadership also demanded that the Jordanian Government revoke this agreement and abide by the principle of comprehensive solution and the constants of the pan-Arab position, according to the PFLP and DFLP spokesman.
