While early reports said that it might be cholera, it now appears that it may in fact be food poisoning contracted from eating fish that had washed ashore during the floods and had affected this area. The director-in-chief, Dr Eileen Thakur, who had a telephonic conversation with the civil surgeon of Motihari this afternoon, told TOINS that people of these villages had fallen ill after consuming the small dead fish. Dr Thakur said the seven persons of Khairi Ajgarwa had, in fact, died of food poisoning and not of cholera. She said in Khairi Ajgarwa alone 500 people had fallen ill complaining of diarrhea and vomiting. The civil surgeon of Motihari has informed the government that a medical team has been camping at Khairi Ajgarwa village to ascertain whether the disease which had been raging in these villages was cholera vibrio non zero or not. The director-in-chief, Dr Thakur today directed the civil surgeon to send a detailed report about the disease within two days.
