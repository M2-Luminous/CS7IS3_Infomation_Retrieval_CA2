Portov; first paragraph is newspaper's introduction] [Text] The Russian Pacific Fleet is likely to resume dumping into the sea liquid nuclear waste, the product repairs to nuclear-powered submarines. Despite Japan's emergency plan to stop the dumping, the resumption is likely to go ahead because Russia does not have enough nuclear waste treatment facilities and is being urged to promote the mass dismantling of nuclear-powered submarines in accordance with the second Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START II). Reporter Portov recently obtained information from several high-ranking Pacific Fleet officers about nuclear-powered submarines, nuclear weapons facilities near Vladivostok, and Russia's handling of nuclear waste disposal. "The graveyard of holdovers from the East-West Cold War era" is now in a terrible condition and out of control. Portov reports on the current situation in an area of Russia which foreigners are still forbidden to enter. Vladivostok -- The Bolshoy Kamen Bay, the Cape of Maidel [name as published], and the Strelok Bay are located between Vladivostok and Nakhodka. The Pacific Fleet's nuclear weapons-related facilities, such as nuclear-powered submarine bases, underground nuclear warhead storage sites, docks designed to handle nuclear- powered craft, and nuclear waste treatment facilities are concentrated in the area. Foreigners are prohibited from entering. Nuclear waste yielded at Zvezda nuclear-powered submarine dock, which is located in the Bolshoy Kamen Bay, is the radioactive liquid at issue in Russian plans to dump waste into the Sea of Japan. About 20 nuclear-powered submarines are currently under repair in the dock. There are also four nuclear reactors in the dock from disassembled submarines. The reactors are known as "cigarette butts." Many of the repairs are made upon the nuclear reactors involved. Repeated cleaning of the reactors' external circuits with cooling water produces a large amount of radioactive waste liquid. In addition, nuclear-powered submarines in the Zvezda dock are equipped with SLBM [submarine launched ballistic missile] launchers, the numbers of which are due to be reduced in accordance with START II. As far as START II is concerned, Russia plans to dismantle eight of the submarines currently in the dock. Also, before the end of the year, it will move a 365-class nuclear-powered submarine equipped with a SLBM launcher from Russia's largest submarine base on the Kamchatka Peninsula to the Zvezda dock for dismantling. There are two nuclear waste discharge ships in the Zvezda dock. They are "TNT-5" and "TNT-27." Both are currently full of radioactive liquids. Another reason Russia is in haste to dump nuclear waste into the Sea of Japan and other waters is the delay in its procurement of new nuclear waste discharge ships. The procurement was proposed at a nuclear waste council meeting held at the Pacific Fleet headquarters on 5 December. Because the Russian Government is currently in difficult financial conditions and because such ships are built in Ukraine, immediate construction and procurement of the ships is unlikely. Nevertheless, a high-ranking Pacific Fleet officer at headquarters said: "If we have new ships, we can dump nuclear waste not only into the Sea of Japan but also into waters further away in the Pacific. But...." His remarks made it clear that the only option left to Russia was marine dumping of nuclear waste, which is banned under the London Convention. Another reason is one that has greatly irritate officers at the fleet headquarters in charge of dumping nuclear waste. The Pacific Fleet owns at least 14 support ships, of which four could be refitted to become nuclear waste storage ships. However, to make money, all 14 have been leased to newly-established corporations by former Pacific Fleet Commander Furatov [name as published], who was dismissed from his post in the spring, and other high-ranking officers. The ships are currently being used for commercial purposes. The headquarters' prosecution bureau is interrogating about 15 former high-ranking officers, including Furatov, on suspicion of having "illegally leased the support ships." Nevertheless, because of the lease contracts, it will be impossible to refit them as nuclear waste discharge ships in the near future. There is another nuclear-submarine dock at Chazima Bay [name as published] in the off-limits zone. Called No. 30 dock, it is currently closed, and falls under direct control of Russian Naval headquarters. In 1985 there was an accident at the dock which killed eight people. There was a blast from a nuclear reactor due to a rapid rise in the temperature of cooling water which occurred when the reactor was opened for repair. It is believed that when Russia resumes nuclear waste dumping it will use ships at the Zvezda dock, such as "TNT-5," but will probably move them to No. 30 dock to elude the vigilance of other countries. It is thought the ships will then leave No. 30 dock to dump nuclear waste or they will be scuttled in the near seas. There is a solid nuclear waste dumping site and an underground nuclear weapons storage depot at the Cape of Maidel. This dumping site is also full of nuclear waste. It is said that Russia has many times dumped nuclear waste from the site into the Sea of Japan and other waters. Reactors from dismantled nuclear-powered submarines represent the most troublesome aspect of handling solid nuclear waste. They are called "cigarette butts." A high-ranking Pacific Fleet officer said: "The Northern Fleet has also disposed of cigarette butts in the waters off the Kolskiy Peninsula in the Barents Sea. If Russia dismantles more nuclear- powered submarines in accordance with START II, the Pacific Fleet may also have to start dumping its cigarette butts into the sea." There is a nuclear-powered submarine base and an underground nuclear warhead storage center in Pavlovsk in Strelok Bay. The submarine base is the largest in the Maritime Kray. In the bay there are two abandoned sunken submarines.
