Guoda Salciute reports: [Salciute] The Seimas Chairman Ceslovas Jursenas commented at a news conference on today's events. They are the initialing of the Lithuanian-Polish Treaty in Warsaw and a meeting of the military representatives of the Baltic States in preparing a joint peace-keeping battalion. [Begin Jursenas recording] How the coincidence of these two events can be explained, or how should one explain this? I think that the main thing here is our advance toward Europe. Both events are linked with our joining European, Western and world structures. I dare to state on this occasion that we ensure the continuity of Lithuanian foreign policy, of an independent state, starting with 11 March 1990 up to this day. We are convinced that one of the most important things that must be ensured for our state are its security and its stability. Both internal means and the corresponding means of international policy are needed for this purpose. Thus the regulation of relations with our neighbors, the existence of good, normal and friendly relations with our neighbors are exceptionally important in the sense of our internal situation, too. If we speak of real advance in Europe, but not of a declaration or nice words, then my dear ones, nobody is waiting for us in Europe, nobody is waiting for us who quarrel with neighbors, who are not reconciled with neighbors, who have not eliminated some conflicts. Europe is not waiting for such, it has enough of its own problems and suffers because of the former Yugoslavia or some other situations. Thus we can more successfully join European structures and can take part in the creation of a new Europe only if we regulate as far as we can our relations with our neighbors. Our previous governments have accomplished a great deal in this direction, I greatly appreciate this, and what they did not manage to accomplish or what they have started, like, for example, a Lithuanian-Polish declaration signed by esteemed Saudargas [former Lithuanian foreign minister] and esteemed Skubiszewski, what the previous government did not manage to accomplish, we are doing this. [end recording] [Salciute] Having assessed the Lithuanian-Polish Treaty, Jursenas also dealt with the hue and cry by some politicians in Lithuania about this document, with meetings and pickets, with a statement by six parties. Having stressed juridical involuntariness [as heard] of this statement, Jursenas asked which experts write such statements. The Seimas chairman also spoke at the news conference about the first days of the Seimas spring session. Although only three days have passed, two capital laws have been adopted: On land and on the reliability of the litas. Asked by journalists whether he himself had confidence in the litas, Jursenas replied that he had and will have confidence in the litas, which has undergone many tests.
