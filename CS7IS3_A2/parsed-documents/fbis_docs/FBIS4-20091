"A new constitution, suitable to our nation, should be prepared at the soonest, to bring rules which would strengthen the democratic and secular structure of the Republic of Turkey, based on human rights," Ozden said. Speaking at the ceremony marking the 32nd year of the Constitutional Court, Ozden said that the Turkish nation was founded on the concept of humanity, rather than a racist understanding and the national characteristic of the republic cannot possibly be changed by force. Ozden said that sovereignty belonged unconditionally to the Turkish nation not to parliament. "Parliament is an organ authorized, on behalf of the nation, to legislate and execute," he said. Ozden warned against illegal rallies which were in fact rehearsals for establishing a Shariah (Islamic law) state and were exploiting democracy in Turkey. ``National, regional or city-level sheikhs or dervishes, political dervish lodges cannot be allowed or considered valid. ``Law is our scientific illumination,'' he said. ``To live under freedom, happiness and confidence requires independence and willpower, rather than pressure and violence. ``This state and country belongs to us all. We shall live with pride and make our state live in pride, if we appreciate the value of these and are aware of our responsibilities.''
