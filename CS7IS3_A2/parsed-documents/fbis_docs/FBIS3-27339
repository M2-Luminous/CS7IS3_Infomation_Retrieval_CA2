According to officials with the Hebei Provincial Transport Bureau, preparations for the bidding have been completed and the offering of tenders will be officially opened next month. The Shijiazhuang-Anyang expressway, at a length of 216 km, will involve a use of 240 million U.S. dollars in loans from the World Bank, the largest World Bank loans China has ever used. Construction of the section from Beijing to Shijiazhuang, with a length of more than 280 km, has been completed and was put into use at the end of last year. Construction of subsequent sections of the expressway southward from Anyang city, in central China's Henan Province, will be undertaken by the provinces through which the thoroughfare passes. The officials said that they had completed the arrangements with the help of the China International Bidding Company and had already published tendering promotion materials on the world highway construction market. According to the officials, more than 30 businessmen involved in contracting projects from all over the world have come and carried out on-the-spot investigations of the Shijiazhuang-Anyang section. The officials added that construction of the Shijiazhuang-Anyang section would start in May, after the bidding is finished.
