This was said today here by Captain Eduardo A. Otero, the vessel's commander. The Gloria was met today at the Cuban Revolutionary Navy (MRG) pier by Captain Martin Jodar, representative of that institution's chief and of its chief of staff, and by Ricardo Santamaria, Colombian ambassador to Cuba. Otero told a group of reporters who were visiting the sailing vessel that he was pleased by the warm reception he was given upon his arrival in this capital and noted that this presence here will serve for the crew and the cadets to learn about the island's reality. I am very enthusiastic because during my first visit to Cuba in 1976 in this same vessel, I travelled as an officer aboard and today as ship commander. This will allow me to contribute to the strengthening of the relations between our two nations, he stressed. Otero and the officers who accompanied him were received by Rear Admiral Pedro Perez Betancourt, MRG chief. Perez Betancourt expressed Army General Raul Castro's, chief of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, satisfaction with the arrival of Colombian Navy training vessel. The vessel, a 23-sail brigantine, will remain at the Havana pier until 21 May when it will depart for Norfolk, Virginia, the United States. The Gloria, which has been the Colombian Navy's flagship for 25 years, embarks annually on tours while it serves as a school for the Colombian naval cadets. Among its goals are the development of the cadets' and officers' love for the sea, the naval mystique, as well as dedication to those values, the members of the crew pointed out to PRENSA LATINA. Moreover, the Gloria's mission is to serve as a goodwill ambassador that takes to all the world's ports of call Colombia's friendly facet, through its floating expositions and through the conduct of each crew member, the same sources added. The 40 officers, 73 cadets, and 13 civilians embarked on the tour will engage in a program of simultaneous visits to Havana's historical center -- patrimony of humanity -- the museum of the revolution, a naval academy, and the biotechnical institute. They will also hold conversations with young Cuban cadets with whom they will exchange experiences and academic knowledge as well as on the life in their respective nations. The Colombian Navy flagship is also scheduled to visit the United States, France, Portugal, the UK, Germany, and Spain in 1994.
