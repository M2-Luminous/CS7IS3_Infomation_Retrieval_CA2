FR940622-1-00011 FR940622-1-00003 b. Should SFAS No. 115 unrealized gains and losses be included in core capital for purposes of the risk-based capital requirement? c. Should SFAS No. 115 unrealized gains and losses be included in supplementary capital for purposes of the risk-based capital requirement? 2. Should SFAS No. 115 unrealized gains and losses be included in capital for purposes of Prompt Corrective Action (PCA)? If so, should the OTS initiate a rulemaking to amend the PCA capital definitions (i.e., tangible equity) or capital categories to ameliorate the statutory effects resulting from the potential volatility due to SFAS No. 115 adjustments? 3. What changes, if any, in asset-liability management, or risk management, would likely result from the inclusion of SFAS No. 115 unrealized gains and losses in capital? Would such changes increase or decrease the risk to the Savings Association Insurance Fund? III. Regulatory Flexibility Act Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, 5 U.S.C. 601), it is certified that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small savings associations. This proposed regulation simply revises the definition of common stockholders' equity included in the OTS capital rule so that it will include a new component of GAAP equity that was added to GAAP equity by SFAS No. 115. Section 4(b)(2) of HOLA requires the OTS to promulgate accounting standards that incorporate GAAP standards to the same degree that those standards are used by the Federal banking agencies. IV. Executive Order 12866 The Director of the OTS has determined that this proposed rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' for purposes of Executive Order 12866. The OTS proposes to revise its capital definition, in order to bring it into conformity with SFAS No. 115, and to ensure that its definition of common stockholders' equity is consistent with those of the other Federal banking agencies.
