According to the present regulations, only deputy groups numbering at least 35 members are eligible for official registration. The official registration gives such a group the right to be represented in the Council of the State Duma and all rights of party factions. So far only one deputy group, New Regional Policy, with 65 out of the 219 deputies elected in one-mandate constituencies, has been officially registered. Thus, a large number of deputies are not represented in the Council of the State Duma. Two deputy groups -- December 12 (leaders Irina Khakamada, Aleksandr Braginskiy and Yevgeniy Bushmin) and Russian Way (leaders Sergey Baburin and Anatoliy Lukyanov) do not have the required number of deputies. During the discussion of the corresponding amendment to the regulations of the State Duma, Chairman of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party [LDPR] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy said that his faction will support this amendment only in exchange for the introduction of the so-called "imperative mandate" which will give the faction the right to deprive any deputy elected on the party ticket of the deputy mandate. "It is not possible for a party to get rid of criminals," Zhirinovskiy said. As is known, lately two deputies, Viktor Kobelev and Aleksandr Pronin, have left the LDPR faction because of disagreement with the leader of the faction. The leader of the December 12 deputy group Khakamada stressed in her speech that the refusal to register their group means violation of equal rights of the deputies and the aggravation of conflict inside the Duma. Sergey Baburin (Russian Way) in turn spoke against the imperative mandate because, in his opinion, "each deputy should be free in voting," and "the discipline in the faction should be established by persuasion, not by whip." In respone Zhirinovskiy accused Baburin of "already having led one parliament to being shot" and demanded that he should not interfere in the internal affairs of the party. Nevertheless, a majority could not be found to support any of the variants of the corresponding article in the regulations. A package proposed by Zhirinovskiy also failed to get a majority of votes. So, the article determining the number of deputy groups required for official registration was sent for elaboration to the working group.
