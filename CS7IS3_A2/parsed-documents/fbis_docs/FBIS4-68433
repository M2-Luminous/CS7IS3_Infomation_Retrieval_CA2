Kokorin, automated assembly line plant economist: "`Either There Isn't Enough Money, or Else Not Enough Sense . . .': Releasing Prices to Stimulate Production and Then Cutting Production to Ease Inflation Is Insanity, not Economic Policy, Says Plant Economist"] [Text] The nonpayments crisis that has struck our economy is a Russian variation on the overproduction and market crisis characteristic for a market economy. Here, as in the general case, insufficient income and demand from the majority of the population lie at the base of the crisis. It was inevitable that our production would get into a market crisis, because the structure of our production was designed for a weak differentiation in incomes. As soon as that differentiation increased, as soon as the incomes of some increased and others decreased accordingly, then it was immediately obvious that some of output was not finding a market. Large incomes are spent completely differently from small ones. And when some found themselves unable to buy furniture, clothing, and expensive foods, others found they needed real estate, Mercedes, and even private account in a foreign bank. Demand has dropped in the mass market and increased in the elite market. If we had a closed economy, then the increase in demand for elite goods would lead to an increase in their production, thereby stimulating general economic growth. Imports got in the way, though. The new bourgeoisie, naturally, preferred higher quality foreign goods. On the other hand, the mass market was swamped by imported consumer goods and food, which exacerbated the market crisis for our own output that had already broken out. The majority now cannot buy imported goods to the extent they used to buy their own. The former are not cheap enough to compensate for the population's declining purchasing power. Partially for this reason, imported consumer goods and foods enjoy a demand because the majority of the population has become so poor. Who, say, would prefer imported oil to our own Vologda oil if their income hadn't dropped? It is not quality, however, but our poverty--this is mainly what has made imported consumer goods and food competitive. We are getting goods intended for third world countries, for nations that don't sneer at them. In the first quarter of this year alone, of the imported meat and sausage products inspected by the State Trade Inspectorate, nearly 60 percent were rejected, as were over 70 percent of the alcoholic beverages and more than 40 percent of the tea and coffee. A piquant situation has come about. The poverty of the majority of the population has made it profitable to import cheap goods that have no demand abroad because of their low quality. The reverse is true as well: the huge incomes of a minority have made it profitable to import goods that do not enjoy great demand in the West, since they are too expensive. Whereas our output has proved less than competitive on the mass or the elite market. The overproduction and market crisis is being aggravated by the sharp cut in what are socially absolutely essential state expenditures. The budget deficit is no testimony to the fact that they are too great. Unlike years past, the budget deficit today is the consequence of low state income. Not that long ago, the state comprised a powerful military-industrial complex and generously financed science and education, whereas today there is no money for anything. Naturally, the social product has been cut. But expenditures for defense, science, and education have been cut even more. The only item that has increased is the cost of maintaining the state apparatus. This latter, however, comprises a relatively small portion of total expenditures and do not affect the financial situation substantially. The actual reasons for the budget deficit are well known: the loans to commercial banks at a negative interest rate, that is, for all intents and purposes, subsidies. This is the transfer into private hands of income from export-import operations; this is uncollected taxes from merchants and, naturally, the export of capital on an unprecedented scale. The flourishing of trade and banking structures costs society dear. Maximally high taxes on producers does not help, and an extremely harsh financial policy with respect to production is not going to save the situation. Financial policy in the sphere of turnover has turned out to be too soft. If the public funds that now go into trade and banking capital were to go into state income, we would now have the healthiest budget in the world--that is how mightily the country's population has been robbed in these years. They are keep insisting on trying to convince us of the need to live within our means. This is a rather banal truth. In fact, however, we are being forced to live much worse than the funds available would allow, to spend on defense, science, education, and the rest much less than what society's cash resources make possible and what is absolutely essential for the satisfaction of society's needs. The nonpayments crisis is going to continue to intensify until the demand for output is cut both on the part of the population and on the part of the state. This is what our radical reformers ought to have in mind if they really do intend to halt the decline in production. But are they aware of the scale and complexity of the task? A monopolized economy has a long hard time coming out of a crisis. By way of illustration, one could cite the United States. In 1929, a crisis broke out, but there was no improvement until the very beginning of World War II. Whereas our market has been deformed to a greater degree than during America's Great Depression. The government is preparing draft documentation for the introduction of a bill of exchange circulation. This is what the Finance Ministry sees as the final solution to the nonpayments problem. But who, one might ask, is going to honor a bill of exchange from our goods producers? The commercial banks? Possibly. But only on condition that the Central Bank is obligated to do a stock-taking of these bills of exchange. But this means inflationary financing, the emission of money not secured by goods. The bill of exchange is no salvation where the final solvent demand is limited and dropping. In order to overcome this overproduction and market crisis, which is classic by its very nature, and which has been called the nonpayments crisis here, it is essential first of all to limit the differentiation in incomes, what is called in the West an incomes policy. Think of F. Roosevelt. In a message to Congress in June 1935, he proposed introducing a progressive tax on major wealth and corporate profits. Congress approved the bill. In the West, people realized long ago that excessive concentration of wealth at one pole and poverty at the other is the basis for economic crisis as well as social conflict. Meanwhile, in our country, not only is no sensible incomes policy being carried out, on the contrary, here everything is being done for the fantastic enrichment of a minority and impoverishment of the majority. This does not exclude other causes for the nonpayments crisis. The government is constantly delaying the repayment of debts to agriculture and the fuel and defense industries and violating budgetary discipline for science, education, and culture. Meanwhile, all social and economic expenditures are being ascribed to the necessity of fighting inflation. There is some logic in this behavior, of course. Our economy does not have any natural, internal barriers to inflation. This means inflation can be weakened only by relying on artificial barriers, which in the final analysis will always come down to saving money. All this is correct, but unfortunately this is not an instance when the end justifies the means. Actually, that's not even so. What the government considers a goal (stable prices) in actuality is only a means, whereas the government looks on the actual goal (production) only as a means for stabilizing prices. Everything is confused in the Oblonskiy house! Releasing prices for the sake of stimulating production, and then cutting production in order to ease inflation, is insanity, not economic policy. The problem is not at all a matter of preferring inflation or decline but in extricating ourselves from the idiotic situation in which we have to choose between inflation and decline. This requires the restoration of state control over prices. Under our specific conditions, however, this kind of control will be sufficiently effective only if control over the movement of goods is established simultaneously. Right now we do not know, generally speaking, at which line between a market economy and a planned economy we will be able to halt the decline in production. Nonetheless, we must act without delay. The nonpayments crisis is entering its final stage, threatening to paralyze all industry.
