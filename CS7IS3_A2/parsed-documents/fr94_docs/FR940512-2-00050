Background The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;239) added a new title IX to the Public Health Service Act (the Act), which established the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) to enhance the quality, appropriateness, and effectiveness of health care services, and access to such services. (See 42 U.S.C. 299&hyph;299c&hyph;6 and 1320b&hyph;12.) The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research Reauthorization Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;410), enacted on October 13, 1992, extended the authorization of AHCPR and amended certain provisions related to the development of clinical practice guidelines. In keeping with its legislative mandate, AHCPR is arranging for the development, periodic review, and update of clinically relevant guidelines that may be used by physicians, nurses, other health care providers, educators, and consumers to assist in determining how diseases, disorders, and other health care conditions can most effectively and appropriately be prevented, diagnosed, treated, and clinically managed. Based on the guidelines produced, AHCPR oversees development, periodic review, and update of medical review criteria, standards of quality, and performance measures. Section 912 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 299b&hyph;1(b)), as amended by Public Law 102&hyph;410, requires that the guidelines: 1. Be based on the best available research and professional judgment; 2. Be presented in formats appropriate for use by physicians, nurses, other health care providers, medical educators, medical review organizations, and consumers; 3. Be presented in treatment-specific or condition-specific forms appropriate for use in clinical practice, educational programs, and reviewing quality and appropriateness of medical care;
