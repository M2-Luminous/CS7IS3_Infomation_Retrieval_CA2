Speaking at special passing out parade in Umtata, he said TDF members would use their professionalism and training to defend the transition to a free South Africa. "The primary mission of a new and integrated national South African Defence Force [SADF] will be the defence and consolidation of our democracy in South Africa. Once successful here we will extend this mission on a continental level to friendly and peaceful relations in the world." Gen Matanzima also said that because of its limited resources, the TDF had been directly dependent for training on the SADF. He thanked the SADF for their assistance, especially in sophisticated technical areas. "We could have benefited more from these courses but the use of Afrikaans (as medium of instruction) did make these training projects particularly difficult than they otherwise could have been." On Thursday the head of Transkei's Military Council, Major General Bantu Holomisa, will preside over a ceremonial lowering of the Transkei flag to symbolise the territory's reincorporation into South Africa.
