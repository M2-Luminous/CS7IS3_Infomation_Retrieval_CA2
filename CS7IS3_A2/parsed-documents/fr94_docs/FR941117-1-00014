FR941117-1-00014 FR941117-1-00004 Mental health professionals generally agree that it is best for the individual for services to be provided in the least restrictive setting possible. In addition, it is usually cost effective to do so. ``Least restrictive setting'' generally means that needed care should be provided on an outpatient basis in the community where the individual lives, as opposed to in an inpatient setting. This principle has been codified in Part B of the Education of the Handicapped Act, Public Law 94&hyph;142 (20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.). The Medicaid program has frequently been criticized for favoring institutional care over community-based care because the reimbursement rates are often viewed as being more adequate for inpatient care, and because eligibility may be more readily available for institutionalized individuals. As a result, institutional care may have been provided when it was not medically necessary, with possible detrimental effects on the patient, because alternative community care was not available. Various studies have estimated that from 39 to 95 percent of the psychiatric inpatient care provided is medically unnecessary. In fact, a wide array of outpatient mental health services can be funded under Medicaid, but for a variety of reasons these options have not been fully utilized by many States and outpatient providers. In recent years, however, many States have become concerned about dramatic increases in Medicaid expenditures for inpatient psychiatric care and have sought to assure that alternative care is available in the community. Many States have moved to increase funding for community services and instituted effective screening procedures for inpatient admissions. We are proposing revisions in ยง441.152, concerning certification of the need for inpatient care, that we believe will serve to support these efforts. These proposals are discussed in section V of this preamble. Inpatient Settings As discussed in Section II Statutory and Regulatory History of this preamble, existing regulations allow the provision of psychiatric inpatient care for individuals under age 21 in any psychiatric facility that is accredited by the Joint Commission and meets the other requirements in subpart D of 42 CFR part 441. The Joint Commission accredits a wide variety of health care organizations which may provide inpatient or outpatient services. Inpatient psychiatric services are currently being provided for individuals under age 21 in psychiatric hospitals in all but 7 States. Psychiatric hospitals must, under section 1905(h)(1)(A), meet the Medicare definition of ``psychiatric hospital'' contained in section 1861(f) of the Act. The regulatory requirements relating to psychiatric hospitals are specified in ยง482.60, Special provisions applying to psychiatric hospitals. In addition, 14 States provide inpatient psychiatric services for individuals under age 21 in psychiatric units in general hospitals. Three States cover the psychiatric L 21 benefit in nursing facilities, and 19 States cover this benefit in facilities called ``residential treatment facilities.'' Although nursing facilities (NFs) are a recognized category of inpatient provider, we decided against designating NFs as an alternative setting for the psychiatric L 21 benefit because NFs are primarily designed to provide geriatric nursing care and would not generally be appropriate for children and adolescents. In view of the fact that a number of States no longer use psychiatric hospitals to provide services to individuals under age 21 and a significant number of States now provide this inpatient benefit in psychiatric units of general hospitals, we propose to specify in the proposed regulations that States may use psychiatric units of general hospitals to provide acute psychiatric inpatient care under the psychiatric L 21 benefit either instead of, or in addition to, psychiatric hospitals.
