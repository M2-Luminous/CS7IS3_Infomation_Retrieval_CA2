The policy platform said a new government to succeed that of outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa should be drawn up "on a blank sheet of paper." The new government should be free from the framework of the current coalition that excludes the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), currently the primary opposition party. Party leader and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, however, told a news conference that Sakigake, which has 15 members in the House of Representatives, will not join a government "under the leadership of the present LDP." Sakigake's deputy chief, Shusei Tanaka, said, "This is not an appeal to the LDP for participation in a government." Sakigake (Harbinger) outlined its goals for the next government as coalition members struggled to come up with a new premier following Hosokawa's abrupt resignation announcement Friday. It also stipulated that the new government should observe the war-renouncing constitution and firmly resolve not to turn Japan into a major political or military power. Sakigake's basic stance is in stark contrast to the vision of Ichiro Ozawa, the coalition's chief strategist and cofounder of the alliance's core party Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party). Ozawa wants Japan's Self-Defense Forces to play a more active role in UN peacekeeping activities. Given that the Hosokawa administration faltered over a financial scandal, Sakigake's platform said the next government has a special obligation to live up to reform pledges. It also urged a more democratic and more transparent policy- making process. Last August the LDP was ousted after 38 years in power when Sakigake and Shinseito, whose members are former LDP parliamentarians, joined five other parties to form the coalition. The LDP failed to win a majority in July's general election. The seven ruling coalition parties remain divided over how to pick a successor to Hosokawa. Hosokawa declared his intention to resign last Friday to assume responsibility for involvement in scandals pertaining to his finances, and to break a deadlock in the Diet that had brought debate over the fiscal 1994 budget to a standstill. A rift is growing among the fractious coalition components, splitting the parties into two blocs. One comprises Shinseito, Komeito and Hosokawa's Japan New Party (JNP). The other consists of the largest component of the coalition, the Social Democratic Party (SDP), along with the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) and Sakigake. Shinseito and Komeito will soon join a new parliamentary group in the lower house established last Friday by the JNP. The SDP, the DSP and Sakigake have said they will not participate in the group because they fear it will be dominated by Shinseito and Komeito, official sources said. Shinseito and Komeito envisage forming a new party, while the SDP, the DSP and Sakigake favor a multiparty system, but with fewer parties than at present, they said.
