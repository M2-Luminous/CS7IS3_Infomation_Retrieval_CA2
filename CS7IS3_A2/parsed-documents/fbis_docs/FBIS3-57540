The Armenian side has asked Russia to reconsider the deployment of Russian troops on the Azerbaijani-Iranian border. What is your view on this issue? [Gulizade] Moscow is not discussing regional problems only with Yerevan. It discussed them with Baku first. Before [Armenian Foreign Minister] Papazyan and [Karabakh Foreign Minister] Gukasyan met Kozyrev in Moscow, Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov had already met and given an in-depth explanation of Azerbaijan's position to Kozyrev. During my meeting with Gasan Gasanov he told me that Kozyrev heard and understood all our positions. We are here to discuss a conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. I don't set great store by such press reports. Armenia has reportedly asked Russia to consider deploying Russian troops on the Azerbaijan-Iran border. Armenia can have no role in this issue. Azerbaijani troops are watching over and defending--they will defend--Azerbaijani borders. [Sherifov] It is also being said that at these talks the view was expressed that Azerbaijan should accept giving broader political status to Nagorno-Karabakh and should even concede Shusha. [Gulizade] On the issue of status, I can only say the following, which I have said before: Similar views were also published in the U.S. press to the effect that Armenia has suffered a political defeat in its struggle over Nagorno-Karabakh. Why? Because even if we consider the status of the former Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast [NKAO], they can't achieve a broader political status than that. In other words, the NKAO had a very broad political status. There can be no discussion about status. It is still very early. Therefore, first, Azerbaijani land must be liberated. No autonomy will ever be better than the autonomy that was. Shusha won't be conceded to them. Indeed, no Azerbaijani city will be conceded to them. I want to assure our television viewers and compatriots of this.
