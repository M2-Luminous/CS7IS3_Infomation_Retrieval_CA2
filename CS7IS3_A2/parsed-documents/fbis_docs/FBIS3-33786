In a statement to MENA, he said the paper, which contains many details, is an indirect attempt to give new interpretations to UN Security Council Resolution 242 on which the Arab-Israeli peace talks are based. Abu-Ziyad explained that in the morning session, the Palestinian delegation proposed forming a minicommittee to draft a new paper or amend the Russian-U.S. paper. The proposal was accepted. Abu-Ziyad said the Palestinians object to the Russian-U.S. paper because it tries to interpret the clauses of UN Resolution 242. The paper thus discusses the inadmissibility of the seizure of land by force without discussing Palestinian territory. It speaks about the region's states but ignores the region's peoples. This means that the paper ignores the Palestinian people and their rights. He said this approach is rejected because the Palestinian people are now passing through a stage of liberation and the establishment of a Palestinian state. This must be considered. He explained that any attempt to rearrange relations among the region's states must consider that another state, namely the Palestinian state, is about to be established. So, the Palestinian people's rights and interests must be taken into account. [passage omitted]
