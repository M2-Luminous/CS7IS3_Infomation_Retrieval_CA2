David Eppel, who has been listening to the evidence, reports here on two new versions of what happened on the morning of the crime; versions that surprised the bench and produced some intensive cross questioning. [Begin Eppel recording] What exactly were the orders given soldiers when Jewish settlers opened fire on Palestinians? Did Barukh Goldstein, the killer, carry the standard M-16 assault rifle or was it a shortened version of the Galil, the Galon. These were the critical questions as the inquiry commission probed deeper into the circumstances surrounding the massacre in Hebron. If, as four soldiers at the cave claimed in their testimony today, Goldstein carried an M-16, it not only contradicts the account given by their deputy company commander Rotem Ravivi, but the version accepted by everyone until now, including the defense establishment. Two of the four soldiers said they saw another settler, whom they were unable to identify, entering the Cave of the Patriarchs around the same time as Goldstein. He, they said, was carrying a Galon, the rifle Goldstein was assumed to have used. Other facts emerging today concerned shots fired by men on guard duty at the door of the Muslim place of worship. Some bullets fired into the air also hit the ceiling. Time and again at this afternoon's session, the bench wanted to hear from the soldiers giving evidence or members of the Tank Corps how they interpreted the open-fire orders. And to a man, they said they had been ordered not to shoot at Jewish settlers if they were using their guns on Palestinians. If they were being shot at, the directive was to take cover and try to remove the magazine from the gun. Several agreed they considered the order illogical, as they put it, and in two instances they expressed their reservations. But beyond that, under questioning, they agreed they would obey it even if they themselves had come under fire. [end recording] The commission goes into recess this evening and the proceedings resume again next week.
