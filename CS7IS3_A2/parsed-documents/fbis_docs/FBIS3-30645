FBIS3-30645 "dreeu026__a94016" FBIS-EEU-94-026-A Document Type:Daily Report 8 February 1994 ANNEX Bulgaria Berov Defends Cabinet in No-Confidence Debate AU0402163294 Sofia BTA in English 1441 GMT 4 Jan 94 AU0402163294 Sofia BTA Language: English Article Type:BFN [Excerpts] Sofia, February 4 (BTA) -- The National Assembly debated the motion made by the parliamentary group of the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) for a vote of no confidence in Prof. Lyuben Berov's government motivating by the cabinet's "incompetence to perform the duties it is assigned by the Constitution regarding the enforcement of law and order and guaranteeing people's safety" and by its "actions leading to crime escalation and to cases of law enforcement authorities blending with organized crime." So far the SDS has tabled four motions for no confidence in the cabinet formed under the mandate assigned to the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and Freedoms and elected at the end of 1992 thanks to the support of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), the New Union for Democracy (NSD, a parliamentary group set up by MP's who split or were expelled from the SDS), three of the no confidence motions were voted down. Setting out the arguments for the no confidence vote, Ms. Ekaterina Mikhaylova, deputy floor leader of the parliamentary SDS, said that the government had not only allowed "crime to grow enormously, but let criminals form large organized groups of the mafia type, blend with state authorities and get important economic sectors under their control." She recalled the cases of what she described as escalating gangland fighting, accusing the cabinet and the Interior Ministry in particular of inaction. The reasons for the helplessness of the executive branch and of the Interior Ministry in curbing crime can hardly be said to stem from the lack of laws, Mrs. Mikhaylova said. In her view, widespread corruption at the Interior Ministry makes it impossible for its members, called upon to protect the lives and security of Bulgaria's citizens, to fight crime in this country. The cabinet unanimously backed Interior Minister Viktor Mikhaylov, thus shouldering the responsibility for the chaos at the Interior Ministry and growing crime, Ms. Mikhaylova stressed. [passage omitted] Answering the accusations against the cabinet in parliament today, Prime Minister Berov said that "there is more to rising crime than the cases which the SDS lists in its arguments for the no confidence vote." "The attempts to represent crime as street clashes among criminals are actually aimed to conceal how deep the roots of crime go. This may be to the interest of those who made the no confidence motion, but it is definitely not to the interest of the nation," the prime minister said. He reminded that in 1990- 1992 (when the SDS was in power), 15,000 Interior Ministry employees were either dismissed or left of their own will. "I would not describe this as an open attempt to politicize the Interior Ministry in 1992 again and make it serve certain narrow partisan interests," Prof. Berov said. Recalling that the government programme as a whole and its section on crime control in particular were linked to the passage of much needed laws on establishing and maintaining a new rule of law, Prime Minister Berov accused parliament of inaction. "Parliament has not passed yet the most urgently needed amendments to the Penal Code, the Code of Criminal Procedure, and the Sojourn of Aliens Act, though it emerged that some 65,000 foreigners reside in this country unregistered," he stressed. "The SDS has been doing its best to prevent the passage of a law on the organization of the judiciary," Prof. Berov said. Stressing that the government bears its share of responsibility for fighting crime, Prof. Berov said all incidents listed in the motives for the no-confidence vote are subject to investigation by the Interior Ministry. Most criminals have been detected but not tried yet, Prof. Berov said. "The government will be uncompromising about everything within its powers. I assure you that the police are at their post, in full control of the situation in the country," Prof. Berov stressed, adding that the government would continue to prioritize fighting crime and view it with responsibility but would not allow crime problems to be politicized. "I can well understand certain claims for decisive action by the government, for more attention to social affairs, the structural adjustment of the economy and the land reform, but I strongly object to attempts at wasting parliament's time and blocking the government's work. This is an irresponsible tactic adopted by the present SDS leadership," the prime minister said. [passage omitted] At the end of his speech in parliament today, the prime minister expressed his conviction that "There is a nationally responsible majority in parliament and if it believes the government can stick to the chosen path of reform, of ending the country's international financial isolation and economic crisis, this will mean support for future more decisive steps to control crime and strengthen the state in the name of the nation and Bulgaria." The debates on the no-confidence vote went on for about five hours. Interior Minister Viktor Mikhaylov went to hospital yesterday and did not attend the sitting. Mainly MP's of the SDS and the BSP took the floor. In their statements MP's of the SDS repeatedly stressed the need for new parliamentary elections. After a regular meeting of the SDS top leadership, the National Coordinating Council, on Tuesday, it was announced that if the government survived the no-confidence vote or the 1994 budget was approved, the SDS leadership and parliamentary group would discuss a boycott of parliament's sittings. MP's of the ASP repeatedly stated that no parliamentary force wants early parliamentary elections now and the motion for a no-confidence vote is intended to waste time. According to parliament's rules of procedure, the motion can be put to the vote 24 hours after the end of debates at the earliest. In this case the vote will be taken on Wednesday [9 February] at the earliest. The MP's decided to vote by secret ballot.
