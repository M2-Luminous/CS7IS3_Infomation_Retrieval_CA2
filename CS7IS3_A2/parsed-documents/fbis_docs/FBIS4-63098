Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko voiced that opinion at a meeting with journalists yesterday. As you know, he has sent the State Duma a draft law "On State Protectionism Toward the Russian Mass Media" by way of a legislative initiative. Vladimir Shumeyko believes that all the mass media, apart from promotional and erotic publications, should be exempt from profits tax. The draft law that he is proposing contains the following stance: "The editorial offices of mass media, publishing houses, printing enterpries, television and radio companies, news agenices, and a number of other organizations 'are not liable to value added tax, tax on enterprises' land and property, or profit tax in respect of the proportion payable into the federal budget.'" The government has sent a similar law to the State Duma.
