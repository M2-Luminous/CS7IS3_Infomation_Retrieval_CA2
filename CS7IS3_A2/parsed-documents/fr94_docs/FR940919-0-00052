ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: As part of the Agency's Land Disposal Restrictions (LDR) program, EPA is today promulgating treatment standards for the newly identified organic toxicity characteristic (TC) wastes (except those managed in Clean Water Act (CWA) systems, CWA- equivalent systems, or Class I Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) injection wells), and for all newly listed coke by-product and chlorotoluene production wastes. The required treatment standards for these wastes must be met before they are land disposed. EPA is also requiring ignitable characteristic wastes with a high total organic carbon (TOC) content and toxic characteristic pesticide wastes, that are being disposed in Class I nonhazardous waste injection wells, to either be injected into a well that is subject to a no-migration determination, or be treated by the designated LDR treatment method. Promulgation of these treatment standards for the newly identified and listed wastes and promulgation of the dilution prohibitions for high TOC ignitables and pesticides fulfills requirements of a proposed consent decree between EPA and the Environmental Defense Fund, and a settlement agreement between EPA, the Hazardous Waste Treatment Council, and a number of environmental groups including the Natural Resources Defense Council. EPA is also making a major improvement in the Land Disposal Restrictions program in order to simplify and provide consistency in the requirements. EPA is establishing a single set of requirements, referred to as universal treatment standards, that apply to most hazardous wastes. EPA is also simplifying the Land Disposal Restrictions program by reducing paperwork for the regulated community, and improving guidance to make compliance easier. EPA is also publishing clarifying guidance regarding treatability variances, which largely restates previous Agency statements. Finally, EPA is modifying the hazardous waste recycling regulations which will allow streamlined regulatory decisions to be made regarding the regulation of certain types of recycling activities. DATES: Effective date: The final rule is effective on December 19, 1994. Section 266.100 and Appendix VIII are effective September 19, 1994. Applicability dates: For high TOC D001 (40 CFR 148.17) and halogenated pesticides wastes (40 CFR 148.17) disposed in Class I nonhazardous injection deep wells, the compliance date is September 19, 1995. For radioactive waste mixed with the newly listed or identified wastes, or soil and debris contaminated with such mixed wastes (40 CFR 268.38), the compliance date is September 19, 1996. Although the effective date of today's rule is December 19, 1994, facilities will be in compliance if they meet the universal treatment standards (UTS) before the 90-day period ends.
