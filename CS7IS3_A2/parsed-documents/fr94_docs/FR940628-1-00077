There is only one standard van with a critical sliding velocity below 16.73 kph. Its rollover risk is predicted to decrease 17 percent if its critical sliding velocity were to increase 12 percent. A 12 percent increase in critical sliding velocity represents a change of 1.65 kph, or four increments. A complete discussion of these analyses can be found in the paper ``Potential Reductions in Fatalities and Injuries in Single Vehicle Crashes as a Result of a Minimum Stability Standard'' in the docket.
