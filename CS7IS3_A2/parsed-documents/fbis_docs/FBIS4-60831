Before leaving for Russia on Friday deputy group head A. Chilingarov told ITAR-TASS the voting was a historic stage in the life of South Africa divided in the recent past by racial barriers. "We have visited many areas of residence of white and black communities and talked to representatives of various political parties, officials and average voters," he said. "We were most impressed by activeness of the population, enthusiasm of Africans who have been given the right to vote for the first time, and the atmosphere of friendliness in meters-long lines to the polling stations." In his opinion, some drawbacks in the elections were caused by the absence of registration lists, which resulted in a sharp shortage of ballot sheets. This may give a reason for doubts in case of any disputes. The Russian observer mission included V. Sheynis, G. Seleznev and I. Novitskaya. In their opinion, the South African elections signify a transition from confrontation to cooperation and show the will of representatives of all races and political convictions to national reconciliation and solution of disputable issues exclusively by peaceful civilized methods. The parliament members noted genuine interest of South Africans in Russia and their striving to develop fruitful and friendly relations with it.
