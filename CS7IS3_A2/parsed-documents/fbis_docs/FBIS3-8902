However, rump Yugoslavia, known formally as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) and comprised of Serbia and Montenegro, envisages introducing visas for UNPROFOR members, the newspaper reported. The force's mandate, extended on October 4, is due to expire March 31. "The FRY considers the UNPROFOR's presence in ex-Yugoslavia is necessary until a political agreement has been concluded on the existing problems," the paper quoted FRY Prime Minister Radoje Kontic as saying in a letter to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. Rump Yugoslavia "supports the Vance (peace) plan (in parts of Croatia under Serb secessionist control) and wants it to be strictly applied," Kontic added. However, he recalled that rump Yugoslavia was hesitant about the force being staffed by countries which dominated the region in the past, such as Austria, Turkey and Germany. Meanwhile the government committee on cooperation with the UNPROFOR decided, at a session chaired by Kontic, to introduce visas for UN peacekeepers. The government was to confirm the move shortly and decide what date the visa requirement should start, the newspaper said.
