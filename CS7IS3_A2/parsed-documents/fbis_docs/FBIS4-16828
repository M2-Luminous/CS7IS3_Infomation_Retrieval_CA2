"This explains the importance of the Moscow meeting between Chairman of the PLO Executive Committee Yasir 'Arafat and Russian President Boris Yeltsin," he added" The Palestinian representative said the meeting was "exceptionally important". In his opinion, it was a logical continuation of the consistent efforts lately exerted by the Russian diplomacy in the Middle East. Moscow has always expressed concern over the situation in the region and has done its best to achieve stability there. "We are thankful to Russia for its understanding of our concerns and anxieties, understanding of the legality of our rights for which we are striving. We are thankful to it for its good offices, which it is ready to offer us," Hamid stressed. He expressed the hope that the Russian president would use his influence to convince Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin during the latter's forthcoming trip to Moscow that Israel should fulfil the terms of the agreement on the settlement principles, signed by the PLO and Israel in Washington last September. "The principle of Palestinian self-government will remain a dead letter as long as the Israeli troops remain on the occupied territories," Hamid stated.
