Zhirinovskiy will arrive in Finland next week with a Russian parliamentary delegation. Many European countries have closed their doors to Zhirinovskiy, who expresses ultranationalistic views. President Martti Ahtisaari does not see any problems in the visit of the controversial politician. [Begin Ahtisaari recording] Well, that was expected because the invitation was sent, and in that sense there is no surprise there, at least not in my case. It was open as to who would be included in the delegation. Everybody who can get a visa to Finland is welcome. [end recording] [Announcer] Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto also takes a relaxed view about Zhirinovskiy's visit to Finland. Haavisto said that he heard about the visit at the Eduskunta. [Begin Haavisto recording] He will mainly be a guest of the Eduskunta and I have received the information from the Eduskunta that he is coming. I do not think there will be any very disorderly conduct because he is a representative of an official delegation and of course, one should take things as they come. [end recording] [Announcer] Zhirinovskiy will take part in a seminar on Tuesday and Wednesday [5-6 April] at the Eduskunta. The seminar will discuss Russia joining the Council of Europe.
