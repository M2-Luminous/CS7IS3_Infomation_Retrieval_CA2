It was pointed out that to all appearances the political confrontation in the Supreme Soviet and in the republic has somewhat lessened, but the economic crisis is on the increase. [Hryb] Not even one of the former USSR republics has determined its state structure. We as such do not have one. The old structure was destroyed but it has not been replaced by a new one. I will use all my efforts to establish a firm presidential rule and, without doubts, cooperation with Russia. This does not stand in the way of developing political and economic relations with Western countries. One is welcome to work in this direction but priority should be given to relations with the Russian Federation since our roots and our economic ties are there.
