It is the same United States which had secured an important concession in the post-war years; the granting of a waiver that agricultural policy and trade in agricultural goods should be exempted from the GATT rules. This was a time when the US pursued a policy of extensive subsidies that kept the American farm prices high, a policy that led to the generation large farm surpluses. India as one of its founder-members is among the 116 which are likely to reach an 'agreement' by December 15. What is in store for it? It has been estimated by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) that a GATT agreement could enrich the world by as much as $270 billion by the year 2002 AD. Indian economy is apprehensive about most of the liberalisation aspects. So, there is no denying that the Indian pie out of the amount estimated is likely to be very small and the cost of getting that pie also remains unestimated. But, we are likely to be one of those signatories whose voices were not heeded. The Draft Final Act (DFA) or the Dunkel Draft, as it is popularly known, envisages for patents rights to be available to both products and processes. At present, the Indian Patents Act of 1970 gives patent rights for processes and not for products in cases of food, medicines and substances produced through chemical processes. Even for the processes of these products, the patent period seven years from the date of application or five years from the date of sealing of the patent, whichever is earlier. The DFA stipulates a minimum of 20 years for every process and product. It is feared that the market prices of various medicines, which are lowest in India, will go beyond the reach of the poor class. In the field of agriculture it means granting of products and processes patent to all bio-technological innovations. This means that all plants and animals growing outside purely natural surroundings can be patented, and further that, even natural plant varieties should be protected by a sui generis system. This has the potential implication of disallowing Indian farmers to keep aside a part of their products for seed. Right to seeds GATT Director General Peter Sutherland has though put this fear to rest. In his recent visit to India, he has said that farmers' right to retain a part of their crop as seed in subsequent crops would be completely protected, since the DFA did not envisage any change. He clarified that even informal exchanges of seeds, as exists in the country, could continue. But, commercial sale would not be possible. In the area of subsidies of agriculture it has been pointed out that the aggregate support measures (subsidies) calculated on the basis of norms suggested in the DFA, amounts to either negative or negligible for most of the crops cultivated in India. The DFA provides for a maximum limit of 10 per cent of aggregate subsidies. In this case too, Mr Sutherland has said that agricultural subsidy in India would not be affected as Indian concern to maintain the food security system was fully understood by the contracting parties to the GATT. Textile being one of the most important segments of our exports sector is causing more anxiety than anything else. India demands higher percentage of integration of the clothing and textiles sector in GATT in the beginning of the transition period, once the Uruguay Round results are put in place. India has termed the present DFA proposal of 10 years transition period for integration as a back-loaded one. The demand for a front-loaded arrangement received a setback when Mr Bill Clinton's administration conceded to its Congressmen from textile-producing States, during NAFTA debate, that it will demand the 'longest possible phase-out' of an integration of the textile and clothing sector into GATT. Trade in services is another area which is being debated. The DFA proposals require that foreign service enterprises be treated at par with the domestic enterprise. But ruling out of free cross-border movements of persons, (except some vague provisions for temporary migration of skilled labour, hedged by requirements of reciprocity) ensures that this benefit goes entirely to the development countries. Although services contribute more to the national income than industry and agriculture in India and are developing fast, it is still at a very pre-mature stage vis-a-vis developed countries. The requirements under the Trade Related Investment Measures (TRIMS), like waiving of restrictions on multi-national companies, stipulate use of a minimum of local content in production or impose on them any export obligations which have already been done away with. Although, it sounds like succumbing to the masters of the unipolar world, one point is noteworthy. The DFA proposals offer a much better deal on patents than the countries like South Korea, China and Mexico, which went into an agreement with USA to avoid trade retaliation under Special 301. China, for example, has agreed to provide protection to all the drugs patented in the US since 1986. As India will have to bring these into force only in the year 2003 AD, after the 10-year transition period is over, it is getting a clear advantage of 17 years. And the fact that the Indian bargaining power in the trade is very low, the best which can be expected is that some of its demands on patents, textile and services are incorporated.
