A recent national working meeting on the registration of foreign-funded enterprises here disclosed that foreign investment is expanding from the coastal areas to interior parts of the country. A survey shows that China had 25,389 registered foreign-funded enterprises in 1990. Included were only 333, accounting for 1.3 percent of the total, in central and western parts of the country, and the Tibet Autonomous Region was a virtual blank check regarding foreign investment. By the end of 1993, however, the number of foreign-funded enterprises in central and western China had climbed to 4,913, accounting for 2.9 percent of the total. More and more large foreign-funded projects were begun in China starting from 1991. At present, China has more than 7,000 large projects each with an investment of at least 10 million U.S. dollars. Included are about 4,000 set up last year. These projects are mainly involved in the fields of real estate development, communications, telecommunications, basic industries and high-tech projects. According to the meeting, the proportion of enterprises solely funded by foreign business people in the foreign-funded sector has risen remarkably since 1991. By the end of last year, China had 20,047 registered enterprises solely funded by foreign business people, accounting for 24 percent of all foreign-funded enterprises registered on the Chinese mainland. According to the meeting, foreign business people have widened their business scope over the past 14 years from hotels, electronics, building materials, machinery, textiles, light and textile industries, medicine and agriculture to energy development, transportation and telecommunications, basic industries, science and education, the arts, banking and insurance. In the past three years, the volume of foreign investment in service industries has increased remarkably. Most of the foreign-funded projects are productive industrial enterprises. A survey shows that foreign-funded enterprises had an average investment of 2.28 million U.S. dollars each by the end of 1993, and 92 percent of the 167,000 enterprises had an investment of less than five million U.S. dollars each. To better draw foreign investment, the Chinese Government has approved the establishment of 54 economic and technology development zones and 13 bonded parks. Recently it permitted Singapore to set up an eight-square-kilometer science and industry park in Suzhou, an economically-booming city in east China's Jiangsu Province. While improving investment conditions, the Chinese Government has paid attention to the formulation of laws and regulations, thus enhancing the confidence of foreign business people in making investment in the country. In addition, China's abundant labor and technical forces, the improved industrial foundation and the vast domestic market have drawn the interest of foreign business people.
