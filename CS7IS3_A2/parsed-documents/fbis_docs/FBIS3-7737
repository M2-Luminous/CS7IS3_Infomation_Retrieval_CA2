During the stopover at the airport in Karachi in southern Pakistan, Vladimir Meciar was received by a minister authorized by Prime Minister Bhutto, who was on a foreign trip at the time. Apart from political and economic issues, they discussed cooperation in tourism. In this respect, the Pakistani side was interested in the conditions for foreign capital entry into our market. A government delegation and a group of businessmen will come to Slovakia and examine the potential and forms of possible capital investments in our country. The government aircraft landed in Ankara after a four-hour flight from Karachi. Vladimir Meciar met Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin there. Their conversation, which lasted approximately 30 minutes, focused, apart from political issues, on the problems of forming a Slovak-Turkish intergovernmental commission for economic cooperation. One of the other topics they discussed was a joint armaments program and the drafting of a plan on cooperation in the sphere of building oil and gas pipelines. The two sides also agreed that it was necessary to prepare a new cultural agreement. [passage omitted]
