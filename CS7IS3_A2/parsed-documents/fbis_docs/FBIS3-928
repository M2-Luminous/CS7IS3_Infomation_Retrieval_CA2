The demand came during a march by thousands of ANC supporters to call for free political activity in the township. The marchers had handed over the memorandum at the Umlazi magistrate's court when they were fired upon by another group, SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio reported. Police used teargas and fired shots to separate the two groups as the ANC marchers made their way home. The protest followed the weekend occupation of Umlazi's King Goodwill Zwelithini Stadium by hostel dwellers ahead of an ANC election rally there. ANC leaders, including Chairman Thabo Mbeki and Transkei military ruler Maj-Gen Bantu Holomisa, were incensed when police failed to move the crowd from the stadium, forcing them to address their supporters on Umlazi's Mangosuthu highway. On Tuesday, several thousand ANC supporters delivered a memorandum to Chief Magistrate Louis Radyn, calling for the ISD and KZP's immediate withdrawal from Umlazi. Mr Radyn said the memo would be forwarded to the government and the Transitional Executive Council [TEC]. The memorandum called for the deployment of the National Peacekeeping Force or forces under TEC control in Umlazi, and for the Independent Electoral Commission to act against those who organised Sunday's occupation of the stadium. "The ISD had no legal right to prevent us from using the stadium...and attack us with teargas and live ammunition," it read. KZP district commissioner Brig Alwyn Burger confirmed one woman was shot dead in the township early on Tuesday. Residents claimed the KZP shot her, but Brig Burger said there was no evidence to that effect and that the claim would be investigated. At the magistrate's court a potentially ugly situation was averted when about 300 Inkatha Freedom Party supporters massed several hundred metres away. Police kept them at bay, and they dispersed soon afterwards. The mood was jubilant and festive, with a sea of people dancing to the song "now is the time, the time is now" blaring from loudspeakers. Not long after the crowd arrived, the South African flag was pulled down by frenzied supporters, ripped and replaced by two fluttering ANC flags. Burning tyres and stone barricades erected to enforce a stayaway impeded progress through the sprawling township and thousands of workers failed to arrive at work in the city. The Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] meanwhile claimed a "double assassination attempt" had been made on Umlazi mayor and IFP women's Brigade regional secretary Maria Xulu early on Tuesday and that it was possibly linked to the ANC march. IFP spokesman Ed Tillett said a group fired on Ms Xulu's home in H section about 4.20AM, and her bodyguards returned fire. He said the attackers returned 10 minutes later and again fired a volley of shots at her home. They were again repelled.
