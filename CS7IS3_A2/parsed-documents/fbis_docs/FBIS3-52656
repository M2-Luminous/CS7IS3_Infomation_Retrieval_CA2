In his meeting this morning with the media leaders, he said that the revolution's serious work to implement the principles of independence was what instigated others to adopt a hostile attitude in their dealings with Sudan, a matter which instigated us to be even more committed to our independence. In this context he pointed out that opening al-Tahadi [defiance] road was a confirmation of independence. Lieutenant General al-Bashir stressed the need for numerous similar great projects in order to get Sudan out of the state of inherited poverty. He stressed the importance of constructing al-Hamdab dam, which will provide 1.250 million mw of electricity in addition to irrigation water. [passage omitted]
