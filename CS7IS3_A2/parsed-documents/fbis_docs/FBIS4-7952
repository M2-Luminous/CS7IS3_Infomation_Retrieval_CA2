Andras Domany reports: [Domany] If the deputies can conclude the past four years with a clear conscience, it is because they managed to lay the foundation of the institutional legal system of the new and democratic Hungary. This, even if haltingly, operates without hitches -- an achievement of both the government coalition and the opposition equally, President Arpad Goncz said. He praised the work that was accomplished and said that one of the reasons why the assembly could not manage to gain the heart of the country completely was that the country had expected miracles from the newborn democracy. However, fate, and not the National Assembly, failed to deliver that miracle. Although an inappropriate tone was sometimes used, it was the failing of a few. Hopefully, the head of state continued, the majority of those deputies saying farewell would be able to use their experience in their next tenure. There are things that the assembly still has to do, Goncz said. The commissioner of human rights was not elected and the assembly representation of minorities has not been settled. The head of state is to submit a bill to the next assembly about amending the Penal Code, which will serve to prevent racial discrimination. He also considers the media law and social supervision of the public service radio and television important, deeming it inadmissible that the lack of these laws should create a source of ceaseless and poisonous internal political tension and put in doubt the enforcement of the freedom of expression of opinion and freedom of speech granted by the constitution. Hoping for a fair and clean election fight, Arpad Goncz said the following: Whatever the people's choice is, we have a duty to take heed of that, winners and losers alike, for the mutual aim remains the same -- the good of the country and the service of the people. He hoped that the Hungarian people, owing to its wisdom, would emerge victorious from the elections. After this, Prime Minister Peter Boross asked permission to speak. He said that the performance of the National Assembly over the past four years may perhaps be disputed today, but looking back from a distance it will be seen as an historic period marking the change of the epoch and the regime. He also mentioned the election period, hoping that it will take place in an atmosphere of fairness and that everybody will participate, which would serve the prosperity of the country ensuring that in the next assembly everybody could meet in a good and friendly atmosphere. The legislative work will cease now, but the government will function, Peter Boross said. During its operation, among other things, the government will create all possible conditions for clean elections and the election of an assembly, the composition of which is realistic and meets the public will. Furthermore, this government, for the first time in several decades, will give a detailed account of its four-year activity, the prime minister said. After this, the National Assembly began its last working day. [passage omitted]
