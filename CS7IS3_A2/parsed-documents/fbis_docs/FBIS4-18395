I am happy that, contrary to expectations certain circles tried to create, the 27 March elections were held in peace, without incidents. I am at peace before you. The True Path Party emerged as the first party from these elections. We are the first party throughout the country. I extend my gratitude to our nation for the trust it showed in us. The Turkish people have faith. They are attached to their traditions. Nobody should try to use religion as a tool for politics. We are the guarantee for freedom of religion and freedom of conscience. We are also the guarantee of the basic tenets of the state, mainly secularism. Do not worry. The law of the Turkish Republic is binding and valid for everyone and everywhere in Turkey. Now is not the time to look back any more. We must look forward. I am saying it clearly: We will fulfill our promises. I saw once again that our people always know the right thing to do. Our people are aware of our struggle against terrorism. They appreciate that we managed to do in seven to eight months what was not done in eight years. With your contributions, with your trust in us, 1994 will be a final turning point in the struggle against terrorism. I will fulfill my promise. Terrorism will fall far back on Turkey's agenda. My dear citizens, we are now ready for another struggle. A struggle as important as the one against terrorism. The struggle against an economy which over many years has been turned into a big tangled knot. Tomorrow, together with Mr. Karayalcin, our coalition partner and leader of the Social Democratic Populist Party, we will disclose a brand new economic implementation plan. Tomorrow will be the start of a new era, the harbinger of improvement that will follow. We will carry out radical reforms no political government or leader dared implement before us. We will lay the foundation of structural changes in the economy. Before all else, we will carry out a revolution of mentality, of mind sets. These are difficult decisions. Maybe, in the first stage, they will hurt. However, we do not have an alternative. This is not a matter of choice. It is certainly not a political maneuver. Nor does it have any arbitrary aspects whatsoever. Together, we will make a sacrifice for the future of our country, for the future of our children. Everyone will put his share in this sacrifice in line with his or her economic ability. We will make social justice and social consensus sovereign. You gave me your consensus in the fight against terrorism. We made progress. Now it is the turn of the economy. We will break the chains of the economy. We will break the chains of its difficulties. We will eliminate the vicious circle of debts, interest, and foreign exchange. We will save our youths from being jobless in the future. We will really crush the head of the monster called inflation. We will make the people's money the people's money. We will make the Turkish money, our national monetary unit, trustworthy. We will grow economically with sound resources. We will do this so that Turkey's future will not be blocked, so that it will be open and well-lit. This will be a very comprehensive program. It will be a restructuring, a kind of rejuvenation, never tried before and involving all the sectors. I am not hiding it: In the beginning we might have difficulties. Protests might come not only from our civil servants, workers, shopkeepers, and farmers, but from the wealthy sectors as well. However, you should know that if our nation is to put these difficulties behind and look to the future with confidence, we must take this medicine. We might have temporary difficulties, but we will certainly gain a healthy constitution. We will erase all the bad elements of this inherited responsibility. We will break our links to the past, to the mistakes of the past, and start a new era. I trust your patriotism. That is what makes us different. This is the spirit and mentality which defines our political character. My dear citizens, I am calling on you: Let us win this war together, hand in hand. Let us get rid of the dark clouds hovering over the country. Let us make our current difficulties the harbingers of a happy future. Let us emerge victorious from the economic liberation war. Our nation is strong enough to succeed in that. Now is not the time for politics, for petty calculations, or for egotistical interests. We are responsible before history. Let us write our history. We are responsible for our future. We are responsible toward our children. We all have a duty to perform at this historic turning point. As individuals, as a nation, we will succeed in performing this difficult duty. History will cite 5 April 1994 as the turning point of Turkey's economic liberation. Together, with dedication, we will end this dark period and create light. Everything for a proud and powerful Turkey. Everything for a modern, dynamic, and peaceful Turkey. Everything for a developed, faithful, stable, leader that is Turkey. I greet you all with respect.
