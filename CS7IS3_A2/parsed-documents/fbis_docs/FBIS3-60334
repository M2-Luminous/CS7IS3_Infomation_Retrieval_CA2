It is the first time that a western country has signed such an agreement with Russia. Speaking at the signing with Aleksander Kouzmitski, [name as received] Deputy Minister of Science and Technology, Mr Gummer said: "I am delighted that the UK is at the forefront bringing the benefits of energy conservation to Russia and that my Department's Energy Efficiency Office has played a major role in making this possible. This country has companies that are the leading edge in this field and have much to offer." "I warmly welcome this very practical sign of co-operation between our two countries which I hope will blossom further. Our companies can benefit through new trade opportunities while the people of Russia will have warm, but energy efficient homes." "All energy conservation is good for the planet. The more energy efficient Russia can become the better it is for everyone as pollution is reduced and fuel saved." Through the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Energy Committee's Energy Efficiency 2000 programme demonstration projects are being set up in Eastern Europe including Russia. British companies including Rolls Royce are interested in taking part in a scheme aimed at improving energy efficiency in 10,000 Moscow flats owned by Gasprom, the Russian gas company. As the projects are established it is hoped their ideas will spread throughout the country offering increasing business opportunities to British companies. The improvements would be paid for from the saving in energy bills. Note to Editors Also present at the signing at the Department of the Environment in Marsham Street was Mr Boris Pamkin, Russian Ambassador, and representatives of Rolls Royce, March Consulting Group, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, the Russian Federation, the Foreign and Commonwealth office and the Department of the Environment's Energy Efficiency Office.
