Grain and edible oil prices have risen sharply since November because of anticipation of higher prices, rumors, untimely shipping, speculation by a handful of units, and other irregular factors. The price rise has also spread to pork and other major nonstaple food items. The rise in grain and edible oil prices has triggered panic buying in some localities, exacerbating people's fear of inflation. Following the situation with great interest, leading comrades of the CPC Central Committee and State Council have personally conducted investigations and solicited views from the masses. A number of measures to stabilize grain and edible oil prices have been announced one after another since mid-December. In particular, following the 25 December work conference convened by the State Council for keeping down grain and edible oil prices, governments at all levels took the matter seriously. They promptly took action by convening special meetings to make specific arrangements requiring retailers to mark the prices of grain and edible oil. The State Planning Commission, Internal Trade Ministry, Railways Ministry, State Administration for Industry and Commerce, and other departments have either convened meetings or issued circulars to outline specific arrangements for fully utilizing major channels of circulation; for organizing the procurement, allocation, shipping, and marketing of grains; and for stepping up the monitoring and supervision over market prices. At present, state-owned grain shops in large and medium-sized cities across the country -- including some prefectures, cities, county towns, and market towns -- sell grain at uniform marked prices with unlimited supply. The prevailing marked prices in the localities are as follows: standard flour, 0.55 to 0.65 yuan a jin; Class-2 standard polished long-grained rice, 0.65 yuan a jin; and rapeseed oil, 3.2 to 3.5 yuan a jin. The state has sold 5 billion jin of reserve grains and 32,000 metric tons of reserve commodity edible oil. Shaanxi, Shandong, Anhui, Beijing, and many other provinces and cities have also sold local reserves to stabilize grain and edible oil prices in their localities. To ensure implementation of the policy and measures of the CPC Central Committee and State Council, local price, grain, industry and commerce departments have dispatched personnel in force to monitor and supervise prices in the market. In Beijing alone, over 600 monitors make daily rounds of the grain stores. Thanks to the aforementioned measures, grain and edible oil prices have dropped in some localities. The state will implement a series of major reforms involving taxes, exchange rates, finance, banking, and investment in the New Year. Luo Zhiling pointed out: Implementation of these reforms will help build the basic framework of a socialist market economy. The steps and scope of reform will be big, covering all sectors and all trades. In formulating the program, we have taken the interest of all quarters -- the immediate interest of the broad masses of the people in particular -- into consideration. Generally speaking, reform will not trigger widespread price hikes. In case it has some impact on certain sectors or commodities, the state will pay adequate attention to them and spare no efforts in devising reform plans and supporting measures to soften the impact on society. The total supply and demands will remain basically balanced in 1994. In the current year, we have plentiful grain resources; the grain output was 30 billion jin higher than in the previous year and we are well-stocked in grain. The state will take a variety of measures to increase the supply of edible vegetable oil. Supply and demand of home appliances, clothing items, and other articles for daily use are basically balanced and, in some cases, supply outstrips demand. We are entirely capable of ensuring adequate supply and keeping the prices relatively stable. The broad masses of the people can set their minds at rest. As for additional measures the government will take to keep the prices stable, Luo Zhiling said: We have made initial progress in stabilizing grain and edible oil prices. However, governments at all levels will continue to keep a close watch on the market. They will step up administration and monitoring of the market around the holidays to uncover problems and solve them in a timely fashion. The state will continue to organize well procurement, allocation, shipping, and marketing of grain, edible oil prices, and other essential materials and sell reserve grains to further bring down prices. To step up control and supervision of the prices, we will, in the near future, ask the State Council to publish "Provisions Concerning Marking the Prices of Commodities and Services" and "Procedures for Supervision Over the Prices of Daily Necessities and Services in Urban Areas." Price departments at all levels should organize and step up supervision and inspections in accordance with the two sets of regulations. They should earnestly investigate and prosecute illegal activities involving exorbitant profits by driving up prices and disrupting the market, conscientiously protect the interests of the consumers, and see to it that reform and opening up go forward smoothly. As we stabilize market prices, localities and departments must not raise prices or service fees under one excuse or another. State-run enterprises and establishments must take the lead in implementing, in an exemplary manner, the state laws and policies on prices and give full play to their role as the main channels for regulating goods and stabilizing prices. They must not take advantage of reform to drive up prices for the benefit of small groups. Violators, once caught, will be punished severely. We also hope that the broad masses of people will, as masters of the state, step up public supervision of the market prices.
