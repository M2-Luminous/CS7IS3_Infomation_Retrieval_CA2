FR940906-2-00069 FR940906-2-00059 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR National Park Service General Management Plan Amendment; Presidio of San Francisco, Golden Gate National Recreation Area; Availability of Final General Management Plan Amendment and Final Environmental Impact Statement Summary: Pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (P.L. 91&hyph;190, as amended), the National Park Service, Department of the Interior, has prepared a Final General Management Plan Amendment/Environmental Impact Statement (FGMPA/FEIS) that describes and analyzes a proposed action and three alternatives for the future management and use of the Presidio of San Francisco, Golden Gate National Recreation Area, California. The FGMPA/FEIS is being presented in two companion documents_the FGMPA, which describes the proposed action in detail; and the FEIS, which presents the proposal and three alternatives, along with the analysis of the environmental consequences of their respective implementations. The draft General Management Plan Amendment/Environmental Impact Statement (DGMPA/DEIS) were released for public review on October 21, 1993 (58 FR 54372), and the public comment period closed December 21, 1993. During this period, three informal meetings and five public meetings were held; written comments were also received. The FGMPA/FEIS contain responses to the comments received and modifications to the text as needed in response to the comments. The proposed action and alternatives all have been designed to protect and preserve exceptional resources and to meet planning objectives and goals for the future Presidio. They differ primarily in approach to overall management, level and extent of resource preservation and enhancement, and diversity and level of visitor programs. The proposed action, Alternative A, provides goals for creating a park setting where cultural and natural resources are preserved and enhanced; and major new programs are established through public/private partnerships to provide an understanding of those resources, encourage stewardship and cultural awareness, promote international exchange, and seek solutions to critical global problems. A federally chartered partnership institution would be created through congressional legislation to assist in managing park partners, and legislation would also be sought to include the former Public Health Service Hospital complex within the Presidio. Modifications have been made to the proposal based on public comment and clarification of Army re-use needs. The changes primarily relate to additional clarification regarding the amount and type of new construction, Army reuse, remediation of environmental hazards, the preservation of historic buildings, building demolition, the jobs/housing balance, addition of adjacent Lobos Creek undeveloped lots, tenant management, the type of partnership institution assisting with management, dog walking, Crissy Field parking and boardsailing access, Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District maintenance facilities, the importance of the Presidio's history and potential museum opportunities, affirmative action programs, Letterman complex reuse, and the Lobos Creek maintenance facility. Alternative B, the no action/minimum requirements option, uses existing authorities for management, provides fewer visitor programs and opportunities, and excludes the former Public Health Service Hospital from the park boundaries. Alternative C, the expanded open space, restoration and interpretation option, provides a high level of overall resource protection similar to Alternative A, but relies on existing management authorities, as in Alternative B. As with Alternative B, the Public Health Service Hospital is excluded from the park boundaries, and in addition, under this option, the Letterman Army Hospital and Research Center would be excluded. Alternative D, the partial military reuse option, shares Alternative B's lower level of overall resource protection and fewer visitor programs and opportunities, but is similar to Alternative A with respect to inclusion of the former Public Health Service Hospital and the necessity of obtaining legislation for new management authorities. Major impact topics assessed for the proposed action and alternatives include natural and cultural resources; traffic and transportation systems; city services; native plant communities; regional economy and employment; noise; and air quality.
