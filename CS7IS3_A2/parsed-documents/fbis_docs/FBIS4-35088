The Judicial Investigations Agency (OIJ) reported that Juan Crisostomo Trujillo Martinez was arrested on 24 June after he arrived in Costa Rica aboard a flight from Santa Fe de Bogota. Trujillo's arrest took place after U.S. Customs alerted the OIJ to the pending arrival of the Colombian, whom the United States has linked to the "laundering" of large amounts of Cali Cartel money. According to sources, Trujillo did not have contacts in Costa Rica. Rather, he arrived here after U.S. authorities set him up to travel to this Central American nation. The suspect, who remains in custody at a jail in San Jose, will be extradited to the United States within the next few days.
