FR940613-1-00051 FR940613-1-00006 This proposed rule's provisions defining ``fair consideration'' and specifying when the foreclosing holder may reject or outbid offers for the property are formulated to reflect the amount that the holder may bid at the foreclosure sale, or not reject during the foreclosure sale or thereafter, in order to recover on its loan or other obligation. In addition, there may be multiple security interests in a borrower's property held by secured creditors, which the definition of ``fair consideration'' must account for. Therefore, for a senior creditor, the term ``fair consideration'' is proposed to mean a cash amount that represents a value equal to or greater than the outstanding obligation owed to the holder (including the fees, penalties, and other charges incurred by the holder in connection with the property). ``Fair consideration'' is further proposed to indicate that the amount that will recover the holder's ``security interest'' in the property may vary depending on the seniority of the loan or other obligation that is being foreclosed upon. Specifically, a junior creditor may be required to outbid senior creditors in order to recover the value of its loan or other obligation. The definition of fair consideration therefore distinguishes between what junior or senior creditors may bid or not reject for purposes of maintaining the exemption. In addition, in order to avoid liability under law (for example, to the borrower), the foreclosing holder may be required to seek an amount at the foreclosure sale that is greater than the outstanding obligation owed to the foreclosing holder, or to sell the property in a different manner; therefore, the proposed rule does not require a holder to accept an offer of ``fair consideration'' if to do so would subject the holder to liability under federal or state law. In this way the proposed rule's provisions with respect to the sale or disposition of property will not conflict with the manner in which such sales are required to be conducted under general principles of law applicable to the holder and the disposition of the property including the UST. For purposes of this proposed rule, the definition of ``fair consideration'' is an objective, ``bright-line'' test to determine whether the foreclosing holder has an investment or other interest in the property that is not within the exemption, or whether the holder's post-foreclosure activities indicate that it continues to maintain its ownership indicia in the property primarily to protect a security interest, and is therefore within the protective ambit of the proposed rule. While a holder may use whatever means are reasonable and appropriate for marketing foreclosed-on property to establish that it is seeking to divest itself of property in an expeditious manner, this proposed rule also provides a mechanism by which a holder can definitely establish that it continues to hold indicia of ownership primarily to protect a security interest and is not an ``owner,'' for purposes of complying with the UST regulatory program, of foreclosed-on property. This mechanism is intended to act as another ``bright line'' to provide clear and unambiguous evidence that a holder is not the UST or UST system's ``owner'' following foreclosure: A holder choosing to avail itself of this bright line test must, within 12 months following the acquisition of marketable title, list the property with a broker, dealer, or agent who deals with the type of property in question, or advertise the property as being for sale or disposition on at least a monthly basis in either a real estate publication or a trade or other publication suitable for the property in question, or a newspaper of general circulation (defined as one with a circulation over 10,000, or one suitable under any applicable federal, state, or local rules of court for publication required by court order or rules of civil procedure) covering the area where the property is located. If the holder satisfies these criteria, the holder is considered to have complied with the requirement in the proposed rule that it is seeking to sell or otherwise divest the property in an expeditious manner. EPA also recognizes that market conditions, the condition of the property, and other factors may mean that despite reasonable efforts to expeditiously sell or divest foreclosed-on property, the property may not be quickly sold. Therefore, this regulation does not impose a time requirement for the ultimate disposition of foreclosed-on property. Provided that the property is being actively offered for sale by the holder and no offers of fair consideration are ignored, outbid, or rejected, foreclosed-on property may continue to be held by the holder without the holder being considered an ``owner'' of the UST or UST system for purposes of complying with the UST regulatory program, as detailed in this proposed rule. Regardless of the manner in which the foreclosing holder chooses to market the property, if at any time after six months following the acquisition of marketable title the holder rejects, or does not act upon within 90 days of receipt of, a written, bona fide, firm offer of fair consideration for the property, the holder will lose the protection of the proposed rule. Under this proposal, a ``written, bona fide, firm offer'' is a legally enforceable, commercially reasonable, offer, including all material terms of the transaction, from a ready, willing, and able purchaser who demonstrates to the holder's satisfaction the ability to perform. Where a holder outbids, rejects, or fails to act upon an offer of fair consideration, the holder is considered, for the purpose of the proposed regulatory exemption, to be maintaining its indicia of ownership in the property as protection for investment purposes, and not as security for the obligation. The proposed exemption from regulatory compliance would also permit a foreclosing holder to undertake actions with respect to the UST or UST system to protect or preserve the value of the secured asset. For example, a holder may determine that it needs to take certain actions with respect to an UST or UST system's operations in order to preserve the value of the foreclosed-on assets or to prevent a future release (such as by the removal of an UST or UST system's contents as described below), or to otherwise prepare property for safe public access incident to sale or liquidation of assets. Precisely because a holder in charge of an UST or UST system may need to take affirmative action with respect to the UST or UST system incident to foreclosure and with respect to any petroleum products that are known to be present, the proposal provides that such actions of dominion and control over the UST or UST system are considered necessary components of holding ownership indicia primarily to protect a security interest, provided such actions are undertaken to protect the asset's value and are not undertaken for investment purposes. Therefore, under this proposed rule, such mitigative or preventative measures are considered to be actions that are consistent with holding ownership indicia primarily to protect the security interest in the UST or UST system.
