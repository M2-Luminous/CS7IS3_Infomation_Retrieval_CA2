SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) is the national organization charged with administering federal funds provided for civil legal service to the poor. Southeast Louisiana Legal Services (SLLS) has been providing state support services in Louisiana since 1981. SLLS has agreed to transfer its LSC funding for the provision of state support services to LLCI. LLCI has been providing these services as a component of SLLS and will now provide these services as an independent grantee. The remainder of the 1994 state support grant to SLLS will be transferred to LLCI; thus LLCI will receive $94,314 in state support grant funding for the remainder of 1994. (LLCI will also receive the unexpended balance of LSC state support funds held by SLLS, with some adjustments). In 1995, LLCI will receive the full annualized allocation for Louisiana state support funding. Dated: May 24, 1994. John A. Tull, Director, Office of Program Services.
