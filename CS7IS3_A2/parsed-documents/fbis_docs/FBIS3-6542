Some bright signs continue to emerge in consumption, and business confidence "has virtually stopped deteriorating," but the labor situation continues to worsen gradually and overall and "economic growth remains weak," the central bank said in its monthly economic review. "While several economic indicators have recently improved, and the economy appears to have stopped weakening, this does not necessarily confirm that economic recovery is in the offing," the report says. It cannot be ruled out that a recovery may be building, but statistics do not confirm such a movement, a BOJ told reporters. Spending by manufacturers on plant and equipment continues to fall, and excess capital stock remains a drag on the economy, the report says. But such leading indicators as "machinery orders and construction starts appear to have stopped declining," it says. "Personal consumption remains weak," the report says, with gains in sales of refrigerators and personal computers, as well as the number of Japanese travelers. Large-scale retail and passenger car sales are down but the declines from year-earlier levels are slimming, it says. Housing investment remains strong, while public works spending has slowed in the last year and a half, the report says. Exports have picked up recently from a falling trend on stronger overseas demand and a fiscal year-end increase, it says, while ''imports, particularly consumer goods, have continued to increase.'' It notes that the BOJ's closely watched ''tankan'' survey of business sentiment, taken in February, found corporations predicting profits will begin to rise in the coming fiscal year, even as they again lowered their profit estimates for the business year ending this month. It cites a recent Ministry of International Trade and Industry report that industrial production rose in January from earlier large declines and is expected to swell in the following two months. But the report calls the rise a ''temporary surge toward the fiscal year end,'' and the underlying trend remains flat, the official said.
