Kozyrev, whose visit will last until 29 January, is to meet with Foreign Minister Qian Qichen in Beijing on Thursday. Moscow regards mutual relations with the PRC as a traditionally high-priority and independent direction of its foreign policy and as an important component part of its general strategy of ensuring national-state interests through partnership with the surrounding world. To a great extent we link cooperation with China with the prospects of fulfilling the unique Euro-Asiatic potential of Russia, the economic upsurge of the rayons of Siberia and the Far East and integration into the economic life of the Asia-Pacific region. The Russian side values highly the results achieved in recent years of cooperation with China that has been carried out on many levels and is satisfied with the stable and positive development along all paths of bilateral links. The bringing of Russian-Chinese relations on to a higher level -- that of constructive partners -- accords completely with the national interests of our countries and peoples, the head of the Russian Federation's foreign policy department told ITAR-TASS correspondents at Beijing airport. The coming talks and meetings in Beijing are expected to be a new step forward on the path of strengthening good-neighborliness and deepening mutual understanding and trust between Russia and the PRC, while the documents signed during the visit will expand the treaty and legal base of bilateral relations.
