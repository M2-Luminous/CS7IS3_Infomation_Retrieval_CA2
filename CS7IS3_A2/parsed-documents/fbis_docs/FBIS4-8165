Relations between the two states are good, and Germany is Poland's most important trade partner. Nevertheless, the opportunities offered by proximity have so far not been fully exploited, Pawlak said in an interview with DDP/ADN in Warsaw before his visit to Germany, which is due to begin on Thursday. "What is needed is stronger commitment in the search for partnership and balance," the prime minister said. This applies above all because "certain disproportions" became apparent last year. For instance, Polish imports from Germany developed more dynamically than exports to Germany. Therefore, both sides should strive for equilibrium in the balance of trade. In Pawlak's view, for example, the export of Polish construction services could be again raised to the level reached years ago. In the talks in Bonn, the Polish prime minister wants to concentrate on the practical side of cooperation. The priority is "the creation of mechanisms and infrastructures that promote exchange between companies and relations between people," Pawlak said. Governments have many opportunities to facilitate this process. The prime minister included in these the creation of a financial and transport infrastructure such as new border-crossing points, the development of cultural cooperation, youth exchanges, and tourism. Pawlak said he wants to talk about these issues in Germany. He pointed out that Poland is very attentively watching Germany's stand on Poland's efforts to seek rapprochement with the EU [European Union] and with NATO. "I think our interests coincide in this area," the prime minister stressed.
