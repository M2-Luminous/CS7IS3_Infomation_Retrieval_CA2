[Qaddumi] Good evening. Welcome. [Tarabayh] Brother Abu-al-Lutf [Qaddumi's nom de guerre], the first question that comes to mind is: Why didn't you attend the agreement signing ceremony in Cairo. [Qaddumi] This has been my position since the very beginning, and it has not changed. It is a position of caution and carefulness because the Palestinian people have not achieved their aspirations. We are now confronting a new challenge. We face a hard test. But we will not give in to despair. We will face these difficulties with confident hearts. [Tarabayh] You refused to go to Washington when the Declaration of Principles Agreement was signed. But you then made a statement stressing the importance of the Palestinian people's unity. What would you say to Palestinians today? [Qaddumi] At this important, difficult phase in history, we say the Palestinian national struggle will continue relentlessly.... [Tarabayh, interrupting] ...the armed struggle? [Qaddumi] The Palestinian national struggle, by all means. It will continue relentlessly and its fire will not end. We are fighting for a legitimate cause in order to regain our legitimate rights from an usurping enemy that is supported by strong world powers. Despite this, our people's determination to resist continues and our intifadah inside the occupied territories will remain until the last Israeli soldier leaves our blessed Palestinian soil. We are advocates of peace, but we reject surrender. We believed in the peace process on clear foundations, which have not been realized yet. We were certain about these foundations--the land-for-peace formula--from the very beginning, and we will achieve that goal, God willing, regardless of how long it takes. [Tarabayh] Abu-al-Lutf, do you think the agreement signed today in Cairo is a step forward or backward on the path of peace? [Qaddumi] In fact, we are facing difficult options as I have said. We must choose the least of two evils. We can judge what was signed today through experience. I am completely optimistic that our people will continue their national struggle to create the appropriate conditions that will serve their objective in national independence and the creation of their state with holy Jerusalem as its capital. [Tarabayh] There is discussion now about the formation of a Palestinian government with members from inside and outside the occupied territories. Will Abu-al-Lutf join such a government? [Qaddumi] What kind of government are we talking about, especially since there is nothing complete yet? There is no room for a government. There may be room for leaders or for a national Palestinian authority. [Tarabayh] As head of the PLO Political Department, were you in full agreement with the other members of the PLO Executive Committee, especially President Yasir 'Arafat, about the agreement signed today? [Qaddumi] I think brother Abu-'Ammar ['Arafat], as was clear from what we saw on television, was angry and unhappy about what he was presented with. But as I have said, it was an inescapable evil. [Tarabayh] But why was he unhappy knowing that the signing ceremony was, according to the Palestinian party in particular, preceded by hard, intensive, and lengthy negotiations that covered all aspects? [Qaddumi] But at the last moment, there were some points the Israelis agreed on initially but then rejected. [Tarabayh] You are one of the historical leaders of Palestinian national action and you are a founding member of Fatah. On this occasion, on this important occasion, what do you say to the supporters and opposers of the agreement within the Palestinian people? [Qaddumi] I tell everyone that at this difficult phase we must not transfer our rage to the inside. It should be directed against the Israeli enemy who usurped our land. The fault is not ours, but that of those powerful forces, the Zionist forces that usurped Palestinian land and expelled our people. It is our destiny to stand united to continue this resistance, and to continue the construction in order to create new facts on the ground, without showing any sign of exhaustion. We will not give in to despair. We will continue this march. The march of history, which doomed certain states to collapse, will also doom our enemy to failure. We are hopeful that, through the developments in today's world, we will triumph, God willing. [Tarabayh] Do you think the agreement signed today is an initial step on the path to establishing the independent Palestinian state? [Qaddumi] We will discuss the details of this agreement. If there were positive points, then every leader, official, and the rank-and-file must take advantage of this opportunity to buttress all resources so we can continue this struggle until we reach national independence. I am certain we will get there soon. [Tarabayh] At this moment in particular, where does Abu-al-Lutf stand? How optimistic or pessimistic is Abu-al-Lutf? [Qaddumi] I have never been a pessimist. I am an optimist by nature. We started this revolution from nothing and generations joined it and excelled in fighting the Israeli enemy. The people were never tired. This is a long march but the signs of victory can, God willing, be seen on the horizon. [Tarabayh] You undoubtedly remember at these times the brothers and comrades who fell on the path of struggle, particularly Fatah Central Committee members such as Abu-Jihad [Khalil al-Wazir] and Abu--Iyad [Salah Khalaf] and the other martyrs. Do you have anything to say on this occasion? [Qddumi] To these heroic martyrs, to the martyrs who fell for the sake of the Palestine cause and for the liberation of Palestine, I say one word: We remain faithful to the pledge. We will continue our struggle until we realize the hope for which they fought and for which we started the revolution together to achieve that noble goal, national independence and sovereignty over our land, regardless of the sacrifices. [Tarabayh] And to the children of the stone: Are they required today or in the near future to drop the stones and move to other forms? [Qaddumi] I say to these younger generations: Hold on to the stone until the last Israeli soldier leaves Palestinian soil. Blessed be they, and greetings to them and to all future generations that will build Palestine with their strong arms; and until the occupation is terminated and until we establish the pillars of peace. We are advocates of peace but we reject capitulation. The late Tunisian poet, Abu-al-Qasim, once said: Despite illness and enemies, I will remain like an eagle standing on a lofty summit. [Tarabayh] Faruq Qaddumi, Abu-al-Lutf, thank you for this interview. [Qaddumi] Thank you.
