[Central Committee], the Communist Party of India (Marxist) supporting the principled stand of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. Indrajit Gupta said the National Council of his party denounces the United States for bringing the talks between the DPRK and the U.S. to a rupture and hopes for a final solution of the nuclear issue through a peaceful negotiation. The C.C., the Communist Party of India (Marxist) said the situation created by the U.S. Government clearly shows that the United States is trying to force the DPRK to accept a comprehensive inspection, not an inspection of the scope agreed upon, by using the International Atomic Energy Agency as a serviceable tool for gathering information on Korea for the imperialists, and intensify military plots against the DPRK by gaining time. A solidarity message supporting the Korean people's cause of national reunification was also sent to the C.C., the WPK by the C.C., the Communist Party of Argentina. Expressing militant solidarity with the WPK, the DPRK Government and people in their just struggle for the peace and peaceful reunification of the country, it voiced full support for the Korean people's cause of defending the banner of socialism and safeguarding the sovereignty of the country.
