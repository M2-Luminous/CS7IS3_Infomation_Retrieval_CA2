This is demonstrated by the "1993 situation report on organized crime," that was presented yesterday by Interior Minister Herbert Schnoor (Social Democratic Party of Germany) in Duesseldorf. According to Schnoor, in 87 investigation proceedings the police exposed 5,589 individual offenses last year. The damage is estimated at more than 102 million German marks [DM]. Schnoor announced that North Rhine-Westphalia will double the number of offices for combating organized crime before the end of the year. Organized crime harbors a "tremendous danger potential" and has to be combated by all the means of the rule-of-law state. According to Schnoor, of 2,115 identified persons who are suspected of crimes, 58 percent come from Germany and 42 percent from abroad. There are leads to 33 states in Europe, Asia, and North and South America. "No field is so international as organized crime," Schnoor said. In one of the proceedings the suspects came from 13 different countries. The largest group of perpetrators comprised 412 persons; four other proceedings were aimed against groups with more than 100 persons. The greatest success: German and Dutch investigators broke up a drug ring that produced so-called Ecstasy tablets with a market value of at least DM250 million for the entire European and North American market. According to the minister, the police have already achieved initial successes as a result of the money-laundering law that came into force in late November. Last year, 158 suspicious money transactions were reported by financial institutions to the land office of criminal investigation. In 115 cases the suspicion of money-laundering was confirmed, he said.
