This is because democratization and respect for human rights in Mexico appear to comprise a primary concern in the 1995 U.S. defense budget. Labor Party presidential candidate Cecilia Soto said yesterday that the Pentagon's explicit concern for Mexico's democratization and respect for human rights, as outlined in its 1995 budget, represents an erroneous position. She said: "It is a completely erroneous position. If any country has shown the world it has violated human rights, it is the United States. Rodney King's case and frequent abuses incurred by Mexican illegal aliens are clear examples of this." She also stressed that human rights violations in Mexico do not pose a security threat to the United States. Mexican Green Party candidate Jorge Gonzalez Torres said the Pentagon's budget blueprint could be a prelude or a justification for military intervention. He said: "The fact that they are discussing Mexico's lack of democracy might indicate that they are preparing a military intervention." Gonzalez Torres also said the document serves as a means of softening public opinion for possible intervention in the event that Mexico becomes increasingly unstable. He added, however, that the Pentagon cannot legitimately give an opinion on these issues because the Pentagon is strictly a military organization that has a history of interventionism. Gonzalez Torres described the fact that Mexican soldiers are training in the United States as "suspicious," because a corps could be trained for a possible "coup d'etat." He said, "They could be preparing an Army corps for a possible coup d'etat -- a corps that could seize control." He added that the U.S. position fails to take into account the Mexican people's needs and the abject poverty being experienced in the countryside. Popular Socialist Party presidential candidate Marcela Lombardo Otero said yesterday that the Pentagon's training of Mexican troops is a threat to the country's sovereignty and harms the Mexican Army's patriotic, nationalistic, and popular ideology. Lombardo Otero contended the Pentagon is giving military advice because the U.S. Government wants to meddle in Mexico's internal affairs through any means possible. Moreover, she said, this kind of interaction distorts the perception that the Army is serving as a patriotic and nationalistic entity that traditionally has maintained a great sense of obligation to the community. "This presents tremendous danger to Mexico, particularly because this nationalistic and popular Army that we have is in charge of national security," she said. Meanwhile, Hector Delgado, speaking on behalf of the Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction Party, said it is all right for the Mexican Army to be trained by the Pentagon, provided that this training does not undermine the country's sovereignty. "It is good that Army troops train in other places to acquire greater skills and learn different things," he said. "There are Mexicans who are in training programs sponsored by the Inter-American Development Bank and GATT, and, therefore, it is not bad for people to train," Delgado said. He said that despite the benefits of having the Army train in the United States, precise limits and restrictions should be established on this kind of training to prevent Mexican soldiers' integrity or national sovereignty from being undermined. PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party], PAN [National Action Party], and PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution] deputies all have described the Pentagon's position as meddlesome.
