FR940407-1-00061 FR940407-1-00012 (4) The rating of a company's financial strength, as provided by Value Line; (5) The variability of a company's common-stock price changes or returns on common-stock equity ( i.e., the standard deviation); (6) The volatility of a company's common-stock price changes or returns on common-stock equity relative to the stock market as a whole ( i.e., the beta coefficient); or (7) Other such valid indicators deemed appropriate by the Commission. (iii) Any proxy group of companies that has received Commission approval will not be subject to challenge in a subsequent rate investigation brought under section (3) of the Intercoastal Act, 1933. (4) Consolidated capital structure. (i) Upon application, after notice and opportunity for comment, the Commission may authorize use of the capital structure of the consolidated system ( i.e., the parent company and all of its subsidiaries) in computing the BTWACC. The application must show that: (A) The subsidiary carrier's parent company issues publicly traded common-stock equity; (B) The subsidiary carrier's parent company owns 90 percent or more of the subsidiary's voting shares of stock; and (C) The business and the financial risks of the subsidiary carrier and the parent company are similar. (ii) The similarity of the parent company's and subsidiary carrier's business risk shall be evaluated by examining the degree to which the consolidated system's profits, revenues, and expenses are composed of those of the subsidiary carrier, and the extent to which the parent's holdings are diversified into lines of business unrelated to those of the subsidiary carrier, and/or other indicators of business risk deemed appropriate by the Commission. The similarity of the parent company's and subsidiary carrier's financial risk shall be evaluated by examining the consolidated system's and the subsidiary's total capitalization ratios, debt-to-equity ratios, investment quality rankings on short- and long-term debt instruments, times-interest-earned ratios, fixed charges coverage ratios (calculated to include both FMC and non-FMC regulated operations), and/or other measures of financial risk deemed appropriate by the Commission. (iii) When the consolidated capital structure is used, the consolidated system's cost of common-stock equity capital (issued by the parent company), the consolidated system's cost of long-term debt capital, the consolidated system's cost of preferred (and preference) stock capital, and the consolidated system's composite statutory corporate income tax rate shall also be used in estimating the subsidiary's BTWACC. (iv) Where the Commission has approved the use of a consolidated capital structure, such use will not be subject to challenge in a subsequent rate investigation brought under section (3) of the Intercoastal Act, 1933. (5) Book-value, average capitalization ratios. Capitalization ratios representing the capital structure used in deriving a carrier's BTWACC shall be computed on the basis of average projected book value outstanding over the 12-month period used to calculate projected midyear rate base in ยง552.2 (f)(1)(ii). The average amount of any class of capital outstanding used in determining the capitalization ratios is computed by adding the amount of a particular type of capital expected to be outstanding as of the beginning of the 12-month period to the amount of that same type of capital expected to be outstanding as of the end of the 12-month period, and dividing the sum of the two amounts outstanding by two. (6) Capitalization amounts and ratios (Schedules F&hyph;I and F&hyph;I(A)). A carrier shall show its long-term debt, preferred stock, and common-stock equity capitalization amounts outstanding, stated in book value terms, as of the beginning and as of the end of the 12-month period used to calculate projected midyear rate base, and the average amounts and average ratios for that 12-month period. Where a carrier is a subsidiary of a parent company, the carrier shall show its own capitalization amounts and ratios unless the carrier applies for and receives permission from the Commission to use a consolidated capital structure in computing the BTWACC. Where such permission is granted, the carrier shall show instead the consolidated system's capitalization amounts and ratios. (7) Cost of long-term debt capital (Schedules F&hyph;II, F&hyph;II(A), F&hyph;III, and F&hyph;III(A)). (i) The cost of long-term debt capital 1 shall be calculated by the carrier for the 12-month period used to compute projected mid-year rate base on the basis of: 1 The cost of sinking fund preferred stock shall be computed in accordance with the regulations in this section for calculating the cost of long-term debt. (A) Embedded cost for existing long-term debt; and (B) Current cost for any new long-term debt expected to be issued on or before the final day of the 12-month period. (ii) The arithmetic average annual percentage rate cost of long-term debt capital calculated on the basis of all issues of long-term debt expected to be outstanding as of the beginning and as of the end of the 12-month period used to compute projected mid-year rate base shall be the cost of long-term debt capital used in computing the BTWACC. (iii) The annual percentage rate cost of long-term debt capital for all issues of long-term debt expected to be outstanding as of the beginning and as of the end of the 12-month period used to compute projected mid-year rate base shall be calculated separately for the two dates by: (A) Multiplying the cost of money for each issue under paragraph (e)(7)(v)(A)( 10 ) of this section by the principal amount outstanding for each issue, which yields the annual dollar cost for each issue; and (B) Adding the annual dollar cost of each issue to obtain the total dollar cost for all issues, which is divided by the total principal amount outstanding for all issues to obtain the annual percentage rate cost of long-term debt capital for all issues. (iv) The arithmetic average annual percentage rate cost of long-term debt capital for all issues to be used as the cost of long-term debt capital in computing the BTWACC shall be calculated by: (A) Adding the total annual dollar cost for all issues of long-term debt capital expected to be outstanding as of the beginning of the 12-month period used to compute projected mid-year rate base to the total annual dollar cost for all issues of long-term debt capital expected to be outstanding as of the end of the 12-month period, and dividing the resulting sum by two, which yields the average total annual dollar cost of long-term debt for all issues for the 12-month period;
