The reason for the statement was the notorious petition signed by the officers of the Khaskovo Garrison, which demanded that the military budget be increased. People started to talk about a rebellion of the officers and even an army putsch. Some people even suspected that behind the petition, there was the long hand of General Lyutskanov, who was forced to retire. Members of the legion claim that they have not violated the Constitution and described the minister's thesis as absurd. It is not easy to determine which side is correct. Visits by high-ranking officers to the headquarters of the three Bulgarian armies were intended to smooth over the scandal under the cover of seeking measures aimed at providing more means than those envisaged by the republican budget, which has already been adopted. Precisely one year ago, the Rakovski Bulgarian Officer Legion warned the politicians and the mass media that they would not allow vagabonds to mock our national symbols. What prompted the warning was the fact that the government and the national flag were booed at the 3 March 1993 celebrations. No one in the leadership of the Defense Ministry or the Chief Prosecutor's Office thought that the warning violated the Constitution or the Armed Forces' regulations. It appears that the situation has changed today. High-ranking officers panicked when they realized that their subordinate officers want precisely what they themselves want -- more money for the country's defense and security. Despite the fact that they wear uniforms and carry shoulder straps, the military are also citizens of our republic and enjoy the same rights as every other citizen. On 1 March, the legion's initiative to convene a roundtable on the Army's problems was supported by the National Police Trade Union. Solidarity actions were promised. Policemen said that political neutrality and the one-man-command principle should not prevent the officers and sergeants from discussing the country's vitally important problems. One could hardly object to that argument. It is excessive to fan tension around the officers' initiative. It will only escalate tension in other areas at a time when a consensus exists among society about defense and security. The high-ranking officers should have more confidence in the lower-ranking officers, because they all serve a common cause.
