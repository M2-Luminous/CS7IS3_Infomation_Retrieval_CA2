"One of the worst moments in the republic's history," former Labor Minister Gino Giugni echoed. No, "the worst moment in Italy's history," CGIL [Italian General Confederation of Labor] Secretary Alfiero Grandi corrected. Immediate (or almost) reactions from opponents to Berlusconi's government came in a crescendo of alarmed and pessimistic tones. The PPI [Italian Popular Party] also spoke in hard, uncompromising tones: "The `new' amounts to very little, and is not always of the highest quality," Rosa Russo Jervolino said. For his part, [Pact for Italy leader] Mario Segni asserted that the Knight [Berlusconi nickname] had applied the Cencelli manual [powersharing system] and favored "many first republic personalities." [Italian Socialist Party, PSI, Secretary] Ottaviano del Turco accused Berlusconi of having given in to [League Secretary] Bossi's "veto power." Such things used to happen -- the PSI secretary recalled -- during the so-called First Republic and used to be called instances of "partyocracy degeneration." This comparison between the "new" which is being offered to the country by the new majority, and the old establishment which is reemerging here and there in Berlusconi's order, has become to some extent the "refrain" of many current comments: "The only novelty lies in arrogance," D'Alema said. "The only criterion is power sharing. And this," he added, "is supposed to be the new politics? The Second Republic?" Fellow party member Claudio Petruccioli spoke in almost identical terms: "A government which certainly seems neither new nor reassuring." Specific accusations were also made. Again, Russo Jervolino remarked: "The government is plethoric. The fascists' presence is significant." It is therefore a government which gives rise to concern among PPI members "because of the way it came into being and because of its structure." Again, Segni said: "We probably owe it to [President] Scalfaro, whom I sincerely thank for this, that the prime minister's lawyer (Previti -- LA REPUBBLICA editor's note), who had advocated placing the public prosecutors under the government's authority, did not get hold of the Justice Ministry." The increasing number of opinions expressed as the evening unfolded, concerned not only the government's overall composition, but also the individual ministers appointed by the Knight. The most targeted were [Christian Democratic Center, CCD, member and new Education Minister] Franceso D'Onofrio ("We are waiting for him," the Students Union said threateningly), and [League member and Institutional Reform Minister] Francesco Speroni, who was the object of former President Cossiga's sarcasm. "Now," Cossiga remarked, "we can finally expect a significant, specific Italian contribution to the never resolved political-constitutional debate between Schmitt and Felsen on the role of guarantees in modern rigid constitutions and the evolution of federalism -- the latter being a subject area which so far had not been addressed by Italian constitutional science, and in which Canadian and North American contributions were predominant." "Now" -- and this is where the sting came -- "this science will be greatly advanced by the new institutional reform minister." Speroni replied immediately, making use of a historical quotation: "Federalist Switzerland," he said, "has been better governed than the Italy of centralist and Christian Democratic know-it-alls." "Number One Berlusconi" was not targeted exclusively by critics. Among the trade unions, only the CGIL was decidedly against, together with CISL [Italian Confederation of Trade Unions] member Raffaele Moreste, who, referring to the government, said doubtfully: "I do not think it is highly qualified." According to UIL [Italian Federation of Trade Unions] confederal secretary Giancarlo Fontanelli, "they are men whose professionalism and prestige are unquestionable," while CISL leader Sergio D'Antoni preferred to wait for "the platforms and the choices made" before giving an opinion. A wait-and-see position was also adopted by Confindustria, which requested Berlusconi to "present an `organic' platform, as well as immediate initiatives in the areas of taxation, finance, and the labor market." Small businessmen, on the other hand, did not conceal their satisfaction, speaking as they did of "a firm statement of trust," while they waited -- as Confapi [Italian Confederation of Small Industrialists] Chairman Alessandro Cocirio said -- "for economic recovery, particularly for small- and medium-sized businesses." Stock Exchange Council chairman Attilio Ventura also expressed "personal satisfaction." In his view, "we have a solid government," which "for some time, the country had been waiting for," with the economic portfolios having been "given to people who are competent and businesslike." The women in Federcasalinghe [housewives federation] were also "fully satisfied," particularly "because of the creation of a Family Ministry," their chairwoman Federica Rossi Gasparrini explained. Finally, magistrates were cautious: "There are no objections in principle among magistrates," said national secretary Livio Pepino, "but we will be looking very closely at the minister's choices." Tribute to new Justice Minister Alfredo Biondi was paid by Pact for Italy deputy Pietro Milio, the criminal lawyer currently defending former Sisde [Intelligence and Democratic Security Service] employee Bruno Contrada: "A valid and appropriate choice," he said.
