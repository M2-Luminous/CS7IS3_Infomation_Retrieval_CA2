The demand for Tokyo to extend this year's 6 trillion yen in income and residential tax cuts, to spur domestic demand and reduce its trade surplus, came again at Sunday's meeting in Washington of the Group of Seven (G-7) finance ministers and central bank chiefs. Fujii told a news conference that he responded by saying multi year tax cuts will be enacted this year, as promised by the coalition government of outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. Japanese officials have said Fujii carried a message that a new government to be launched Monday will carry on Hosokawa's reforms. Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata is certain to succeed Hosokawa as premier. Fujii said the finance leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and the United States also confirmed with him "the shared understanding that excessive changes in exchange rates are undesirable." He said he stressed to the meeting "that exchange rates should reflect economic fundamentals and that excessive changes are undesirable, and all the countries confirmed this." He said they agreed on "close cooperation" on the exchange market. Foreign exchange volatility is also undesirable for stock and bond markets, Fujii said. Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno told the same news conference that he recognizes U.S. economic recovery as genuine and that other countries are steadily moving in a brighter economic direction.
