The March 22-23 talks will follow a meeting from March 16 that will focus on calculating the foreign share in the Japanese semiconductor market for the October-December quarter last year, said an official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. Under a 1991 trade pact, Japan and the United States agreed to a 20 percent goal for foreign market share by the end of 1992. In the final quarter of 1992, the foreign market share exceeded the goal, reaching 20.2 percent under a U.S. formula. According to the U.S. formula, the foreign share since has been in a downward trend, standing at 18.1 percent for the July-September quarter last year. Under a separate Japanese accounting method, which includes chips manufactured in Japan by foreign companies for their own use, the foreign share had risen above the 20 percent level for three successive quarters from the final quarter of 1992, but fell to 19.7 percent in the July-September quarter last year. U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor has said he is concerned about the decline and insisted that Tokyo is not abiding by the bilateral trade agreement. It is viewed by the United States as a commitment but as a nonbinding target by Japan.
