He termed as historic the work performed by the DNI, which has been forced to yield to a new organization conceived within the framework of state modernization in line with the process of transformation, which is shaking the foundations of public and private institutions. The top military chief said that justice is the gauge of civilization and that the greatest ruin of a nation is not that many of its residents do not fear God, but that those who do not fear God do not fear the law either. He said that as bad as it is that men do not feel subject to a powerful, moral law, it is even worse that they do not respect the legal system, which is what makes public order, social peace, and human coexistence possible. Discua said that the police forces were born as auxiliaries of justice and that what has happened recently is an indication the world is preparing for the advent of a better society. "That is how we understand it, and we accept it that way. We believe in those who will henceforth have to handle these matters," he added. Discua said that personnel of the current Directorate of Criminal Investigation earn a decent salary and that professional training and social sensitivity are requirements that further the state's interests. He said the members of the defunct DNI have fulfilled their work in the face of every adversity and act of ingratitude. He admitted that those agents have made mistakes, and, being human, were not as perfect as their critics and that they lacked the supernatural qualities claimed by those who offended and insulted them everyday. "The fatherland and thinking citizens will recognize their sacrifice someday," the military chief added, referring to the DNI agents who stood for five hours on the parade grounds of the National Police School (Anapo).
