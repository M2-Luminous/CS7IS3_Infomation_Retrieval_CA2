In this statement he made yesterday before the ruling Labor party, Rabin said: Israel can remain an occupying force. However, he added: It is high time the Israelis realized the price for this will would be to pay with their blood. JANA's political editor commented on this report and said: Can we infer from the statement made by the Israeli prime minister that he has come to his senses, albeit late, or is it merely another verbal maneuvering? We would like to think the Israelis, who are strangers in Palestine, have come to their senses and they have realized that their presence on a land alien to them and against the will of its original inhabitants and its real owners will cause their destruction and ruin. Therefore, those who were fetched from Europe, America, and other regions must return to their original homelands where they will lead a peaceful life and they must leave Palestine to its owners. Unless this happens, the Israelis will continue to face a devastating danger; and if they want to be safe, they must reject the plans of the Christian West, which hates them and wants their destruction.
