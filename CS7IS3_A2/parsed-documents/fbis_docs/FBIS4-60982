Asia, Caucasus LD0305094194 Moscow ITAR-TASS in English 0900 GMT 3 May 94 LD0305094194 Moscow ITAR-TASS English BFN [Report by KYRGYZKABAR-TASS correspondent Albert Bogdanov] [Text] Bishkek 3 May TASS -- "Russia's main interest in Central Asia and in Transcaucasia is peace," speaker of the upper chamber of the Russian parliament Vladimir Shumeyko told a press conference here on Monday [2 May] after the signing of an agreement on interparliamentary cooperation between Russia and Kyrgyzstan. Russian troops in the Caucasian conflict zone serve only as a disengagement buffer between the conflicting sides. In Shumeyko's opinion, any "war between two CIS nations is an obstacle to the development of the Commonwealth of Independent States as a whole." Speaker of the Kyrgyz parliament Medetkan Sherimkulov added: "We cannot leave Russia to deal with the Karabakh problem alone. We must prevent it from being accused of imperial designs when it tries to restore peace in this area by its own means. Of course, we are aware of Russia's interest in the republics of the former Soviet Union. But today Russia can rely not only on its own forces. Its efforts are now correctly assessed in all the states of our commonwealth." Asked about the plans for achieving peace, Shumeyko said: "The MPS are unanimous that the problem should be solved as a single whole." Shumeyko indicated three settlement stages: complete end of hostilities, withdrawal of all the troops from the conflict zone, and conclusion of a peace treaty. "The status of Nagorno-Karabakh can be determined only after that," he stated. Shumeiko, together with his counterpart Medetkan Sherimkulov, flew to the southern part of the republic today to visit districts hit by a recent natural calamity.
