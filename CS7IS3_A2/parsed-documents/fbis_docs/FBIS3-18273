Of course, this withdrawal remains to be confirmed and the alliance continues to display the same determination. If guns were still to threaten Sarajevo, planes would fly at the expiration of the ultimatum. Nonetheless, everyone hopes that things will not go that far. This is why Russia's pressure on the Serb forces was greeted unanimously like a victory of Russian diplomacy. However, this is going a little too fast. Since the NATO ultimatum, the Russians have done everything in their power to avoid a strike on their Serb friends. They have threatened, going as far as brandishing the specter of a world conflict; they have used dilatory maneuvers in an attempt to disempower NATO to the benefit of the UN; they have negotiated by multiplying contacts with Western embassies. These efforts were all in vain and did not shake the West's resolve. The Russians had but one avenue left: convince the Serbs to adhere to the conditions of the ultimatum. This is what Moscow did, and this is where the success of its diplomacy stops. It must be admitted that it is modest. On the other hand, the policy conducted by the French Government scores some points. Paris has been repeating for months that to achieve a negotiated settlement of the Bosnian issue, it is imperative to have the cooperation of the United States and Russia. However, these countries to date had refused to do so. Washington did not want to pressure the Muslims, just like Moscow refused to pressure the Serbs. The French determination following the Sarajevo massacre compelled the Americans to join forces with France in NATO and to reconsider their relations with the Muslims. Thus created, the Franco-American front led Russia to participate in the diplomatic process and pressure the Serbs. If this new element, derived from the French initiative, produces results and renders useless NATO air strikes now that the stranglehold on Sarajevo has loosened, France will have won an important diplomatic success. On condition, however, that taking advantage of the opportunity, Muslims do not decide to fill the void left by the Serbs and raise too high the stakes in the peace negotiations that could start as early as next week.
