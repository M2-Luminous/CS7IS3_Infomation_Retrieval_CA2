This was stated to journalists by Richard Nixon after his speech at the State Duma committee for international affairs. "I held meetings with a number of leaders and concluded that right now there is no one who would be ready to take his place," the U.S. ex-president stressed. "They will appear but for the moment there are no people like that," ITAR-TASS reports. Speaking of his meetings with Grigoriy Yavlinskiy and Sergey Shakhray, Richard Nixon noted: "They are both young, vigorous, and highly educated. I think they can be viewed as potential leaders. But I would not rule out others with whom I met. In particular I was impressed by the Communists' leader Gennadiy Zyuganov. But he will not become president since Russia does not intend to return to communism."
