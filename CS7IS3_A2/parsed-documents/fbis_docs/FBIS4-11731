Due to their economic and political potentials, Iran and Saudi Arabia are capable of bringing about stability and a spirit of cooperation in the Persian Gulf region and the Middle East as a whole. The key role played by both countries in the world's oil markets, their proximity to the Persian Gulf's northern and southern shores, together with their common religious heritage makes them natural allies. A Tehran-Riyadh axis can be instrumental in creating a political and economic critical mass large enough to address the problems currently facing the Islamic world. Despite their national and regional interests, the Saudis have subordinated their domestic and foreign policies to the United States' hegemonic objectives in the Middle East. By doing so, they have diluted their own political independence and have identified themselves too closely with Washington's interests which are at odds with the aspirations of the Islamic world. The three salient Saudi policies which run contrary to the interests of the region and do not bestow much honor on the Saudi leaders are: producing more than their OPEC quota; facilitating an American presence in the Persian Gulf; and reducing the limit on the number of Iranian pilgrims to Mecca in the Hajj season. Riyadh has so far failed to formulate a cohesive policy based on the recent Islamic and Arab political experiences, and has not been able to differentiate between its national and regional interests, and those of the Western powers. The Islamic Republic recognizes Riyadh's right to make independent policy decisions, so long as those decisions are based on the principles of peaceful coexistence with and mutual respect for neighboring countries. However, Tehran is not prepared to accept the political and economic cost of its neighbor's shortsighted policies which will ultimately affect the welfare of the Islamic Republic and other Muslim countries of the Middle East. After 15 years of Saudi enmity towards the Islamic Republic with the resulting negative consequences for the Islamic and Arab worlds, a review of Riyadh's policies towards Iran based on mutual respect and interests is now in order. The Saudi leadership's decision to lower the number of Iranian pilgrims was made, supposedly, because of construction projects to expand the holy Grand Mosque of Mecca which surrounds the holy Ka'ba. But according to informed sources, renovations were completed some time ago. This Saudi decision to, unjustifiably, reduce the number of pilgrims from the Islamic Republic is politically motivated and reflects the wishes of certain factions in the House of Sa'ud whose interests are served by sowing dissension between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Under the present circumstances, the Saudi leadership needs to make a courageous political decision to remove the existing strained relations between the two countries.
