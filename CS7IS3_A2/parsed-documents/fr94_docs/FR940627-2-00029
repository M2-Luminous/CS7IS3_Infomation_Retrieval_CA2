SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Administration on Children, Youth and Families (ACYF) administers national programs for children, youth and families, works with States and local communities to develop services which support and strengthen family life, seeks out joint ventures with the private sector to enhance the lives of children and their families, and provides information and other assistance to parents. The concerns of ACYF extend to all children from birth through adolescence. Many of the programs administered by the agency focus on children from low-income families; children and youth in need of foster care, adoption or other child welfare services; preschool children and preschool children with disabilities; abused and neglected children; runaway and homeless youth; youth gangs; and children from American Indian, Alaskan Native, and migrant families. ACYF funds research, demonstration, dissemination, utilization and technical assistance in four basic areas: child welfare, child care, youth development, and child and family services. The resources budgeted for these four areas address the needs and problems confronting some of the most vulnerable children and families in the country.
