He had arrived in Paris on 23 February and, according to diplomatic sources, the three days of his visit translated into a resounding failure. The Futungo de Belas Palace chieftain did not come anywhere near achieving the goals he had set for himself on this trip, because the French Government is rather reluctant to provide economic and military aid to Luanda. In what must have been a major shock to the strongman at Luanda's Futungo de Belas Palace, the French authorities said that everyone is waiting for the outcome of the Lusaka talks. It is worth noting that Eduardo dos Santos was granted an audience by French President Francois Mitterrand yesterday. The unelected president of Angola is now packing his bags and will be returning to Luanda today, after his visit turned out to be a complete failure and he found that many people in the French capital contested his regime. Angolan, French, and Italian citizens gathered to demonstrate against his presence in the fatherland of Charles de Gaulle. Those people, who are the friends of Angola and of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, UNITA, unreservedly asked for an end to the carnage that Eduardo dos Santos has been masterminding in this country. They carried placards and shouted the following slogans: We want Angola to be free of massacres by the Riot Police! Dos Santos, free the thousands of political prisoners you are still holding! Return the bodies of the UNITA peace negotiators who were murdered in Luanda! That demonstration, which took place in front of Luanda's embassy in the French capital, received direct support from a number of French parties that maintain friendly relations with UNITA. Observers have made it clear that the Futungo de Belas Palace chieftain's visit to Paris was both premature and poorly planned. No head of state has ever been as humiliated in Europe as Eduardo dos Santos was in his visit to France. Luanda's strongman failed miserably and was unable to achieve his goals. The government led by Prime Minister Edouard Balladur was very rigorous, stuck to its promises, and did not allow the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party to buy any weapons or combat helicopters. The team led by Eduardo dos Santos had already been preparing to engage in such talks. The Futungo de Belas chieftain was not received by powerful Defense Minister Francois Leotard or by the mayor of the city of Paris, a very important figure in the European Community. Moreover, the French media covered only very sparsely the Luanda chieftain's visit, which wound up yesterday. The few newspapers that have reported on the visit have noted that the government led by Eduardo dos Santos has remained insensitive to the Angolan people's suffering. [passage omitted]
