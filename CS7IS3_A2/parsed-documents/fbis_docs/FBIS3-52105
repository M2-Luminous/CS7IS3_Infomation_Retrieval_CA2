We have given thee a manifest victory, that God may forgive thee thy former and thy latter sins, and complete His blessings upon thee, and guide thee on a straight path, and that God might help thee with a mighty victory. It is He who sent down tranquility into the hearts of the believers, that they may add faith to their faith, for to God belongs the forces of the heavens and the earth, and God is full of knowledge and wisdom. [Koranic verse] God tells the truth. O sons of our great Palestinian people, O you activists, steadfast and mujahidin people for Palestine, O you the people of the valiant Intifadah, O you the heroes of the confrontation and resistance in exile and in the diaspora, O you the brave heroes who are patient and resilient in jails and detention centers, O you valiant eagles and courageous hunted men in every camp, village. and city; in every town, valley, and mountain in the land of beloved Palestine. Oh you the sons of our glorious Arab nation, in this glorious day, the anniversary of the outbreak of Fatah, the anniversary of the outbreak of the Palestinian revolution, in this day which marks the 29th anniversary of that glorious day, those rare historic moments when young people who have believed in their God and people have decided to open up the road to the beginning of a new stage for our people in the track of its struggle since the beginning of this century, on this day, on this glorious day, we mark this Palestinian national revolutionary anniversary in a new climate, in a new situation, and in the face of new prospects. Today, after decades of bitter struggle, today, after 29 years of a burning revolution, today after six years of the glowing Intifadah, today after long and bitter years of steadfastness, confrontation, and resistance in which we have given the price for Palestine in the form of the pains of our injured people, the freedom of our prisoners and the sorrow of our women, sisters, and daughthers, and the patience of our elderly people and men, and with the blood of our heroes, the cohorts of loyal martyrs, the brave sons of our people, today we miss them badly, those horsemen who have left their mounts early, the brave martyrs who have fallen on the road to freedom, liberation, and independence. [Passage omitted] Our celebration today, oh my brothers, is different and set apart from any day in the past. On this day we stand with our relatives in the beloved homeland separated by only a few days from our appointment with history, from the appointed date for the beginning of the Israeli withdrawal from part of our land, from the appointed date for beginning of the return of thousands of our cadres and leaders to the homeland, from the appointed date for the establishment of the first Palestinian national authority for our people on the territory of their homeland in accordance with the resolution of our Palestinian National Council in 1974, from the date appointed for the new resurrection of the homeland of Palestine and the establishment of our Palestinian people on the political and geographical map of the region now that the attempt to wipe our mighty people from this map has ended forever. The people of Palestine are mighty, the people of Palestine are mighty. [passage omitted] We have upheld the pledge and the oath. [passage omitted] O sons of our great people, O sons of our glorious nation, by signing the Declaration of Principles agreement between the PLO and the Israeli Government, the cause of our people has entered a new historical and decisive phase. This agreement included the beginning of the Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza strip and the Jericho region in connection with the redeployment of the Israeli forces in the rest of the occupied territories and the establishment of a Palestinian authority led by the PLO, the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people; and the beginning of a transitional period followed in no more than three years by the negotiations of the final stage. The most important issues to be debated will be Holy Jerusalem, the old refugees, the settlements, the final borders, and the implementation of UN resolutions 242 and 338. This agreement and the sweeping international support it produced, and the new realities it brought about, meant one single and basic fact, namely that the Palestinian people have firmly established their feet on the soil of their homeland by the effect of decades of the blessed Jihad and by the results of the bitter confrontations and the legendary steadfastness in the face of the expeditions of extermination and evil and by the effect of the legend of building and consolidating the national identity -- yes, by the effect of the legend of building, consolidating, and safeguarding the national identity in the diaspora and under the bayonets of occupation and in the heart of the detention camps and prisons, by the effect of the masses of our brave people, the architect of the epics of the unique struggle in the refugee camps in Lebanon and the architect of the epics of the heroic Fida'is operations and the tough resistance at al-Karamah [battle in Jordan where Palestinian resisted an Usraeli attack] and in the homeland's soil and the architect of the legendary epic in standing fast in the siege of Beirut and the architect of the independent Palestinian decisionmaking, the architect of the blessed and brave intifadah; Yes, the architect of the blessed and brave Intifadah in our occupied homeland, which dealt a finishing and final blow to the expansionist Zionist scheme. By the effect of all this, events have built up day after day. The walls, one after another, and obstacles, one after another, have collapsed until Israeli recognition came to announce a new era of our people's history and of our genuine and loyal Jihad. [passage omitted] Sons of our struggling people; brave and valiant women, men, children and youth in all positions inside and outside the homeland; our valiant wounded and our hero detainees; our glorious Arab nation: We are entering the new era full of hope without being deluded by chimeras. Yes, without being deluded by chimeras. We do so armed with faith and confidence. [passage omitted] The path is still long, but we have much food; the tasks are still many and difficult, but our positions are stronger and more advanced and more impregnable. [passage omitted] We say this so that we can realize our reality well and so that we can firm our footholds. The historic achievement that was realized does not mean in any way that our national tasks have been completed, as we still have before us the task of completing the comprehensive Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied territories, at the forefront of which is Holy Jerusalem, the capital city of our independent state in implementation of the resolutions of international legitimacy, so that our people can exercise their right to self-determination and establishing their independent state. Before us there still remains the main holy task of guaranteeing the rights of the Palestinian refugees in accordance with the principles and resolutions of international legitimacy, in addition to the issue of the settlements and the final frontiers. Out of our realization of all that, our central council made its decision that the PLO should be the point of reference as far as the national authority is concerned -- the national authority that will be established in the territories from which Israel will withdraw so that we can preserve the entity and role of the PLO in all that means of the unity of the people and the cause. The political battle of negotiations that we have been waging, O sons of our great people, since 13 September to secure the precise and faithful implementation of the Declaration of Principles agreement is only a small sample of the obstacles that we are to face in the future. We are aware however of the fact that a historical step such as the one that has been achieved will have so many obstacles in its path due to the fact that it has taken place following decades of tenacious confrontation, war, aggression, and occupations. We stress that we look at the Declaration of Principles as a first step on the path toward achieving a comprehensive peace that would not acquire its full meaning before the implementation of all the UN resolutions, the Israeli withdrawal, and the recovery of Arab rights on all fronts. Approaching is our great concern for Arab coordination, which we consider as a necessary condition for the consolidation of the stand of the Arab negotiator [as heard] especially after the Declaration of Principles brought about a change that bridged the gap between the Palestinian track and the rest of the Arab tracks in terms of time as dictated by the requirements of the peace process in Madrid. [passage omitted] We would have wished greater size and quicker pace for the programs of support. [passage omitted] We, while crossing the threshold of the new era in our history, fully realize how this moment is so special and unique; we realize its difficulties. Allow me to say to you that the anxiety we all are feeling, where hopes mix with fears, progress with hesitation, and emotions with wisdom and consideration, is natural. Yes, my brothers, this is a natural matter. In fact, it is evidence that everything is alright and healthy as far as our entity and society are concerned. [passage omitted] It is the moment of the beginning of the process of the realization of our national aims; it is the moment of the beginning of the revival of a new Palestine. It is the moment of the meeting of our masses inside with their revolution and people in the diaspora. It is the moment of the beginning of the construction of the Palestinian national entity on the land of Palestine. We have to realize full well the requirements of this moment so that our steps will be precise and correct and so that we can advance toward the completion of our aims. [passage omitted] We want the Palestine that is being revived anew to be a homeland that realizes for the people of Palestine their dreams, hopes, and aspirations -- a homeland that will realize the aims for which we have struggled; a homeland that will compensate our masses for continuous decades of injustice and oppression, which were the result of the historic crime and injustice carried out against us. We want it to be a free homeland for a free people and for strugglers; a modern and advanced entity; democratic, and a model that makes available the opportunity for the continuation of the civilized role and religious and cultural heritage that Palestine had throughout history; an oasis in which our people will enjoy freedom, democracy, political pluralism, security and safety, the independence of the judiciary, the preservation of public freedoms, stability, prosperity, human rights and equality between men and women. A homeland for the Palestinians wherever they may be, getting ready for the time when our objectives are achieved with the [military] evacuation of our holy Jerusalem and the whole of this homeland, the land of holiness and prophets and the place of the ascension of our prophet Muhammad and the birthplace of Jesus, is completed [sentence as heard]. My brothers, beloved, comrades of the path and the march, and brothers of struggle and Jihad, the enormity of the sacrifices we are facing is relative to the size of our dreams and hopes, our determination and persistence, the strength of our belief and will. We are starting from the reality of destruction that years of occupation have inflicted on the infrastructure of our economy and society. [passage omitted] On this occasion and on this historic day I address an appeal to all the sons of our Palestinian people -- in all its sectors and groupings everywhere; in all its detachments, forces, parties, trends, personalities, and activities -- saying to them all that the hour of the major jihad has struck -- the hour of building the national entity to consolidate our capability to complete the wresting of all our national rights -- this hour is for unity and not for disunity, and this hour is for harmony that concentrates on the common denominators and not an hour for division that looks for contradictions and differences. Come; come, let us together and hand in hand and side by side wage our holy battle by building the national Palestinian entity. Come, let us agree on what we agree upon. Let some of us pardon others on what we differ upon. Come, let us agree and disagree under the umbrella of what unites us -- under the umbrella of the sublime national interest of our people and homeland and nation. [passage omitted] O sons of our great people, this new year is that of the renaissance. Here is Palestine being reborn again as a national entity on its way to becoming an independent state. [passage omitted] In this year, it is our duty to consolidate our rank and mobilize our energies to be at the level of the challenges facing us. This is the year of great tasks, and the year of achievements that we are undertaking from new stands, with new spirit. It is the year of the free people who are making a free homeland and a new torch of light, hope, and faith in the region. [passage omitted] It is a revolution until victory, until victory, until victory. Your brother, Abu 'Ammar.
