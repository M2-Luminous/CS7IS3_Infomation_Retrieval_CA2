SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Consumer Advisory Council was established in 1976 at the direction of Congress to advise the Federal Reserve Board on the exercise of its duties under the Consumer Credit Protection Act and on other consumer-related matters. The Council by law represents the interests both of consumers and of the financial community. Members serve three-year terms that are staggered to provide the Council with continuity. New members will be selected for terms beginning January 1, 1995, to replace members whose terms expire this year. Nominations should include the address and telephone number of the nominee, information about past and present positions held, and a description of special knowledge, interests or experience related to consumer credit or other consumer financial services. Persons may nominate themselves as well as other candidates. The Board is interested in candidates who have some familiarity with consumer financial services and candidates who are willing to express their viewpoints. Candidates do not have to be experts on all levels of consumer financial services, but they should possess some basic knowledge of the area. In addition, they should be able to make the necessary time commitment to prepare for and attend meetings (usually two days long including committee meetings) three times a year. In making the appointments, the Board will seek to complement the qualifications of continuing Council members in terms of affiliation and geographic representation, and to ensure the representation of women and minority groups.
