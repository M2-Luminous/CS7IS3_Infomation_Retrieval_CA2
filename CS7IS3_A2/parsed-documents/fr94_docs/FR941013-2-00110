FR941013-2-00110 FR941013-2-00079 Based on its experience with the pilot program, however, the Amex, along with OCC, has proposed certain minor refinements to the types of property acceptable as collateral for MIOERs issued to cover short call positions. As the Commission noted in regard to the recently approval proposal by OCC, 21 these new standards will ensure that only liquid assets are eligible to underlie escrow receipts. Specifically, the Commission believes that the proposed rule change is a reasonable response to OCC's finding that certificates of deposit and bankers acceptances present an undue risk to OCC because it has no means of ensuring that issuers of such instruments are financially sound. 22 Thus, the Commission agrees that limiting ``cash equivalents'' to short-term United States government securities will enhance the integrity of escrowed collateral. Moreover, the changes to the definition of ``qualified equity security'' are consistent with the Federal Reserve Board's definition of ``margin security'' or existing OCC rules. 21 See OCC approval order, supra, note 5. 22 In contrast to its monitoring of MIOER issuers, OCC receives no financial information on banks issuing certificates of deposit or bankers' acceptances. Because of the potential exposure if the issuer fails and the instruments become worthless, OCC proposed eliminating them as eligible types of collateral. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26951 (June 21, 1989), 54 FR 26870 (June 26, 1989) (File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;89&hyph;04). OCC also found that few customers utilize such instruments. Id. Finally, the Commission has determined that the escrow receipt contains safeguards ( e.g., minimum collateral levels; the requirement that issuing banks or trust companies notify customers and OCC of reductions in collateral) 23 that should help ensure the adequacy of the collateral posted and diminish the risks associated with MIOERs. To date, the Amex's experience with the pilot program supports the Commission's earlier conclusion that, absent extremely unusual circumstances, the value of the collateral should be greater than the cash difference between the current index value and the exercise price of the option ( i.e, the amount the must be delivered upon assignment. 24 The Commission therefore believes that implementation on a permanent basis is now appropriate. 23 For further discussion of value requirements and incentives for the industry to police itself, see supra, notes 16&hyph;17 and accompanying text. 24 See pilot approval order, supra, note 4. The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the Federal Register . This will permit the portfolio management benefits of the proposed rule change to be realized as soon as possible. In addition, the Amex's proposal is identical to proposals by the CBOE, PSE and Phlx that were published in the Federal Register for the full comment period and were approved by the Commission. 25 25 No comments were received in connection with the proposed rule changes by the other options exchanges. See permanent approval order, supra, note 6. It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) 26 that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;94&hyph;31) is hereby approved. 26 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988).
