"It is not a matter of good luck," he laughed. "When things are done right, they come out right." Gaviria believes that Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin and the rest of the team that consolidated his election as the new OAS secretary general did things very well. Gaviria announced that he will not get involved in national politics in the next few years and added: "More than one person will be happy about that." He appears confused when told what many people in the streets are saying, that he was put in the position by the United States. But he defends himself without hesitation and says firmly that he would not have been elected if the international community had not viewed Colombia as a very independent country. This is what he plans to do from his post at the OAS. [EL TIEMPO] Why did you want to head the OAS, an institution in crisis? [Gaviria] Late last year, some presidents and foreign ministers suggested that I should submit my name for the position. It looked like an interesting challenge. Although Joao Baena did a good job at the OAS and the organization has modernized itself in the past few years, nearly all international organizations lag behind in terms of the tremendous changes that have taken place and the speed with which the agenda has shifted. For those reasons, I thought I could do something worthwhile after I complete my term. [EL TIEMPO] Aren't you interested in resting? Isn't this decision like getting off one bucking bronco to get on another? [Gaviria] Yes. I would say it is a coincidence -- not a very happy one -- that I will have to leave one position and assume another without respite. But the situation was not under my control. I have not set the date, but I will have to assume office as OAS secretary general a few weeks after the end of my administration, maybe early in September. [EL TIEMPO] What will have to change to make the OAS a true instrument of integration and to overcome the rhetoric that has gone on for the last 30 years? [Gaviria] First, I perceive a great desire on the continent for the OAS to play a more important role in economic issues and in the integration processes of various countries. There is an American ideal to create a great free trade zone. I hope to make some progress along those lines in the next few years. Second, there is a general idea that the OAS must be more prepared and equipped to cope with the problems of democracy on the continent, problems such as ruptures and difficulties. It must also encourage democracy. Third, we are convinced that much more has to be done regarding human rights, not only studying specific cases but stimulating compliance with these rights. [EL TIEMPO] Do these things depend on your leadership or on a change in the institution? [Gaviria] I do not think it depends on my leadership. It truly depends on our capacity for political willingness and our ability to express it through institutional change, something that was not always possible in the world. Sometimes the willingness is there but no way is found to make changes or to use the means at our disposal, or maybe the adequate instruments are not found. I hope we will succeed. [EL TIEMPO] Which case requires the most urgent attention: Cuba, Haiti, or Peru? Which is the most difficult? [Gaviria] I think the Peruvian problem is a thing of the past following the Democratic Constituent Congress. I do not think Peru is a case at all anymore, nor do I think Cuba is on the organization's immediate agenda. Haiti, however, is on that agenda. Other than stating -- as I have several times before -- that we must continue to work to reestablish democracy in Haiti and to reinstall President Aristide, I have nothing new to add, except that I will have to study the situation carefully when I take office. There are still a few months to go yet, and I have no way of foreseeing what additional proposals or solutions could be adopted. [EL TIEMPO] Among the most recent Colombian presidents, you have been one of the most open toward Cuba. You built bridges for them; you reestablished diplomatic relations; you met Fidel Castro; and now there is talk of selling oil to Cuba. Does this mean it will be easier for you to bring Cuba back into the Inter-American system? [Gaviria] Nations all across the continent believe that if there is political and economic change in Cuba, approved, of course, by the organization, we could try to move Cuba back into the inter-American system. There is no way to assess the degree of such changes or the country's willingness to make them happen. If changes are made, it would be desirable to bring Cuba back into the system. [EL TIEMPO] How will you maintain and guarantee your neutrality in conflicts involving Colombia? [Gaviria] As soon as I take my oath, I will be the secretary general of the OAS. My opinion as the president of Colombia should have no bearing on my performance as secretary general. I will become the interpreter of the organization's mandates. [EL TIEMPO] Trade, poverty, the environment, and drug trafficking are some issues on the continent's agenda. What are the priorities? [Gaviria] I think the priorities are trade, the defense and conservation of democracy, human rights, the environment, and poverty. In the next few years we will have to work hard and see what happens. We need institutional reforms and new instruments. We must study everything carefully and see how to handle each specific situation. [EL TIEMPO] Rumor has it that you were put in this position by the gringos. Niehaus said that after losing. How will you demonstrate your independence? [Gaviria] I have no reason to demonstrate my independence. Colombia's foreign policy over the last few years should remove any doubt about the Colombian president's independence. Contrary to what one may expect to result from that policy, many countries backed Colombia because of its international policies and its independence. Colombia's success is due to the great work by Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin and the ministry itself in spreading our message. It was not Colombia's message but the message of the nations that accompanied Colombia. My candidacy was successful because of the way Colombia presented its arguments and convinced 20 countries to support it. The United States publicly expressed its support for Colombia early in the race and gave us its vote. I don't think it did anything more than that. [EL TIEMPO] Will you remain on the sidelines of national politics over the next five years? [Gaviria] Without any doubt whatsoever. [EL TIEMPO] Is there anyone who is particularly happy because of this decision? [Gaviria] More than one person will be happy about that. Of course, I am going to be on the sidelines of Colombian politics. There is no possibility whatsoever that I will be able to participate at any level. [EL TIEMPO] Mr. President, with respect to the issue of drug trafficking, it is being said that Colombia has no autonomy and that is agrees with what the United States believes must be done with the drug cartels. [Gaviria] I strongly disagree with that assessment. Colombia's policy on drug trafficking has been independent and in agreement with our convictions and the country's fundamental interests, and we have been able register a high degree of international cooperation. Keep in mind that during the past few years we outlined a uniquely Colombian policy. Colombia eliminated extradition, we undertook the surrender program, and we decided to strengthen the justice system. In the beginning, the international community viewed these policies with skepticism, and yet, these policies proved to be successful and effective. I would like to know where you got the idea that these policies were imposed by the Americans. None of these policies... [EL TIEMPO] I was referring to recent statements and positions regarding the Cali Cartel, and comparing them with what the United States believes must be done. [Gaviria] Statements from whom? [EL TIEMPO] For example, the U.S. drug czar and the attorney general. [Gaviria] We must understand that judicial cooperation is a very difficult process and that the two countries' judicial systems are different. We got into instituting some programs, and also into a somewhat disturbing public discussion in an effort to determine whether we could cooperate. It is logical that differences should arise. The U.S. Justice Department has significant differences with the Prosecutor General's Office. In the past, the executive branch also had differences of opinion, but I believe we are overcoming these now. Nevertheless, we cannot be surprised by this. The president is usually very careful when he issues an opinion with regard to U.S. drug trafficking policies. However, the Prosecutor General's Office does not always react in the same manner. If this happens here, then we must expect to receive criticism from over there. [EL TIEMPO] In light of your experience in dealing with drug trafficking, what do you think the struggle against this problem will be like within the OAS? [Gaviria] I believe that for now the OAS has a very narrow program which basically focuses on prevention and crop substitution. I also believe that no one has proposed going any further; at least, I do not see any worthwhile proposals being evaluated at this time. [EL TIEMPO] How will Colombia benefit from your being in the OAS? [Gaviria] I believe my election already represents something positive, because it represents a recognition of the country's international policies. I also believe it is going to be positive in the future. If Latin America progresses, the integration process develops, and cooperation increases, then Colombia will benefit just as all the other countries will benefit. [EL TIEMPO] It has been said that you were born under a very auspicious star, and, under such a star, we are going to end up as world soccer champions. What do you think about the team? [Gaviria] I do indeed believe I am often considered a very lucky person. Of course, that is a somewhat fatalistic explanation. No, it is not a matter of good luck. When things are done right, they come out right. Obviously, those things that started out on the wrong foot turned out badly. Public opinion and the media pointed out these mistakes. I believe it is time the country learns that things can go right and that it is not simply a matter of good luck. No. I believe we Colombians are doing things right in areas such as the economy, politics, institutional change, the struggle against drug trafficking, and sports. In fact, things cannot go wrong all of the time.
