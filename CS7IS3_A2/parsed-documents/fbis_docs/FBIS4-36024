He said this is a result of the situation in our country since the eruption of the political crisis in August and a result of the military situation exploded by the secessionist clique within the Socialist Party, as well as al-Bid's secessionist declaration that has no foundation in the Constitution or the law, since the Yemeni Republic is an indivisible whole and no part of it may be relinquished. The letter asked the conference to voice support for Yemen's unity and constitutional authority that was elected by the people.
