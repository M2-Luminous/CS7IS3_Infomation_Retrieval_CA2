Official and media reactions have been very strong since as many as more than 60 Palestinians were killed and a lot more wounded in a single day, the worst bloodshed since Israel seized the Arab lands in 1967. Arab governments and public opinion, Palestinians in particular, have held the Israeli Government responsible for the massacre. They demanded effective measures be taken to protect the Palestinians under Israeli occupation, disarming of Jewish settlers and Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories. In downtown Amman, a huge rally was held today to protest against the massacre. Jordanian parliamentarians expressed their indignation, saying the appalling crime posed a serious challenge to peace in the region. Jordan has also announced a three-day mourning for the victims as of today upon the directive of King Husayn. The Palestinian leadership has decided to recall all its negotiators in Cairo and Paris for consultations on future Palestinian-Israeli negotiations in the wake of the massacre. In Lebanon, Palestinians closed their refugee camps and burnt tires today in protest against the massacre. In Beirut's Shatila and al-Burayj refugee camps, Palestinian demonstrators carried a coffin draped in the Palestinian flag in a symbolic funeral for the victims. In Saudi Arabia, a government spokesman denounced the "regrettable incident, which is characterized by extremism, fanaticism and non-respect of human rights." Oil-rich gulf newspapers today condemned "the horrible massacre." An article in "AL-KHALEEJ," a daily of the United Arab Emirates, said the conscience of the world must not skip over "the direct responsibility" of the United States for "this horrible massacre" since the United States is "the cherisher of Israel." In their editorials today, Qatari newspapers called on the international community to "inflict on Israel a due punishment appropriate to the size of the aforesaid crime," urging Palestinian leadership to "suspend negotiations with Israel." The English-language Qatari newspaper "GULF TIMES" said that the declaration of principles signed by the Rabin government with the Palestine Liberation Organization has not changed "Israel's policy of protecting Jewish terrorist settlers." A Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry spokesman said that the Israeli Government should be responsible for the killing since it sponsored Jewish settlements inside the occupied Arab territories. The spokesman said sheer denunciation is not enough. Decisive measures are needed more than ever before to protect the Palestinian people. He also said that Kuwait, while offering condolences to the Palestinian people, calls for international efforts to ensure the rights of the Palestinian people to statehood on their own land.
