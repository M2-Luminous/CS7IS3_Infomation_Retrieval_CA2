Comrade Kim Chong-il in his work published on April 22, 1964 elaborated on the need to do substantial work with the young people, firmly build up the rank of officials of the League of Socialist Working Youth and enhance their role in view of the practical demand in renaming the Democratic Youth League the League of Socialist Working Youth [LSWY]. In a by-lined article headlined "Highly Important Work Which Brought a Revolutionary Turn in the Work of the Youth League" the paper says the work serves as a highly important guideline in the development of our youth movement as it clearly indicates the tasks of the LSWY, the political reserve unit of the Workers' Party of Korea, and ways of their fulfilment. For the validity and truth of the idea and theory expounded in it, the work has displayed its great vitality to the full, successfully applied to the work of the LSWY in the past 30 years, the article says, and goes on: The significance and vitality of the work lie first of all in that it has helped improve the work with the young people so that they could grow stoutly to be true revolutionaries of chuche type and successors to the revolution who, firmly armed with the revolutionary idea of the party and the leader, devote everything to the party and the revolution, the country and the people. All the young people in our country today are growing to be lifeguards and death-defying corps defending the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il with death on the forefront. We cannot find in any other place such revolutionary young people as ours who are unfailingly loyal to the leader, sound in ideology and pure in morality. Our party and people deem it a great pride to have such laudable and trustworthy young people of new generation as the reserves of the revolution. The significance and vitality of the work also lie in that it has helped firmly build up the ranks of officials of the LSWY and enhance their role constantly and thus make the LSWY organisations to be virile organisations. The dear leader's work is an immortal banner which makes it possible to improve and strengthen the LSWY work and stoutly rear all the young people as reliable successors to the revolution, stresses the article.
