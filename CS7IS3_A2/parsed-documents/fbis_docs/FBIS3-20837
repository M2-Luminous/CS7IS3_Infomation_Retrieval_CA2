How many loans have the banks granted to a dead industry since introduction of the Avram, what problems are they encountering, and is there a chance of the "rusty wheel" starting up and gathering speed in the foreseeable future? Under the new market-oriented conditions, one gets the impression, the banks are ready to extend loans exclusively to sound production. Production which will yield an assured profit, and they have no intention of using their money to revive losers. Meanwhile, the big question is how many producers will manage to obtain enough credit to get their machines going and at the same time sell their products. For Zastava alone, one of our largest factories, for instance, it will take bank support amounting to at least 3 million German marks or new dinars per month, and that represents between 30 and 40 million super dinars annually. From what certain daily newspapers are writing, the announcements now coming from that giant are that this month "there will be nothing" coming from the assembly line for precisely that reason. A Real Rate of Interest at Last Unfortunately, there are quite a few giants like that in the country. Factories at Rakovica in Belgrade are waiting for loans like a thirsty man waiting for water, but even if they get them, the question is who they will sell the tractors and other machinery to, so that they can repay the money. They cannot export them abroad, at least for the present, and the peasants are holding onto their money in order to buy petroleum products, seed, fertilizer.... To invigorate production in the large factories, there is no doubt, the government and the banks will need a great deal more money than they themselves have at this moment, and it is uncertain when the sanctions will be removed and when we will again get foreign loans. Nevertheless, commercial banks here have already begun to invest money in production. This is not enough for a beginning, but things have nevertheless begun to move. Since early January the mixed PKB [Beograd Agroindustrial Combine] Bank has loaned about 9,000 billion old dinars and more than 700,000 new dinars to support production. Seventy percent of that credit was invested in agriculture, and the bank mainly enters into joint investments with creditors. Nenad Urosevic, general director of the PKB Bank, who mentioned first of all that the banks must operate on a profit basis, but an honest profit, also says that a real rate of interest has finally been introduced for the first time and must be at least 0.1 percent above the rise of retail prices. Otherwise it is inflationary. "It is not true that the banks are obstructing the program. So far the producers have been putting up for sale goods from inventory only to the extent that they could market them. Now they must count on a real rate of interest, since otherwise the program will not succeed," Mr. Urosevic warned. He added that people are not coming to the bank for credit, but for a loan. The bank in turn is seeking security in the form of collateral, and it wants repayment of the principal and interest within the period called for in the contract. When things are set up like that, no one will be operating at a loss, and there will not be any inflation. All Credits Are Short-Term Union Bank has also begun to furnish credit to its customers, agricultural producers, although sizeable applications for credits are expected only in the months to come, when planting begins. According to Milan Aleksic, director of funds and loans, 730,000 dinars have so far been invested in the fattening of baby beef, production of equipment for the food manufacturers, and the purchase of production supplies. Another 200,000 dinars have been supplied to agriculture through interbank credits, that is, not directly, and applications are being examined for 600,000 dinars in credit to finance the fattening of hogs, but also about half a million dinars for other types of production (wood manufacturing), and about 150,000 for fruit. In addition to all that, this bank is also furnishing customers guarantees so that they can import production supplies. "All the credits are short-term, for one month with the option of extension at an interest rate margin of 1-4 percent per annum. The price of our capital is perhaps high, since bank costs are immense," Mr. Aleksic said, adding that producers, those who have taken credits, have not complained about the rates of interest, since they have the kind of production that will bring a profit. From 24 January to 1 March Agrobanka approved about 4,300,000 dinars for spring farmwork, and more than 2,000,000 have been used. Slightly more than 3,000,000 dinars in credit have been granted to animal husbandry, of which about 2,500,000 dinars have been used. All in all, this bank has supplied about 7,300,000 dinars in credit, and between 80 and 95 percent of this was for agriculture. The Forgotten Cooperatives "The amount of credit approved is far less than agriculture needs," says Stanko Bugarcic, assistant director of the dinar-loan sector of Agrobanka. Nevertheless, this bank expects to be able to furnish about 25,000,000 dinars for spring farmwork. Interest rates have been set at two levels: 12 percent for primary production and 14 percent for other production. Asked whether these are real rates of interest, Mr. Bugarcic replied: "They are high for the borrowers, but for us they are low, in view of the situation the bank is in, since capital has melted away." The decision on mandatory guidance of bank loans (published in SLUZBENI LIST [OFFICIAL GAZETTE] on 15 February), which prescribes how the banks are to behave, calls for credits to be committed to production, but nowhere were the agricultural cooperatives mentioned. "We went to the NBJ [National Bank of Yugoslavia] and demanded that the cooperatives be treated like any other production firm, since between 80 and 95 percent of agriculture is based on the agricultural cooperatives," Mr. Bugarcic said. Vojvodjanska Banka has also begun to grant credits in new dinars, mainly for agriculture. So far, according to Mirko Tisma, deputy general director of the main headquarters in Belgrade, more than 10,000,000 dinars have been invested in food production. All in all, the commercial banks are ready to invest sound capital only in sound projects. The time of primary note issue is behind us, and therefore so is the credit financing of firms so that they can meet their payrolls.
