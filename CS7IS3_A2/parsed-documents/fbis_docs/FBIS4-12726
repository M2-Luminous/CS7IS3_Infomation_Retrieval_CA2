This is a basic given the Army has been contemplating ever since conditions for implementing the Gaza and Jericho First agreement began maturing. After that agreement, the Jewish Hebron turning point is bound to arrive. No one is preparing any military plans for such a move. Whenever the matter of security in Hebron is raised at the meetings of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee and at cabinet meetings, the chief of staff focuses on the astronomical numbers of troops deployed to protect a few hundred Jews living in the heart of Arab Hebron, but he says nothing else. Political sensitivity is at its peak. The voices which emanated from the cabinet concerning the possible evacuation of Hebron after the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre were received in the Army with perfect clarity. The only two questions left are how and when. The second given is that when the Army receives the orders, it will carry them out. When the Army is asked for its opinion on how to evacuate the Hebron Jews, it will present two options. The first: a one-swoop evacuation of all the 400 Jewish inhabitants, which may take several days. Such a move is liable to provoke bloodshed and leave deep social scars for generations to come. Nevertheless, such a one-stage evacuation is supposed to eliminate the undisputable center of friction, which is liable to deteriorate when the Palestinian police enter Hebron, enabling the political process to continue undisturbed. The second way is a prolonged, gradual evacuation, which limits the possibilities of bloodshed. This option offers greater flexibility to select the politically appropriate time, permits greater elbowroom for a dialogue on a quiet, voluntary evacuation of most Jews, and may reduce the risk of trauma among the public and Army personnel. This option has another advantage in that it conveys a message to the Palestinians concerning the evacuation of Jewish settlers during the interim period: Settlement evacuation is not a sweeping action; it is done case by case on merit, and Israel does not intend to renounce sites held sacred to Judaism. The disadvantage lies in the continued existence of this center of friction, albeit a reduced one. The Army can be expected to recommend the second option. In any event, any evacuation decision should be kept secret, thereby preventing the settlers from anticipating the event. The Jewish quarters in the heart of Hebron are composed of four areas centered around the Old City market and casbah. Bet Hadassah and Bet Shneorson are one residential block. The central bus station and the Avraham Avinu installation form the second block. The central bus station building is inhabited by yeshiva students. The third block is the Cave of the Patriarchs area, which abuts on a yeshiva and a settlers' restaurant. The restaurant, as well as the yeshiva, are slated to move to Bet Romano, which is being renovated. The fourth block, Tall al-Rumaythah, is 500 meters away from the Jewish compound as the crow flies. It consists of a few campers in an Arab neighborhood situated on a site perceived as the ancient, historic Hebron. The evacuation of two of the four blocks -- the yeshiva and Tall al-Rumaythah -- seems easier. The yeshiva is composed of students, youths who are not Hebron inhabitants. Next year, their parents can be expected to refuse to send them to a school situated in a permanently life-endangering district. The students live in the central bus station, daily commuting to and from the yeshiva -- a several-hundred-meter distance -- which requires an Army escort at all times. If the yeshiva is not artificially filled with students from Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza next year, it will probably either stop operating altogether or radically cut down its operations. Tall al-Rumaythah is a different block requiring separate protection. Protecting settlers walking inside the city to the Cave of the Patriarchs and the Jewish zone is particularly problematic. Tall al-Rumaythah was the last site to be settled, and is the first one that should be evacuated. From all viewpoints -- both in terms of security and tradition -- there is justification to evacuate this block to the central Jewish location at the central bus station, in place of the yeshiva students currently housed there. The evacuation of the Tall al-Rumaythah settlers might satisfy the world and the Palestinians as a first step. The problematic blocks are those located at Bet Hadassah, Bet Shneorson, and Bet Avraham Avinu. The Jewish population there utterly believes it has been chosen by God to live in Hebron. Some of them are willing to die for this belief. An immediate and forceful evacuation could lead to horrible sights such as a settler torching himself on a rooftop, or a settler opening fire on soldiers. Some of them actually believe that a confrontation with the Army is a necessary prelude to the messianic age. The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is construed by them as an army of a secular entity, a sort of mercenary force which has a certain role to fulfill in the messianic saga. It is not an essential part of the local scene, and the fanatics among the settlers have no qualms about opening fire on such a mercenary force. The halakic rulings of rabbis such as Goren, Shapira, and Li'or -- calling for a forceful opposition to evacuation -- strengthen the support for the not-so-large nucleus of fanatics. At the same time, the Hebron settlers have supporters in France and the United States. It is not inconceivable that such a group of supporters barricade itself in a Brooklyn house and threaten suicide. Such a situation would greatly embarrass the Israeli Government vis-a-vis other governments. If the government opts for a one-swoop evacuation, it is preferable that the police and border police directly deal with the settlers. In such a case the Army will clamp a curfew on Hebron and a closure on Qiryat Arba', and will declare the entire Hebron district and the roads leading to it a closed military zone. The burden of enforcing these measures will fall on the regular infantry brigades, which will have to deal with the outer circle of settler supporters who will try to reach Hebron. Problems in the Army regarding willingness to implement the evacuation are expected only in the low ranks, and this can be dealt with beforehand by appropriate treatment at the company level. Soldiers who will declare beforehand they do not intend to participate in the evacuation can be quietly left in base. There are not likely to be too many of them in any case. This is how the Army currently deals with the handful of soldiers -- mainly reservists -- who refuse to serve in the territories. A prolonged, gradual evacuation -- which will start out with the evacuation of Tall al-Rumaythah and the yeshiva, to be followed approximately two years later by the evacuation of the other Jewish quarters -- offers the influential rabbis an opportunity to come to their senses and issue appropriate halakic rulings. The sane Jewish population will also understand that the historical period of Jewish settlement in Hebron is over. A period of two years will also provide ample opportunity for removing the dangerous and fanatical elements from the area. If the government therefore decides to evacuate the Jews of Hebron, it will probably opt for this second option.
