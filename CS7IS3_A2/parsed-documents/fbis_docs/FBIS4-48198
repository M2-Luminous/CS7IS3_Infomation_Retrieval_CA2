The 120 Tanzanians, including 40 children, met the Ngara district commissioner, Ndugu Jonah Mwakishomba, who was at Kabungo on the Burundi border on other business. The Tanzanians led by the secretary of the Tanzanian community in Rwanda, Brother Ramadhani Hamza Tisiime, told the district commissioner of the suffering they experienced in Rwanda before their departure via Burundi. The Tanzanians, who arrived in Tanzania in a freight truck flying the Tanzanian flag, and five private cars are travelling to Mwanza where they hope to meet the regional commissioner. They plan to present the commissioner with the national flag which was removed from the Tanzanian Embassy in Kigali and is now flying on the truck. The embassy in Kigali was closed many days ago. The Tanzanians say they stayed outside the embassy in the sun and rain without getting any assistance from the Rwandans who claimed that President Habyarimana had been killed on his way from Tanzania and therefore they should fend for themselves. One woman told the Ngara district commissioner that she had been on a visit to Kigali and had left her residence for a short time. When she returned she found that all the Tanzanians in the house had been killed by government troops and government militia. The Tanzanians related that on their way home, they received some assistance from RPF fighters. They also said there are 40 other Tanzanians at the embassy in Kigali without food who need assistance from the government of Tanzania. [passage omitted]
