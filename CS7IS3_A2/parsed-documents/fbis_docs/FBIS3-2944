They declined to talk about the inspection process and said that results will not be released immediately. The inspection of seven of the nine DPRK nuclear sites was agreed to in a February-15 accord between the IAEA and the DPRK. Pyongyang described the accord as one aimed at ensuring nuclear safety. The IAEA is expected to negotiate with the DPRK on inspection of the remaining two nuclear facilities to verify that the DPRK is not developing nuclear weapons. The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency suspects that the DPRK is developing nuclear weapons in the two facilities. The United States has made the implementation of IAEA inspections one of the conditions for opening the third U.S.-DPRK high-level meeting, scheduled for March 21 in Geneva.
