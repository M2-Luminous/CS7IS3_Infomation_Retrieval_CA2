For instance, his meeting with heads of the city's leading industrial enterprises outlined some ways to eliminate the chronic crisis of unpaid debts in the defense industry. During a visit to the Petr Velikiy, a nuclear-powered heavy missile cruiser which is under construction, the intention of both the Defense Ministry and the workers themselves to commission the ship on schedule was confirmed. This offers the hope that, despite funding difficulties, the Russian Navy is beginning to see a revival in its fortunes. [A. Kokoshin, Russian first deputy defense minister, identified by caption] I believe that by the joint efforts of the fleet, the Defense Ministry, and the shipyard the construction of this ship will be completed and it will join the Navy.
