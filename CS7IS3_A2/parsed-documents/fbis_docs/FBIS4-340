Bulger] [Text] Johannesburg April 7 SAPA -- The African Christian Democratic Party [ACDP] on Thursday [7 April] launched an election manifesto which, it said, provided a basis for the social and economic transformation of South Africa. The programme is based on a moral, judicial and ethical system, open market economics and direct democracy. The ACDP said a mere change in centrl government would not answer South Africa's social needs. "If a new government attempts a mere lineal approach of more houses, more jobs, more teachers, more schools and more hospitals, it will bankrupt the country long before the goal is ever reached. A transformational strategy through the introduction of a new dimension of freedom is the only hope," the ACDP manifesto says. The manifesto was introduced by party leader Kenneth Meshoe, Chairman Johan van der Westhuizen, spokesman Dan Maluleke and Policy Co-ordinator Nick Addison. Dr van der Westhuizen said communities formed the building blocks of the ACDP's programme. "The ACDP stands for the centrality of the family as the home for human development and the cornerstone for building healthy communities and a stable society," the manifesto says. "Community-based development organisations and/or community development trusts should assist local government in the implementation of the various development and social delivery functions on a contractual basis. Community involvement in the allocation and uses of scarce resources will improve transparency and a more equitable application of these resources." Dr van der Westhuizen said the party was committed to federalism with a two-tier government, the first tier being a small central government and the second being district governments. The system's purpose would be to curb the growth of bureaucracy and to prevent majoritarian tyranny. The ACDP would create wealth by stimulating entrepreneurship and small business. It opposed redistribution of wealth and confiscation of land although it supported land restitution by legal means. "The ACDP opposes policies which will simply dump families on unsustainable plots of land, which will trap them into subsistence and poverty. Land allocation will have to meet the criterion of viability and will have to be supplemented by effective support systems to avoid further depletion and erosion of a scarce resource," the manifesto says. Under an ACDP government, social services would be provided by district governments while the state would provide services within its means. Statutory bodies would be set up to maintain national standards which would become equitable over a 10-year period. Dr van der Westhuizen said the ACDP had 147 offices countrywide and the support of about 8,000 "community" leaders. It was formed in December last year to contest the elections nationally.
