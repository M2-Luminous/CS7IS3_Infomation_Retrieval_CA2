[Husayn] [passage omitted] There is a clear colonialist (?campaign). Five out of the seven states which have been listed as terrorist countries, and are on America's terrorism list, are Arab and Islamic states. And this for no reason other than these states have independent decisions and that these states want to develop and live in pride. The issue is clear; they [as heard] now admit that the accusations on the basis of which this unjust blockade was imposed on the Great Jamahiriyah (?are groundless). They cast doubts on these accusations and all these have now collapsed. Despite this, the blockade continues. [passage omitted] Why was Sudan put on the list of terrorist states? No incident has been proved and no terrorist action has been launched from Sudan, and Sudan has not experienced terrorism throughout its life. We have never heard of a Sudanese citizen participating in any terrorist operation. This is something which does not exist in the character and structure of the people of Sudan. When they said that they put us on the list of terrorist states, the Americans said that there were accusations by reliable sources. We told them [word indistinct] and we do not want these sources to be disclosed. We told them: We do not want you to disclose these sources, but to prove to us these facts. They have not been able to prove a single fact. Despite this Sudan was put on the list of terrorist states. Former American President Carter denied this, because he visited Sudan [word indistinct] to announce that these accusations were unjustified. This is what was said by a former American president. The issue is not about proved facts, but the whole matter is that any voice which is raised in the Arab nation to declare the pride of this nation must be silenced, and anyone raising this voice must have a blockade imposed on him and must be humiliated. This is the issue. [passage omitted] We reject injustice, this unjust blockade, and this list on which they put whoever they want without any evidence, and we reject the use of international organizations and meetings for personal goals. The United Nations has double standards and uses rules and means with which people are humiliated. [passage omitted]
