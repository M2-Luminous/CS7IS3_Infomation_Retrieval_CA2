Foreign Undersecretary Rodolfo Severino said the dispute would in no way be the focus of Mahathir's visit this week, but he pointed out that "the air could be cleared to some extent and things clarified" with the Malaysian leader's meeting with members of the Philippine Congress. It is just as well. Although the executive since the time of former President Corazon C. Aquino has made moves to drop the Sabah claim to improve our relations with Malaysia, opposition by senators has consistently stood in the way. [passage omitted] Mahathir has since said that he understands the peculiarity of the Philippine system, declaring that certain processes have to be followed before Manila could relinquish its claim to Sabah. The Sabah issue, therefore, represents just about the exception in the traditional dictum that foreign policy is formulated by the executive. The issue is an emotional one and cannot be resolved by mere executive fiat. But more than that, the Sabah issue represents the challenge facing the Philippine government system on one hand, and Philippine-Malaysian relations on the other. Since the Senate has insisted on becoming a partner with Malacanang [presidential office] in setting the foreign-policy agenda at least in so far as the Sabah issue is concerned, it is compelled to define a far-reaching but workable stand to resolve the thorniest problem plaguing our relations with Malaysia. Prolonged opposition by lawmakers to executive initiatives to drop the claim without any initiative on their part to make practical proposals will inevitably be construed as nothing but obstructionism. In short, the issue is a challenge to Philippine democratic consensus-building. [passage omitted] To be sure, the exchange visit of Mr. Mahathir will show that Philippine-Malaysian relations have matured. It signals the desire of Malaysia to continue on the path of regional solidarity and cooperation. The grand vision of ASEAN appears secure and cannot be derailed by territorial disputes. Like France and Germany, the Philippines and Malaysia have managed to build a strong partnership in spite of pending historical claims. [passage omitted] It is up to our legislators to show to the Malaysian leader that their opposition to dropping the Sabah claim at this time upholds the national interest, an aspect of which is fostering better relations with Malaysia. The dialogue perhaps will make tentative steps toward resolving the dispute once and for all in a peaceful and mutually beneficial manner. If so, the Sabah issue may yet instruct and impress the Malaysians on the glory of Philippine democracy.
