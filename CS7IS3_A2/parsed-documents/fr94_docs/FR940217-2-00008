FR940217-2-00008 FR940217-2-00005 [A&hyph;583&hyph;810] Chrome-Plated Lug Nuts From Taiwan AGENCY: Import Administration/International Trade Administration, Commerce. ACTION: Notice of preliminary results of antidumping duty administrative review and partial termination. SUMMARY: In response to a request by a petitioner, the Department of Commerce has conducted an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on chrome-plated lug nuts from Taiwan. The review covers four firms and the period April 18, 1991, through August 31, 1992. The review indicates the existence of margins for the firms. As a result of this review, we preliminarily determine to assess antidumping duties equal to the difference between United States price and foreign market value. Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results. EFFECTIVE DATE: February 1, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Todd Peterson or Thomas Futtner, Office of Antidumping Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;4195 or 482&hyph;3814, respectively. Background On September 20, 1991, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published the antidumping duty order on chrome-plated lug nuts from Taiwan (56 FR 47737). The Department published a notice of ``Opportunity to Request Administrative Review'' on September 11, 1992 (57 FR 41725). On September 21, 1992, the petitioner, Consolidated International Automotive, Inc. (Consolidated), requested that we conduct an administrative review for the period April 18, 1991, through August 31, 1992. We published a notice of ``Initiation of Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Administrative Review'' on October 22, 1992 (57 FR 48202), announcing an administrative review of King Kong Corporation, San Shin Hardware Works Co., Ltd. (San Shin), Gourmet Equipment (Taiwan) Corporation (Gourmet), Chu Fong Metallic Industrial Corporation (Chu Fong), and San Chien Electric Industrial Works, Ltd. (San Chien). On January 8, 1993, the petitioner withdrew its request for review of San Shin. Therefore, we are terminating the review. We were unable to identify an address for King Kong Corporation. We sent questionnaires to Gourmet, Chu Fong, and San Chien. We received a response from Gourmet and conducted a verification at Gourmet's office September 22, 1993, through September 26, 1993. On May 26, 1993, the petitioner alleged middleman dumping of the subject merchandise. Based on information compiled during the review process, the Department determined to apply best information available (BIA) to Gourmet and the two non-respondents. Therefore, the Department did not initiate a middleman dumping investigation (see Use of BIA, Middleman dumping allegation, and Transhipment allegation memos to Holly Kuga, Director, Office of Antidumping Compliance). On June 11, 1993, the petitioner alleged that the respondent was shipping the subject merchandise through Canada to the United States. We examined data provided by the U.S. Customs Service which showed no evidence that the Canadian buyer resold the subject merchandise to the United States during the period of review (POR) (see Use of BIA, Middleman dumping allegation, and Transhipment allegation memo to Holly Kuga, Director, Office of Antidumping Compliance). The Department has now conducted the administrative review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff Act).
