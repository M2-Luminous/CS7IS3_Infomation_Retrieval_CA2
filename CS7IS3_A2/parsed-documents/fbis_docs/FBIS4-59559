Vivekanand] [Text] Amman--The release of details of agreements reached between Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) on implementing their Jan. 7 economic accord has been delayed for 48 hours upon the request of the PLO leadership, both sides said Friday [13 May]. It was not immediately known whether the PLO leadership in Tunis would seek any amendment to the agreements, which were supposed to have been formalised and released Thursday through a joint statement and a press conference. The delay in the process was attributed to the PLO Executive Committee's preoccupations with naming members of an "autonomy cabinet" for the Gaza Strip and Jericho. Information made available to the JORDAN TIMES indicated that the main points covered by the agreements included: -- The formation of a joint committee for banking and monetary affairs in the autonomous territories; envisaged under the Sept. 13 Israel-PLO declaration of principles; -- Free trade between Jordan and the autonomous territories; and -- Maintaining the Jordanian dinar as the "main currency" in circulation in the occupied territories. "These are the salient points in the agreement which are of utmost importance at this point in time," said a Palestinian source. "Other points cover the technical details of how to implement these decisions and also touch upon tourism," said the source, who preferred anonymity. Jordanian sources confirmed that these were the broad outline of the agreements, reached in two days of talks between a high-level Jordanian delegation headed by Minister of State for Cabinet Affairs Jawad al-'Anani and a PLO team led by Ahmad Quray', director of the Economic Department of the PLO. "It is an implementation-oriented document, and we hope to launch moves on the ground as soon as it is ratified by the leaderships of the two countries," said a senior-Jordanian source, adding that the government had reviewed and endorsed it. According to the source, who also preferred anonymity, "the agreements are those we could arrive at, given the peculiar circumstances of Palestinian autonomy." "Are the Palestinians free to decide and act as they want?" asked another official, in a reference to an economic agreement signed by the PLO and Israel in Paris in April. That accord details a series of measures that are widely seen as confining the PLO's freedom in exercising its economic options with Jordan, or any other party other than the occupying power itself. Furthermore, it also closed the door against the implementation of some of the provisions in the Jan. 7 agreement signed between Jordan and the PLO in Amman. Asked whether the agreements reached last week reflected the Kingdom's acceptance that they were the best that the Kingdom and the PLO could hope for, given the Israeli-imposed limitations, the source was non-committal, saying: "That's your deduction." The sources said the joint Jordanian-Palestinian committee on banking and monetary affairs could meet as early as Saturday, shortly after the expected release of the details of the document. Under the agreements, the committee, which will be headed on the Jordanian side by the deputy governor of the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) and on the Palestinian side by the deputy governor's counterpart from the Palestinian Economic Council for Development and Reconstruction (PECDAR), will monitor and control banking and currency affairs in the occupied territories. Jordanian banks which have already been licensed by the CBJ to reopen their branches in the occupied territories will also come under the committee's control and supervision. All future applications for licensing will be dealt with by the committee. The sources said Jordan had expressed reservations over a no ceiling, free-trade arrangement between the Kingdom and the autonomous territories and but then dropped its reservations. The Kingdom had suggested a $300 million ceiling for trade, but the PLO could not meet that volume because of the Israeli-imposed curbs in the Paris agreement. "We decided to keep trade open-ended in the initial stage," said the Jordanian source. "We hope to develop it further as we go along further in our economic cooperation." There were no formal meetings on Thursday. Royal Court Chief Sharif Zayid Bin Shakir and the King's advisors held talks with the PLO delegation. No details were available on the discussions. "We have forwarded the agreements to the PLO Executive Committee and are awaiting its response," said the Palestinian source. "We hope to receive the committee's endorsement anytime now." "Hopefully, we could wind up the meetings early Saturday and release the details," added the source. The self-rule authority will use the Jordanian dinar in all its dealing, he source said. "The dinar will be the main currency in circulation in autonomous territories as well as the rest of the occupied lands," said the source. All other currencies, including the Israeli shekel, will also be used, added the source. The Paris agreement states that the shekel will be "a legal tender" in he autonomous territories.
