FBIS4-64143 "drsov104cc_94004" FBIS-SOV-94-104 Daily Report 31 May 1994 INTERREGIONAL AFFAIRS ITAR-TASS Carries Press Review for 31 May ITAR-TASS Carries Press Review for 31 May LD3105064594 Moscow ITAR-TASS in English 0500 GMT 31 May 94 LD3105064594 Moscow ITAR-TASS English BFN ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] [Text] Moscow May 31 TASS -- ROSSISKIYE VESTI on President Boris Yeltsi's working trip to Tatarstan: the newspaper believes that special attention during the tour will be devoted to problems connected with the rebuilding of the motor engine making plant, after it was gutted out by fire last year, at the kamaz, one of russia's largest autoworks in Naberezhnyye Chelny. ROSSIISKAYA GAZETA singles out a statement by Vice-Premier Sergey Shakray that the purpose of Yeltsin's trip to Tatarstan is to work out a mechanism to monitor compliance with the treaty between Russia and Tatarstan "plus an economic agreement". NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries and article headlined "How Much Sovereignty Did Tatarstan Gain? boris Yeltsin Decided To See That for Himself". The newspaper recalls that it was precisely in Tatarstan when Yeltsin as Russian praliament chief running for the presidency, uttered his famous phrase: "Take as much sovereignty as you can chew". President Yeltsin can now make a real assessment of what has been done in this respect by the republic "which through persistent efforts over the past two years has gained, perhaps, the greatest independence from Moscow", the newspaper noted. KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) focuses on the discussion of a bill "on a state-placed defence order" at the State Duma committee for industry, construction, transport and power. Drafters of the bill are of the opinion, the newspaper points out, that such a law will make it possible "more fully to enact Russia's military doctrine, enhance the material interests of all those who fill a state-placed defence order, raise the role of state contracts and agreements, and guarantee material and technical resources for defence industry needs". The first reading of the bill is to be considered in the state Duma at the end of June. RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA, in connection with the current exhibition of weapons in Vladimir, writes that "our country, notwithstanding a first-class defence potential, has not even approached the main sale counters of the arms market". "The spheres of influence at the market have long been divided, and it is not easy to get there now. But the country must get there", for even individual specimens of the most effective small arms cost hundreds of thousands of U.S. dollars," the newspaper points out. TRUD on Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's homecoming: The return of the great writer and citizen, who was forcibly expelled from the country twenty years ago, was awaited by many with impatience and hope, if only because they saw that as the restoration of historical justice". KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA on the death of former East German leader Erich Honecker: "Honecker was a staunch romanticist of the communist idea. Unlike his fellow leaders in Eastern European countries, not a single reproach connected with an abuse of official position for personal gain was flung at him." SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA maintains that the package of presidential decrees, signed on May 23, which cancels export quota-fixing and licensing, plunges the country into a new phase of a "democratic revolution". The newspaper writes that the decrees considerably ease the tax burdern of enterprises with foreign capital and "obligingly fling the gate to the west inordinately wide open". PRAVDA on the 95th birthday of writer Leonid Leonov: "There is no precedent in the history of world culture when a writer, a national classic, would mark his 95th birthday with the publication of a new novel summing up the philosophical and ethical results of a whole stage in the history of world civilisation. The novel in question is The Puramid, the publication of which has been started by Nash Sovremennik (our contemporary) literary journal". ROSSIISKIYE VESTI reports, referring to a statement by Ukrainian first Deputy Interior Minister Valentin Nedrigailo, that "there will be no war in the Crimea". An article to this effect, headlined "Partnership for Peace: Realities and the Interests of Russia", propounds the idea that it is possible to maintian stability in Europe "only in active cooperation with Russia".
