It is international practice to follow the accounting standards of the enterprise's home country. 2) When an enterprise is listed on the Hong Kong market, it should prepare balance sheets in light of international or Hong Kong accounting standards. Although the "experimental system" and the accounting operation and statistical systems have approached Hong Kong's accounting standards, there are still differences between mainland statistics and Hong Kong's prevailing practices. To help Hong Kong investors understand and analyze the financial status of the listed companies, the financial reports presented by the company to the shareholders should follow China's accounting standards and regulations as well as international and Hong Kong accounting standards. 3) When the shareholding company is set up, the listed enterprise should implement the "experimental system." The provisions governing shareholding companies should be followed for endorsing the establishment of a company, namely, "a company is established and becomes a corporation after it registers with the industrial and commercial administrative management authorities." 4) The implementation of the "experimental system" will not be retroactive. To provide a comparable financial report, the auditing report submitted by the registered accountant should readjust the balance sheet of the previous years and reckon the achievements of the previous three years in light of constant prices. This does not affect the actual situation of a certain accounting system already practiced in an enterprise. 5) The time and method for evaluating transfer accounts. According to provisions, when an enterprise is transformed into a shareholding company, its assets must be evaluated, and the face value of the original enterprise must be readjusted in light of the values defined in the evaluation. There are two points which should be clarified: First, when the accounts should be transferred. The accounts can be evaluated and transferred only after the enterprise has been transformed to a shareholding company. Second, how the accounts should be transferred. The floating capital, long-term investment, and invisible assets should be transferred in light of the value and face value defined in the evaluation. The original value and accumulated depreciation of the fixed assets should be reevaluated. The net value of the fixed assets should be calculated by deducting the estimated depreciation from the reevaluated original value. 6) Public welfare funds should be placed under the shareholders' control. In accordance with the law and administrative rules, a shareholding company should draw a certain proportion of public welfare funds from its after-tax profits. Public welfare funds should be under the shareholders' control. The fixed assets purchased by an enterprise with public welfare funds are considered part of the enterprise's assets. Any gains or losses which result from the disposal of these assets should be regarded as income or expenses from enterprise operations and should be included in the enterprise's total profits or losses.
