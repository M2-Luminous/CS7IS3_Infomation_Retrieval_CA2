SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On May 19, 1994, MSHA published a proposed rule in the Federal Register (59 FR 26356) revising stayed provisions of MSHA's existing safety standards for ventilation of underground coal mines. The proposal also revised, clarified or reproposed certain other provisions in the existing rule; included some new provisions; and addressed concerns raised by the public. The comment period was scheduled to close on July 18, 1994, but, in response to a request from the mining community for additional time in which to prepare comments, MSHA extended the comment period to August 8, 1994 (59 FR 35071). The purpose of the hearings is to receive relevant comments and to answer questions interpreting or clarifying the proposal. The hearings will be conducted in an informal manner by a panel of MSHA officials. Although formal rules of evidence or cross examination will not apply, the presiding official may exercise discretion to ensure the orderly progress of the hearings and may exclude irrelevant or unduly repetitious material and questions. Each session will begin with an opening statement from MSHA, followed by an opportunity for members of the public to make oral presentations. The hearing panel will be available to address relevant questions. At the discretion of the presiding official, the time allocated to speakers for their presentations may be limited. In the interest of conducting productive hearings, MSHA will schedule speakers in a manner that allows all points of view to be heard as effectively as possible. Verbatim transcripts of the proceedings will be prepared and made a part of the rulemaking record. Copies of the hearing transcripts will be made available to the public for review. MSHA will also accept for the record additional written comments and other appropriate data from any interested party, including those not presenting oral statements. Written comments and data submitted to MSHA will be included in the rulemaking record. To allow for the submission of any post-hearing comments the record will remain open until November 18, 1994. Dated: August 11, 1994. J. Davitt McAteer, Assistant Secretary for Mine Safety and Health. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;20199 Filed 8&hyph;16&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4510&hyph;43&hyph;P
