A draft of this document has recently been examined by the Belarusian Cabinet of Ministers Economics Department. The main disagreement between the government and trade unions regarding this draft, concerned the proportions between the minimum wage and the minimum consumer basket. Nevertheless, as Viktar Talstakoraw, chief of the FPB Department of Organization and Remuneration of Labor, told BELAPAN, the following compromise was reached on this issue: The proportions between the minimum wage and the minimum consumer budget should be reexamined according to the results of the first six months of 1994. The three sides also agreed that it is necessary to constantly control the implementation of the general agreement. Control was entrusted to the Belarusian Arbitrary Council for Labor and Social Issues that includes representatives of the government, the FPB, and the Employers Union. The council is to hold its meetings every three months. As Viktar Talstakoraw pointed out, this year's general agreement distinguishes itself as "more specific and directed."
