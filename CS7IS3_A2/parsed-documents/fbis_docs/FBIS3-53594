The two sides discussed bilateral trade relations and means to bolster and develop these relations. Details are in the following report: Dr. Khalaf reviewed trade relations between Jordan and the United States and the great investment opportunities that the citizens are expecting as a result of the peace process in the region--a process that achieves a just, comprehensive, and durable peace and maintains Arab rights. She talked about Jordan's current economic reform program and the positive results of this program. She noted that the Gulf war had a negative impact on the program, which led to its interruption for a period of time. The minister said that Jordan is an important partner to the United States, pointing out that Jordan's import of U.S. goods is 23 percent of its overall world imports at a time when Jordanian exports to the United States are very limited. In this regard, the minister expressed Jordan's desire to sign an agreement with the United States to take advantage of the preferential U.S. trade system, based on which exports to the United States, including Jordanian exports, are given privileges such as customs exemption. She noted that Jordanian exporters faced some difficulties as a result of being excluded from this system and its privileges. Dr. Khalaf said that Jordan is seeking to improve the investment climate in order to find appropriate trade relations with the world, including the United States. Minister of Planning Dr. Ziyad Fariz said that Jordan began planning policies in the areas of investment and development of exports in 1989. He noted that the Ministry is seeking to privatize some of the public sector's properties, adding that this requires assistance as well as a solution to the social problems that could result from this. He said there are economic and social reforms in this field such as developing the health system. Dr. Fariz also talked about Jordan's efforts to solve the problem of Jordan's debts to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Moreover, the minister of planning presented to the U.S. secretary of commerce a paper that summarizes the most important economic and social problems and challenges facing Jordan. Minister of Finance Sami Qammuh talked about Jordan's debt of $7.5 million, which obstructs the process of serving commerce and investment. He noted that this debt needs to be written off. For his part, the U.S. Secretary of Commerce talked about the importance of trade exchange between Jordan and the United States and the prospects of trade in the region as a result of the peace process. He noted the importance of Jordan's geographical location, which allows it to play a big role in reinforcing trade in the Middle East. He welcomed economic reforms in Jordan, which include encouraging the private sector and reinforcing its role in investment opportunities. He noted the possibility of cooperation between Jordanian and U.S. businessmen to encourage the private sectors of both countries to get involved in various forms of investment. He welcomed the idea of opening a number of branches for Jordanian banks in the occupied Arab territories, which will provide for broader cooperation between the banking sectors of Jordan and the United States. The Jordanian and U.S. sides exchanged ideas on the possibilities for commercial cooperation and on encouraging the private sector's role in this field. Khaldun Abu-Hassan, head of Amman's Chamber of Industry, talked about the embargo imposed on Jordanian goods at the port of al-'Aqabah, stressing the need to provide the private sectors of both countries with opportunities for investment and commercial exchange.
