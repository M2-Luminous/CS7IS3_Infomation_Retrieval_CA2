FR940825-0-00080 FR940825-0-00016 The provisions of the current subpart J, Monitoring and Reporting of Program Performance, are removed as modified by the Circular to the revised subpart C, §74.51, Monitoring and reporting program performance. We have eliminated the distinction which appears at the current §§74.82 and 74.83, between program performance reports under construction awards and under non-construction awards. Identical rules now apply to both types of awards under the revised subpart C. Sections 74.90 and 74.91 of the current subpart K, Grant and Subgrant Payment Requirements, are eliminated as being obsolete, having been overtaken by the changes in the systems used to transfer Federal funds to recipients of Federal awards. The remaining §§74.92 through 74.97 are removed as modified by the Circular to §74.22 (a) through (h), and (j) through (m) of the revised subpart C's Financial and Program Management provisions. The provisions of the current subpart L, Programmatic Changes and Budget Revisions, are removed as modified by the Circular to §74.25, Revision of budget and program plans, of the revised subpart C with two exceptions. First, the intent of the current provisions at §74.100 (b) and (c) exempting ``mandatory grants'' is covered at §74.1 of the revised subpart A which, as discussed above, sets forth the extent to which this part, as amended, applies to the ``entitlement programs'' identified at 45 CFR 92 (a)(3), (a)(7), and (a)(8). Second, §74.104 is eliminated because it is no longer necessary in light of other provisions of the Circular as implemented herein. Section 74.110, Definitions, of the current subpart M, Grant and Subgrant Closeout, Suspension, and Termination, is incorporated as modified by the Circular in the revised subpart A, §74.2, Definitions. Current subpart M §§74.111, Closeout, and 74.112, Amounts Payable to the Federal Government, are removed as modified by the Circular to the revised subpart D. Current §§74.113, Violation of Terms; 74.114, Suspension; and 74.115, Termination, are removed as modified by the Circular to the revised subpart C, §§74.60 through 74.62, Termination and Enforcement. The provisions at the current subpart N, Forms for Applying for Grants, have been replaced in their entirety by §74.12, Forms for applying for HHS financial assistance, as the revised subpart B. Section 74.132, Definitions, of the current subpart O, Property, is incorporated as modified by the Circular in §74.2, Definitions, of the revised subpart A. The remaining §§74.133 through 74.145 of the current subpart are removed as modified by the Circular to §§74.30 through 74.37 of the revised subpart C's Property Standards provisions. Sections 74.160, 74.161 and 74.163 of the current subpart P, Procurements by Grantees and Subgrantees, are removed as modified by the Circular to the Procurement Standards of the revised subpart C at §§74.40 through 74.48. Section 74.162 of the current subpart is eliminated as being obsolete. Section 74.164 of the current subpart is incorporated as modified by the Circular in §74.53, Retention and access requirements for records, of the revised subpart C. The current subpart Q, Cost Principles, are removed as modified by the Circular to §74.27, Allowable costs, of the revised subpart B, except that current §§74.171(b) and 74.172(b) are eliminated as being obsolete; and §74.177 is eliminated as being redundant with the cost principles of the applicable OMB Circulars. Differences Between Part 74, as Amended and Circular A&hyph;110 1. Circular A&hyph;110 Options Circular A&hyph;110 contains language that, expressly or by implication, authorizes agencies to exercise discretion in how they choose to implement a particular Circular provision so long as the exercise of such discretion does not violate some applicable statute. Many of these options will be administered on a program-by-program or an award-by-award basis by HHS awarding agencies. However, to maintain maximum consistency and uniformity in HHS award and administration policy and practice, HHS has elected to regulate the following on a uniform basis: •The Circular (section XXXX . 23(b)) provides for Federal agency prior approval when a recipient wishes to satisfy a cost-sharing or matching requirement by not seeking Federal payment of some or all of the indirect costs under the award. We are waiving this prior approval requirement to minimize administrative burdens on HHS recipients of funds. See §74.23(b). •The Circular (section XXXX . 24(f)) authorizes Federal agencies, by regulation or by the terms and conditions of an award, to allow recipients to deduct the costs of generating income under federally-supported projects, in certain circumstances, when they compute net program income. To facilitate uniformity of treatment in HHS awards administration, we are persuaded that all recipients of HHS funds subject to this part should operate under the same rule; therefore, we have elected to exercise this authority by regulation. See §74.24(f). •The Circular (section XXXX . 25(c)(2)) requires recipients of non-construction awards to request prior Federal agency approval for changes in key personnel working under the award. We have elaborated on this fundamental requirement by specifying that the project director or principal investigator is always such a key person under HHS awards. This has been HHS policy for many years because we believe that project direction and leadership are important bases upon which HHS makes award decisions and decisions during the course of award administration. See §74.25(c)(2). •The Circular (section XXXX . 25(c)(5)) authorizes Federal agencies to impose a prior approval requirement on recipient budget transfers between direct and indirect costs. HHS has not previously required such prior approval, and we see no need to do so now. Consequently, this provision of the Circular does not appear in these amendments. •The Circular (section XXXX . 25(f)) authorizes Federal agencies to impose a prior approval requirement on certain fund transfers that exceed ten percent of an award's total budget. HHS has not imposed this requirement in the past. Our long term experience without such a requirement gives us no reason to establish one now. Because award administration has worked well without a prior approval requirement, we have elected to continue to refrain from imposing one. Consequently, this provision of the Circular does not appear in these amendments.
