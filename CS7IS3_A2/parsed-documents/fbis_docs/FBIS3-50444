According to a communique issued this week by CONACOPP coordinator Cherestal Vanes, he had decided to expel Saurel Beaujour from the confederation because of a lack of harmony between Beaujour and the other members of the organization. Beaujour in turn accuses Vanes of depositing a check for $600 in his personal account. This Indian wrestling match is taking a new turn. The latest note from CONACOPP, dated 29 December, signed by nine members of the organization's national secretariat, formally denied the letter from Cherestal Vanes, who had personally made the decision to expel Saurel Beaujour. The communique says that the CONACOPP national secretariat was never aware of the facts mentioned in Vanes' letter. The secretariat asserts that Saurel Beaujour has always had exemplary behavior within the organization, which has not been true of Cherestal Vanes. The secretariat also took this opportunity to announce to the national and international organizations that Cherestal Vanes is no longer CONACOPP spokesman.
