Therefore, its ideological work must display high militancy and great power of persuasion. At turning points -- especially when the revolutionary cause enjoys new opportunities and also faces great difficulties and challenges -- there is a greater need for ideological work to meet high militancy requirements. Under such circumstances, efforts must be made to point out the advantages and difficulties; shed light on the profound and new character of the problems encountered; adopt timely action to get rid of all indications of subjectivism, pessimism, oscillation, faltering faith, and erroneous concepts regarding policies and lines; and take firm steps to lay bare and effectively cope with sabotage by hostile forces on the ideological front. Since the sixth party congress, the national and international situations have become very complicated and put our party's ideological work through a very stringent test. A socioeconomic crisis began in the late seventies and early eighties and lasted for many consecutive years. The situation became more precarious from 1986-1988 when inflation developed at a galloping pace. Then 1991 witnessed the crumbling of the former Soviet Union and a number of socialist countries. Our country faced another dangerous challenge. Nonetheless, our party has demonstrated its political steadfastness and persisted along the socialist path. Thanks to its spirit of independence, sovereignty, and creativeness, our party has helped our people tide over great challenges, stand firmly on their own feet, and begin to shift to a new development stage. The events of recent years have provided us with new knowledge and experiences regarding militancy and the power of persuasion in ideological work. Nevertheless, our militancy and power of persuasion in ideological work have not been upgraded in an even manner to meet our high requirements. There are still instances in which cadres, party members, and people fail to adopt a clear-cut attitude, heighten vigilance, and fully realize the acts of sabotage by hostile forces aimed at getting rid of the party and socialist regime in our country. A number of cadres and party members still look on with indifference in the face of the enemy's erroneous concepts and attempts to instigate the people and cause disturbances. Others oscillate when confronted with the need to persist along the socialist path, or worse still, want to follow a different path. Efforts have been made on the ideological and theoretical fronts. Nonetheless, because our efforts still do not meet the high militancy requirements, the results obtained are not effective enough to provide timely and eloquent solutions to problems arising from real life situations. Many cadres and party members, including leading cadres, are still too lazy to learn... Dissension still exerts a very heavy impact in a number of party organizations. Now that the revolution has reached a new turning point, the militancy requirements of ideological work are reflected through the following points: -- It is necessary to safeguard the essential problems concerning the revolutionary cause. They include the "ideological and theoretical foundations, political goals and lines, and the nature of party leadership..." As far as the aforementioned problems are concerned, ideological work must meet the high militancy requirements and must give top priority to efforts to work out problem-solving methods. -- It is important to uphold the high militancy in our ideological work. The current situation requires theoretical work to begin first so that orientations can be set. Because the real life situations are too new to understand, though, many problems need to be clarified. The militancy in the ideological work must be reflected through one's assertiveness, ability to make early predictions and be sensitive to new developments, determination to make bold studies, and courage to deal with unprecedented problems while at the same time taking precautions against disorientation. -- It is necessary for everyone to grasp party lines and resolutions fully and understand them thoroughly, display single-mindedness, and develop consistent implementation measures. Efforts must be made to overcome weaknesses arising from subjectivism and internal dissension that are likely to develop at turning points. It is important to make sure that words match deeds and yield effective results. Efforts must be made to do away with poor work organization and skepticism, because these drawbacks exert a negative impact on militant activities. -- Make sustained efforts to educate cadres and party members so they can grasp new opportunities while at the same time helping to safeguard and develop the political stalwartness of each cadre, party member, and individual citizen. The militancy in ideological work covers concrete contents based on the specific requirements and tasks of each of the revolution's development stages. The aforementioned requirements and tasks have already been clearly defined by the midterm national party conference and the conference on ideological and cultural work in early 1994. Based on the aforementioned orientations, the militancy in ideological work must be patterned after a number of key ideological concepts. It is necessary to uphold the spirit of independence, sovereignty, and self-sufficiency and self-help. At the same time, it is important to criticize and help overcome the bad practices of waiting for help from the outside world or relying on subsidies from the state or upper echelons. As far as ideological work is concerned, efforts must be made to discover and encourage examples of success made possible by the spirit of self-sufficiency and self-help in the framework of the renovation cause of our party and people. It is necessary to learn selectively from mankind's achievements and from other countries' experiences and apply them to the actual situation in Vietnam in a correct and creative manner. Timely measures must be taken to check and overcome slavish imitation and dogmatism, which always does more harm than good to the revolutionary undertaking, no matter where it comes from. Here military spirit is reflected through the will to act and free oneself from poverty, dependence, and the danger of being left behind. It is important to promote the sense of industry, thrift, honesty, and righteousness. Practicing thrift to serve the cause of national construction and defense is a major policy designed by our party to mobilize and make effective use of all available resources to develop the national industrialization and modernization program a further step. We must carry out the ideological struggle on a long-term basis, bearing in mind the following: -- It is necessary for everyone to grasp party lines and resolutions fully and understand them thoroughly, display single-mindedness, and develop consistent implementation measures.

Practicing thrift to serve the cause of national construction and defense is a major policy designed by our party to mobilize and make effective use of all available resources to develop the national industrialization and modernization program a further step. We must carry out the ideological struggle on a long-term basis, bearing in mind the need to make persistent and meticulous efforts to turn our ideological concept into a lifestyle for all members of society to follow. As an immediate objective, it is necessary to condemn resolutely the waste or loss of public funds and use of budget allocations on extravagant spending sprees, lavish parties, gifts, and unnecessary equipment. Measures must be taken to put an end to the bad practice of spending beyond the limits set by our economic growth rate. Strategically speaking, it is very important to grasp opportunities, eliminate dangers, and overcome challenges to shift the country gradually to a new development stage and accelerate the renovation undertaking, which is aimed at making the people rich and the country powerful and at building an equal and civilized society. Therefore, it is necessary to understand this strategically important concept thoroughly and apply it to the current situation to accelerate our country's renovation undertaking. This means that it is now possible for the militancy in ideological work to shift from a defensive position to an offensive position, take the upper hand, and move forward. Ideological work must be carried out in a confident manner and with new enthusiasm. Refresher training programs on the party's concepts and lines must be held so that cadres and party members can enhance their knowledge; be firm in the nation's choice of the socialist path; study their appropriate adaptation and development of Marxist-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh Thought in the new situation; and discover and resolutely rectify incorrect conceptions, vague interpretation, and ideological deviation to counter opportunistic, rightist, dogmatic, and conservative manifestations. It is necessary to discover early and fight uncompromisingly against deviations in outlining lines and policies and executing the party's lines and policies, which may lead to aberrations in the socialist path. We have to criticize and analyze incorrect conceptions and hostile allegations in society quickly and correctly. The heavy losses suffered by many ruling communist parties in the past provide us with a profound lesson in party building tasks. It is a lesson about the danger of erroneous lines; violations of the principles of the party's organization and activity; mistakes in selecting and deploying cadres, especially key cadres; and the practice of bureaucracy and staying aloof from the public. It is also a lesson for us about enhancing the party's intellect, logic, and political capacity; uniting in ideology; and preserving the fine quality of party cadres and party members. In August 1989, the party Central Committee directly stated that many party organs, leading cadres, and party members have been lax in their ideological tasks. They lack a fighting spirit against deviate ideas and conceptions and incorrect actions and statements. They are showing poor responsibility in the fight for the socialist ideology. This situation has been corrected and overcome in one step. The militancy in ideological work has been further restored and enhanced. We need to clearly realize our shortcomings, though, including very severe ones. In many party installations, the education, control, and management work of party members has been undermined by irregular and poor party activities. The idealism of some party members has faded. Their fighting power has decreased. Some have plunged into the practice of individualism, opportunism, and pragmatism. They take advantage of loopholes in party and state policies and management structures to practice corruption and get rich illegally. They have become depraved and degenerated. Some cadres are preoccupied with sectionalism and factionalism. They fight for higher positions and personal interests, thus severely affecting the party unity. Facing this situation, the ideological work of party installations must not be evasive, yielding, or rightist. The improvement of ideological and political quality starts with strengthening the spirit of criticism and fighting based on the party's conceptions and stands. The fighting spirit is badly needed in the current activities of party installations. At the moment, the fighting spirit also requires more study efforts by the entire party as well as every party cadre and party member. Our party is a vanguard party; at the moment, more than any other time, party members must improve their intelligence level. If a party member does not want to study for his own advancement, he cannot improve his knowledge and assume a leading role. The militant character requires that control over the implementation of the party's lines, policies, and statutes be strengthened. We have to overcome situations where implementation does not comply with resolutions, words do not agree with actions, and the practice of many cadres who remain silent in conferences but whose deeds are always at variance with party resolutions. In the current situation, political determination, loyalty to party ideals, and devotion to serving the interests of laborers and people should be considered the most essential characteristics of a party member. They are also guiding concepts in the task of heightening the militant and compelling characteristics of ideological work. Ideological work implies the task of building trust. It requires high motivational and persuasive abilities that can work effectively on people's wills and emotions. A very persuasive character leads to a strong, sharp, and effective militant spirit. The militancy in ideological work, therefore, requires self-education and self-criticism by every individual in order to better their implementation. The struggle on the ideological and theoretical fronts can only succeed if every cadre seriously contemplates the essential issues in the party's viewpoints and political lines, then draws the logical conclusions and makes necessary and positive adjustment in conception and viewpoint. Nowadays, social democratization is expanding, people's knowledge is increasing quickly, and public media and other information sources have become very rich and diversified. These changes update human thinking very rapidly, increase cultural interaction enormously, and make social disparity wider. Therefore, ideological work should not be carried out in outdated ways and its militancy should not be conceived and developed as before. Reality demands that the current ideological work should be highly compelling; a characteristic our struggle on the ideology front should strive to achieve through persuasion, not coercion and pressure. Our ideological work, therefore, should be renovated toward widening democracy and increasing the volume of information in practical and suitable forms for different types of target groups. It should also allow more dialogue and open debate. The innovative spirit should be developed among party members and cadres. The tasks of criticizing and evaluating viewpoints should be carried out properly, but not in a rough and coercive manner that prevents independent thinking. The militant and compelling character of ideological work must be built through discussion and debate on contradicting opinions and viewpoints in order to obtain eventual profound agreement with the party's lines and viewpoints. Democratization should be implemented along with careful observation of party discipline and order, and with a high sense of responsibility by party members. Distinctions should be made between people who observe organizational discipline and order but hold the wrong viewpoint because of their low level of understanding and knowledge, and those who intentionally breach party discipline and carry out evil deeds. The methods and forms of political activities must be diversified regularly. We should not only convey the contents of resolutions, but also encourage the raising of issues and provide all the necessary information and material. We should compare the party's viewpoints and policies with reality, thus helping people -- through thought and discussion in a frank and democratic atmosphere -- solve for themselves any confusions in their viewpoints.
