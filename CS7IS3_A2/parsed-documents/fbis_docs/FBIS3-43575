The shots were fired from a nearby control post held by a Pakistani contingent of UN troops, one of whom said his US colleagues opened fire after spotting a Somali bearing a submachine gun. US officers said Sunday they had launched an inquiry into the incident but refused to comment further. Women in the area at the time said they heard one or two gunshots and saw the woman collapse after being hit in the stomach. The witnesses said she was aged about 30 and pregnant. A member of staff at the nearby Benadir Hospital was wounded Friday by US gunfire, while two other Somalis were killed by US and Pakistani peacekeepers Thursday.
