"There is no external threat to Azerbaijan at the moment, a threat comes from inside the CIS, from Armenia", the ambassador stressed. According to him, under the present circumstances Azerbaijan's borders with Turkey and Iran should be regarded first of all as its external borders, and only then as external borders of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Last September, Azerbaijan became a full-fledged member of the Commonwealth and joined the Collective Security Treaty. However, no mutually acceptable schemes for ensuring the safety of Azerbaijan's boders with Turkey and Iran have been worked out so far. These borders are virtually transparent at present.
