Addressing tens of thousands of supporters at a rally at Taylor's Halt, about 20km from the Natal capital of Pietermaritzburg, Mr Buthelezi came out strongly in support of peace. saying his party did not want war. Mr Buthelezi also accused the government and the African National Congress [ANC] of trying to intimidate the IFP into fighting elections. He said his party was continuing talks with the ANC and government, but accused the two of an "appalling style" of negotiating. He said he favoured continued negotiations: "Even at this late hour we have avoided belligerence and we believe in continuing to negotiate." The IFP president said it was only through "true negotiations" that peace would be achieved in South Africa. "We know that war serves only to divide the people of South Africa. It serves only to split communities and break up families. "We know that in the end it will pit orother against brother, sister against sister, mother against daughter, father against son. We in the IFP therefore do not want war. "No one wants peace more than the IFP." The IFP would not be intimidated by the ANC, he said, adding "while we know that we will defeat the plans of the ANC alliance, we also know that victory will come at a great cost to all." "That is why we want to negotiate. That is why we want peace." He said a spokesman in the ANC alliance had warned that army tanks would roll against the people of kwaZulu. The inhabitants of the homeland would be much worse off under an ANC government than the present government, he said. The IFP's decision not to participate in elections unless its demands were met was a "grave one". Many would be forced into voting. If the ANC won the elections it would try and destroy the IFP and kwaZulu, he said. "We must know this and brace ourselves to this onslaught if it happens. "It is far more noble to resist evil and die for what you believe in, than to live in chains." Mr Buthelezi said he was against war, but Zulus were a "proud and warrior" nation which could resist the ANC. Opinion polls showing minimal support for the IFP were "lies", he said. He urged followers not to fail in their support for Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini, saying participation in the elections under the current constitution would be going against the monarch. A failure of support for the king on this score would divide the Zulu nation, he said. The interim constitution was flawed because, among other things, it did not acknowledge the sovereignty of the monarch. While he reiterated his strong opposition to elections under the present interim constutution, the IFP president's speech was not free of electioneering talk: "We are the party of prosperity. You can lay your trust in us." Mr Buthelezi promised supporters that if the IFP continued to rule kwaZulu, jobs would be created and they would be better provided for. The ANC, he charged, didn't have a "snowballs chance in hell" of delivering on its "wild" election promises. "We will have to work extremely hard. We must continue to embrace the twin pillars of our philosophy in the IFP, which is self-help and self-reliance. "We do not want to deceive our youth by promising things that we will not be able to deliver instantly if we become the government," he said. "The IFP is the only party that can bring prosperity to the people of South Africa."
