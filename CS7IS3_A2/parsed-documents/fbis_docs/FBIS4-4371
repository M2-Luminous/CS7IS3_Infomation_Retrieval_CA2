The reason for this foreign policy approach is rather different from Malaya's purported original purpose in sending some 1,413 soldiers to the Congo in its first UN peacekeeping operation in 1960. Then it was to prop up a besieged UN Secretary-General in his fledgling peacekeeping role which a small nation like Malaya felt could blunt the edge of Cold War politics. Today, it would seem more like the manoeuvrings of an aspirant middle power flexing its political sinews on behalf of itself, the Third World, the South and Islam, whichever way one chooses to look at it. On March 12 this year, Defence Minister Datuk Sri Najib Tun Razak made it a point to advertise Malaysia's contribution to UN peacekeeping operations in a ceremony bestowing a national award to all soldiers and personnel who had served with the UN in such operations. Some 2,555 officers and men are currently serving in UN peacekeeping duties in Bosnia (1,512), Somalia (982), Mozambique (19), Liberia (17), Cambodia (11), West Sahara (6), Iraq and Kuwait (5), Angola (1) and at the UN in New York (2). The three most prominent recent and current peacekeeping operations in which Malaysia has been involved include actions in Cambodia, Somalia and Bosnia. Most recently. Malaysia's UN peacekeeping role has gained a significant fillip for better or worse as Malbatt II (Malaysian Battalion II) in Somalia prepares to take over from the Americans when they pull out of Mogadishu on March 31. Today, Malaysia's foray into Bosnia-Herzegovina represents not only its current largest involvement but arguably its most difficult mission both from the military and political standpoints. In that regard, Malaysia's particular posture and current actions in UN peacekeeping are calculated to match its vision to become a developed country by the year 2020, which is also part of a trajectory towards middle power status in world politics. Notwithstanding this, in behaving as a nation-state, Malaysia acts not merely at the direction of its leaders but is demonstrably sensitive to and constrained by its domestic situation and the ever-changing international environment. The end of the Cold War has brought about a rash of UN peacekeeping and would-be peacekeeping operations which has put not only an unprecedented strain on the UN's budget but has also taxed the tempers of its members. The US-led coalition's actions against Iraq during the Gulf War of 1991 generated angst among Muslim populations, including Malaysians, and this has now gravitated to Bosnia-Herzegovina. It takes little explaining as to why a country like Malaysia has cried foul over the excruciatingly tardy pace at which the West has deemed it fit to act with force in Bosnia, and that too on a scale and level well below that of the action in the Gulf. Malaysia's strident stance on the Bosnian issue stresses this "double standard" of the West, which, it hopes, rests on economics (the oil factor of Kuwait) and not Western ethnocentrism or xenophobia (the birth of an Islamic Balkan state). Thus, it may be argued that Malaysia' involvement in the Unprofor (the UN Protection Force) operation in Bosnia is as much motivated by politics geared or targeted either at the international Islamic audience or the predominantly Muslim population at home. This is not to say that humanitarianism is not a factor in such policies but perhaps altruism dovetails well here with political motivation. The politics, one hastens to add, is borne of a genuine concern with Western callousness and double standards on human rights and its lack of appreciation of Islamic perspectives. In contrast, the Cambodian action which now counts among one of the UN's successful peacekeeping and peacebuilding operations presented no political dilemmas to Malaysia or conflict with the West. Indeed, Asean's high profile in the Cambodian conflict as well as in its resolution phase meant that participation in the peacekeeping effort was almost a foregone conclusion for Malaysia. Add to that Cambodia's geographical proximity and potential economic links with Malaysia which have now been firmly established through air links, banking, trade and other flows. Two Malaysian soldiers perishing in the line of duty (succumbing to Malaria, not the bullets of the Khmer Rouge) were from the country's viewpoint, a small sacrifice for the winding down of the last serious international political conflict in Southeast Asia. All said, Malaysia's foray into UN peacekeeping and peacebuilding operations has been approached with calculated expediency even as Malaysia has in a real sense taken to heart Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's call for effective preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peacekeeping in his "Agenda for Peace" speech at the 1992 47th Session of the General Assembly. Malaysian Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed, in his vision to turn the country into a developed country is clearly aware that the principle of noblesse oblige applies in domestic as well as in international affairs. The economic development and rising affluence of Malaysia has made it possible to pursue such a principle wherein one of the ways is to contribute to maintaining international security. Doing so through the UN is the least controversial and perhaps the most prestigious approach. In championing the cause of the Southern countries and the Third World, it would also seem fitting that a country like Malaysia should consciously engage in UN actions which would otherwise come under the direct purview or control of major powers should the smaller states opt out of them. Indeed, as is perhaps becoming more evident in a situation such as in Somalia, the presence of smaller powers is often less counter- productive to that of big powers, which tend to elicit accusations of ulterior motives. This said, one must quickly caution that playing the role of UN policeman in these turbulent times may certainly enhance national status but it is often a dismal task in which the dividends are few and the frustrations legion.
