The spokesman, Mahmud Mohammadi, was referring to the recent statements by the UAE Crown Prince Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Zayid Al Nuhayyan who has called for the establishment of friendly ties with Tehran but asked Iran to give up the three islands of Abu Musa, the Lesser and the Greater Tonbs. Mohammadi further added that the Islamic Republic of Iran attaches great importance to the security and stability of the region. He stressed that Iran had always tried to maintain security and stability in the region and under critical conditions had even welcomed cooperation of other countries in thwarting threats against the collective regional interests. The spokesman said that Shaykh Khalifah's statements regarding the three Iranian islands were in contradiction with the UAE's call for the establishment of friendly ties with Iran. Mohammadi termed as incorrect the report aired by Agence France Presse (AFP) on the meeting between the Iranian and Egyptian Foreign ministers in the course of the on-going Non-alignment Movement [NAM] ministerial session, convened in Cairo Tuesday. AFP had reported that Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa had expressed willingness to confer with his Iranian counterpart 'Ali Akbar Velayati and quoted Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying that Velayati would not meet any Egyptian official. He said that to meet with foreign ministers of other countries at multilateral sessions and holding talks with them is quite customary. Stressing that Iran and Egypt are two influential members of the movement, the spokesman said that during the NAM meeting the two foreign ministers can discuss major issues such as situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, disarmament and restructuring of the U.N. organization.
