The president's words are a renewed support to the plans of certain governors, Buenos Aires Governor Eduardo Duhalde among them, who hope the Constituent Assembly approves a clause enabling them to become gubernatorial candidates in 1995, even if their districts prevent them from being reelected. In remarks made to "La 9.90" radio station on the night of 26 May, Menem again denied rumors that he was seriously ill. He called for "an end to this irresponsible behavior, because spreading this sort of rumor shows no love for the country or its people." [passage omitted] Commenting on the Olivos Pact, he rejected the idea of a "package." He pointed out that "it is a law, part of which has been agreed upon," and declined "to make further comments because now it is the Constituent Assembly members' turn to talk about it." He also expressed support for a possible reelection of governors because "four provinces have the possibility of reelecting their governors and this unequal treatment of the issue is repugnant to the national Constitution." He emphasized: "There are no grounds, no reasons to oppose the governors' reelection. We cannot forget that if we look at the issue from the philosophical point of view, the provincial constitutions must be entirely in accordance with the terms of the national Constitution." Menem believes the reelection issue is not a matter of form but of essence because "it grants all citizens an equal right to be elected and reelected." Asked whether Duhalde could run for the vice presidency if prevented from being reelected governor, Menem answered "of course he can." He added that it was "a lie" that Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo might become "jealous" because of that. He pointed out: "Cavallo is now less interested in entering the political area because he is doing very well in the economic area. He is a vigorous, somewhat passionate, man." He added: "The important thing is that in the economic field things are well." He confirmed that "there is no possibility of modifying or violating the economic model that we have implemented." Regarding disagreement created over the Secretariat for Community Protection, Menem regretted the fact that "some have exaggerated what has happened." He emphasized, however, that "the issue has been discussed and the river waters have returned to their course. The river is flowing slowly but uninterruptedly and no one is mentioning the topic now." "I do not know where the rumors come from, but all I can tell these people is `those whom you have killed are in good health.' I have never felt better nor as full of enthusiasm for doing things for my country as now," Menem said denying rumors about health problems.
