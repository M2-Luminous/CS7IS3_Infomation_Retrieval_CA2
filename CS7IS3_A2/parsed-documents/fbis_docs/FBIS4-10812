Sanchez Ugarte added that the federal government has not "yet" considered making any changes in its targets regarding growth and inflation. Fernando Cortina, president of the Confederation of Industrial Chambers [Concamin], noted that the today's "moments of political tension" might affect economic prospects, and, therefore, "we should not be confused by rumors," because only by "visualizing the type of country we want in the future" will we be able to eradicate "the signs of violence and antidemocracy that pervade these times of confusion." Meanwhile, Enrique Aranzabal, president of the National Chamber of the Textile Industry [CNIT], said during an interview that in light of political uncertainty in the nation, "it will be difficult to meet official economic targets." During the regular General Assembly of the Textile Chamber, Sanchez Ugarte pointed out that the federal government is determined to stay the course in terms of its macroeconomic program, anti-inflationary policies, and healthy public finances. "We hope that all macroeconomic factors continue to hold steady and that the economy remains stable," Sanchez Ugarte said at the end of his speech. Sanchez Ugarte expressed his confidence that the GDP will increase by 3.5 percent, and he added that "no changes have been made yet" to meet this target. Asked about the national industrial situation, he commented that there are no current figures on industrial performance at this time, but he indicated that in December 1993, manufacturing sector began to recover. He also expressed confidence that figures for the first quarter of 1994 will reflect an improvement over previous months. In terms of job creation, Sanchez Ugarte noted that today the industrial sector provides employment to approximately 3.5 million workers, and "in 1994, this sector could generate 150,000 jobs." Meanwhile, Concamin leader Fernando Cortina underscored that the intensity of the globalization process is not only reflected in greater economic competition, but also in the exacerbation of social problems, "which hint the turn of the century will be shaken by unemployment, plummeting investment, economic slowdown, volatile financial markets, the internationalization of new commercial agreements, and the general use of violence as a means of political pressure." In Mexico's case, Cortina maintained that in light of "uncertain times," it is commonplace to emphasize the negative aspects of a period of tension. However, he added that the country's industrialists "must trust in Mexico, considering the progress accomplished, and they must also, in all seriousness, continue to press for those goals that remain unresolved." Cortina added: "We should not be confused by rumors. Conditions for economic stability exist, and if we trust in Mexico, we will overcome the uncertainty of having little time to lead the country along a path of environmentally sound, sustained growth." Along this line, Cortina urged the national business community to maintain its trust in the future of Mexico, because, through hard work, it will be possible to achieve the proposed 4.2-percent average industrial growth. Cortina concluded: "Let us not lose our objectivity, and let us keep working on what we know how to do efficiently -- to produce with quality and efficiency. Let us defeat those adversaries who only seek to destabilize us. Together, we will create a better Mexico." Meanwhile, CNIT President Enrique Aranzabal noted that the Mexican economy is facing a very difficult period characterized by political circumstances that are causing instability in the national economy and might result in foiled government expectations regarding inflation and growth. In his speech before Sanchez Ugarte, Aranzabal demanded prompt solutions to the problems threatening the textile industry -- namely, financing and the entry into national territory of merchandise priced at dumping levels. The National Chamber of Commerce [Canaco] Says Economic Problems Have Not Been Overcome Canaco leader Gustavo A. Madero pointed out on 12 April that it would be a mistake to think the nation's economic problems have been overcome, because the fight against inflation is still continuing. The inflation problem must be truly solved, effectively controlled, and secured with "strong locks" to prevent the remergence of pitfalls that have been apparently overcome. Madero indicated that in terms of growth, the country is facing the worst times in the entire six-year period, with local problems and increasing obstacles, but organized businessmen have neither slowed down nor ceased their efforts to reverse the trend. Consequently, Canaco has supported the creation of a credit union for its members, as well as the establishment of a "single office" for transactions -- although it is currently overwhelmed with requests -- and it has implemented a permanent promotion campaign to standardize corporate mergers, among many other tasks.
