In the most recent effort to resolve this crisis, the five members of the Persian Gulf Cooperation Council and Egypt have proposed in a letter to the UN Security Council president that the council examine the situation in Yemen. Within this framework, a resolution has been proposed to be discussed by the Security Council. In this proposed resolution an immediate cease-fire between the two conflicting sides and a ban on the dispatch of any type of war materiel and arms to Yemen have been requested. The UN secretary general also has been requested to send a fact-finding mission to Yemen and to pave the way for the resumption of talks between the two conflicting factions. The UN Security Council is expected to begin examining the Yemeni crisis on Tuesday. The proposal by the six Arab countries to the UN Security Council shows that their attempts to end the conflicts in Yemen are at an impasse. Despite their efforts, the Arab countries--both individually and within the framework of the Arab League--have been unable to prevent the political differences in Yemen from turning into a civil war. This inability has been attributed to the differences of opinion among the Arab countries on the Yemeni crisis. Having the Yemeni problem discussed by the Security Council automatically grants an international dimension to this crisis. While it is a very welcome development for the leaders of south Yemen, it causes concern among the leaders in the north. Since the outset of the crisis in Yemen, the leaders in the south have constantly sought ways to internationalize the problem in a bid to inflict pressures on the north. The north has referred to the crisis as a domestic issue and has urged foreign countries and international organizations to not become involved. When the southerners declared their separation from the north and the formation of an independent country, the internationalization of the problem granted them the opportunity to strengthen their bases. Since this weakens Yemen's unity, it is a source of great concern for the northerners who want unity to be preserved.
