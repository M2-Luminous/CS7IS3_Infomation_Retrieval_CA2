He expressed the hope that the two countries would further develop economic cooperation and trade while increasing political cooperation in the future. Zhou Jue and his entourage arrived in Paris last night at the invitation of the French National Assembly's Foreign Affairs Committee. During its visit to France, the delegation will also hold working meetings with the Foreign Affairs Committee.
