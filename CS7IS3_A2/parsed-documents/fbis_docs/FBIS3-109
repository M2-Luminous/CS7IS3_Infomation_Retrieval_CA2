Responding to a message from President Paul Biya (?suing) for peace along the Nigeria-Cameroon border, Gen. Abacha said he would gladly host President Biya for talks on the protracted border skirmishes. The Cameroonian delegation came at the heels of an open confrontation along the border following irritating incursions into Nigeria's Bakassi Peninsula by Cameroonian gendarmes. For a very long time now, the gendarmes have harassed Nigerians living on their own side of the border often on the excuse of going after fleeing tax defaulters. Thousands of Nigerians have been displaced and abused in the process. Lagos had often treated such complaints at the diplomatic level so as not to spark off a war. Perhaps this gave the false impression that Nigeria could be a pushover in such matters. But the truth is that Nigeria, though a war-tested nation that can hold its own against any onslaught whatsoever, regarded the antics of Cameroon as undeserving of serious attention. It should be known that Nigeria did not want to react to the siege of its [word indistinct] because Cameroon cannot be a match for Nigeria when it comes to war. Besides, it is apparent that Cameroon is being a pawn in the hands of those who do not wish Africa well. Nigeria knows this and does not want to oblige those who seek the dismemberment of the continent. However, certain internal feuds among communities in the eastern extremities of Nigeria called for the deployment of troops there to restore order. The trigger-happy gendarmes, not quite versed in military strategic movements, panicked and struck blindly. If there were any doubts about the maturity and forbearance of the Nigerian authorities over this matter, such doubts have been dispelled by a highly placed Cameroonian, Mr. John Fru Ndi, leader of the Cameroon Social Democratic Front, SDF. He owned up to a foreign radio station that the conflict was sparked off by Cameroonians. According to him, the Cameroonians in question were seeking an outlet for their internal frustrations. But, this is rather infantile because Nigeria does not want a spillover of the politics of its neighbors nor is Abuja known for territorial ambition. However, this short confrontation must have shown the Cameroonian authorities the futility of their aggressiveness and the need to resolve the matter through genuine dialogue. But, first, Yaounde should accept that it put the cart before the horse when President Biya sought to internationalize the dispute. President Biya ought to know better than fall in for international do-gooders whose only aim is to emasculate Africa of its potential as a world power. President Biya and his team are welcome any day and can expect openness from Nigeria, but they should realize that Nigeria will no longer fall for delay tactics or double talk. This is because Nigeria can no longer allow her nationals to be abused and maimed by any country. The sacrifice for African unity should not be a one-sided affair just as the quest for transborder peace should be a collective responsibility. Ironically, there are over 2 million Nigerians currently engaged in active trade with their Cameroonian counterparts while nearly a million Cameroonians are either studying or doing business in Nigeria. This has been so for centuries. This Saturday's [26 February] action goes beyond ordinary neighborliness and when it is known that there are uncountable marriages across the borders one wonders what really is amiss. For decades, the Nigerian-Cameroon Commission has worked hard to eliminate disputes along the common border but it seems that try as it can, there is a (?mistake) somewhere down along the line. This is what the Abacha-Biya talks should identify and find a solution to in the interest of the sociological well-being of their two countries.
