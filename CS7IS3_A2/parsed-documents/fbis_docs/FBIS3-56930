Not a term laid down by U.S. legislation for the President's team, but the month for which the President asked the Pentagon chief to continue carrying out his duties so that the Defense Department would not be leaderless for a long time following Aspin's resignation announcement. Wishing to preserve continuity in armed forces leadership as well as the combativity of his foreign policy team, a month ago Bill Clinton picked a man who he regarded as a worthy replacement -- retired Admiral Robert Inman. But a week before the U.S. Congress resumed work (after the Christmas and New Year break) Inman suddenly announced that he was turning down the post he had been offered by Clinton. If there were primarily political reasons behind Les Aspin's resignation, caused by the secretary's disagreement with some points in the President's course in both domestic and foreign policy, then in Robert Inman's case it is all much simpler, and more complex. Simpler because the retired admiral's reasons are clear: He indicated his reluctance to tolerate the current attempts in the press to sully his reputation, and it was not inconceivable that the search for blots on his service record would continue during the Senate hearings. The difficulty in understanding Robert Inman's decision to withdrawn from consideration for a federal government secretaryship is due to such subtle matters as moral and ethical purity and decency. That is, categories very difficult to measure -- where do you find the relevant criteria? We know of many cases where senior leaders, statesmen, and government officials have continued to occupy their posts without batting an eyelid even when beset by the gravest accusations. What motivates them is their idea of duty to the people, to the voters, and so on. In fact, Inman is weighed down by considerations of moral purity (strictly speaking, the accusations against him are not that horrendous, particularly by our Russian standards -- merely the tardy payment of Social Security taxes, not even concealment of them). The admiral decided it was impossible for him to weigh -- not on the scales of justice, but on the scales of public opinion! -- the 30-year service record of a career in the U.S. Navy and intelligence organs against the illusory benefits of a secretaryship. Actually, he had admitted from the outset that he had accepted President Clinton's offer not out of ambition, and certainly not out of a desire for material gain. Since his retirement Inman has had a pretty good life as head of two electronics firms and then of the U.S. Federal Reserve Service Bank in Dallas. A top-class professional who worked at the top of the Defense Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency, and CIA under various administrations without any party bias, he agreed to take the Pentagon post entirely out of duty to the country and the people. So Les Aspin has not yet left the Pentagon building on the banks of the Potomac. He will be staying there until President Clinton picks a new candidate for defense secretary. It is hard to predict who it will be. But one can speculate about the new secretary's tasks. That is because Les Aspin, who is the first to leave the Clinton administration fold, during his spell in office managed to map out the main path of development for the U.S. armed forces over the next few years. It is hard to say to what extent this tallied with his personal views and beliefs, nonetheless the strategic guidelines determined by him are unlikely to be radically revised. Ultimately they are dictated by entirely objective factors of both international and domestic political life. First and foremost there are significant cuts in the armed forces' numerical strength and arsenal, a substantial reduction in the military budget, and, of course, against this background, the safeguarding of a high level of readiness of troops and naval forces for actions in defense of U.S. national interests and for participation in multinational peacemaking actions.
