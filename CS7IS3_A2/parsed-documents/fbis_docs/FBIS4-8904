[passage omitted] The commander of UN forces in Bosnia, Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Rose, had welcomed Karadzic's announcement on allowing UNPROFOR troops into Gorazde. "It is important because it does bring about a cease-fire. It does allow us to run these humanitarian and UNPROFOR convoys," Rose said in an interview with the BBC. "It is the first step." Any cease-fire, he said, was temporary, but he hoped the current move would turn into a permanent cessation of hostilities, but this depended on the willingness of the two parties not to resume their conflict. In Geneva, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said UNHCR representatives reported an easing of the Serb assault on the town. "The last message we've got said that the shelling had died down considerably," UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond said after contacting staff in Gorazde at 7:00 AM (0500 GMT). [passage omitted] Rose said Wednesday, meanwhile, that the exclusion zone for heavy weapons around Sarajevo could well be replicated elsewhere in the safe areas. Some 12,000 people are now without shelter in Gorazde and the corridors of apartment blocks are full of people. [passage omitted]
