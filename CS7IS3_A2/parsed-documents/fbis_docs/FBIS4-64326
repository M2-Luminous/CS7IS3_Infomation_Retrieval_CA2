In an attempt to dampen speculation that Mr Major would threaten to withdraw from the Community if further encroachments were made on national sovereignty, Mr Hurd said there was no alternative to continued participation. "We are part of Europe, and I am quite clear that our prosperity and security depends on making a success of Europe," he said. "Therefore we have to argue strongly, as we have done and will do, for the kind of Europe with which we are at ease." But Mr Edward Leigh, who was sacked as Industry Minister, claimed that as many as 200 Tory MPs "do not want to be dragged further and further into a federalist system." Mr Hurd's comments came at the end of a week in which Tory tensions over Europe have reasserted themselves as battle-lines are drawn ahead of the 1996 inter-governmental conference that will chart the development of the EC into the next century. Sensitivities are such that ministers swiftly denied there had been any fundamental redrafting of the party's manifesto for the forthcoming European elections, though it was conceded its rough edges had been smoothed and some sections dropped. The Prime Minister, on a regional tour of the north west of England, said the manifesto had gone through the normal redrafting process and was now virtually complete. Suggestions that the original drawn up by Mr Hurd had been rewritten by Downing Street were "over dramatised and fanciful," Mr Major said. The manifesto attempts to bridge the gulf between the party's two extremes on Europe and Mr Hurd believes he has produced a document that will satisfy about 90 percent of MPs. He wants the party to campaign on avowedly European issues in order to highlight the differences between a Conservative commitment to a loose alliance of nation states and alleged Labour and Liberal Democrat support for bureaucracy, regulation and interventionism. A comprehensive policy statement on Europe is included in the annual Campaign Guide published by the Conservatives last night. It emphasises that the Tories are committed to keeping Britain "at the heart of Europe" and to playing a "pragmatic constructive and above all practical" role in the EC. But Euro-sceptics, who now term themselves "realists," fear that if a stand is not taken now, then Britain will be dragged along in the federalist slipstream leading to a united states of Europe and a common currency. With some on the Tory Right now openly canvassing the option of withdrawal, both Mr Major and Mr Hurd made clear yesterday that this was not a strategy they would embrace. The Prime Minister said it was in Britain's economic and security interests to remain part of the EC although that did not mean that every edict from Brussels or opinion of a European partner had to be accepted. The Foreign Secretary speaking in Devon, said "Our message is positive in that we see no alternative to Europe." Mr Michael Heseltine, the President of the Board of Trade, also rounded on the Euro-sceptics for reopening the divisions ahead of the June 9 elections. "It is undermining the position of the Prime Minister, of our candidates and making our supporters in the country reel with amazement," he said. The rekindling of the Conservtiave Euro arguments has provided the opposition parties will ample ammunition in the run-up to the June 9 elections, at which the Tories face heavy losses, although largely because of domestic unpopularity.
