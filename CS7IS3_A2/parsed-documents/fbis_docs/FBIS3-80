Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-30MAR94-DPRK-ROK-U.S. North Sharpens Rhetoric on 'Patriot' Missiles Reflecting a hardening of its opposition to the prospective introduction of Patriot missiles in South Korea, North Korea has staged a "mass rally" and sharpened its rhetoric against Seoul and Washington. At the 29 March rally in Pyongyang--the first such rally Pyongyang media have reported being staged against deployment of the missiles--the main speaker, a city People's Committee functionary, characterized current tension on the peninsula as such that a "nuclear war" could be touched off "by accident." He went on to warn that if the United States and the South "challenge" the DPRK, it will "punish them hundreds and thousand times"(Pyongyang radio, 29 March)--a departure from Pyongyang's heretofore cautious pronouncements that went no further than to promise unspecified "countermeasures." Like the speaker at the rally, an authoritative Nodong Sinmun commentator's article on 29 March also pledged to "deal a thousand-fold retaliatory blow" if the South unleashed a war against the North "in league with outside forces" (KCNA, 29 March). In a similar vein, KCNA on 30 March, commenting on the "increased [U.S.] military threat to the North," ominously warned Washington that "if one likes fire he is bound to get burnt." Pyongyang has balanced its harsher rhetoric on the Patriot issue with indirect appeals for resumption of negotiations with Washington. Thus, a KCNA report on 29 March claiming that foreign leaders are calling for a peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue cited the Malaysian prime minister as saying that the Korean nuclear issue "should be resolved through negotiations" and not "by means of pressure." It portrayed the Congolese prime minister as similarly prescribing "dialogue and negotiation" for the issue. The report also cited the Senegalese prime minister as ''expressing hope'' that the issue will be resolved through "DPRK-U.S. talks." (AUTHOR: YIM.
