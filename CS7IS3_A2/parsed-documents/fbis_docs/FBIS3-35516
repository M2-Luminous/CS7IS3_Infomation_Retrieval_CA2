The system for collecting health tax in this proposal follows the "Bayga [nickname for Finance Minister Avraham Shohat] compromise," according to which the National Insurance Institute will be in charge of tax collection, but Kupat Holim will be able to collect a "welfare" tax from its members, which will stand at 0.8 percent of the insured person's earnings. Following the Labor party decisions, the two alternative bills were brought before the joint health committee and Labor MK 'Amir Peretz decided to renew the legislative process. Labor MK Yoram Lass' proposal was attached to the two other bills. Peretz refused to coordinate legislation with the government, despite knowing that it too was about to reinitiate the process, and although he was asked to withhold his bill. Peretz claimed that the government was not entitled to impose its will on the Knesset and invited government representatives to sit in on the committee's legislative proceedings, which, as earlier mentioned, had noted down the Labor party's position. The committee went on to consolidate the three proposals into one bill, which stipulated three options in clauses 4 and 16, pertaining, as mentioned above, to the issues of linkage and collection. The Government's Bill -- this is the earlier bill (the "Ramon bill," with amendments to the clauses on linkage and collection, as decided upon by the Labor party. Last month, the government pulled back the bill after it was brought before the Knesset for its second and third hearings, while promising to resubmit it to the Knesset plenum after the Labor party convention reached a decision on the controversial clauses. Last week, the government, with the objection of the Meretz ministers, adopted the revised version of the bill, and is going to bring it before the Knesset next week in order to ask for the Knesset's approval to resubmit it to the health committee, in order "to operate" on the two above mentioned clauses. [Minister] Shahal's "trick" -- Moshe Shahal, the minister liaising between the government and the Knesset, claimed that he had found a way to neutralize the private bills and restore the government's bill, which had been pulled back last month, to its progressive stage in the legislative process (second and third hearings before the Knesset plenum). According to the plan, Shahal was supposed to announce to the Knesset that according to clause 133 in the Knesset regulations, the government wished to resubmit the bill for a second and third hearing, and after this request was approved, to ask, according to clause 127 in the Knesset regulations, to withdraw the bill so that it could be amended by the health committee. Al these announcements must be voted on and approved by the Knesset plenum. That is why Shahal informed the Knesset last week that he had placed the government's bill before the Knesset. Shahal believed that using the regulations would enable him to remove the private members' bills from the agenda, because when dealing with the same issue, a bill submitted by the government has priority. However, the government's legal adviser to the Knesset ruled that this rule applies only when the government's bill is submitted before the private one. Therefore, there was no obstacle to presenting the private bill for its first hearing. Moreover, Shahal and the leaders of the Labor party were unsuccessful in mustering a Knesset majority to support clause 127. Their fear was that if the plenum approved the request to return the bill for its second hearing (clause 133), but turn down the request to return the bill to the committee for amendments (clause 127), the Knesset could simply continue with the second and third hearings, and, in the absence of a majority, it may approve the law in its original form without the health committee's amendments. That is why Shahal refrained from submitting his proposal until Prime Minister Rabin returns from abroad. Rabin is supposed to use his influence on SHAS [Torah Observing Sephardim] and Meretz in order to canvass a majority for clause 127. Only after the bill is brought before the committee will efforts start to guarantee a majority for the government's position on the actual contents of the bill. This effort seems impossible today, and senior Labor party officials are taking into account the possibility of being forced to accept the "Bayga compromise." "The Bayga compromise" -- This stipulates, as does the Labor party proposal, a bilateral linkage between the Histadrut and Kupat Holim; however, like the "Ramon" proposal it stipulates that the collection will be carried out through the National Insurance Institute. Each Kupat Holim organization will nevertheless be permitted to collect an employee welfare tax which will total 0.8 percent of the employee's income and to transfer this tax to the Kupat Holim management. The compromise prepared by Finance Minister Avraham Shohat on the eve of the Labor party convention was rejected by the Histadrut.
