Sidyakin said it was symbolic that the Totsk military test-range, which saw the first cloud of a "mushroom" of a nuclear explosion going up on September 14, 1954 as a sign of the times of the Cold War, has been turning into an arena of close peaceful cooperation between Russian and American troops. Nevertheless, the general expressed concern over the fact that joint military Russo-U.S. exercises scheduled in July have encountered strong resistance from the mass media in the Orenburg and the Volga region. The general pointed out that one might get the impression that the very possibility of the presence of American servicemen there arouses the indignation of some representatives of parties and movements. "The scope of the upcoming exercises stand no comparison with exercises regularly held on our test-range," the general said. "Shots are permanently fired and explosions are made in the neighborhood of Totsk, showing that full-scale military exercises are underway there. The upcoming exercises are not so big in comparison because the main goal of these exercises is to teach organisation and planning the activities of peace-keeping forces," the general said. He pointed out that the main purpose of the exercises is to work out with the U.S. side a common approach to conducting peace-keeping operations. "These operations are of a non-combat character, but rather exercises in the disengagement of warring sides and the establishment of a regime of safety in the disengagement corridor," the general said, adding that the exercises would be held with the single aim of ensuring political, non-military settlement of a conflict. The general pointed out that no shots are planned and expected on the test-range, since "this is not necessary and was not specified by a U.N. Security Council mandate." The general pointed out that taking part in the exercises will be 50 armoured carriers, adding and that no "phantom tanks" can possibly damage the Orenburg soil. Asked about the U.N. role in organising the exercises, the general pointed out that "the exercises will be held under the U.N. auspices which might send its representatives to the exercises. In future, the exercises might be held with the participation of "blue helmets" and other states. "Thus, the exercises would be multilateral," the general said. In conclusion, the general pointed out that the process of the U.S. and Russia getting closer together and cooperation between them have become irreversible.
