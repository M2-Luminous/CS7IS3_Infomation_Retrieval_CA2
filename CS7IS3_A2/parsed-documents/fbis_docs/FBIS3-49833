Judit Laszlo reports. [Laszlo] [passage omitted] Andras Agoston called it a rumor that the VMDK will be the socialists' coalition partner. The Hungarians of Vojvodina wish to ask the English, French, and Russian leaders of the peace process for advice on the formation of an internationally legitimate government, without the intervention of foreign countries in rump Yugoslavia's domestic issues. According to Deputy Chairman Janos Vekas, Hungary's help is also needed in settling the issue. Therefore, the VMDK has launched an initiative for the parties of the Hungarian parliament and the political forces of the Hungarians beyond the borders to issue a joint declaration to the effect that they wish to realize their national policy interests jointly. In this declaration, the VMDK demands every form of political autonomy, said Deputy Chairman Janos Vekas.
