They repeatedly talk about "human rights" as if only they are concerned about the rights of the Chinese as men, the truth were with them, we Chinese were not concerned about the rights of our own compatriots as men, and we remain stubborn and extremely ignorant despite their repeated urging (which is in fact coercion). However, we cannot but doubt whether these Westerners are really concerned about us and whether they are concerned about the rights of we Chinese as men. Because we remember very well that it was they (perhaps their fathers and grandfathers) who came to China to slaughter us Chinese, rob us of our property, rape our women, and trample on the rights of us as men. Now they say their human rights concept is a great, consistent, and globally recognized value. Moreover, they also say that they do not have any intention of imposing it upon us. There always seems to be some contradiction here. The history of China's humiliation by Western imperialism dates back to the year 1840. In that year, China fought a war with Britain called the "Opium War." Did the war have anything to do with "human rights?" The Chinese fought for the right to prevent themselves from opium poisoning. Perhaps the two sides stood by their own human rights. Was there justice in the matter? Anyway, China was defeated. Imperialists throughout the world held that the principle of "fair trade" had won. The result of the war was the signing of the Treaty of Nanjing, whereby Hong Kong was occupied by Britain for over 100 years. The history of China's entry into a semicolonial society began here. However, it is completely wrong if one thinks that the British imperialists were only concerned about the "human rights" of British merchants and were unconcerned about the "human rights" of Chinese. One should know that their human rights concept has really been "consistent." Article nine of the Treaty of Nanjing reads: "All Chinese who have inhabited a city occupied by the British, who have dealings with the British, and who follow and attend to British officials, will have their guilt completely pardoned by the grace of the great emperor through a royal decree and such things will be made known to the world. All Chinese who have been arrested and imprisoned on British business will also be forgiven." Such wonderful wording was perhaps the first official record of how Western imperialists showed concern about China's human rights, or it was at least the first record of a Sino-foreign diplomatic treaty. It is said that the Western concept "human rights" means that all men are born with equal rights. Therefore, Westerners have adopted an attitude of general concern for China's "human rights," and the phrase they used in the first place was "all Chinese." However, any genuine concern for the rights of the Chinese is out of the question. Otherwise, they would not have come to China with guns and cannons and forced opium on the Chinese. In the words that followed, they concretely explained the four types of people they were really concerned about: All "who have inhabited a city occupied by the British," "who have dealings with the British," "who follow and attend to British officials," and "who are arrested and imprisoned on British business." In a word, they were traitors who helped the British fight the Chinese and harm the Chinese. In what way were they cared for? "Guilt completely pardoned," and those arrested to be "released" and made "known to the world" so that their names would be known all over the world and that glory would be with them, thus encouraging more Chinese to follow their example and facilitate them exploit Chinese of all their rights as men. The Treaty of Nanjing was signed by the Chinese under the coercion of British gunboats. Nonetheless, those crafty imperialists never forgot equality in form. In article nine, there was no such phrase such as the "British demand" nor the "two sides agree." The "initiative" all rested with the emperor of the great Qing Dynasty. What fine-sounding phrases as "royal decree" and "by the grace." Why did the British not reciprocate? Why could the guilt of the British working for the Chinese not be pardoned and why could their names not be made known to the world? It should have been the internal affair of the Chinese themselves to punish Chinese who committed crimes in China. But an internal affair had been written down in a diplomatic treaty. With this as a precedent, some Westerners often say: You have arrested so-and-so and violated human rights. We are unhappy about this and must impose sanctions on you. Is this strange? No. They have always done this. Nevertheless, it seems that their "human rights" pretext needs to be changed to "traitor's rights." It is the right phrase. Of course, they will never make such a change. If they did, they would find it difficult to deceive people. But the Chinese pay attention to reality, and, for the sake of the rights of more than 1.1 billion Chinese as men, we cannot but deprive a few traitors of their rights. There is no way out other than this. The Chinese have already had dealings with imperialism for over 100 years and this is valuable wealth. Not forgetting this historical episode makes one a little clearer.
