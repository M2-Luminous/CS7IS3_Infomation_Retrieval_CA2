FR941025-1-00041 FR941025-1-00010 Pursuant to 50 CFR 424.16(c)(2), the Service may extend or reopen a comment period upon finding that there is good cause to do so. The Service has determined that good cause exists, in that full participation of the affected public in the species listing process will allow the Service to consider the best scientific and commercial data available in making a final determination on the proposed action. Section 4(b)(5)(E) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq .), requires that a public hearing be held if requested within 45 days of the publication of a proposed rule. In response to numerous requests, the Service is holding three hearings. The three public hearings will be held on the dates and at the addresses described above. Anyone wishing to make an oral statement for the record is encouraged to provide a written copy of their statement and present it to the Service at the start of the hearing. In the event there is a large attendance, the time allotted for oral statements may have to be limited. Oral and written statements receive equal consideration. There are no limits to the length of written comments presented at the hearings or mailed to the Service. To facilitate the uninhibited exchange of information, cameras and videotape recorders will not be allowed within the public hearing rooms. Legal notices announcing the dates, times, and locations of the hearings will be published in newspapers concurrently with this Federal Register notice. Author The primary author of this notice is Lorena L.L. Wada (see ADDRESSES ). Authority The authority for this action is the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq .). Dated: October 18, 1994. Lynn B. Starnes, Acting Regional Director. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;26370 Filed 10&hyph;24&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;55&hyph;P
