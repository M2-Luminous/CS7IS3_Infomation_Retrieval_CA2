[Karadzic] They have not entered Gorazde. I do not know what they call Gorazde, but they have not entered the town itself. We are restraining ourselves here, but as far as strategic points are concerned, almost all of them are in our hands. Washington probably needs this [information that the Serbs have entered the town] in order to launch a new attack. The Muslims are currently activating mines around Gorazde by means of remote control, in order to convince the international public that we are targeting the town itself. It looks as if UN observers, some of whom have been evacuated last night -- I ordered a cease-fire which was a complete success on our side and the observers were evacuated by helicopter shortly before nightfall -- [changes thought] but it seems that they left an observer or two behind in order to have cause to attack us in case they are shelled. The only reason, the only justification for an attack on Serbian positions would be our intentional endangering of the lives of their people, which has never been the case so far. [Bozic] What is your assessment, will there be more bombings of Serbian positions? [Karadzic] We believe that there will be, we believe so because they are very dissatisfied with the effects [of the earlier air strikes], they are highly dissatisfied with the degree of fear among the Serbs. The Serbs are not displaying any fear at all. On the contrary, we are very decisive. Both the decisiveness and the morale of both our army and the leadership are rising. Whenever we are treated unfairly, we always draw great moral energy from this. Therefore, we are resolved to protect our interests. For us, Gorazde -- even if we had taken it, we would have been right -- is not a safe haven but a military stronghold. We believe that they have an entire corps there, some 15,000 troops. Well, we have an entire corps there to keep an eye on them. This corps of ours was supposed to go and do its work in factories, but we have to (?keep it in position) in order to ensure that the Muslims do not attack us. That is unacceptable. The international community must be clear on this point. It either is or is not a protected area. If it is a protected area, the Muslims must hand over their weapons. If they do not hand them over to the United Nations, we will force them to hand the weapons over to us. [Bozic] This afternoon you contacted Mr. Akashi by telephone from Banja Luka. Can you reveal a few details of this conversation? [Karadzic] Well, he again received information that the Serbs were fiercely shelling the town center. I contacted my generals, and was told -- even by those generals who have a view of the town, who can see the town -- that there were explosions in the center of the town and that they resemble explosions of remotely activated mines, but that the Serbs were certainly not shelling the town. Nothing launched by the Serbs was landing on the town. Moreover, the generals told me that is was possible that this was pressure on the observers, that the observers were actually hostages of the Muslims and were forced to send reports that were dictated to them.
