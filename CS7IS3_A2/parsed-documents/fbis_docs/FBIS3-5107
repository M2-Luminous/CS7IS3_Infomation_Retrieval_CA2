Hosokawa asked Yamahana, former head of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), to proceed with drawing up districts for the 300 single-seat constituencies for the House of Representatives, the officials said. The request was made as the House of Councillors passed into law political reform package amendments that will replace the current multiseat districts with 300 single-seat constituencies and 200 seats allocated according to popular vote in 11 electoral units. The package, which also revises regulations on political donations by corporations, will be enforced after enactment of a law delineating the 300 single-seat constituencies, expected this fall. Hosokawa also asked Yamahana to study the possibility of lowering the age of voter eligibility from 20 to 18.
