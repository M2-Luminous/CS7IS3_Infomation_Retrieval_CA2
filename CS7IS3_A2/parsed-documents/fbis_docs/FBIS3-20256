Considering the total domination of the study commissions by "objective" members, no one was surprised that this last one came to the same conclusion as all the others: a "balanced yes" to membership, as Chairman Olof Ruin put it. We were unable to count more than four of the 40 or so commission members who are openly critical of the EU. Serious criticism must therefore be directed at the makeup of the commissions studying the consequences of joining the EU. Their members naturally should have been selected earlier, either before the application was made or at least before the negotiations began. What was the point in choosing them in the midst of the negotiations if not to use them in the yes propaganda itself? The no side was not represented, with the result that it has had great difficulty in following the work and commenting on the results. But the commission on democracy should have allowed the no side to attend a hearing and to present its own views in an appendix. Wrong Already Formal sovereignty -- that is, the right of self-determination -- will be reduced, the commission on democracy says, but that will be offset by the fact that we will be able to take part and influence "the common problems in Europe." Here the commission is guilty of the same mistake as the yes side when it equates the EU's 12 states with Europe's 48. We will be able to take part and influence, says the commission. Who is "we"? The subway crossing guard in Bandhagen, the nurse's assistant in Angelholm, or the small farmer in Morjarv? No, it will be a small minority consisting of Dinkelspiel, Carlsson, and Bildt that will get to exercise the increased "virtual sovereignty" at a safe distance from their subjects in Sweden. Power will shift from popularly elected members of the Riksdag to a Commission, Council of Ministers, and EC Court that make their decisions in secret with little risk of public control and publicity. Our influence in the EU will amount to 5 percent, but 80 percent of the decisions will be transferred from Sweden to the EU, as Jacques Delors put it several years ago, and we will be 100-percent bound by the EU's decisions. Superficial and Simplistic The EU is no threat to welfare, said the commission on welfare and equality, which was headed by Agneta Dreber, head of the Public Health Institute. In an article published in SVENSKA DAGBLADET, one of the commission members says it is true that we will have to pay an annual fee of about 20 billion kronor to the EU, but we will get it back in taxes thanks to increased investment in Sweden. It is true that from 20 billion to 30 billion kronor in state revenues will disappear because of a harmonized value-added tax, but we can get that back through higher property taxes. That is just amazing. The commission is basing its support for EU membership on pious hopes of faster growth and dynamic effects. It consistently overestimates the revenues arising from membership, when in fact we do not know whether there will be any, and underestimates the costs and declines in revenue, when in fact we know that the total will amount to at least 50 billion kronor per year. Where are we going to get that money? We already have a deficit of about 200 billion kronor. The question we should be asking is: Can we afford the EU? And the commission has been subjected to strong criticism. Two Social Democratic members -- Lena Gonas and Margareta Persson -- expressed reservations regarding the commission's conclusions. This is how they explain their reservations: "The lack of analysis between program and reality, the minimizing of the costs and consequences of membership, and the unwillingness to discuss the risks that such minimizing involves from the standpoint of welfare and equality are remarkable." Forgetting the Flip Side The commission on municipalities and the EU also comes up with a yes answer and talks about increased benefits from changes in purchasing rules that will improve the municipalities' opportunities for competing in Europe. Here again, the flip side is being forgotten: the fact that foreign firms will be able to drive Swedish subcontractors who have been cooperating with the municipalities and county councils for years out of business. The outcome may be that the gains and losses will cancel each other out. But if there are any gains, they will not be the result of membership in the EU. The municipalities are already free to use the EU's purchasing data bases under the terms of the free trade agreement, and doing so will be compulsory under the EEA [European Economic Area] agreement. The thing that is most likely to impact the municipalities is the membership fee of about 20 billion kronor per year and the tax shortfall of between 20 billion and 30 billion kronor that will have to made up by cutbacks and reduced subsidies from the central government. The commission also ignores the fact that the municipalities will be included in the EU's convergence rules on maximum borrowing. This means that the EU will be able to force the municipalities to make further cutbacks, since their borrowing will not be allowed to exceed 3 percent of GNP. Completely Dominated by Yes Side The commission on economic consequences comes next in the series of commissions dominated by the yes side. One member, Professor Yvonne Hirdman, felt that the commission was being so tightly manipulated that she resigned. "Experts" from the Industrial Research Institute and the Ministry of Finance are presenting figures supposedly substantiating the thesis regarding the economic advantages of membership in the EU. Based on a long list of assumptions, it is claimed that direct investment by foreign firms will increase if Sweden becomes a member of the EU. The attempt is made to present this as being a crucial issue for our entire country. Not mentioned is the fact that direct investment accounts for only about 4 percent of total investment in Sweden and that even if foreign investment doubles, domestic investment will still be 10 times greater. In both Great Britain and Denmark, foreign direct investment declined for a great many years immediately after they joined the EC. The studies have also been criticized by professional economists, examples being Professor Magnus Blomstrom of the School of Economics, LO [Swedish Federation of Trade Unions] economist Dan Andersson, and Rudolf Meidner. For example, it is claimed that membership in the EU would lead to a percentage increase in GNP that is 0.45 percent higher than in the EEA alternative and that unemployment would correspondingly be 0.04 percent lower than under the EEA agreement. Figures concerning the future are being given in hundredths of a percentage point. Nor is any attempt made to answer the main question: Does anyone believe that Sweden's 608,000 unemployed will do better in a European Union that already has 18 million unemployed and that pursues a constitutionally mandated economic policy in which the fight against inflation always takes precedence over the fight against unemployment? Almost Tragic We still have the commissions on security policy and environment to consider. Sverker Astrom and Leif Leifland, two retired diplomats and former under secretaries of state for foreign affairs, stated long before the study was made that they were strong supporters of the EU and that the neutrality policy had had its day. It is almost tragic the way every means is being used to try to get the citizens, in Goran Rosenberg's words, to "adapt to their politicians" on the subject of foreign and security policy. Instead of shaping opinion before the decision, Bildt and Carlsson are now having to devote themselves to "informing" their citizens after the fact of the neutrality policy's sudden death. No wonder people are both confused and confounded. Unlike Denmark, Sweden has not asked to be exempted from any of the EU's foreign and security policy provisions or from the defense cooperation planned for the Western European Union (WEU). Sweden has simply lain down and accepted the Maastricht treaty down to the last comma, thereby voluntarily giving up its independence in foreign policy. It will not be easy to "inform" away that reality. Manipulated Lastly, there is the commission on environment. It is sad that a government commission should have to manipulate opinion by removing information unfavorable to membership. We do not know what role was played by the two active advocates of "Network for Europe," Annika Ahnberg and Stefan Edman. What happened merely reminds us of the worst features of the earlier referendum. The information removed from the report shows that Sweden will find it exceedingly difficult to influence the EU's environmental policy in the right direction. Even if Sweden had the "environmentally friendly countries" and the "undecided" on its side, that would not be enough to constitute a majority in favor of a sustainable long-term policy on environment and natural resources. If the voting rules are changed to favor the big states -- and there are proposals to do so -- the above will naturally become even harder. We will therefore have a greater possibility of influencing the environment if we can pursue our own policy in our own country, in various UN agencies, and at major environmental conferences like the one in Rio de Janeiro. We would like to put the following questions to Prime Minister Carl Bildt and opposition leader Ingvar Carlsson: You are both advocates of membership in the EU, but in view of your roles, you also have a special responsibility to see that light is shed on all aspects of the EU issue, especially in studies that are being paid for with tax money. Do you think that the makeup of the commissions has been balanced? Do you think that the commissions are trustworthy? If not, are you prepared to give the no side equal funds for carrying out six new studies?
