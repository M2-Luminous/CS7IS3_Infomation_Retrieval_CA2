The united [B-H Army and HVO, Croatian Defense Council] units are not yielding an inch of the free territories of Tesanj, Maglaj, Doboj, and Teslic. At about noon today, the heaviest artillery and infantry attack so far was repulsed in the region of (Suskova Kosa) and Bandera. During the day an infantry attack on (Planike) was been repelled, where our fighters inflicted heavy losses on the enemy. Some 20 chetniks were killed, and the same number were wounded. In the operational zone of the 203d Glorious Motorized Doboj-Bosnia Brigade, the aggressor has been attacking ferociously, but to no avail. Civilian targets are coming under continuous shelling, while sniper fire is incessant in (Miljevac), (Bugarilovici), and (Jelovci). We know for a fact that chetniks Rade (Subotic) and Nebojsa Milakovic are particularly notorious for killing civilians. One of them is responsible for killing a one-year-old child in its mother's arms, as she was on her way from [word indistinct] to the Tesanj war hospital.
