In the SPD leadership it was said that at the Executive Committee meeting Scharping primarily insisted that his "financial policy guidelines" be supported. This means Scharping's promise that an SPD-led federal government will not raise the tax quota or net borrowing, within this framework there is to be redistribution at the cost of high-wage earners, the growth of the federal budget should be below that of the nominal GNP. According to SPD Federal Manager Verheugen, these "basic values" presented by Scharping were not contradicted in the SPD Executive Committee. The Executive Committee discussed the debate about income thresholds for a supplementary tax. Verheugen said that in the Executive Committee there was "complete agreement" that the planned solidarity surcharge of 7.5 percent for all, which the Federal Government is planning, is to be rejected as unsocial. He said that the income threshold of 50,000/100,000 German marks [DM] (single people/married couples) does not refer to the gross income but to the taxable income. According to SPD calculations, this would affect 17.5 percent of single people, but 82.5 percent would be better off; 14.4 percent of married couples would be [adversely] affected but 85.6 percent would be better off. Verheugen stated that, following these explanations, there were no controversies about this matter in the Executive Committee. In the SPD it was recalled that Scharping had not committed himself to any detail. Last Friday the SPD chairman spoke of an income threshold of DM50,000/DM100,000 (single people/married couples), using "may" and said: "Whether this is done will be decided by further deliberations." The matter must be seen "in connection" with other financial policy projects. On Monday SPD officials said that it is still open whether the demand for a 10-percent supplementary tax to replace the 7.5 percent solidarity surcharge planned by the coalition is to be included in the election campaign program. Scharping's advisers have warned against including such details, which might prove null and void after a stocktaking of the actual financial situation of the Federal Government. For this reason, Scharping wants to avoid giving detailed figures in the election program. The SPD Executive Committee for the first time discussed the draft, which was formulated under the leadership of Scharping and his deputy Lafontaine. The final vote in the Executive Committee is to be taken on 2 May, following discussions within the party; the draft formulated by this process is to be passed on as a motion for a resolution to the delegates of the SPD Congress in Halle on 22 June. Before the SPD Executive Committee meeting began on Monday at noon, the members of the body avoided continuing the public debate that had started on the weekend. Lower Saxony Minister-President Schroeder (SPD) was heard saying that he considers the tax plans "highly sensible." Scharping said that it is better to have a debate now than later. After DGB [German Trade Union Federation] Chairman Meyer, who was once an SPD Bundestag deputy, stated on the weekend that the income threshold planned by Scharping is too low, Mr. Rappe, chairman of the Chemical Industry Trade Union and SPD Bundestag deputy, also voiced his concern on Monday. At the Executive Committee meeting Baden-Wuerttemberg Environment Minister Schaefer (SPD) came out against a renunciation of a general speed limit, as envisaged in the draft of the election program. Schafer said that both energy policy and traffic policy favor a general speed limit. On the weekend the election program draft was criticized by the Federal Congress of Young Socialists in Herne. The draft is "boring and without prospects." The Congress called for a red-green coalition. "Our goal is the immediate opting out of nuclear energy." The Young Socialists passed resolutions calling for the "immediate abolition of compulsory military service." The goal is "an FRG without an army" within eight years. Deputy DAG [German Employees' Trade Union] Chairwoman Konitzer came out against the income threshold mentioned by Scharping for a supplementary tax; she called for thresholds of DM80,000/DM160,000. Mr. Fuchs, the chairman of the Federation of German Wholesale and Foreign Trade, criticized both the SPD proposals and the solidarity surcharge planned by the coalition.
