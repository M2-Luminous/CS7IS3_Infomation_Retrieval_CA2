This qualitative change in the popular debate has occurred because it has become apparent that it is the shortage of supply, not an exaggerated increase in income, that has essentially created the phenomenon of excess liquidity, which is having serious economic and social repercussions. People are becoming more and more aware that, although the abrupt decrease in supply is associated with external factors (the disruption of Cuba's economic and commercial ties with the former socialist world and the reinforcement of the blockade), the recovery of supply now depends above all on our ability to develop internal capacities for revitalization and economic growth. And it is becoming clear that completely overcoming the shortage is not something that can be accomplished merely by manipulating certain variables that might reduce solvent demand, such as prices, taxes, and other monetary factors. Rather, it has to be accomplished by making positive changes in the most concrete factor in the economy, the place where the production of value is verified. We must recall, to avoid harboring unfounded hopes, that any financial measures that may be taken will not have an immediate or absolute effect of boosting production or increasing supply, because their function is to serve as a bridge to provide access to revitalization. And it should also be emphasized that it is unreasonable to expect the elimination of the shortage to occur uniformly, all at once, and equally for all citizens. To understand this assertion, it is not enough to say that egalitarianism is a tendency that we must banish; we have to start from the notion that Cuba does not now have any external financing that would enable it to put to work a broad range of idle productive capacities in the short term, or to increase supply and stimulate work through consumption, as was done in the 1970's when external financing made it possible to create the parallel market. And that is the vicious circle that workers see when they realize that the internal financial imbalance and low consumption, equitably distributed, erode the motivating force of wages, which is a factor that tends to weaken productive efficiency. To break this vicious circle, it is imperative that we continue the policy of distributing available resources appropriately to certain sectors of the economy where spending will have the maximum multiplier effect. These sectors must be given not only the necessary supplies for production, but also a complement of consumer goods so that the workers can spend their income and thus counter the pernicious effect of shortages. We are talking, then, about a crucial measure that is in the process of being implemented and should figure more prominently in the deliberations of the Workplace Parliaments, even though it is not on the agenda for the next session of the National Assembly and is not strictly a financial matter. But this is an economic policy that also requires a broad consensus, given that our limited resources must be channeled preferentially toward activities such as sugar, mining, tobacco, coffee, oil drilling, biotechnology, the manufacture of medical and pharmaceutical products, tourism, agricultural food production, and others that directly generate foreign exchange income or are essential for the country's economic functioning and social life, such as public health and education. Applying this policy in a consistent manner would promote the stabilization of those sectors, and would gradually create the surpluses needed for the recovery of other sectors, which would contribute to broader reproduction until the recovery of the national economy and the normal development of society became a reality. In these priority sectors, which can play the role of "engines" of the economy, in addition to greater stimulation of work, the improvement of business practices must be established as an extensible premise. These sectors must have enough decisionmaking power and autonomy to ensure, without excuses, reasonable levels and increases in economic efficiency. But it is our contention that this viable solution requires a consensus, because the allocation of resources to these multiplier activities is limited by the austere sacrifice required of other sectors, which, for a time, cannot aspire to the same levels of consumption. This limitation, which is qualified by the national commitment not to leave any sector of the Cuban population out in the cold, makes it necessary to consider the decisive role that moral, ideological, and political factors must continue to play in the revitalization of the country's economy. For that very reason, it is of vital importance that all workers be able to understand thoroughly the complexity of our situation, the viability of possible solutions, and the orientation toward changes that will help us win, little by little, the battle for efficiency and economic recovery.
