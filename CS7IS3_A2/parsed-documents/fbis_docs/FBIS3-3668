Hence, Deng Xiaoping must have partners for the game. He has two generations of partners. The older generation includes Zhang Zhixiang, Wan Li, and Wu Han, and the younger one includes Ding Guangen, Wang Hanbin, and Wang Daming. The latter group has played bridge with him since the early 1960's. Although quite a few people have played bridge with Deng Xiaoping, most have been "troops disappearing like running water." Only the setup of Deng Xiaoping, Ding Guangen, Wang Hanbin, and Wang Daming has lasted long and remained stable, so they are called by Deng's family as the "basic contingent." As overseas readers are familiar with Ding Guangen (member of the CPC Political Bureau, secretary of the Secretariat and head of the Central Propaganda Department), and Wang Hanbin (alternate member of the Political Bureau and vice chairman of the National People's Congress Standing Committee), this article is intended to give an account of Wang Daming. Wang Daming Made an Appearance in Hong Kong Wang Daming showed up in Hong Kong in mid-December 1993. Tall and thin, with gray hair, Wang carries a distinctive air of the academic in his speech and deportment. He led a delegation visiting Hong Kong in the capacity of chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] Beijing Municipal Committee. His purposes in visiting Hong Kong were, among other things, to meet old friends, make new friends, and discuss with relevant parties the issue of electing additional members to the CPPCC committee in Beijing. Originally, he wanted his visit to Hong Kong to be a low profile one, and to try to avoid causing a sensation as much as possible. Unexpectedly, however, he was followed with increasingly keen interest during his eight-day visit to the territory. Of course, it has something to do with his personal style, as he is free from bureaucracy, straight forward, sincere, resourceful, and easily wins people's confidence. Perhaps it may also have had something to do with the particular background of his intimacy with Deng's family, because the latest information about Deng Xiaoping's health that he brought with him was, no doubt, regarded as specially important by various sectors in Hong Kong, who pay close attention to the CPC's political situation. Wang Daming was asked about Deng Xiaoping's health on many occasions and denied all the false reports concerning Deng's health by telling the questioners that "he had played bridge with Deng Xiaoping only recently." Besides, he disclosed some details known to few outsiders: Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, which contains 116 articles and was published a short time ago, was personally examined and approved by Deng Xiaoping article by article during the hot summer. Wang Daming said emphatically: "It is entirely impossible for an old man of nearly 90 to examine and approve in person every article he wrote if he is in poor health." Playing Bridge Was a Must Required by Underground Work Wang Daming is from Beijing and is three to four years younger than Ding Guangen and Wang Hanbin. He came from a poor worker's family and graduated from the machinery department of the Beijing Advanced Industrial School in 1948. He joined the underground Communist Party when he was a student and learned to play bridge while doing underground work. The cards were used to conceal their activities when something happened during their gatherings. When the people's republic was founded in Beijing, Wang worked on the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League [CYL]. Later, he was transferred to work in the Policy Research Center of the Beijing Municipal CPC Committee in 1953, holding the position of deputy head of the industrial group of the committee. His career during this period was connected with that of Wang Hanbin. In this same period, Wang Hanbin held the position of head of the university section of the Beijing Municipal CYL Committee. Afterward, he transferred to the post of deputy director of the Policy Research Center of the Beijing Municipal CPC Committee. During leisure time after work, the common hobby of playing bridge has made them well-coordinated partners for the game. In 1961, Wang Hanbin worked with Deng Xiaoping in Shunyi County on the outskirts of Beijing to conduct investigations of agriculture. One day he said to Wang Daming: "Let me take you to play bridge." In this way, Wang Daming played bridge with Deng Xiaoping for the first time in a senior cadres' club on Yangfengjia Road, thus cementing his friendship with Deng Xiaoping over the bridge table for the past 33 years. Arrangements for Deng Xiaoping's Life After His Retirement At first, playing cards with Deng Xiaoping was kept strictly confidential, and the card players used the password "on duty" to make appointments for playing the game. Wan Li's secretary would act as an organizer by advising Wang Daming on the phone: "You are on duty this evening." During that time, Wang Daming had to be on duty three times a week on average, and very often he spent his holidays at the card table with Deng Xiaoping. They played cards in the senior cadres' club on Yangfengjia Road before the Great Cultural Revolution. After Deng Xiaoping was rehabilitated in 1974, some people suggested setting up a senior cadres' club again, but Deng Xiaoping did not agree. Therefore, the card table was moved into Deng's home, and Wang Daming and other friends have played cards there ever since. According to an insider, the arrangements for Deng Xiaoping's life after he retired to the second line are: Seeing a film one night, and playing mahjong three nights and bridge three nights. He plays mahjong with family members, but he has to invite friends to play bridge. For this reason, Deng Xiaoping's wife Zhuo Lin particularly called them and said: "Comrade Xiaoping has some trouble -- he is always thinking about things and will never stop thinking. It is only when he is playing cards that his attention can be diverted a while. That is why playing cards is the best way for him to take a rest." She thanked them very much for the time they had sacrificed. According to Wang Daming's observation, the reason Deng Xiaoping is able to keep fit lies in his persistence in swimming and playing bridge, as these activities have done a lot of good for him. Last year, the doctor advised him to give up swimming because of old age, but he goes on playing bridge, usually twice a week. Discipline Is Enforced at Deng Xiaoping's Card Table At Deng Xiaoping's card table, this discipline is enforced -- no discussion about politics. Wang Daming recalled that there were exceptions on a few occasions. For example, it was some time in the 1960's when Deng Xiaoping returned from the controversy between the CPC and the CPSU. As everybody was anxious to know the result of the negotiations, they asked him about it while playing cards with him, and he just made some brief remarks regarding the matter. Wang Daming said: "For many decades he has so trusted me that I can take liberty to go about his house at will. A very important point is -- I can observe discipline." Despite the ever-changing situation in Beijing and the personal ups and downs of his official career these years, he always kept silence before Deng Xiaoping and refrained from "saying this and that, and talking about right and wrong." In fact, had he ever spoken to Deng Xiaoping about his career future, he might have had a better official life than he has now. In the early 1980's, Wang Daming took up the position of director of the Economic Commission in Beijing. His ideas on reform are clear. In a survey on changing tracks and finalizing the pattern in enterprises, which was conducted in 1983, Wang Daming pointed out that "enhancement of economic results should depend on people with clear minds." Hu Yaobang appreciated his views very much and gave written instructions to this effect: "I agree with the views of Wang Daming from Beijing. In the previous reorganization of enterprises, we failed to grasp this crucial part, but this time he has hit the vital point." Shortly afterward, Deng Xiaoping also said that the opinion of Wang Daming from Beijing was right because economic results in enterprises could not be enhanced if they did not have people with clear minds. He Took Up the Post as Chairman of CPPCC Beijing Municipal Committee in 1993 In 1986, Hu Yaobang named Wang Daming as the person to be appointed as deputy head of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee. Deng Liqun was in charge of ideology at that time. However, before Wang Daming was able to display his ability, he returned to Beijing [as published] because of illness in 1987. Since then, Wang Daming has been down on his luck. Li Ximing, former secretary of Beijing Municipal CPC Committee, assigned him the post of vice chairman of the CPPCC committee. During the ensuing five years, he was engaged in doing study and investigation work, making quite a few valuable proposals on major economic issues, and blazing a trail for the CPPCC to participate in the deliberation and administration of state affairs. In 1993, he took up the position of chairman of the CPPCC Beijing Municipal Committee and eventually reentered the power center in Beijing. But, five years had passed, after all, and he was already 62. Deng Xiaoping Is Particularly Punctual Wang Daming is deeply impressed by some minor incidents at the card table. He said: "Deng Xiaoping shows great respects for others." It happened in those days when they played cards at the club on Yangfengjia Road. One day, it was approaching the appointed time when Deng Xiaoping suddenly called to say that he would be late as he had something to attend to. Wang Daming and other comrades thought that Deng would come very late, otherwise he, being a big shot, would not have to phone them to revise the appointment. Hence, they felt relieved and went to take a bath. To their great surprise, Deng Xiaoping arrived in a quarter of an hour, so everyone was in a hurry to put on clothes. "Later, we got to know that he was particularly punctual," said Wang Deming, "whenever we made an appointment to play cards, he would be waiting for us at the table a couple of minutes ahead of schedule." Deng Xiaoping is very easy-going at the card table, so we never feel nervous playing cards with him. Someone always wins and loses in the contest, and Deng Xiaoping certainly tries his utmost to win. But, if he is in an inferior position, no one will give ground to him. Sometimes he discards a wrong card, and Ding Guangen and Wang Hanbin criticize him bluntly: "You are wrong to discard this one. Do you not know which card you should discard?" Deng Xiaoping listens with respectful attention. In playing bridge, it is impossible to avoid making mistakes, but people making fewer mistakes will defeat those who make more. Wang Daming believes that Deng Xiaoping likes playing bridge because he thinks the game can train people's thinking and judgment. Moreover, the principle of seeking truth from facts is particularly stressed in playing bridge. If the cards in one's hand are poor, one must not blindly raise the stake. "Comrade Xiaoping's skill in cards is quite good among the retired veteran comrades," said Wang Daming in assessment. This basic contingent of the four abovementioned people has won a number of championships in many amateur competitions. There Are Two More Staff Officers in Deng's Family Over the past few years, there have been two more staff officers at the card table since the basic contingent started to play cards at Deng's home. Deng Pufang and Deng Nan used to sit behind their father to watch him play, and sometimes they made suggestions by giving him some pointers. During a bridge game, Deng Nan would yell to Ding Guangen, criticizing that he had discarded a wrong card, and Deng Pufang would add color and emphasis to fan the flames. With all the talking and laughing, the room was suddenly permeated with a lively atmosphere. Wang Daming said he liked the harmonious affection in Deng's family. Sometimes Deng's grandson would run into the room to lean over his grandfather, and Deng would lovingly give him a kiss. If they played for a long time, Deng Xiaoping would invite them to dinner. The dishes for dinner are very simple, just like those of ordinary families, and the supper is simple as well. A small plate is laid before each person, in which there were a few slices of apple or orange. When Deng Xiaoping is away from Beijing, Wang Daming sometimes accompanies him for a short period. During his south China tour in 1992, it happened that Wang Daming was leading a group of Beijing CPPCC committee members to emulate the experience in Guangdong, Shenzhen, and Zhuhai. Upon arrival in Shenzhen, Wang Daming went to call on Deng Xiaoping who arrived a day earlier, and told Deng about his impression of the south. He said that the reform situation was favorable and the socialist factors had increased. At the end of last year, before going to Shanghai to spend the winter, Deng Xiaoping asked him whether he could go along. As Wang Daming was busy with official duties in his important position as chairman of the CPPCC Beijing Municipal Committee, he was unable to leave Beijing, but promised to pay a New Year call to the respected old man after the Spring Festival and have a happy gathering at the card table.
