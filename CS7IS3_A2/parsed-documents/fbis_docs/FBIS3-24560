Vishnyakova and V.I. Kukhtenko (GosNIIAS, Moscow) under the ``Complex Technical Systems'' rubric] [Abstract] The first stage of a system for computer aided design of short range (5 to 25 km) anti-aircraft missile complexes (AMCs) is described. The system methodology is based on using the body of mathematics of the theory of operations in conjunction with the automatic control theory the theory of large systems. The problem of developing a short range AMC is stated and solved for the developmental design proposal stage. The process of computer aided design of an anti-aircraft complex includes sequential solution of problems of synthesizing the AMC image and analysis of resulting AMC configurations. The article describes the structure of the CAD system, as well as its hardware and software. The software for simulation of the AMC and its major subsystems is also described in great detail. The AMC CAD system was used for a number of practical calculations investigating the prospects for development and analysis of effectiveness of various configurations of a short range AMC. The use of the AMC CAD system made it possible to substantially increase the number of alternative AMC versions analyzed during the development process, which improved the quality of the design output. The system can be used by a research engineer who does not know programming languages but knows AMC design methods and procedures. Figures 13, references 23.
