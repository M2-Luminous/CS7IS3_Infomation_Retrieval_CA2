Those who held this view were mainly liberals who advocated compromise solutions with the ruling regimes which were linked in one way or another with imperialist forces. The liberals claimed that the more the people intensified their resistance to imperialist agents and imperialism itself, the more the agents and their overlords increased their oppression of the people and prolonged foreign domination of Iraq and other Arab states. Despite their call for peaceful action represented by addressing nicely written petitions to the monarchy on some public demand and dispatching delegations to key government officials, or to the British Embassy in Baghdad, for instance, concerning some issue of public interest, such as calling for an end to British influence in and domination of Iraq, our liberal friends were not spared persecution, arrest, imprisonment, and even exile by those royal governments. Many of those liberal ideas found their way into political action of a different kind in Egypt under the late President Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir. Before the June War, the Egyptian leadership was advised not to provoke the Zionist entity and to use diplomacy in resolving the Arab-Zionist conflict. Strangely enough, the Soviet Union itself was one of those who offered such advice. Following the Arab defeat in that war, many people, both friends and foes, began saying: We advised 'Abd-al-Nasir, but he did not listen to our advice, hence the defeat. Actually, 'Abd-al-Nasir listened to Soviet and French advice. It was the Zionist entity which did not care and was not ready to hear anything other than the voice of racism, aggression, occupation, and the overthrow of 'Abd-al-Nasir's regime. It is understood that the Soviets also advised Iraq not to provoke the United States and the West by nationalizing oil. The nationalization decision which was drafted by struggler Saddam Husayn was the strongest and most important of all. The Soviets repeated their stand in the period before and after the Nazi military aggression on Iraq. This time, however, it was charged with ill-intention and evil. It came under Gorbachev, not under Podgorny in 1967 or Brezhnev during the nationalization days in 1972. The position taken by the public throughout those years to this day, especially in Iraq, is to reject the ridiculous idea about not provoking the enemies and opponents, as the liberal circles should have described them. Enemies are essentially provokers against the people, the homeland, independence, and national sovereignty of Iraq or any other country which upholds similar principles. Were it not for the belief in these principles and their efficacy, their revolutions would not have succeeded and victories would not have been achieved in this country or any other country. The experiences of Egypt under al-Sadat and Mubarak, the experiences of other Arab states, and the experiences of 'Arafat with "Israel" all indicate the disastrous course followed by all those Arab sides, which finally led them to surrender to the imperialist and Zionist forces. The escalation of Iraqi action on the political and media levels against the United States, the West, and the Arab forces which are allied to the imperialists is not only consistent with great Iraq's spirit of challenge against all those quarters as embodied in the glorious word "no", which leader Saddam Husayn has uttered and with which he expressed the steadfastness of the people and the homeland against the blockade, but also harmonious with the principles of the great 17-30 July Revolution and the principles of Saddam Husayn, the engineer of the revolution and its leader to the end. Our dispute with the different enemies is a deep one. The solution of this dispute is only possible on the basis of those enemies recognizing Iraq's right to freedom, independence, and progress, not on any other basis as the aggressors and their collaborators want and imagine. Perhaps, the enemies' insistence on harming Iraq despite its implementation of the so-called "UN resolutions" is proof that the hostile stand against our country has not changed. This calls for a similar stand at all times. They did not lay down their political, military, and economic weapons against us, and therefore we must continue to use the weapon of information and steadfastness against the aggressors from now and until they are forced to change their stand against us.
