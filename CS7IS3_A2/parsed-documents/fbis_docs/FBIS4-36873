FBIS4-36873 "drnes114dd_94018" FBIS-NES-94-114 Daily Report 9 Jun 1994 Palestinian Affairs Hamas Spokesman on Ties With PLO, Gaza-Jericho Hamas Spokesman on Ties With PLO, Gaza-Jericho NC1206080094 Jerusalem AL-QUDS in Arabic 9 Jun 94 pp 1, 19 NC1206080094 Jerusalem AL-QUDS Arabic BFN [Interview with Hamas spokesman Muhammad Nazzal by unidentified correspondent in Amman; date not given] [Text] [AL-QUDS] What are the results of your repeated meetings with PLO officials? [Nazzal] Following the signing of the Oslo Agreement, Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] leadership decided to freeze all official contacts and meetings with the PLO leadership. Since then, no meetings between us have taken place. [AL-QUDS] But you have met recently with 'Abbas Zaki. [Nazzal] The recent meeting with brother 'Abbas was at his request. We did not freeze individual contacts with officials opposed to the PLO policy. Accordingly, my meeting with brother 'Abbas came within this context. [AL-QUDS] What about your intention to join the coming Palestinian Authority and its institutions and how do you view the future of your relations with them? [Nazzal] I have informed brother 'Abbas of Hamas' official and final decision rejecting participation in the Palestinian Authority. We do not recognize this authority and do not believe it represents the Palestinian people. I believe it was imposed by a U.S.-Israeli desire. [AL-QUDS] If legislative elections under the Palestinian Authority were held, would you take part in them? [Nazzal] We believed and continue to believe in holding free and general elections that can ensure the election of a leadership representing the Palestinian people. [AL-QUDS] What is the alternative to the Oslo Agreement you are offering to the Palestinian people and thousands of Palestinian families at home and abroad? [Nazzal] Hamas offers resistance as an alternative to the settlement process. The settlement process which started in Madrid and ended in Oslo has brought about an extremely feeble agreement. The way it was drafted and its clauses constitute a liquidation of the Palestinian cause. We believe that the resistance and its continuation are essential for achieving a full Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Palestinian territories. Gaza was a burden to the occupation. What happened is that the Israelis traded their exit from Gaza for an agreement that has consecrated Israel's occupation of Palestine and granted the Palestinian administrative self-rule, thus treating Palestinians as an ethnic minority living under a Jewish state. [AL-QUDS] But is Hamas offering resistance to steer the Oslo and Cairo Agreements toward the desired objectives? [Nazzal] We believe that the Oslo Agreement and the agreements that followed it have interpreted the Declaration of Principles in a way that serves Israeli interests and harms Palestinian interests. Accordingly, Hamas believes that these agreements are the natural result of the policy pursued by the PLO leadership. [AL-QUDS] Suppose that the agreement did not exist, what would have guaranteed that no more settlements would be built? [Nazzal] When the PLO leadership decided to attend the Madrid Conference it made this conditional on halting the settlement activity. What happened is that the PLO has abandoned the condition it placed for itself. When the agreement was signed, no mention was made of removing or dismantling the settlements or even freezing settlement-building. So even the agreement does not provide for the guarantees referred to in the question. [AL-QUDS] But don't you think that the agreement has preserved what is left of our land? Perhaps tomorrow we will not find land to negotiate about. [Nazzal] I believe that the agreement has not dealt with the Palestinian issue as a problem of land, but a problem of a people. The land occupied in 1967, which according to the Security Council Resolutions is occupied land, has become, under the negotiations, disputed land. This means that the PLO's ceiling in the negotiations is lower than that of the so-called international legality, which is very strange. I do not believe that this agreement will preserve the Palestinian territories or what is left of them but instead will consecrate Israel's sovereignty of this area. [AL-QUDS] But don't you think that the decision to take part in the negotiations has been made in the absence of an international balance of power and amid Arab fragmentation? [Nazzal] Joining the negotiations under Arab weakness and fragmentation and in the absence of the balance of power is in the interest of Israel, and the Palestinians shouldn't have participated in the negotiations, because negotiations should be among strong and equal parties. Negotiations between a weak and a strong party will inevitably be in the interest of the strong, which will impose and even dictate its terms. This is what happened in the settlement process that started in Madrid and ended in Oslo. The excuses that the PLO leadership has advanced and is advancing for joining this process are supposed to lead us to results contrary to what the PLO leadership has expected. [AL-QUDS] But don't you think that the Oslo and Cairo Agreements will prompt the Israeli leadership to abandon, even partly, the notion of Greater Israel? [Nazzal] We must realize that the theory of Greater Israel still exists in the Zionist mind, but there are two approaches to it. One says that it can be achieved by geographic expansion, while the other, which is adopted by the Labor Party, seeks to build Greater Israel through Israel's political, economic, and cultural penetration of the so-called Middle East. One of the most important things gained from this agreement is that the Palestinians will be the bridge that the Israelis will cross into the region, thus achieving the theory adopted by the Labor Party. [AL-QUDS] But the Palestinian National Independence Document stipulates the establishment of the Palestinian state on any part of Palestine to be liberated. So how can you explain your opposition to the establishment of a Palestinian entity on liberated land? [Nazzal] When we see that any part of the Palestinian land is liberated we will be the first to express our support and blessings. However, we believe that the agreement is devoted to championing the Israeli sovereignty. We also believe that the agreement has not liberated anything. The settlements still exist in the Gaza Strip and the Israeli occupation has redeployed its troops and has not completely withdrawn. Therefore, how can we accept what they say about the so-called liberated land? [AL-QUDS] But Israel is continuing the negotiating process with the Arab countries. Can Hamas guarantee its continuous opposition in these countries? [Nazzal] The Hamas movement started and forged ahead in the occupied Palestinian territories. Hamas' principal organizational structure is still there. It will, therefore, not be affected by any political development that might emerge in Arab-Israeli relations. Also, I rule out any normalization in the relations so soon, particularly with regard to Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon. [AL-QUDS] How do you envisage the future relations between Hamas and the opposition Palestinian forces, particularly the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine? [Nazzal] After the Madrid Conference, we started to coordinate efforts with the opposition Palestinian forces. We succeeded in establishing a political alliance with them. This alliance aimed at forming a political base to confront the weak base set up by Yasir 'Arafat at the start of the Madrid Conference. We formed an alliance consisting of 10 Palestinian organizations to confront Yasir 'Arafat's alliance which is made up of only three groups. I believe that the structure of our alliance is unprecedented on the Palestinian arena as well as in the Arab and Islamic arena. Our alliance included political and ideological currents in the "leftist nationalist and Islamic" region. We are trying to promote this alliance in the new stage that started with the implementation of the Oslo Accord. [AL-QUDS] But what if the Hamas Movement wants to use its position in the opposition to gain the support of the masses to ensure its success in the upcoming elections? [Nazzal] Hamas started as a resistance movement, and it has never aimed at assuming power. Furthermore, the authority they are talking about is nothing but an imaginary authority. It is an administration supervised by the occupation, and it is, therefore, a tool in the hands of the occupation. [AL-QUDS] But all the provisions of the Palestinian-Israeli Agreement were signed. What is the most dangerous political challenge that might face the Palestinian people in the wake of the implementation of this agreement's protocols? [Nazzal] This agreement has not dealt with basic issues that represent the core of the Palestinian cause. These issues have been postponed until the next stage of negotiations with the aim of promoting the agreement. This is because we believe that there are clear Israeli answers to all outstanding issues, namely Jerusalem, settlements, the 1948 refugees, and the Palestinian state. Hence, these issues will be settled only if the negotiations are completed in favor of the enemy. Therefore, the challenge facing the Palestinian people is to complete the march of resistance against the occupation and to reject the agreement and to consider it null and void.
