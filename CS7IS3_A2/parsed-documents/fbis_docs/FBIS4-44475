It merely termed unemployment "awaiting employment." Nevertheless, as the situation developed, in 1993 China began to admit to the existence of an unemployment problem and officially formulated and extended measures providing relief funds. However, many experts have noted that since reform of the labor system, much of the labor force is bound to become armies of unemployed. Thus the situation warrants greater attention. As a joint Ministry of Labor and Ministry of Civil Affairs report noted, China's unemployment situation is grim. It will become a centennial worry. According to reports, just as the State Council received this report, five separate long lines of people created disorder on a nationwide scale while seeking work. Li Peng truly highly regards the report. He says that we definitely cann ot allow the unemployment problem to worsen. If peasants or workers rebel, our CPC will be unable to hold onto state power. As one concerned noted, the report proposed outlooks for reform of China's labor and employment systems. There still are two possibilities: One, a balanced interim. At present, the masses of enterprises have begun to be psychologically prepared for unemployment and smashing the "three irons." They have considerable psychological endurance to oscillation of the labor and employment system tracks. At the same time, there will be no big problems, especially with agricultural development and in most villages if the unemployment insurance mechanism and the unemployment-reemployment mechanism are gradually perfected, price reform goes smoothly, price increases are not great and the government evenly exchanges functions and streamlines organization. With these conditions it is estimated that after three to five years of painstaking work, labor demand and supply relationships under market mechanisms gradually can be established. Enterprises also will get great vitality from labor and employment system reform, seizing the last opportunity of this century to bring up economic development to a new stage. China hopes for and seeks such results, yet there are two crucial non-economic factors: 1. Political stability with no change in the overall direction of reform; 2. Unemployment problems brought on by labor and employment system reform do not threaten social stability. These two non-economic conditions ultimately depend on the judgment and choice of 1.2 billion Chinese people. Labor and employment system reform will be a self-revolution. Whether it succeeds depends on how many people have the determination and the ability to accept such a revolution. A short time ago, Shanghai did a sample survey of workers throughout the municipality; 94 percent of workers appraised reform and the open door policy as good or relatively good. Their attitudes toward the next, greater reform dynamics are: 39 percent believe in supporting it provided the overall situation is advantageous; 35 percent believe in supporting it provided they can bear it economically. When asked about the psychology and acceptability of drawing unemployment relieft, several 10,000s of Shanghai's unemployed replied: 73.3 percent felt it psychologically hard or very hard to bear; 78.24 percent had economic difficulties while unemployed. In electing labor and employment system reform, 15 million to 30 million workers in state-owned enterprises face grim challenges. Deeper and more thorough government organization reform implies that nearly one-half of the 34 million cadres nationwide must depart from government organizations and enter the marketplace. These 10 million cadres will face yet an other grim challenge. There also are those reckoned at one million potential unemployed--the peasants. The spring of 1994 just passed and a surging wave of public project workers arrived at the coastal cities earlier, constituting a serious threat to railway transport, railway stations and the social order of large cities. To have a balanced transition of labor and employment system reform, these all are unavoidable conundrums which have to be faced and must be resolved appropriately. 2. Urgently step on the brakes and return to a planned system. This is a result which China does not wish for and hopes to avoid at all costs. But it is not impossible. In the process of electing to reform the labor and employment systems, if most enterprises and workers cannot accept it and the masses underestimate the unemployment threat, they will be in a muddle by the unemployment attack. Peasants congest the cities. Price reforms are not in concert. Serious inflation and large scale unemployment intersect. Establishment of unemployment security and reemployment systems have not kept up. This may affect social order and even bring on a social crisis. Ultimately the government will have no choice but to resume direct interference. To continue to ensure high employment goals, enterprises will have to drop labor and employment system reforms. The aforementioned report also noted that in the 1990s, China still faces a stituation of total labor supply far greater than total demand. According to forecasts, in the year 2,000 the nationwide labor-age population will be 781 million people, up 84 million people over 1990; the average annual growth rate is 1.2 percent. Of which, the average annual growth rate during the Eighth Five-Year Plan is 1.3 percent, and during the Ninth Five-Year Plan, one percent. Compared to the 1980s, in the 1990s the characteristics of labor resources are: 1. Less population entering the labor-age and lower growth rates. Between 1991 and the year 2,000, some 188 million people will be of labor-age nationwide, 6.25 million less than i n the 1980s. The annual growth rate will fall from 3.1 percent to 2.4 percent. 2. More population pulling out of labor-age. In the 1990s it will be 86.2 million people, up 12.8 million people compared to the 1980s, up 17.4 percent. Among the labor-age population, employment posts need not be provided to a portion of it for various reasons. If the labor force participation rate is calculated at 82 percent in the year 2,000, the labor supply seeking employment posts will reach 640 million, up 74 million over 1990, or an average annual increase of 7.4 million people at an average annual growth rate o f 1.9 percent. The situation of hidden unemployment within enterprises is relatively serious. Within enterprises owned by the whole people alone, surplus personnel have reached 15 million, and some estimate there are 30 million. Surplus rural labor is even more astonishing. According to predictions, at present agricultural labor approximately has a surplus of 40 percent. With overall consideration of various factors, in the next decade the issue of employment will have to be resolved nationwide for about 202 million people. According to methods of calculating the employment growth elasticity coefficient used by the World Bank, between 1979 and 1988, China's GNP increased 150.2 percent. Social labor grew 35.3 percent. The employment growth elasticity coefficient was 0.235. Inferred from the goal that the total value of GNP will double by the end of the century, in the next 10 years the average annual social labor growth rate is only 1.55 percent. A 10 year increase in labor force demand is only 94 million people. Even if the economic growth rate is somewhat higher, if the growth rate were eight percent, in the 1990s there would only be about 120 million new employment posts. Of course, one also must add the more than 8,000 employment posts withdrawn from labor-age and vacated. In this way, it can be expected there will be about 200 million employment posts. However, two factors must be considered: first, the great savings on labor force demand from technological advances and the management revolution. The 1990s will not be like the 1980s in terms of the employment growth elasticity coefficient increase. Second, a considerable portion of the population pulling out of labor-age may continue to remain in their employment posts. Some of the labor age population may have more than one job and occupy two or more employment posts. Thus, this implies that China will bring an enormous unemployment force into the 21st century. This is a worry that will last into the next century.
