"I'm very optimistic. I believe this time NATO is seen as the organisation who holds the key," said the source. "The UN and the European Community are asking us to take action. If we do not take action, we paralyse the international community." The comments came after North Atlantic Treaty Organisation ambassadors held "intense" consultations on the possibility of airstrikes against the Bosnian Serbs around Sarajevo in the wake of the weekend massacre of 68 people in a Sarajevo market. The NATO ambassadors, who could take a decision on the issue on Wednesday, are considering a request by UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali for action to deter any repetition of the mortar attack NATO Deputy Secretary General Sergio Silvio Balanzino earlier said: "As to air strikes I will have a very definite and clear answer tomorrow. Stay tuned as they say on TV.... At this stage, I can't say anything more." Although upbeat, the source added the ambassadors would also study the "wider implications" of such air strikes, and would consider in particular a proposal by France for an ultimatum to be put to the Bosnian Serbs. France has said it would press for an ultimatum giving the Serbs a few days to pull back their heavy guns from the predominently Moslem Bosnian capital, even if the idea was rejected by the EC ministers. The idea was opposed by Britain, Greece and Spain here on Monday, although it was supported by Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands at a meeting of European Community foreign ministers. Any decision on air strikes must be taken unanimously by the North Atlantic Council, NATO's executive body. Sources close to the alliance added that NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner, convalescing from surgery, may give a press conference Wednesday on the outcome of the ambassadors' meeting. In August, NATO authorised the use of its warplanes to end the strangulation of Sarajevo and other Serb-besieged Moslem communities if requested by the United Nations. But the pro-Serb Socialist government in Greece, which took power in October, says airstrikes could trigger a wider Balkans war and is threatening to veto the move since NATO operates on consensus. NATO currently has 170 aircraft, including 80 warplanes, deployed to enforce a no-fly zone over Bosnia. But it faced tough decisions in considering whether to unleash them against the Serbs. Although Butrus-Ghali sought authorisation for a punitive strike as a deterrent to future shelling, European Community foreign ministers on Monday backed the use of air power to lift the siege of Sarajevo immediately. The United States has also signaled its support for wider action beyond what US Secretary of State Warren Christoper called the "rather narrow request" of the UN chief.
