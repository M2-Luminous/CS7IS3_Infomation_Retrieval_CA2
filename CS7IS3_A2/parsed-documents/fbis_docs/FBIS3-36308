In an interview with Interfax, he said that the treaty and the entire visit should be regarded "as a strong impetus to political efforts to return peace to Abkhazia and South Ossetia rather than a substitute for such efforts." Kozyrev stressed that in defining the future status of the regions it was necessary to renounce force and seek "a realistic compromise."
