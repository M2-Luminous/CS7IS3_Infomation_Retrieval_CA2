It was about 1800 and night was just beginning to fall. The streets near the penitentiary were virtually deserted. At that time of day, in that part of town, passersby are very rare. The presence of anyone, even strangers behaving suspiciously, would thus attract no attention. The prison guard, an accomplice, waited for a sign from his confederates. At the appointed hour, he opened the prison gate and let the three terrorists inside. Obviously, the guard must have given his partners a detailed map of the prison in advance. With their pinpoint knowledge of the premises, they proceeded first to the office of the warden, who was taken by surprise and failed to react quickly enough. They rushed him and--to avoid making noise--fell on him with knives. With serious wounds in the throat and elsewhere on his body, the warden collapsed on the floor of his office in a pool of blood. According to the latest information we have obtained, the victim is still in extremely critical condition. One crime already behind them, the group proceeded with the guard in the lead to the facility's armory, carrying off six pistols, an equal number of "mat 49" and Seminovs. Armed with all these weapons--the principal motive for the attack--the terrorists and the guard took flight. While the facts about this attack discredit recently circulated rumors about a spectacular prison breakout of some 200 prisoners, they do confirm that the Cherchell prison was indeed the target of a terrorist operation. Also, we have learned the prosecutor in Saida was seriously wounded yesterday in a terrorist attack. Thus we see terrorists are again targeting officers of the court. Other magistrates brought down by the beastly terrorists include Lardi Baida, deputy prosecutor for the court of Algiers, assassinated last July; Mohamed Said, prosecutor general of Tlemcen, victim of a terrorist attack last May; and Bekai Mustapha, presiding judge for the court at Kolea. Indeed, the attack on Sidi Ghiles prison and attempted assassination of Said's prosecutor were part of an almost synchronized recrudescence of terrorist attacks throughout the country. In several cities, a number of civilians and members of security forces were assassinated between last Tuesday and Sunday: no less than 21 civilians, including a forest ranger, his eight-year-old daughter, a clerk, the president of the Guigbab DEC [expansion unknown] (Merouana), and an imam. The security services are mourning the loss of 14 of their men, including nine policemen savagely murdered last Wednesday at Benghazi while trying to remove a police roadblock. Two other policemen were wounded in that ambush. Nevertheless, the security services have struck back with some effective blows against the terrorists in the space of only a few days, eliminating 12 and arresting 149 others. The biggest raid was carried out on Tuesday at Tiaret, where five terrorists were killed and 46 others rendered harmless, while in the Sidi Bel Abbes region seven members of the group that set fire to the ENIE [expansion not given] at Telagh were neutralized. These results demonstrate once again that despite the relentlessness and murderous fury of the armed groups, the security services are more determined than ever to wage unceasing battle against them.
