The shuttle had originally been scheduled to land at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC), but bad weather over the center forced the change in the landing place. The moment the shuttle touched down, approximately 300 mission controllers and other people, who had been watching the large image screen within a studio at the German Space Operation Center (GSOC) stood up and applauded, celebrating the safe return. Among those people at the studio watching the landing were Professor H. Stoewer, managing director of the German Space Agency (DARA), Dr. W. Kroell, chairman of the German Aerospace Research Institute (DLR), D-2 mission manager Dr. H. Dodeck, and the author. Following the 1985 D-1 mission, the D-2 mission was originally scheduled to be carried out in 1988. However, it was delayed five years due to the accident involving the U.S. space shuttle Challenger. Considering the difficulties they must have had to overcome during those years of delay, this author could read the mixed feelings of relief and hardship on the faces of the people in the mission control room. Our company, Space Technology Corporation (STC), was the Japanese participant in the D-2 mission. In the following, the author will introduce the reason for STC's participation in the D-2 project and the experiences we had by participating in it. Outline of D-2 Project Management of D-2 Project The D-2 project was led by DLR under the supervision of DARA. The launch of the space lab was delayed several times before the launch was carried out in 1993. Germany set up DARA in the summer of 1989 to promote space development efficiently by empowering it to coordinate all space-related activities within the country. In line with this, the responsibility to implement the D-2 project was transferred from the German Research and Technology Ministry (BMFT) to DARA in August 1990. However, considering the fact that DLA was already responsible for promoting the D-2 project, the institute was allowed to continue managing the D-2 mission as an exceptional measure. In October 1990, the names of four German astronauts, i.e., R. Bruemmer, H. Schlegel, G. Thiele, and U. Walter, all of DLR, were announced. In September 1990, the Manned Space Control Center (MSCC) was set up within GSOC located in Oberpfaffenhofen in the outskirts of Munich. The work for launching space lab D-2 according to the time schedule (Table 1 [not reproduced]) in September 1992 proceeded. However, the manifest for the launching of the space shuttle was revised several times. The shuttle launch from KSC finally took place at 1050, 26 April 1993, seven months after the original launch schedule. Background of D-2 Project The manned space flight project in Germany started with its participation in the space lab development program in the early 1970s. Based on the success of the manned space lab D-1 mission in 1985, the D-2 program was planned. (The D-1 mission sent two German astronauts into space.) The D-2 project was led by Germany, with the United States, Japan, and other European countries participating, to conduct a series of experiments under the microgravity environment of space. The project was regarded as the first important step in preparation for using Europe's Columbus space center. Scientifically, the D-2 mission aimed at conducting material and life science experiments and conducting earth and astronomical observations. Technologically, the mission was designed to test the operation of the experiment equipment systems, to promote the automation of ground control operation, to evaluate space robotics technology, and to carry out the measurement of microgravity in space using the most advanced measurement technology. The scientific experiments involved the evaluation of the technologies used in the mission experiments and the operability of the experiment instruments to prove their functioning and performance in space. The payload of the D-2 mission was composed of 15 payload elements involving 28 experimental instruments. Approximately 90 experiments, taking a total of 210 hours, were conducted in space using these instruments. One aim of the D-2 project was to promote international cooperation in space endeavors. ESA took charge of the development of an anthrorack and a fluid physics experiment system. Six ESA experiments were conducted using these German-developed systems. ESA shouldered a reasonable percentage of the mission costs. CNES of France offered a temperature-gradient furnace for use in the experiment. NASA cut the launch costs for the European partners in exchange for its use of 30 percent of the anthrorack and for allowing them to conduct one experiment in the biolab. Originally, 30 percent of the German space experiment resources was made available to German industry. However, the industry's interest in conducting experiments in space was low, and only one company, a beer company, participated in the D-2 project. As for Japan, STC participated by shouldering a reasonable amount of the mission costs. Background of STC's Participation in D-2 Mission Since former U.S. President Ronald Reagan announced a program to construct a space station in 1983 and called on Japan, Canada, and European countries to participate in the program, Japanese interest in the program has been mounting. Since the announcement of the program, a group of private companies, led by major trading companies, has been set up to study space station utilization. In addition, the Japan Space Utilization Promotion Center (JSUP) has been established. In 1985, an agreement was reached between the Research and Technology Ministry (BMFT) of the former West Germany and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) regarding Japan's participation in the D-2 mission. Both parties agreed that it was beneficial to both countries to strengthen their mutual cooperation in space fields to expand the industrial utilization of space. This agreement was followed by the establishment of STC in April 1986, with MITI's backing, as a domestic organization to promote Japan's participation in German space experiment programs (the D-2 and D-3 projects). STC was set up with 70 percent of the capital supplied by MITI and the 30-percent balance, 5 percent each, shouldered by six private companies, i.e., Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries, Toshiba, NEC, Hitachi, Fujitsu, and Mitsubishi Electric. STC was originally established to engage in the research and development of compound semiconductor materials under microgravity conditions. To date, approximately 30 STC researchers have been engaged in R&D at its labs set up within the research centers of these companies. STC was originally scheduled to participate in both the D-2 space lab mission, scheduled to be carried out in 1988, and the D-3 mission, scheduled to be implemented in 1991. However, the Challenger accident forced the United States to drastically change the space shuttle program, and this prompted the Department of Defense (DOD) to include the expendable launch vehicle (ELV) as a payload. The schedule for the resumption of the space shuttle launch program, announced in late 1986, set the launch of the D-2 mission space lab for 1991, three years after the original launch schedule. This delay forced STC to thoroughly review its space research plan. As a result, our corporation decided to continue research under a microgravity environment by using small rockets and the free-fall tower, both of which were available for obtaining microgravity conditions. On the German side, on the other hand, BMFT designated Intospace as the establishment in charge of accepting applications from private German companies, as well as from foreign companies, for participating in the D-series missions. STC signed a new contract with Intospace for the Japanese corporation's participation in the D-2 mission (Figure 1 [not reproduced]). The negotiations for STC's participation took time because the German side had failed to determine the fees that private companies participating in the D-2 project were required to pay. The German side had no time to determine the fees because it was preoccupied with the preparations for establishing DARA. An agreement between the two countries was ultimately reached. The agreement required the private participants to pay mission costs by taking into account the weight, energy consumed, and the length of use of the experimental resources by the researchers of the participating establishments. In addition to these mission costs, the costs for creating the cartridges and for conducting the preparatory experiments on the ground in Germany came to an unexpectedly high level. Access to D-2 Mission When STC was set up, each of the labs located within the research centers of the investing companies drew up proposals on the kind of experiments that should be conducted when STC participated in the D-2 mission. The following are the proposals put forth by these labs. - Lab No. 1 (Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries): Growth of a PbSnTe crystal using the Bridgeman technique - Lab No. 2 (Toshiba): Growth of compound semiconductor crystals involving the use of several material systems - Lab No. 3 (NEC): Research on the fluid state of materials for growing crystals - Lab No. 4 (Hitachi): GaAs/Ge heterojunction - Lab No. 5 (Fujitsu): Growth of a GaAs/Ge crystal from the melted fluid state - Lab No. 6 (Mitsubishi Electric): Epitaxial growth of InP These proposals came when information on the experimental systems to be used in the D-2 mission was still scarce. Therefore, this caused these proposals to be reviewed later by taking into account the results of the preparatory experiments conducted on the ground and the characteristics of the experimental systems to be used aboard the space lab. The review was made in a series of systematized meetings at which STC researchers, engineers in charge of the experimental systems from Germany and France, D-2 mission officials from Germany, and the German contractors participated. They exchanged candid opinions on technological matters. It was not easy to reach an agreement because of conflicts in the policies and the method of dividing the mission costs among the participants. The quadripartite meeting was held a total of six times, i.e., in Hanover (Intospace), Koln (DLR), Bremen (ERNO), Friedrichshafen (Dornier), Toulouse (CNES), and Tokyo (STC). These meetings were very useful in promoting mutual understanding, as well as the project, by grasping the actual situation surrounding the preparations being made for launching the space lab (Photo 2 [not reproduced]). When STC was established, the investing companies intended to conduct one experiment each, for a total of six separate experiments in the D-2 mission. However, they failed to coordinate these experiments because of lack of information about how long they could use what kind of experimental hardware and how much their experiments would cost. Therefore, efforts were made to coordinate and reach an agreement with respect to the mission costs at the quadripartite meetings. For the D-2 mission, four types of furnaces were available--a temperature-gradient furnace (CNES), a uniform temperature furnace (ERNO), a fast-cooling furnace (Dornier), and a mirror furnace (ERNO). STC held discussions with engineers from these furnace manufacturers to ascertain if the furnaces could be used to conduct the experiments put forth by these six Japanese labs. First, Lab No. 3 submitted the specifications for the system for conducting an experiment involving the measurement of the thermal conductivity of molten semiconductor materials under microgravity conditions. The D-2 project was designed to allow manned space experiments employing mostly general-purpose experiment systems to be conducted. Because of this, it was almost impossible technologically to modify the systems to meet the specifications required by Lab No. 3. Therefore, the quadripartite meeting concluded that the lab's experiment should be conducted by launching small rockets mounted with experiment systems specifically designed for the lab's experiment. Following this conclusion, Lab No. 3 decided not to participate in the D-2 project. The superiority of CNES's temperature-gradient furnace made many participating establishments want to use the furnace for conducting their experiments. This furnace made it possible to use larger specimens than did the other available furnaces, and it also made it possible to provide heat treatment to three specimens simultaneously under the same conditions. Considering the necessity for all these furnaces to be used uniformly, the popularity of the French-made furnace posed a problem. Other labs restudied their experiment themes so that the experiments could be conducted in the D-2 mission. Lab No. 2 decided to conduct an experiment involving the diffusion of impurities within the melted fluid of a material using the uniform heating furnace. On the other hand, Lab No. 5 decided to carry out the growth of a crystal from the melted fluid of a material using the uniform heating furnace in a slow cooling mode. Lab No. 6 submitted a request to use the temperature-gradient furnace to conduct its experiment to realize the crystal gas-phase growth of a material. However, the mission manager recommended that the lab use the mirror furnace, and the engineers from the mirror furnace company ascertained that the furnace had the specifications that would satisfy the requirements put forth by the lab. However, the lab insisted on using the temperature-gradient furnace, and the Japanese request was ultimately met. As the experiment by Lab No. 1 progressed on the ground, it became clear that the growth of a good PbSnTe crystal could not be obtained unless it was carried out by controlling the temperature gradient very accurately over several dozen hours. Thus, the lab determined that the CNES's temperature-gradient furnace was not suitable, and withdrew from the D-2 mission. Instead, the lab decided to conduct its experiment by launching small rockets (TEXUS). Originally, Lab No. 4 intended to conduct material experiments by launching many small rockets on its own without relying on the D-2 project in view of the cost advantage and for other research-related reasons. However, taking into consideration the agreement between Japan and Germany regarding the former's participation in the D-2 mission, the lab finally decided to conduct its experiment using the steep-cooling furnace designed to be used in the D-2 mission. Finally, STC decided to conduct the four labs' experiments involving nine separate specimens in the D-2 mission. However, the extension of space shuttle's flight by one day made the Japanese corporation conduct more experiments involving the unexpectedly larger number of 13 specimens thanks to Germany's largesse. Of the research conducted by STC, research results have been detailed in the July 1987, July 1988, August 1989, and August 1990 issues of KIKAI SHINKO. Therefore, the author will refrain from elaborating further on STC's research in this report. Lesson Learned from Participating in International Project The D-2 project was planned and carried out based on the experiences and results of the D-1 project. However, the D-2 project was the first D-series project in which private companies, including STC from Japan, were to participate. This caused much time to be consumed during the preparatory stages in order to determine the mission costs that these companies would be required to shoulder. The original estimate of the costs which STC would be required to pay was far higher than STC was prepared to pay. This made STC, an organization which was set up with a limited budget for financing its operation, take much time and effort in narrowing the gap. However, thanks to the cooperation from the Japan Key Technology Center, a compromise was struck between the STC's budget for the D-2 project, which was totally dependent on the government's ceiling-limited yearly budgetary allocation, and the D-2 mission costs that had increased substantially from the original estimate due to the delay in the launch schedule. By experiencing these difficulties, we have learned the importance of nurturing a good relationship based on mutual trust among the project partners for the success of the joint project. We have also learned the importance of having a direct exchange of opinions among the scientists and engineers involved in the project with respect to the data obtained through the ground experiments by having the experiment systems used at hand. We traveled to Germany a number of times, the expenses for which were covered by our limited research budget. However, the author thinks that the travel expenses were worth spending in that they promoted communications with the German side. Through these experiences we have had in our efforts to carry out the D-2 project, we have learned (1) that the characteristics of experiment systems change greatly depending on the conditions of the specimens used, (2) that the effects of these changes can be reduced by the use of optional systems or through software modification, and (3) that it is important to ascertain a system's limitations at the earliest-possible stage of the experiment. We have also found that the researchers who are equipped with insufficient data for preparatory experiments tend to make the requirements too stringent. The availability of a coordinator well versed in both the experiment systems and the experiments conducted using these systems ensures that a project will progress smoothly. In the course of our efforts to promote the D-2 project, we have experienced many instances of awkwardness resulting from the cultural differences between the two countries. One example of this is that we have seen the mission officials from German governmental establishments and the officials from the private sector having vigorous and candid discussions on matters concerning the D-2 project. In Japan, such heated exchanges of opinion do not occur between the government and the private sector. Another example was that in German documents, that were thought to have been prepared with the utmost care, we found proofreading errors in passages referring to thermocouples. In addition, there were many problems which German researchers did not notice and which had to be pointed out by us. These problems included the loss of reproducibility of data when specimens were changed. There were many occasions in which we were misunderstood by the people we contacted in the United States and Europe. These misunderstandings were traced mainly to the Japanese penchant for valuing the proverb "Action speaks louder than words." By carrying out the D-2 project together, we have been able to further our mutual understanding with German engineers and scientists. At the same time, we have recognized that carrying out an international project is not as easy as it is generally said to be. Epilogue The specimens we used in the D-2 mission are scheduled to be returned to the research organizations to which they belong within about six weeks of the completion of the mission. These returned specimens will be analyzed and evaluated, with the results to be reported later. STC is grateful that an unexpectedly large number of valuable experiments have been successfully conducted through participation in the D-2 project, i.e., the first large-scale technological cooperation program carried out between Japan and Germany. Representing STC, the author would like to express the company's gratitude to the government departments concerned and to those investing companies for their support and cooperation extended to its research. In order to promote research on the utilization of the space environment, it is important to improve the infrastructure of the domestic space industry and to introduce a system which will make the users support space research more actively. To realize this, the author suggests that research centers, like the Center for Commercial Development of Space (CCDS) in the United States, in which researchers from government establishments, universities, and private industries can conduct R&D jointly, be established. STC's participation in the D-2 project made us more confident of promoting further Japanese-German technological cooperation in the future. The project also contributed to promoting the mutual exchange of scientists and engineers between the two countries. The author concludes this article by hoping that our experiences in the D-2 program will serve as a guide in our continued efforts toward developing space.
