Opening the meeting, Yeltsin pointed out that the old tradition of meetings with heads of the republics is being revived. "We plan to hold such meetings five to seven times a year," he said. "Such a meeting is being held for the first time after the adoption of the Constitution and elections to the Federal Assembly. In the past months a lot of changes have taken place, political stabilization is gaining momentum. The ruinous division of power has been overcome." Yeltsin particularly noted that he "practically has no differences" with the speakers of the Federal Assembly Chambers Ivan Rybkin and Vladimir Shumeyko with whom he has been meeting on a regular basis. Yeltsin said that after adopting the constitution, new federative relations started to form. Out of 88 subjects of the Federation, the elections took place and "were registered" in 61, and 17 subjects did not gather the necessary number of votes. Yeltsin expressed hope that elections to local bodies will be fully completed this year. Then a full balance of powers will be established, the president noted.
