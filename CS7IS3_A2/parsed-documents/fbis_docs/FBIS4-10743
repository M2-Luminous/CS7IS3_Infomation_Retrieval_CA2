(EL ESPECTADOR, 27 Mar) During a Liberal Party gathering in Rionegro, Antioquia, on 25 March Samper announced that the party's renewal would be based on five pillars: modernization, democratization, participation, institutionalization, and moralization. Samper said he was pleased with the enthusiastic response to his "Alliance for Colombia" proposal and said that some members of the rival Conservative Party see in it the possibility of transforming their own party into one which is "less dynastic, more democratic, and more concerned about social aspects of Colombia's future," according to EL ESPECTADOR (26 Mar). Samper and the party's new secretary general, Pedro Gomez Barrero, announced the names of those who will serve on various party committees. These include an ethics tribunal which will work in coordination with campaign ethics director Jorge Valencia; the committee for the renewal of Liberalism which will be headed by Samper's running mate Humberto de la Calle, with Pedro Gomez and national campaign director Fernando Botero acting as coordinators, and additional members to include six women, seven youth representatives, and some legislators. Carlos Lleras de la Fuente, David Turbay, Carlos Lemos, and Rodolfo Gonzalez--all of whom competed with Samper for the Liberal Party candidacy--will serve on an advisory committee. In addition, Samper appointed Carlos Lemos, Carlos Lleras de la Fuente, and former acting mayor of Bogota Sonia Duran to help direct his campaign in Bogota. (EL ESPECTADOR, 24, 26 Mar) The candidate has also begun a new publicity campaign which, according to Samper's "image adviser" Rodrigo Pardo, emphasizes the candidate's desire for a "new social policy, since people have been the candidate's primary concern." (EL ESPECTADOR, 24 Mar) New posters are now being circulated which show Samper, his wife Jacquin, and their two sons, standing at the center of a long line of people--representing every social class and age group, as well as different races--in front of a banner displaying Samper's name in huge letters and the slogan "It's the people's time." (EL ESPECTADOR, 24 Mar) Speaking with reporters after launching this new publicity campaign, Samper said the strategy now is to spread that message, according to EL TIEMPO (24 Mar). Another version of the poster, symbolizing Samper's support for women's rights, shows Samper's wife with an all female group. Pastrana Warns About Political Influence of "External Forces" In a letter to Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff, Conservative Party presidential candidate Andres Pastrana expressed his "tremendous concern" about the "recent invasion into politics, in a brazen manner, of external forces and dealings" which he likened to "the first stages of drug trafficking in symbiosis with sectors of politics," according to the 25 March EL TIEMPO. In a likely reference to his rival Samper, Pastrana began his letter by stating that at the start of the presidential campaign, he had "found a candidate and his political director to be running contrary to the idea of making morality and scrupulosity a campaign issue, openly discussed before the people of the country." He went on to warn that, the "invasion" of "contraband mafias" not only "corrodes the moral fiber of politics," but makes a "mockery" of tax-paying citizens. He declared that "contraband" is the "antithesis and number one enemy" of countries seeking to strengthen ties to the rest of the world and develop competitive industries, adding that Colombia "cannot be complacent in the face of this contraband." Pastrana ended the letter with an appeal to De Greiff to investigate the matter. Reaction to Vice-Presidential Selections In a 20 March editorial, Liberal Party oriented EL TIEMPO expressed enthusiasm about Ernesto Samper's selection of Humberto De la Calle as his running mate, saying that De la Calle's performance as Minister of Government under Gaviria had earned him the right to be considered "a big player in the Liberal Party's future." The paper also solicited reaction to each candidate's vice-presidential selection from the opposing candidate's campaign director and from senators of both parties. Samper campaign director Fernando Botero described Pastrana's selection of Luis Fernando Ramirez--a member of Pastrana's own New Democratic Force faction of the Conservative Party--as the "last nail in the coffin" for Pastrana's effort to present his candidacy as one that "transcends political parties," according to EL TIEMPO (23 Mar). Pastrana campaign director Luis Alberto Moreno said the big difference between the Liberal and Conservative tickets is the importance each places on honoring its word. Moreno noted that Humberto De la Calle went from being Samper's most ardent critic to serving as his running mate, and cited numerous quotes from De la Calle's campaign speeches which criticize Samper's proposals and accuse him of changing his views to suit public opinion. In addition, noted Moreno, De la Calle declared on numerous occasions that he would not accept the vice-presidential slot "for any reason." In the end, however, De la Calle "went back on his word and surrendered his principles," according to Moreno. In contrast to Samper and De la Calle, Moreno observed, Pastrana and Ramirez are "men of their word." He noted that, while mayor of Bogota, Pastrana kept his promises and later, as a senator, supported President Gaviria during difficult periods in his administation. Ramirez, Gaviria's former Labor Minister, was committed to pushing forward with social security reform despite the fact that Congress "was asking for his head," according to Moreno. Liberal Party Senator Victor Renan Barco praised De la Calle's intellect and experience, describing him as "right on target" as a vice-presidential choice. In contrast, he described Ramirez as a "technocrat," noting that while he views Ramirez as someone who would appeal to those in central banking and national planning circles, he doubts that his appeal will be universal among Conservative voters. Conservative Senator Fabio Valencia Cossio said the Pastrana-Ramirez ticket seeks to present an image of change, adding that Ramirez has proven himself as a public servant and is identified with some existing programs. Valencia said Samper's choice of De la Calle was based strictly on party affiliation and gives the impression that it was done to avoid division in the party (EL TIEMPO, 23 Mar).
