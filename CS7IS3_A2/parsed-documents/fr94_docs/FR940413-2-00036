FR940413-2-00036 FR940413-2-00023 B. State of Missouri On September 17, 1993, Missouri submitted an application for adequacy determination for Missouri's municipal solid waste landfill permit program. On November 19, 1993, EPA published a tentative determination of adequacy for all portions of Missouri's program. Further background on the tentative determination of adequacy appears at 58 FR 61090 (November 19, 1993). Along with the tentative determination, EPA announced the availability of the application for public comment and the date of a public hearing on the application. The public hearing was held on January 4, 1994. Additionally, Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MDNR), Solid Waste Program provided a public availability session immediately following that public hearing to discuss issues relating to specific sites and enforcement actions. The EPA received the following comments on its tentative determination of full program adequacy for Missouri's MSWLF permit program. Several comments not directly relating to the program adequacy tentative determination, e.g., those relating to a specific facility and enforcement action by MDNR, were deferred to MDNR's public availability session that followed the public hearing. EPA's response to the comments relating to the tentative determination follows each comment below: One commenter asked if the STIR had been finalized. EPA response: EPA is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation Rule that will provide procedures by which the EPA will approve, or partially approve, State/Tribal landfill permit programs. The STIR is currently used as a guidance document by states, tribes and the EPA regions in interpreting and complying with the requirements of 40 CFR part 258. One commenter asked how changes in the federal regulations will impact an approved state. EPA response: The states will be provided a mechanism and time frames for upgrading their programs to comply with federal regulations. Another commenter asked how changes in an approved state's regulations will impact the state's approval. EPA response: A state that changes its regulations and becomes more stringent is required under the Memorandum or Agreement that is part of the application, to keep EPA's regional office informed. A state that enacts less stringent requirements may endanger its approval or partial approval. One commenter asked if EPA provides funding to the state under subtitle D. EPA response: EPA provides funding for certain training and demonstration grants. However, these funds may not be expended for staff salaries or costs to operate the state agency's basic permit program. One commenter asserted that the state has traditionally been responsive to the environmental needs under the regulations and has been in the forefront as far as staying in step with technology. For example, liquids and hazardous wastes were banned from Missouri solid waste landfills before it became a federal requirement and therefore the contaminant levels in leachate produced by Missouri landfills are less than in other states. EPA response: EPA is aware that Missouri imposed this requirement before it was required by the federal regulations. EPA's approval of MDNR's program is not intended to prevent the state from taking advantage of technological advancements or imposing more stringent requirements. One commenter asked, with regard to the MDNR inspection and enforcement program, when offenses are committed over and over again for a particular facility why the offender is given repeated chances to comply and not considered an habitual violator. EPA response: EPA deferred this response to the MDNR staff at the hearing, who stated that under the state of Missouri's rules a landfill operator must have some sort of formal enforcement action, e.g., abatement order or court order, taken against it before they would be classified an habitual violator. Additionally, EPA responded that the application by the state described the requisite elements of an inspection and compliance program that are required for state program approval. One commenter asked what sort of activity warrants formal enforcement action. EPA response: EPA deferred this response to MDNR staff who were present at the public hearing, who stated that when an owner/operator has significant ongoing violations which it refuses to address at the site, it is at this point that formal enforcement action begins.
