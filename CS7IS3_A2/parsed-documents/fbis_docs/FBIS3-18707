The President of the Board of Trade, who failed in his challenge for the leadership in 1990 after toppling Lady Thatcher, sought to dampen recent speculation about his own rekindled ambitions in a lengthy BBC radio interview. It coincided with an attempt by Mr Michael Howard, the Home Secretary and a leading Cabinet Rightwinger, to bolster Mr Major's position and implicitly challenge Mr Heseltine's credentials as a potential Prime Minister on grounds of age. "I want John Major to be Prime Minister for a very long time," Mr Howard said. "I believe he will be Prime Minister for a long time, and when the time comes for him to hand over to someone else, I do not think it will be to an older man." As Mr Major is 50, this would rule out Mr Heseltme, 60, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor, who is 53, and Mr Howard himself. Asked on BBC television's "Breakfast With Frost" whether he would like to be Prime Minister, Mr Howard, 52, replied: "I have given my answer. When John Major gives up, he won't be handing over to an older man." Mr Heseltine was asked on BBC Radio's "The World this Weekend" whether he was ruling out contesting the leadership. He sald: "I am telling you quite categorically that I believe John Major will remain in place. I am not prepared to be involved in any speculation about my own position because I intend to go on helping him win the political battles that the Conservatives have to fight. I believe he will do that and lead us to victory at the next election. ``I do not think there is any question of there being a vacancy and I don't think there is any profit in analysing what would happen if there was. My position is clear. John Major has entrusted me with one of the jobs I most wanted. I will do it to the best of my ability, because I believe Britain has a very exciting opportunity.'' He added: "I have made it quite clear that my role in history is creating rather a good garden. That is where I have spent the morning." However, Mr Heseltine was careful to avoid any definitive statement on his own position should a vacancy arise. He has made a good recovery from the heart attack that seemed to have put paid to his career last summer, and there are many in the party who would turn to him if the Tories needed a new leader. Although he is privately irritated about the renewed gossip at Westminster about his ambitions, Mr Heseltine's supporters believe he would be ill-advised to rule himself out at the start of a year which is certain to see renewed pressure on Mr Major if the Tories perform disastrously in the local authority and European Parliament elections. The re-emergence of Mr Heseltine as a serious contender for the leadership following his performance at the Scott inquiry last week has sufficiently alarmed his detractors to prompt reports of a "Stop Michael" campaign gathering ground at Westminster. Some MPs are suggesting he should be appointed party chairman after the European elections in June, in which the Conservatives could lose up to a dozen seats. They argue this would exploit Mr Heseltine's political talents to the full while "lashing him to the mast" of Mr Major's leadership . There have also been signs that Mr Heseltine has been trying to make himself more acceptable to the party Right, especially over Europe. In a speech last week he was critical of the "Eurosclerosis" in Brussels over the implementation of the European single market. "My preoccupation is to help, in every way I can, the Prime Minister's determination that, in being at the heart of Europe, we shall influence the thinking of Europe in a way that will make Europe more competitive and richer and therefore make Britain better off," he said yesterday. The Tory approach to Europe in this June's elections will try to chart a course through the divisions in the party. However, Sir Edward Heath, the former Prime Minister, said it would be a "serious mistake" if the views of the "Euro-sceptics" held sway. The sceptics would not be satisfied with anything less than the break-up of the whole thing, he said on ITV's Walden programme.
