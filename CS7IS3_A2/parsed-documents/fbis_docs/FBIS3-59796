Looks for Exporters of Heavy Water for ATR 94FE0022C Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 28 Sep 93 p 13 --FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 94FE0022C Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:CSO [Text] The Electric Power Development Company (EPDC) has begun looking into exporters of heavy water for the demonstration advanced thermal reactor (ATR), which is in the planning stage in Oma-machi, Aomori Prefecture. Unlike the light water reactor used by the electric power companies, heavy water is used as a neutron modifier in the ATR. There is little merit to producing heavy water domestically because the ATR is almost the only way it is used in Japan. That is why a reliable exporter must be ensured. EPDC's survey probably will cover Canada and China. The value of the commercial transaction will be in the order of ¥10 billion, and will contribute to increased international procurement by the electric power industry. EPDC plans to begin construction of the demonstration ATR in Oma-machi in 1996, and begin operation in 2002, and it will load deuterium as a modifier 2 years before the start of operation. Once 350 tons are loaded initially, only a small amount per year will be needed as supplements. For the prototype ATR ``Fugen,'' which is being operated by the Power Reactor and Nuclear Development Corporation in Tsuruga City, Fukui Prefecture, heavy water was purchased from Norway, the former West Germany and China. Canada, China, Norway and Germany have put in bids for EPDC's heavy water contract. Canada was considered the strongest candidate because it has a large heavy water production facility. It is used by the CANDU heavy water reactor, which was developed independently by Canada. There is talk, however, that the heavy water plant will be closed when the Darlinton Number 4 plant (Ontario Province) is completed and the current project is concluded. That is why candidates other than Canada must be considered. China has said that it has heavy water manufacturing equipment for its nuclear weapon development program and it can supply Japan with heavy water in 10 - 100 ton units. It could provide the amount needed for the ATR over a period of several years. The difficulty with Norway and Germany is that their supplying capability is even less than that of China. India, which incorporated Canada's CANDU reactor technology, also has a heavy water manufacturing facility, but it is not considered reliable enough at this time. A few years ago, the price of heavy water was ¥10,000 to ¥30,000 per liter. Recently, however, this has dropped to ¥2,000 to ¥5,000, when the effect of the high yen is factored in. The heavy water for the initial loading of the ATR alone will be a million yen transaction. EPDC will be watching trends in the yen exchange rate as it negotiates a procurement contract.
