Sun Guangdi, chief engineer for nuclear power for the China National Nuclear Corp (CNNC), said some foreign businesses have shown interest in financing new nuclear power plants. As a showcase of what Sino-foreign co-operation can accomplish, CNNC officials cite the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant in Guangdong Province, the country's first joint venture in this field. Sun said many provinces are eager to build more plants, but developing nuclear power is hindered by the shortage of capital. Some provinces -- such as Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Fujian, Shandong and Hainan -- are actively looking for sites and conducting feasibility studies of nuclear power plants. All these provinces are in South and East China and suffer severe shortages of electricity. "The market for nuclear electricity is potentially vast, and with advanced nuclear technology we have the ability to develop nuclear power," Sun said. Encouraged by the safe and efficient operation of the country's first two nuclear power stations, in Qinshan, Zhejiang, and at Daya Bay in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, China is stepping up work on other plants. Second-phase construction has already begun at the Qinshan plant to install two 600,000-kilowatt generators, Sun said. A planned third phase would expand total capacity to 3 million kilowatts. The capital for the project came from the State and from Shanghai Zhejiang, Jiangxi and Anhui, which use the plant's electricity. China also plans to build another nuclear plant in Guangdong and one in Liaoning Province. The new plant in Guangdong will be located at Lingao, north of Daya Bay. The plant will house two 900,000-kilowatt generators, and construction is due to be completed in 2002. Part of the capital for the project will come from the profits of Daya Bay, whose No 1 Generator went into commercial operation on February 6. Its No 2 Generator is expected to begin operating commercially in May or June. The Liaoning plant will be located at Wafangdian near Bohai Bay and will have two Russian generators, each with a capacity of 1 million kilowatts. Sun said designing of the plant has already begun. "With power shortages becoming increasingly severe in China," Sun said "nuclear power is a safe, economical and clean way for the country to resolve its difficulties." However, Sun said, China got a late start in nuclear power and must make big strides to catch up with other countries. Nuclear power accounted for only 0.3 per cent of the country's total electricity output last year, compared with 78 per cent in France, 43 per cent in South Korea and 27.7 per cent in Japan. China's two nuclear plants generated 2.49 billion kilowatts last year and the figure this year is expected to climb to 8 billion to 10 billion kilowatts. In addition, China is negotiating to build a nuclear power plant in Iran with two 300,000-kilowatt generators. Sun said that construction is in full swing on the Chashima Nuclear Power Plant in Pakistan, one of China's biggest assistance projects in a Third World country.
