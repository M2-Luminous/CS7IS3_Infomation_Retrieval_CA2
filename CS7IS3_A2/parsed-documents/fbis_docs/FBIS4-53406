FBIS4-53406 "dreas097_c_94008" FBIS-EAS-94-097 Daily Report 19 May 1994 North Korea Chongnyon Sends Appeal on Japanese `Persecution' Chongnyon Sends Appeal on Japanese `Persecution' SK1905052794 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0459 GMT 19 May 94 SK1905052794 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Tokyo, May 17 [dateline as received] (KNS-KCNA) -- Han Tok-su, chairman of the Central Standing Committee of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon), sent to international organisations, peace, democratic and solidarity organisations and prominent figures of many countries around the world an appeal for a solidarity movement to force the Japanese authorities to stop persecuting and suppressing Chongnyon and Korean nationals in Japan. The appeal recalls that persecution and suppression of Koreans is openly committed in Japan and on the 25th of April the Japanese police searched the Osaka Prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon and its branch offices by letting loose scores of riot police vehicles and more than 1,300 policement. The appeal says: "It must not go unnoticed that the Japanese authorities are trying to justify their massive arms buildup by spreading rumors about `threat from North Korea' through all the propaganda machines and media and, furthermore, to pave the way for a comeback to the Korean peninsula and Asia by enacting a 'security emergency law' and forcing constitution revision at any cost. "The Japanese authorities, far from deeply repenting of, and apologizing and compensating for the colonial domination over Korea and the past crimes against the Korean people, are persecuting the Koreans in Japan, the direct victims of the colonial domination, and savagely suppressing the Chongnyon organisation that speaks for their democratic national rights under the groundless pretext. We sternly denounce this, branding it as one more crime against humanitarianism." "In view of the grave situation today, we appeal to our friends worldwide who love justice and peace to launch a solidarity movement protesting the unpardonable persecution and suppression of Chongnyon and Korean nationals in Japan by the Japanese authorities and calling for its immediate halt."
