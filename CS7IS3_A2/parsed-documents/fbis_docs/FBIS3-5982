The assembly on Wednesday began a six-day meeting during which members will debate legal amendments approved recently by Cabinet, including a proposal to allow the setting up of an industrial estate. A senior Laotian official said yesterday the proposed amendments would provide more incentives for foreign investors in Laos, mostly Thais. Proposed changes included allowing businessmen longer tenure on rented land. "Businessmen are authorized to transfer the rental right to a third party -- which is not provided for in the present foreign investment law," he said. Businesses would not need to try to buy the land, because the lease period would be for up to 99 years, more than adequate for business planning. The amendments would also provide more protection for foreign investors. It is proposed to establish an industrial estate, partly because Laotian authorities are understaffed and already hard-pressed to monitor the 40-odd foreign industries already operating in Laos. "To have them in the same location will make our work easier and will also be to their advantage as the government will certainly develop necessary infrastructure and facilities in the estate," he said. The first industrial estate is expected to be developed about 30 kilometers north of Vientiane, on the way to Nam Ngum dam, if President Nouhak Phoumsavan announces approval. The official said the planned estate will not be located near Vientiane, to avoid polluting the capital. Leuan Sombounkhan, vice president of the committee for planning and co-operation, told THE NATION that tax incentives would be given to businesses which locate in industrial estates. The National Assembly conference is presided over by Saman Vi- gnaket, a member of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party central committee and president of the National Assembly. The opening was attended by Prime Minister Gen. Khamtai Siphandon President Nouhak and other Politburo members, National Assembly members and Cabinet members. In his opening address, Saman told the assembly the world situation could have both favorable and complicated effects on national development and security. "The world's people, especially those of developing and less- developed countries, struggle to safeguard their political independence while focusing efforts on socio-economic development to improve living conditions," the official quoted Saman as saying. In Southeast Asia the emerging trend was towards peace, stability and co-operation between nations, which would facilitate national development.
