He also declared himself satisfied after his Thursday meeting with the head of state and praised "President Carlos Salinas' determination to resolve the crisis through dialogue rather than force." Fully accepting the official line of the Mexican authorities, which is challenged by a majority of the country's political class, Juppe said that the violent incidents which have racked the Chiapas state since 1 January were "outbursts which affect four towns" on the Guatemala border. "I may be wrong in my analysis," he said, "but I do not think we should blow out of proportion (a local issue) that does not affect the whole country." Meanwhile, the Mexican Army seems to be taking more seriously risks of the conflict spreading to the Federation's other states, since it has asked several foreign governments, including France, to help it fight terrorism after several bombs exploded in a number of cities, including the capital. According to a source directly involved in the talks, Mexico's Defense Ministry wishes to obtain training support for personnel specializing in the neutralization of explosive devices. France, which -- apart from a few Ecureuil marine patrol helicopters supplied last year to the Navy -- has not sold any military equipment to Mexico since 1984 (Sagaie wheeled armored vehicles and Panhard light armored vehicles, currently in use in the Chiapas conflict), has yet to answer Mexico's request for help with mine clearance. Insisting on Mexico's achievements with respect to inflation reduction (less than 10 percent in 1993 compared with 159 percent in 1987), deficit cutting, and renegotiation of the external debt -- which should let the country become soon an "active member" of the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development), among others thanks to France's support -- Mr. Juppe concluded that "economic recovery has not solved every social issue, but it remains essential in order `to avoid'" explosions such as the Chiapas rebellion. According to Juppe, the Chiapas conflict should affect neither foreign investments in Mexico (France is the fifth foreign investor in Mexico with nearly Fr9 billion and 228 firms, behind the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan) nor foreign trade, which is largely dominated by the United States (70 percent of Mexico's trade involves its northern neighbor, compared with a little over 2 percent for France). Mr. Juppe judged that "French firms understand they could benefit" from the free trade agreement in force since 1 January between Mexico, the United States, and Canada, provided the three partners "do not pass legislation that discriminates against third- party countries." One of the topics he discussed with Mexican authorities -- he met with Finance Minister Pedro Aspe -- had to do with supporting French investment in sectors such as environmental protection (liquid waste reprocessing) and public transportation, especially with respect to equipment for a 10th subway line currently under construction.
