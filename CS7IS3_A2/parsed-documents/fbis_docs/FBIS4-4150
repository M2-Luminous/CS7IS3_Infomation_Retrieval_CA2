At a press conference given jointly by Christopher and Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat following their meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa, Christopher pointed out that the two sides are proceeding on the road of reaching an agreement on the implementation of the PLO-Israeli peace accord. The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Israel signed the peace accord in Washington on last September 13, which provides for Palestinian autonomy in the occupied obt bank's [as received] Jericho area. Christopher said this was a chance "for the people of Gaza and Jericho to experience for the first time an opportunity to manage their own lives, something comparable to the thrilling experience we're seeing today in South Africa." He underlined the need to end this phase and start implementing the peace accord. Those who want to hinder the peace process will have no better alternatives, he added. Christopher said that during his meeting with 'Arafat he found a common ground to move forward. He said progress in the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks has been furthered by the arrival Wednesday [27 April] of the first batch of the cars offered as a grant by the U.S. to the Palestinian police. The cars are only part of the assistance pledged by donor countries to the Palestinians, he added. Christopher reiterated the importance of further moving forward. He said he was heartened by the reports he had received from the peace negotiating parties over the past six months. The U.S. official affirmed his country's keenness on encouraging all parties to move on toward a more advanced stage. 'Arafat said he hoped that an agreement would be reached within an overall settlement of the Middle East dispute on all tracks. "We hope to overcome the obstacles still hindering reaching a Palestinian-Israeli agreement," he added. 'Arafat emphasized that the Palestinians are well prepared to sign an agreement on enforcing the PLO-Israeli peace accord as soon as the obstacles are eliminated.
