Tugay Ulucevik, Turkish Foreign Ministry deputy under secretary; and Ertugrul Atakan, Turkish Foreign Ministry deputy director general of Cypriot and Greek affairs; today visited Prime Minister Atun; Ozker Ozgur, state minister and deputy prime minister; and Atay Ahmet Rasit, foreign affairs and defense minister. In a speech during his meeting with the Turkish delegation, Prime Minister Atun said the coalition government views the Cyprus problem as the priority issue before it. However, he said, we are determined to defend the rights of the people vigorously while tackling the issue. Tugay Ulucevik briefed the prime minister on Turkey's role and attitude in the current stage of the Cyprus problem. Ulucevik pointed out that there was a slowdown in efforts to reach a solution to the problem due to the early general elections. He said the international community expects the Cyprus problem to be tackled now that the new government received a vote of confidence, adding that the confidence-building measures are now on the agenda. As always, he stressed, Turkey wants the decision to be reached in Cyprus. The Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot people will make their own decisions regarding this issue, he added. Ulucevik stated that for a decision to be reached, the method of free negotiations is essential. That is what Turkey believes, he said. Ulucevik pointed out that even though it is up to the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus to decide on the confidence-building measures, in principle, Turkey has always looked positively at the idea that the two communities should take confidence-building measures. In principle, he added, Turkey supports this issue. Ulucevik said that in the coming days, the search for a solution will focus on this issue between the two communities. Naturally, the decision will be made by the Turkish Cypriot Government, he said. Speaking at his meeting with Ulucevik and Atakan, Ozker Ozgur, state minister and deputy prime minister, said he has always been in favor of a solution of the Cyprus problem, which has been going on for the past 30 years. The world expects this problem to be resolved, he said. Ozgur pointed out that he shares Ulucevik's views on the Cyprus problem. He said: The coalition government has a positive approach to the solution of the Cyprus problem as soon as possible. There is a confidence crisis between the two communities created during the past 30 years. The coalition government will do all it can to eliminate this. Our government wants an acceptable solution.
