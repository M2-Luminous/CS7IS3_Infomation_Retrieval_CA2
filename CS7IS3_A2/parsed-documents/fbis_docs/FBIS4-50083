FBIS4-50083 "drchi093_o_94001" FBIS-CHI-94-093 Daily Report 24 Apr 1994 REGIONAL AFFAIRS East Region Fujian Procuratorate Report for 1993 Fujian Procuratorate Report for 1993 HK1305105394 Fuzhou FUJIAN RIBAO in Chinese 24 Apr 94 p 5 HK1305105394 Fuzhou FUJIAN RIBAO Chinese BFN [Report by Zheng Yizheng (6774 5030 2973), chief procurator of the Fujian Provincial People's Procuratorate, to the Second Session of the Eighth Fujian Provincial People's Congress on 14 April 1994: "Work Report of the Fujian Provincial People's Procuratorate" [Text] People's Deputies: I am now going to deliver a report to this congress on the main facts about the procuratorial work in 1993 and the main tasks for the procuratorate in 1994 for your deliberation. In the past year, the provincial procuratorial organs at all levels, under the leadership of the party committees and under the supervision of the people's congresses at the same levels, conscientiously implemented the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; carried out the guideline of "strictly enforcing the laws and effectively handling cases" in procuratorial work as a whole according to the spirit and the resolution from the First Session of the Eighth Provincial People's Congress; intensified the legal supervisory function; made new progress in all fields of procuratorial work; and made positive contributions to maintaining political and social stability and guaranteeing the smooth development of reform, opening, and economic construction in this province. I. Concentrate Strength on Handling Major and Serious Corruption and Bribery Cases Last year, especially after Comrade Jiang Zemin's important speech at the second meeting of the CPC Central Discipline Inspection Commission last August, the procuratorial organs at all levels resolutely carried out the tasks laid down by the party central leadership and by the provincial party committee; vigorously carried out an anticorruption struggle; adopted a series of measures to crack down on crime more effectively; handled a number of major and serious criminal cases, including corruption and bribery cases; and achieved new results in their work. The procuratorial organs throughout the province placed a total of 1,876 corruption, bribery, and other criminal cases on file for investigation and prosecution. Of these, 1,119 were major cases involving over 10,000 yuan, an increase of 34.5 percent; cases involving between 100,000 and 500,000 yuan numbered 114; cases involving between 500,000 and 1 million yuan numbered 22; cases involving over 1 million yuan numbered 13; and cases involving lawbreaking by cadres at and above the county and bureau level numbered 52, an increase of 370 percent. The number of major and serious cases accounted for 62.4 percent of the total cases placed on file for investigation and prosecution, a recorrd high. By the end of last year, the investigation of 1,522 cases had been concluded and involved 1,786 people to be prosecuted. Apart from those still undergoing investigation for prosecution, and those exempt from prosecution because of the petty nature of their crimes, prosecutions against 770 people were brought to the courts. Through handling these cases, 75.31 million yuan's worth of direct economic losses caused to the state and the collectives were recovered. Last year's anticorruption struggle and the actions of meting out punishment to those involved in such crimes as corruption and bribery had the following characteristics: 1. Strength was concentrated on handling major and serious cases and a number of economic criminal cases involving huge amounts of money were solved. For example, Zhang Jianping, head of the first section of the Provincial Foreign Trade Center Group Minerals and Chemicals Department, accepted bribes [tan wu 6304 3064] of more than $2.74 million and more than 640,000 yuan and embezzled [nuo yong 2180 3938] more than $170,000 of public money. This was the most serious corruption case in this province since the founding of the PRC. After a public trial was held, the court sentenced Zhang Jianping to death. In another case, Zeng Huiyang, a securities dealer with the Trust and Investment Company of the Construction Bank of Fujian Province, accepted bribes of 560,000 yuan and embezzled 4.15 million yuan of public money for illegal stock speculation. After a public trial, the court sentenced Zeng Huiyuan to death with a reprieve. Cadres at the county and bureau level who were involved in the corruption and bribery cases on file for investigation and prosecution numbered 47; and cadres at the provincial departmental level involved in such cases, numbered five. These numbers marked an all-time high. In particular, a major bribery case was cracked in the Min Jiang Hydropower Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Power Industry. Five departmental-level cadres, including bureau chief Zhang Chunbao and bureau party committee secretary Qiao Yanling (both with the rank of full departmental chief) and 10 bureau-level cadres were involved in the case. They demanded and took bribes by taking advantage of their official function in issuing work contracts. This created strong repercussions inside and outside this province. The facts revealed in the course of the investigation of such criminal cases show that if the principal leading cadres in a department are corrupt and degenerate, crimes there will certainly be comparatively serious. Therefore, we always gave priority to the thorough handling of some particularly serious cases among the major cases. 2. Resolute action was taken to handle criminal cases which occurred within the party and government leading organs, the judicial organs, the law enforcement administrative organs, and the economic management organs. Last year, 756 corruption and bribery cases in these four types of organs were investigated and handled. Of these, 126 cases were in party and government leading organs, 180 were in judicial and law-enforcing administrative organs, and 450 cases were in economic management organs. The procuratorate in Nanping Prefecture investigated and handled a major cases involving Qu Awang and Wei Mingjing, director and deputy director of the prefecture's hydropower bureau, who were suspected of abusing their official functions and accepting bribes. The procuratorate in Quanzhou City investigated and handled the major case of Lin Wentao and five other customs officials who were suspected of taking bribes amounting to more than 360,000 yuan and showing favor to smugglers on many occasions by not checking the smuggled goods. Chen Ganming, deputy director of the Yunxiao County Public Security Bureau, extorted and accepted bribes amounting to 34,000 yuan by means of threatening to arrest some people. Chen, whose dastardly behavior aroused strong public indignation, was sentenced to life imprisonment after his trial on the basis of the procuratorial organ's investigation. The handling of these cases was of great significance in maintaining the incorrupt nature of the party and government organs and safeguarding the solemnity of the state laws. 3. The particularly serious smuggling cases involving the law enforcement personnel from some administrative organs were directly investigated and handled according to the relevent law. Last year, in accordance with Article 13 of the "Criminal Procedure Law" and the requirements of the "Circular on Sternly Cracking Down on Smuggling Activities" issued jointly by the Supreme People's Procuratorate and Supreme People's Court, the procuratorial organs directly investigated and handled four particularly serious smuggling cases: In the first case, Fujian Anhua Development Company participated in smuggling 600 sets of motorcycle parts with a total value of 8.36 million yuan. The department concerned confiscated the smuggled goods and imposed a fine on the company but did not transfer the case to the judicial organ to bring the criminal offenders in the case to justice. The provincial procuratorate placed the case on file for investigation and prosecution. The provincial party committee, the provincial government, and the provincial people's congress attached great importance to the handling of this case and strongly supported the procuratorate. After efforts over one and a half months, the investigation was concluded and a public indictment was filed to the court. In the second case, Zhanghai Economic Development Company practiced fraud when importing 10,000 tonnes of steel products in the name of 17 foreign-funded enterprises for their own use and then resold the duty-free goods for 34.7 million yuan, making an illegal profit of 1.8 million yuan. The company thus caused 6.89 million yuan in losses to the state's customs tariff and product tax revenue. The Zhangzhou City Procuratorate placed the case on file for investigation and prosecution and brought those responsible in the case to justice. In the third case, Zhanglong Enterprise Co. Ltd. and Zhangan Labor Service Company collaborated in smuggling 1,000 Hitachi 63-cm color TV sets. The Zhangzhou City Procuratorate has placed the case on file for investigation and prosecution. In the fourth case, 12 people, including the leader and members of an anticontraband team headed by Wang Shaomin, director of the Xiapu County Industrial and Commercial Administrative Bureau, abused their official functions by participating in smuggling 899 cartons of cigarettes worth 2.29 million yuan. The Xiapu County Procuratorate has concluded investigating the case and has conducted a public trial. The procuratorial organs' direct investigation and handling of these smuggling cases played a positive role in checking the participation by institutions in smuggling activities and effectively prompting the law enforcement organs concerned to perform their functions rigorously. 4. Constant efforts were made to rely on the masses in performing professional functions. We cannot do without the people's support in the course of discovering crimes, collecting evidence, and punishing criminal offenders. Last year, the procuratorial organs throughout the province received a total of 15,349 items of information and evidence and 11,921 of these items related to cases currently being handled. More people provided information using their real names and a larger proportion of the information was verifiable. The information provided by ordinary people exposed 69.2 percent of the corruption, bribery, and other criminal cases on file for investigation and prosecution in the procuratorates throughout the province. The procuratorates at all levels adhered to the principle of "being resolute and prudent and verifying all evidence" in the course of investigation and employed all legal means with flexibility to unearth major and serious cases. Last year, the procuratorial organs in Nanping, Longyan, Fuzhou, and Quanzhou successfully collected decisive evidence for 14 extremely serious corruption cases, involving more than 300 suspected lawbreakers and over 7 million yuan in ill-gotten gains. In the course of handling these major cases, 181 related cases were placed on file for investigation and prosecution, of which 102 were major cases and 26 were serious cases. The procuratorial organs also made more effective efforts to round up criminals at large. Last year, 61 economic criminal offenders at large were arrested in this province. Ten of these people were suspects in serious cases involving over 500,000 yuan; four were even suspected in cases involving the huge amount of over 1 million yuan. In addition, 122 people who had committed crimes of corruption surrendered themselves to the procuratorial organs because they were frightened by the power of the laws. 5. Chief procurators took the lead in handling cases.We adopted the work system which required that chief procurators take the lead in handling cases and defined the responsibilities of chief procurators at various levels for handling cases of differing seriousness. The chief procurator of the provincial procuratorate is responsible for handling serious cases involving over 500,000 yuan and major cases involving departmental- level cadres; the chief procurators of the prefectural and city procuratorates are responsible for handling serious cases involving between 100,000 and 500,000 yuan and major cases involving bureau-level cadres; and the chief procurators of the county procuratorates are responsible for handling serious cases involving between 50,000 and 100,000 yuan. Last year, 174 chief procurators and deputy chief procurators personally directed and participated in the investigation of 674 corruption, bribery, and other criminal cases. The chief procurators also personally examined letters and complaints from the masses and discovered a number of important clues in some major cases. In the practice of taking the lead in handling cases, the leaders enhanced their work ability to make decisions in a democratic and scientific way and to control the overall work situation. Last year, the procuratorial organs investigated and handled 286 cases of evading taxes and refusing to pay taxes and 87 cases of counterfeiting trademarks, recovering more than 13 million yuan in direct economic losses to the state and the collectives. The cases being investigated and handled in recent years show that the seriousness and prominent characteristics of the crimes of embezzlement and bribery are reflected in the following facts: First, the criminal cases often involve large amounts of money and the number of major and serious cases is on the increase. Second, an extremely small number of leading cadres abuse the power in their hands in pursuit of private gains, exchange power for money, and commit serious crimes of embezzlement and accepting bribes. Third, a small number of functionaries in the judicial and law enforcement administrative organs were involved to a serious degree in extorting and accepting bribes, bending the law, and other irregularities. Fourth, the incidence of economic crimes increased in some functional departments which play a key role in regulating the market economy and in some active economic sectors. Fifth, there were more criminal activities involving legal persons; in particular, an extremely small number of law enforcement institutions were involved to a serious degree in smuggling activities. Sixth, some new forms of criminal activity appeared in the stock and securities market and in the real estate market. Seventh, economic crimes were committed, in many cases, by people holding concrete power in some specific fields; for example, those committing crimes of embezzlement were often people managing money and those extorting and accepting bribes were often people managing personnel, material, and financial affairs. Eighth, crimes were committed through collaboration between insiders and outsiders and between people from different localities and departments. Ninth, in the departments and localities where irregularities existed to a serious degree, the principal leaders were often corrupt and degenerate and the incidence of crimes was higher. Tenth, many criminal offenders were motivated by their desire to seek physical pleasures, often lavishing their ill-gotten gains on leading a dissipated life, gambling, and visiting prostitutes. In general, the vast majority of party and state officials are working honestly and diligently for the benefit of the general public. However, a small number of seriously corrupt people certainly exists and we should be fully aware of the harm and danger their existence poses. As Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out, if we take such problems lightly and allow evil to spread unchecked, then our party and the people's government will eventually be ruined, as will the great cause of socialist modernization in our country. At present, the situation in the anticorruption struggle is very good and it continues in depth. However, quite a few problems still remain. The main problems are: The leaders of some departments and localities still do not properly understand the necessity to "use both hands to grasp the work and keep both hands tough," thus they cannot investigate and handle major and serious criminal cases effectively and the anticorruption struggle there has not yet achieved good results. In some places, the local authorities have replaced the laws with their own oral instructions, using their administrative powers to interfere in the enforcement of the laws and impeding the procuratorial organs in their investigation and handling of major and serious cases. Some units do not transfer the discovered criminal evidence to the procuratorial organs for investigation and prosecution. On the other hand, some chief procurators lack the courage to perform their law enforcement duties when encountering tough cases; some police officers have not adapted their law enforcement methods to the needs of the struggle and have yet to enhance their ability to discover and verify crimes; some police officers fail to rigorously enforce the law, or even bend the law, while performing their duties, thus affecting and disrupting the handling of the cases; the rate of exemption from prosecution in corruption and bribery cases is 33.5 percent, which is still too high though it is a bit lower than in the previous year; and the effectiveness of the crackdown on crimes has not been markedly improved. In addition, the local procuratorates are still short of working funds and their technical equipment, transportation, and communications remain backward in quality and insufficient in quantity. This has also affected the efficiency of investigating and handling major and serious cases. All such problems and difficulties have to be solved in our future work. II. Maintaining Stability, Sternly Cracking Down on Serious Criminal Activities Persistently inflicting stern and quick penalties on serious criminal offenders and resolutely cracking down on serious criminal activities is an important aspect of our efforts to maintain social stability and is also another key point of the procuratorial work. Last year, the procuratorates closely cooperated with the public security organs, the law courts, and the law enforcement administrative departments in taking intensive actions to deal with the salient problems in law and order and to crack down on various crimes. 1. Approving arrest applications and handling cases transferred by the public security organs for arrest and prosecution in a timely fashion. Last year, the procuratorates handled applications submitted by the public security organs for the arrest of 16,220 suspects and approved 14,395 arrests after examination, an increase of 10.9 percent over the previous year. The procuratorates handled the cases of 15,327 suspects for prosecution and for exemption from prosecution transferred from the public security organs and conducted public trials against 12,062 people, an increase of 6.4 percent. On the other hand, 1,290 people were exempted from prosecution. 2. Giving priority to cracking down on such vicious and violent crimes as murder, robbery, rape, causing explosions, and the illegal use of firearms and cracking down on criminal gangs with the nature of triads. Last year, the procuratorates approved the arrest of 5,150 suspects involved in serious violent crimes and brought 4,137 of them to public trial, increases of 29.8 and 27.1 percent respectively. The procuratorates also approved the arrest of 549 members of crime syndicates and prosecuted 322 of them, increases of 9.8 and 14.6 percent respectively. 3. Taking an active part in the struggle against highway and railroad robbery, theft, smuggling, illegal emigration, and prostitution. The procuratorates at all levels conscientiously carried out the instructions of the central authorities and the provincial party committee on suppressing highwaymen and railroad robbers. They dispatched investigation teams led by chief procurators to key areas and sections of highways and railroads, cooperating with the departments concerned in rounding up and suppressing highwaymen and railroad robbers. Last year, the procuratorates approved the arrest and pursuit of 1,516 highwaymen and railroad robbers, increases of 15.6 and 17.6 percent respectively. The procuratorates in coastal areas intensified the crackdown on smuggling and illegal emigration and approved the arrest of 101 people suspected of illegal emigration and prosecuted 161 such criminals (including those arrested during the previous year). This included the approved arrest of 91 organizers of illegal emigration (also called "snake heads") and the prosecution 101 such criminals (including those arrested in the previous year). Action was also taken to punish lawbreakers who committed such crimes as trafficking in drugs, selling pornographic items, abducting and kidnapping women and children, and enticing and forcing women to practice prostitution. The procuratorates approved the arrest of 391 suspects in such crimes, prosecuting 439 criminals (including those arrested in the previous year). 4. Increasing the advance participation in the handling of serious criminal cases. The procuratorates made advance participation in the handling of 2,733 serious criminal cases from the stage of approving arrests and made advance participation in the handling of 1,808 serious criminal cases from the investigation and prosecution stage, increases of 225 and 250 percent respectively. The advance participation in the investigations and preliminary hearings not only enhanced the efficiency and quality of the work of approving arrests and conducting prosecutions but also enabled the procuratorial personnel to discover facts relating to the cases in good time, collect sufficient evidence, cooperate with the public security organs more closely, and supervise the investigation activities more effectively. 5. Improving the effectiveness of the procuratorial link in the comprehensive measures for maintaining public security and public order. Through the public prosecutions in the courts, the procuratorates played a positive role in giving publicity to the laws and regulations, helping cadres and ordinary people increase their understanding of the laws and regulations and prompting them into abiding by the laws and regulations. Through handling criminal cases, the procuratorates also made suggestions to the units where crimes occurred about removing the hidden perils. The procuratorates gave more effective reeducation to convicts undergoing reform through labor and to offenders who were exempted from prosecution. They also carried out the established measures for helping and educating offenders exempted from prosecution and convicts being released after completing their prison terms and reeducation-through-labor terms by calling on these people and monitoring their behavior regularly. The procuratorates set up fixed ties for maintaining law and order with certain factories, mines, schools, and villages; paid close attention to trends in society; and organized mass activities of preventing and cracking down on crimes. The procuratorates conscientiously carried out the "Law on Protecting Minors" adopted by the National People's Congress Standing Committee, improved the work of arrest approval and prosecution involving cases of juvenile delinquency, and strengthened measures for preventing juvenile delinquency and for educating and rescuing juvenile delinquents. The procuratorates conscientiously handled letters and complaints from the masses and took the initiative in helping the departments concerned to promptly and properly handle collective complaints and civil disputes, thus removing various factors which could affect social stability. At present, public order in the province is stable on the whole but the law and order situation remains rather stern. The hostile forces and individuals within and without the mainland of China have never stopped their sabotage and secret-stealing activities; serious criminal cases are still on the increase and violent criminal cases have been increasing by a big margin; the activities of crime syndicates in some places remain rampant and some of these crime syndicates are triads; and factors which can affect political stability and public order continue to increase. In law enforcement work, some localities are still failing to crack down on criminal activities effectively. We should closely cooperate with the public security and state security organs, and with the people's courts, in taking resolute action against counterrevolutionary criminals who endanger state security in various forms and against serious criminal offenders, making efforts to safeguard political stability and public order. III. Performing the Functions in Rigorous Law Enforcement Last year, we particularly emphasized rigorous law enforcement. The procuratorates themselves were required to rigorously enforce the law and to intensify internal control over the handling of cases which they directly investigated; on the other hand, they conscientiously performed the duties of exercising legal supervision as stipulated by the Constitution and other laws and intensified the supervision over the law enforcement work of the other institutions concerned. 1. Intensifying supervision over investigation.Attention was paid mainly to the phenomena of not bringing lawbreakers to justice and replacing terms of imprisonment with fines. The procuratorates rigorously performed their duty of exercising legal supervision over the investigation activities of the public security organs. They also took legal measures to correct the practice of not bringing lawbreakers to justice or treating innocent people as criminal offenders, as soon as such problems were discovered. Last year, in the course of examining the arrest applications and the prosecution preparations, the procuratorates issued warrants for the arrest of 223 lawbreakers at large and instituted prosecutions against 29 criminal suspects who had not been prosecuted initially; on the other hand, the procuratorates overruled the arrest of 792 people who had not committed any crime and whose arrest was unnecessary, decided not to prosecute 66 people who should not have been suspected of having committed a crime, and returned the cases of 4,359 suspects to the public security organs for further investigation. The procuratorates submitted 314 proposals for correcting illegal practices in the investigation process. Some local procuratorates also supervised the handling of major criminal cases and took action according to the laws and regulations to correct the practice of failing to charge and arrest lawbreakers or replacing necessary prison sentences with fines. For example, Wang Teh-chin, a lawbreaker from Taiwan, colluded with six other lawbreakers in Aoqian Town, Pingtan County, in organizing the illegal emigration of 112 people and gaining an illegal profit of 1.7 million yuan. Under the legal supervision of the local procuratorate concerned, the case was properly handled and the criminals in the case were punished according to law. 2. Intensifying supervision over the trials of criminal cases and sentencing. Attention was paid mainly to incorrect court judgments which treated serious crimes as petty crimes or treated the guilty as innocent, protests being filed against such judgments. The provincial procuratorate dispatched special officials to investigate a number of cases in which the courts announced the innocence of the accused in some localities. Protests were filed if the court judgments were found to be incorrect. Last year, the procuratorates filed 50 protests against incorrect court decisions on criminal cases and put forward 46 proposals to correct the lawbreaking practices in court hearings. 3. Intensifying discipline supervision over legal proceedings. Attention was mainly paid to malpractices by some government functionaries in abusing their powers, infringing upon people's civil rights, and cases of malfeasance. Last year, the procuratorates investigated and handled 352 cases of such malpractices as bending the law for private gain, extorting confessions by torture, effecting illegal detention, neglecting public duties, and causing serious accidents through dereliction of duty. Such cases accounted for 81.3 percent of the lawbreaking cases in the law enforcement field. The Quanzhou City Procuratorate investigated, in accordance with the law, the case of Lin Zhaoze and others in the Nanan City Public Security Bureau, who tortured people under interrogation to death; the investigation has been concluded and a public trial held. The Hanjiang District Procuratorate in Putian City investigated, in accordance with the law, the case of Yao Yinghuang, a policeman from the Suburban Police Station of the District Public Security Sub-bureau, who illegally detained and beat up Chen Guozhang, a people's deputy in Putian County. A public trail was held and the court sentenced Yao ot one year's imprisonment, suspended for 18 months. 4. Intensifying supervision over prisons and places for reeducating convicts. Attention was paid mainly to such lawbreaking cases as prison management personnel who practiced corruption, took bribes, performed corporal punishment and mistreatment prisoners, releasing prisoners illegally, and neglecting official duties. Supervision over court decisions in criminal cases and the implementation of such decisions was also strengthened. The procuratorates corrected the illegal and unwarranted detention of 70 people, the illegal release of 61 people, and the continuing imprisonment of 18 people who should have been released. They also corrected the handling of 23 convicts who were improperly released on parole, whose prison terms were improperly decreased or increased, and who were released on bail for medical treatment. The procuratorates gave advice on correcting the illegal practices in prison management, including illegally prolonging the prison terms of some convicts. As some prisons and places of correction ordered convicts or their families to pay unfair and irregular charges and fees, the procuratorates investigated such problems and promptly checked such practices. At the same time, the procuratorates cooperated with the correction institutions in resolutely suppressing convicts who took the lead in resisting prison management and acting as overlords among their fellow prisoners. Prosecutions were brought against 178 convicts who were undergoing reform through labor or receiving reeducation through labor when they committed new crimes while serving their sentences. 5. Intensifying procuratorial supervision over the handling of civil and administrative cases. Attention was paid mainly to lodging protests against incorrect court judgments in civil, economic, and administrative disputes. Last year, the procuratorates handled 541 such appeals, placed 121 cases on file for investigation, and finished the investigation of 115 cases. They lodged protests against the court decisions on 33 of these cases to the procuratorates at the higher levels and lodged protests on 24 cases to courts, with different decisions being made by the courts. At the same time, serious action was taken against the court personnel who made incorrect judgments in civil cases by perverting justice after accepting bribes and private gains. Xue Lizhi, deputy chief judge of the Pingtan County Court, and Lin Maohao, an assistant judge of the court, accepting 20,000 yuan in bribes when handling a debt dispute case. They thus practiced fraud and bent the law when making the judgment. The procuratorate concerned investigated the case and brought a prosecution against the court officials. They were sentenced to imprisonment for five and six years respectively. The procuratorate also lodged a protest against the first court judgment on the civil case. 6. Intensifying procuratorial supervision over the handling of appeals. Attention was paid mainly to reexamining the handling of appeals against decisions on exemptions from prosecution and against court decisions in criminal cases. Last year, the procuratorial organs handled 552 initial appeals within their jurisdiction, gave replies to 276 appeals, placed 182 criminal appeals on file for reexamination, and corrected the decisions on 38 cases. Of the appeals, 151 were against the decision on exemption from prosecution and the original decision on 32 cases was changed; three were criminal appeals against the sentences made by the courts and one case was retried by the court and the original sentence was changed. Through intensifying supervision over law enforcement the procuratorates played a positive role in prompting the departments concerned to rigorously enforce the law, guaranteeing the unified and correct enforcement of the state law, and protecting the democratic and personal rights of the citizens. However, they still could not fully perform the function of exercising legal supervision and their supervision was still not effective enough. The environment and conditions for rigorous law enforcement have yet to be improved. The new situation of establishing the socialist market economy urgently requires rigorous law enforcement. The established laws must be followed and rigorously enforced and those who violate the law must be brought to justice. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out legal supervision more effectively. IV. Setting Strict Demands on the Procuratorial Personnel and Guaranteeing Their Integrity and Ability Over the past year, the procuratorates at all levels persistently carried out the principle of strictly performing procuratorial functions according to law and made great effort to improve their work and enhance the political and professional quality of the procuratorial personnel. In order to guarantee the integrity of the procuratorial personnel, we adopted five main measures: First, we required leading cadres to carry out serious self-examination and self-correction, strictly in accordance with the five-point anticorruption self-discipline requirements laid down by the central authorities. Second, we resolutely investigated and handled lawbreaking and violation of discipline cases occurring among procuratorial personnel, never shielding the evildoers or concealing the problems. Last year, we handled 32 such cases, three of which were criminal cases. Zheng Lilin, an assistant procurator of the Gulou District Procuratorate in Fuzhou City, accepted bribes and then absconded to avoid punishment. He is still on the wanted list. Liu Tong, an assistant procurator from the Longyan City Procuratorate, joined others engaging in illicit coal trading and evading taxes. He was sentenced to six months' detention. Third, we resolutely checked and corrected the illegal practice of abusing the procuratorial functions by levying irregular charges. Some grass-roots procuratorates charged fees for exempting from prosecution, fees for criminal investigations, guarantee money for repentance and bail, amounting to a total of 154,600 yuan. All the money has been returned to those who paid it. Fourth, we seriously screened and reorganized the business companies run by procuratorates. The procuratorates throughout the province once ran 36 business companies; 23 have been closed down, 11 were transferred to other institutions, and two are still being handled. Fifth, we conscientiously implemented the "Circular on Strictly Enforcing Discipline and Rigorously Enforcing the Laws in Law Enforcement Departments" issued by the Central Commission on Politics and Law, further establishing and perfecting anticorruption rules and regulations, strengthening the work of discipline inspection and supervision, and improving the internal supervisory mechanisms. Strengthening ideological and political work. Cadres and policemen were organized to study the third volume of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" so that they could arm their minds with the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. They were also organized in studying the theoretical knowledge about the socialist market economic structure in order to enhance their firmness and consciousness in carrying out the party's basic line. Education was given to all procuratorial personnel on the issues of rigorous law enforcement, procuratorial discipline, the principle of serving the people wholeheartedly, and honestly performing official duties. Publicity was given to the progressive and exemplary deeds of the procuratorial personnel who performed official duties honestly, faithfully, and with selfless dedication and advanced collectives and individuals in various aspects of the procuratorial work, especially in the forefront of case handling, were commended. Through the establishment of the chief procurator training system, procuratorial diploma courses were given to procuratorial personnel and professional training was organized in various forms and through various channels. Education and training for cadres were strengthened. Last year, the election of new leading bodies in grass-roots procuratorates throughout the province was completed. A number of outstanding young and middle-aged cadres, with integrity and ability and with professional knowledge and practical experience, were elected as chief procurators. The leading bodies in the grass-roots procuratorates were consolidated and strengthened. Last year, according to the Supreme People's Procuratorate instructions, tax affairs procuratorial offices, mainly at the township level, were consolidated and improved. The management systems and the organizational structure were improved so that they functioned more effectively. Over the past year, the vast number of procuratorial cadres and police officers in this province demonstrated a high morale and good working style while facing arduous tasks and difficult conditions. They were tempered in the anticorruption struggle and stood tests in that struggle. A number of advanced collectives and individuals emerged in the work and they made outstanding contributions to the improvement of the procuratorial work in all aspects. V. Implementing the "Regulations" and Conscientiously Accepting the Supervision By the People's Congress Last year, the procuratorial organs at all levels conscientiously implemented the "Regulations on Subjecting the Procuratorial Organs to Supervision by the People's Congresses and Their Standing Committees" laid down by the Supreme People's Procuratorate and subjected their work to supervision by the state power organs. First, continuing to pursue the effective systems of giving regular work reports, special reports on important issues, immediate reports on major cases, and advance reports on personnel changes. Last year, the provincial people's congress standing committee held the chairman's meeting and the fourth plenary meeting to listen to the provincial procuratorate reports on cracking down on the crime's of corruption and bribery. The meetings also emphasized the need to bring the functions of the procuratorial organs into better play. This played an important role in guiding and promoting the work of the procuratorates in the process of rigorous law enforcement and effective case handling. Some local procuratorates set up the system of keeping a namelist of local people's deputies and keeping regular contacts with them. They included the activities of contacting people's deputies in their routine work plans and made concrete arrangements for this. Second, chief procurators attended the meetings of the people's congress standing committees as observers, resolutely carried out the resolutions and decisions adopted by the people's congress standing committees, and conscientiously accepted the law enforcement inspections by the people's congress standing committees. They also seriously considered the opinions of the people's congress standing committees and promptly adopted measures for solving the problems discovered during the inspections. Third, the procuratorates conscientiously considered the opinions expressed by people's deputies and the measures passed by the people's congresses. They assigned special cadres to take charge of cases and other affairs, including the motions, proposals, criticisms, and opinions transferred from the people's congresses. They also gave quick feedback to the people's congresses. Through accepting supervision by the people's congresses and their standing committees, we deeply felt that such supervision was supportive of our work and, only under the supervision of the state's power organs, could the procuratorial organs correctly and effectively perform their functions and fully play a role in exercising legal supervision. People's deputies: In 1994, the general tasks for the whole party and the whole nation is to grasp the opportunity, deepen the reform, expand opening, promote development, and maintain stability. The procuratorial work must be properly oriented to the needs of these general tasks and must serve their general fulfillment. At the provincial chief procurators meeting earlier this year, we fixed our main tasks for the year: Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, we must: Conscientiously carry out the spirit of the 3d Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the instructions by the central leadership on struggling against corruption; persistently carry out the principle of "using both hands to grasp the work and keeping both hands tough"; strengthen the legal supervision function; rigorously enforce the laws and regulations; effectively handle cases; concentrate strength on investigating and handling major criminal cases of corruption and bribery, criminal cases involving legal persons, and cases of not rigorously enforcing laws; sternly crack down on serious criminal activities; take an active part in the comprehensive activities of maintaining law and order in society; safeguard political stability and public order; create a benign law environment for reform, opening, and modernization in this province; and promote the establishment and development of the socialist market economic structure. 1. In the anticorruption struggle, continue to concentrate strength on investigating and handling major and serious cases. Priority is to be given to investigating and handling criminal cases involving party and government leading organs, leading cadres, the judicial institutions, the law enforcement administrative institutions, the economic management institutions, and their personnel; especially the criminal cases of corruption and bribery among leading cadres, cases of bending the law by judicial and law enforcement administrative personnel in the course of law enforcement, and the criminal cases involving legal persons. Top priority is to be given to handling the most important serious cases and the most important major cases and such cases must be handled conscientiously. No matter who is involved in such cases, the investigations must be thoroughly carried out without leniency. It is necessary to sort out the available evidence and information promptly, especially that related to major and serious cases. Attention should be paid to the comprehensive and flexible employment of various legal investigation means and efforts should be made to collect decisive evidence. The provincial procuratorate and the prefectural and city procuratorates should organize, direct, and inspect the investigation and handling of major and serious cases more effectively. They should supervise and guide the work of their immediate subordinates, thus advancing the struggle in depth, step by step, by removing obstacles and resistance. 2. Persistently carry out the principle of inflicting severe and quick punishments on serious criminal offenders according to law and sternly cracking down on serious criminal activities. Priority is to be given to cracking down on such crimes of violence as murder, robbery, rape, causing explosions, and stealing firearms and cracking down on crime syndicates, especially triads. Arrests and prosecutions should be carried out as quickly as possible according to law so that severe punishments can be inflicted on the criminals through cooperation with the departments concerned. We must take an active part in the struggle to crack down on crime syndicates, solve major cases, and round up criminals at large. We must also participate in cracking down on highway and railroad robbery, thefts, abduction, prostitution, smuggling, and illegal emigration. The procuratorial work related to state security will be strengthened and severe action will be taken against criminals who endanger our social and political stability in various ways. At the same time, the procuratorial link in the comprehensive management of public security will also be strengthened. 3. Intensify law enforcement supervision and correct the problems of not strictly enforcing the law. Attention will be paid to uncovering various phenomena of not following the legal procedures in handling cases and not strictly enforcing the law. We will shortly advance proposals on correcting such practices. In particular, we shall investigate and handle such criminal cases among the judicial and administrative law enforcing personnel as abusing power, bending the law to seek private gain, shielding evildoers, extorting confessions by means of torture, effecting illegal detention, mistreating or employing corporal punishment on people in jail or under detention, covering up criminal facts, providing false evidence, and harboring criminals, resolutely bringing such lawbreakers to justice. 4. Consolidate the contingent of the procuratorial personnel and enhance their integrity and law enforcement ability. We will earnestly study the third volume of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," arm our minds with the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and continuously enhance the integrity and ability of the procuratorial cadres and police officers. We must seriously deal with the corrupt phenomena existing among the procuratorial personnel and resolutely investigate and handle the lawbreaking and violation of discipline cases among them. At the same time, we will persistently carry out the principle of "running the procuratorates and performing the procuratorial functions strictly according to law." We will conduct reeducation on ideals, beliefs, and principles fo all procuratorial personnel and will require them to strictly abide by laws and discipline, rigorously enforce the laws and regulations, and handle cases in a correct manner. We will also conduct discipline and professional ethical education for them and establish and perfect the concrete anticorruption rules for the procuratorial personnel, the responsibility system for case handling, and various rules and regulations for internal supervision and self-discipline. People's deputies: The people's procuratorates at all levels in this province and all procuratorial cadres and police officers will, under the effective leadership of the party committees and under the supervision of the people's congresses and their standing committees, will continue to make greater achievements in their work, overcome difficulties, and make new and solid progress in the effective and efficient handling of cases, the rigorous enforcement of the laws and regulations, and in doing down-to-earth work to perform the procuratorial function in all aspects.
