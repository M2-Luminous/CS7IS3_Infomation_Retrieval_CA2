Recalling that delegates from different countries, regions and international organizations to the recent 50th meeting of the UN Commission on Human Rights strongly urged Japan to approach the settlement of the "comfort women" issue with a sincere attitude, the article says: It is an undeniable fact that the Japanese Government is obviously under obligation to take a legal action against those involved in the crimes against the "comfort women" and make compensations to the victims. It is an open secret that the plan of the "comfort women" system was worked out and carried into practice by the Japanese military and government in the past. Nevertheless, none of those involved in the crimes against the "comfort women" has so far been punished in Japan. When the international opinion including those drafted as "comfort women for the army" came in demand of punishment of those responsible for it, the Japanese authorities tried to avoid it under this or that pretext. They allege that those chiefly responsible for the crimes against the "comfort women for the army" cannot be punished because Japan has no domestic law on the trial of the "crimes against humanity" and the period of prescription is past. This is an open evasion of their obligations under international law, a shameless mockery of and insult to those drafted "comfort women" and human conscience. Facts fully show that the Japanese authorities have no intention to admit and liquidate the past crimes, the anti-human crime of sexual enslavement in particular. It is impermissible for the arrogant Japan which has no regard for the international law to take a permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council.
