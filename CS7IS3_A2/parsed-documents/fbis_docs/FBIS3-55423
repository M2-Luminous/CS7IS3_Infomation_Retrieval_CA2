What are its achievements? What could it elaborate? What is awaiting the Ukrainian parliament in 1994? Our correspondent talks about this with first deputy chairman of Ukraine's Supreme Council, V.V. Durdynets. [HOLOS UKRAYINY] Esteemed Vasyl Vasylyovych, the present situation in Ukraine is difficult. The prestige of the power structures has been shaken. Notwithstanding this, many people still believe in our state's supreme legislative body. This follows at least from the fact that people gather precisely under the windows of the parliament building in order to express their dissatisfaction with something, expound their demands, or simply hold discussions with people's deputies. Therefore, they hope that parliament is still capable of doing something to build up the state. Has the eighth session justified these expectations? Which of the legislative acts adopted by it can be assessed by you as fundamental and leading? [Durdynets] Well, this question is not a simple one, and I would generally agree with the emphasis that you have placed in it. However, one point needs to be better specified: Today, people do not only pin their hopes on the Supreme Council, but, to a no lesser degree, on the bodies of executive power, the president, and the Cabinet of Ministers, which are directly responsible for the fulfillment of the laws and decrees that have been adopted. People gather at the square in front of the Supreme Council mainly on the days of plenary sessions in order to hold a direct dialogue. This is, undoubtedly, mutually useful. As regards the work of the eighth session, it was really held in difficult conditions. It is worth stressing here that this session adopted quite a number of exclusively important legislative acts, which may be called a political reaction on the part of the legislators to the topical demands of our time. The session worked very hard and was very productive. [HOLOS UKRAYINY] Before closing the session, Ivan Stepanovych Plyushch quoted some figures.... [Durdynets] Yes, Ivan Stepanovych quoted specific figures. In terms of quantitative indexes, the session differs from others. Its 52 meetings discussed 249 questions and adopted 66 laws and 133 decrees. However, it is not only by this that I would characterize the session. It must be said, first and foremost, that, by passing the law on the early elections of the Supreme Council and president, it responded to the need to renew the power structures, a need that has become felt in our society. The Law on the Elections of Ukraine's People's Deputies was adopted and the composition of the Central Electoral Commission was approved. In fact, the adoption of these documents marked the beginning of the pre-election campaign. The people were given a chance to delegate their new envoys to the Supreme Council, and the political parties -- their representatives. [HOLOS UKRAYINY] At its eighth session, the Supreme Council repeatedly discussed the issue of the economic situation in Ukraine and of the social protection of the population. The "dialogue" between the people's deputies and the Cabinet of Ministers was quite sharp. The government has changed three times over the three years. A number of laws and decrees have been adopted. What positive changes have taken place? What has the Supreme Council managed to achieve, in your opinion? [Durdynets] Economic and, in particular, social problems were and still are the most painful ones for our society. It is clear that the economic situation in Ukraine is also quite noticeably affected by foreign factors and by the still severed production ties within what used to be a single national economic complex. Nor is the structural and technological rebuilding of Ukraine's economy proceeding smoothly: It is too delayed, sluggish, and has many shortcomings. However, our misfortunes are largely due to strictly internal problems, inefficient administration, and errors in the implementation of reforms. Unfortunately, the economic programs, including those proposed by previous governments, have not produced positive results. The expanding spiral of inflation and the uncontrolled price increases have led to a drastic deterioration of the people's standard of living. In the course of the eighth session, the Supreme Council had to adopt nine legislative acts directly associated with the social protection of the population. I mean the Law on the Status of War Veterans and Guarantees of Their Social Protection, the Law on the Main Principles of the Social Protection of Veterans of Labor and Other Citizens of Old Age, changes to the Law on State Assistance for Families With Children, the Decree on Urgent Measures for Overcoming Hyperinflation in Ukraine, and other legislative acts. It is important to emphasize that, in view of the conditions that have recently taken shape in the state, the Supreme Council adopted, a few days ago, a new Concept for the Social Protection of Ukraine's Population. It has laid down the principles for the legal and formative foundation for social protection and elaborated mechanisms that, proceeding from the actual economic possibilities, will ensure the fulfillment of state guarantees regarding the implementation of the citizens' rights to labor and unemployment benefits: Remuneration for labor and minimal wages; provision of state assistance and other types of social assistance for low-income citizens and families with children. Yet another important principle, which follows from the concept, is that the system of social protection must be built in such a way as to prevent egalitarianism and moods of parasitism from prevailing during the distribution and consumption of benefits. This system must not weaken the motivations and incentives for labor, but must create conditions for their fullest possible manifestation. [HOLOS UKRAYINY] Some politicians assert that it is precisely the Supreme Council that raises prices.... [Durdynets] There are such politicians, but they cannot confirm this with a single document. The Supreme Council has not made a single decision to raise prices. On the contrary, as you remember, last spring, it imposed a moratorium on price increases, but owing to the government's persistent requests (the government assured us at that time that it was the last price increase), the Supreme Council agreed to authorize the decision. [HOLOS UKRAYINY] How about the considerable price increases in December? [Durdynets] It is precisely on this that I want to stress that the last month of work of the Supreme Council's eighth session was particularly strained. In connection with the sharp price increases and popular discontent, the situation called for urgent and extraordinary measures on the part of the Supreme Council, the president, and the government. After the discussion, which continued for many days, of the reports by Acting Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, Chairman of the Board of Ukraine's National Bank Viktor Yushchenko, Minister of Finance Hryhoriy Pyatachenko, and Minister of the Economy Roman Shpek, the Supreme Council passed, on 17 December, an important decree on the economic and social situation in Ukraine with specific recommendations for the emergence from the economic crisis and, a week later, a decree on additional measures for stabilizing the socio-economic situation. In my opinion, these documents will somewhat mitigate the situation. Certainly, provided that strict control is established over the timely and thorough fulfillment of the regulations on stabilizing the socio-economic situation and overcoming inflation. Here, the standing commissions of deputies must actively interact with the executive bodies. At the ninth session, which will start on 20 January, the Supreme Council will analyze how these decrees have been fulfilled. [HOLOS UKRAYINY] At the beginning of the interview, you mentioned legislative laws adopted by the eighth session as a response to the need for a political renewal in society. Unlike some politicians, you seem to be convinced that elections will be held. Am I right? Another question: Will it not happen that quite a number of those people's deputies who, today, work actively and competently on commissions, will not be elected to parliament for the simple reason that they appear in front of the microphones or at rostrums less frequently? [Durdynets] I will start with your second question: It will be a pity if this happens. It is a fact that a professional nucleus of legislators, highly erudite politicians responsible to the state and the people, has formed in the present parliament. However, I hope that these deputies will continue to serve our country. It is high time that we created a civilized and professional parliament. As regards new elections, it will not be simple to hold them. However, I do not think that the majority of voters will not come to the polling stations at all, as some people predict. I hope not. It cannot happen that the majority of voters will not care who works in parliament and who will come there. The law passed is not as bad as some people picture it. It is democratic. I am sure that the majority of citizens in our society are mature enough to have a profound understanding that it is precisely they who must form a new parliament through elections and take care of their own future. This is, incidentally, attested to by the political tension in the state. [HOLOS UKRAYINY] Perhaps, the discussion of the draft of the new constitution of Ukraine should be placed into the category of key problems? [Durdynets] Undoubtedly. The work on the draft of the new constitution was quite time-consuming. It is the main law of the state, and the deputies consider its elaboration to be a particularly important matter. The eighth session discussed the draft into which the Constitutional Commission introduced fundamental changes and additions -- taking into account the results of the nationwide discussions. Much time was devoted to its discussion at plenary meetings. The deputies were able to analyze the draft in depth. Many important remarks and proposals were voiced in the course of the discussion. They refer to all parts of the draft, but in particular, to those articles that deal with the general principles of the constitutional system, democracy, the electoral process, forms of state power and administration, the main principles of Ukraine's territorial system, and the organization of state power and self-government in the provinces. I want to stress that different points of view were voiced in the course of the discussions, but one could feel a constructive approach in assessing the draft constitution and the desire to find the best variant, which would take into account the experience of democratic countries and our national traditions and specific features of state building. It was decided to publish the draft constitution in the press once more, so that all the citizens of Ukraine could familiarize themselves with it. The Constitutional Commission, which generalizes the proposals made by the people's deputies, is already receiving letters with specific proposals. We expect that the question of the new constitution will also be discussed in substance at the conference of the representatives of local councils of Ukraine's people's deputies, which will be held on 18 and 19 January. We are also thinking how to speed up the amendment and adoption of the new constitution, because it is extremely difficult to build a young state without new main law. Ukraine needs a new constitution. [HOLOS UKRAYINY] The ratification by parliament of START I and of the Lisbon Protocol gave rise to very strong reactions, which are also quite controversial. How would you comment on this? [Durdynets] Right, the adoption, on 18 November, by the Supreme Council of the decree on the ratification of these documents gave rise to a considerable response in the world. The numerous reactions and commentaries by state and political circles point to their understanding of the motivations for adopting such a decision. At the same time, some political figures and mass media offered interpretations of some aspects of the decree that differ from what they really meant. As you know, the adoption by the Supreme Council of the decision on the ratification was preceded by an almost year-long discussion and thorough collective analysis of possible military, political, economic, ecological, and social consequences of the implementation by our state of this treaty, which had been concluded without Ukraine's participation. In their approach to this issue, the parliament, its standing commissions, and the temporary working group of deputies, created to pass the corresponding recommendations, proceeded both from Ukraine's noble intention to become, in the future, a nuclear state and from the ideas of the inviolability of state borders, as well as from other national interests. In the course of the in-depth and comprehensive study of the problems, the deputies also paid attention to such a serious matter as the economic feasibility for our state to fulfill, to a full extent, the obligations that are stipulated by the treaty. We have striven to convince the international community, and first and foremost nuclear and other influential world powers, that it is essential for them to make reciprocal steps and offer Ukraine reliable security guarantees and provide it with proper financial assistance, enabling it to destroy those weapons, and to compensate us for the nuclear warheads. Unfortunately, our hopes were futile. That is why the Supreme Council, while adopting the decision on the ratification of START I with reservations, took these aspects into account and proceeded from the real situation that had taken shape. Incidentally, recent events, and particularly openly anti- Ukrainian statements made by individual Russian political and state figures, justified our position. [HOLOS UKRAYINY] The problems of combating crime in our country continue to be acute. How were they dealt with by the Supreme Council? [Durdynets] The deputies analyzed these problems with great concern, because the growth of crime, and in particular organized crime, are a matter of serious concern to our society. This problem is constantly within the Supreme Council's field of vision. This session alone approved more than 20 normative acts intended to strengthen law and order and intensify the struggle against crime, in particular, laws on more severe punishment for certain crimes against the state and on the state protection of court and law- enforcement officials; the draft law on combating corruption was given its first reading. Important changes and additions were introduced into the Criminal and Criminal-Procedural Codes and other legal acts. Active work is under way on the elaboration of new codes. Serious criticisms were directed against the Procurator General's Office in connection with the shortcomings in its work. The Supreme Council strengthened the leadership -- a new Procurator General was appointed and a new composition of the board approved. Changes were introduced into the Law on the Procurator's Office that are intended to improve its work. A number of acts that were adopted are aimed at reforming the judicial power and improving legal proceedings. A new leadership of Ukraine's Supreme Court was elected. The main task now is to strengthen parliamentary control over the implementation of legislation on legal issues and to combine the efforts of executive and law-enforcement agencies in combating crime. [HOLOS UKRAYINY] However, one does hear much more criticism than approval of the Supreme Council's activities.... [Durdynets] All of this is understandable. Life does not get any better, and the legal acts that are adopted do not, unfortunately, work the way in which we would like them to. Incidentally, many voters judge the Supreme Council's work only by the plenary meetings. They do not see the colossal, painstaking, and, I would say, very hard work done by the Presidium, standing commissions, and subdivisions of the Supreme Council apparatus. Every issue, no matter how unimportant it may be, is subjected to expert analysis by specialists and is discussed in deputies' groups and commissions before it is put on the agenda of the plenary meeting. Diverse, sometimes opposite, ideas and proposals need to be studied, substantiated, and compared in order to enable a proper decision to be made. For example, I mentioned two extremely important decrees adopted by the Supreme Council at the end of the session -- on the economic and social situation in Ukraine and on measures to stabilize the socio-economic situation in the state. A special working group had been created to prepare this. It included people's deputies, ministers, and specialists -- economists and lawyers. I happened to be the head of this group. We worked hard for several days and nights. Everything was there -- sharp discussions, opposite views, and some peoples' narrow departmental ambitions. We had to go through all of this to reach a compromise and arrive at coordinated and well-weighed decisions that would take into account the numerous appeals from the provinces and proposals made by people's deputies. Believe me, this was a very difficult task. We have to make the decisions, as people expect us to do. I must say that, since these decisions were made, the government has made considerable efforts to implement them. There are great difficulties here. [HOLOS UKRAYINY] Before the end of the last plenary meeting, it was announced that the next session, the ninth, will start work on 20 January. Meanwhile, one hears doubts: Will the Supreme Council be able to work at full capacity if some of the deputies become involved in the pre-election struggle? [Durdynets] The ninth session will primarily discuss two most important issues -- the plan for Ukraine's economic and social development and the draft state budget for 1994. They were on the agenda of the eighth session, but the Cabinet of Ministers was unable, for various reasons, to submit these bills on time. Of course, this cannot be considered a normal situation, when a new year starts and there is still no plan for the country's economic and social development and no state budget. That is why the deputies at the session sharply criticized the government for such a delay. We hope that the drafts of these documents will be submitted to the Supreme Council within the first 10 days of January. By the beginning of plenary meetings, the deputies will be able to analyze them in detail in standing commissions. Until the budget for 1994 is adopted, the Supreme Council, by its decree of 24 December allowed the government and the National Bank to carry out the financing of immediate expenditure in January 1994 within the limits of real contributions to the budget. I will also list those issues whose discussion cannot be delayed in view of their social significance. These are, in particular, the draft state program for privatization meant for next year. It must take into account the best experience accumulated by other countries and our specific characteristics and mistakes so that it would open the way to an intensification of the economic reforms. We must discuss the second reading of the bill on combating crime and introduce the appropriate changes into Ukraine's Criminal and Criminal-Procedural Codes. It is not necessary to prove the great need for this law today, when corruption seriously threatens the development of our national economy. The Supreme Council must discuss the amended draft concept of Ukraine's national security (policy principles). As is known, this global issue was discussed at the eighth session, but the discussion was not finished. There also are a number of bills that were already passed at first reading. They are expected in particular sectors. Some of the currently effective legal acts also need to be altered and supplemented. However, is it possible to put all of them into the "working portfolio" of the future parliament? Therefore, I am convinced that the overwhelming majority of the deputies will consider these questions with great responsibility and that the ninth session will work in a normal and businesslike manner. Now, during the period between the sessions, standing commissions do not halt their legislative work and also conduct checks on the implementation of the laws and the decisions that have been made. I am using this opportunity to greet all Ukrainian citizens and their families for Christmas and the New Year and wish them happiness, prosperity, peace, accord, and a better life. Thank you for your attention.
