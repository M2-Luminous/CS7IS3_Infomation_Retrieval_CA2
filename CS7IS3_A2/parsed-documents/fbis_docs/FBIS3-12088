In an operation called "Canaveral" which took place at 1330 on 18 March, the FELCN found the laboratory located 5 km in a straight line west from Viru Viru Airport, near the Sanchez valley. The FELCN could not, however, arrest any of those who had been processing the drugs until a few minutes before the operation. The laboratory had the capacity of processing some 300 kg of cocaine per week with a degree of purity that is not common in our country. The FELCN had been informed that a cocaine shipment had left the laboratory to be sent to Brazil. The FELCN agents nevertheless found more than 500 kg of cocaine in various processing stages at the site. According to experts, the drugs were being processed in accordance with severe norms aimed at obtaining an ideal substance for export. The laboratory was inside a nearly 20 hectare farm planted mostly with sugarcane. The La Belgica sugar mill is 15 km from this laboratory. FELCN District Commander Colonel Hector Frias Cardozo did not reveal the names of those arrested because of this operation, but it has been unofficially reported that at least four suspects have been identified. A second stage of this operation is still being conducted at the capital of Santa Cruz Department, to identify the owner of the farm and those who are involved in the illegal activity. Apparently the laboratory has been operating at the site for at least one year. [passage omitted] Together with the drugs, the FELCN agents burned 90 liters of ammonia, 13 kg potassium permanganate, two kg caustic soda, 200 kg calcium chloride, 175 liters of sulphuric ether, 50 liters of sulphuric acid, seven kg manitol, and 400 liters of acetone.
