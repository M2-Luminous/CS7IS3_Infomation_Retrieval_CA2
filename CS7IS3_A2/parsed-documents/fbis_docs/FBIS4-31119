On 1 July, Germany will become the presiding country of the European Union, and, immediately thereafter, as of the new year, this role will be taken over by France. Paris supposes that, by the end of this year, French diplomacy will succeed, with Bonn's assistance, in pushing matters forward so that the Stability Pact can be signed. Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, the author of the original idea, must score this success for a quite prosaic reason: He wants to become successor to President Francois Mitterrand and expects such an international triumph to greatly strengthen his chances. For this reason, French diplomacy did everything it could to ensure the conference's success. This becomes most evident when we take a look at the changes that the original Balladur plan has undergone; it really has changed beyond recognition. What Slovakia as well as other countries considered to be of the greatest importance was the acceptance of one of the major CSCE principles--the inviolability of the existing borders. One could even argue that, if this did not happen, the whole initiative would probably have gone down in the textbooks of diplomacy as one of the examples of abortive activities. It needs to be said--without schadenfreude but, still, with satisfaction--that the results of the Paris conference signify the end of the hopes of certain circles in Hungary, and also abroad, that had hoped for possible revision of the borders with Hungary's neighbors and, thereby, for a precedent to be set. This disappointment was to be felt also in Paris in the speech of [Hungarian Foreign Minister] Geza Jeszenszky, for whom participation in the conference apparently was his swan song as the chief of Hungarian diplomacy. Still, even when we use moderate and diplomatic terms, his words startled and struck the audience by their confrontational tone, which also met with the appropriate response. In the end, the overwhelming majority qualified this as a last attempt to save political face in the face of one's own fiasco. The focus of work in the forthcoming period will be on preparatory negotiations to determine the exact dates of two regional roundtables. The first will pertain to the Central European region and will involve Slovakia and Hungary. The other will involve the Baltic countries. Five areas of problems are to be discussed, but the agenda could be expanded if new issues emerge. In this context, it needs to be stressed again that representatives of ethnic minorities will not be able to directly participate in these roundtables. This applies, in particular, to the Hungarian minority, whose representatives have demanded this possibility most vehemently, with Budapest's support. However, as Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik stressed some time ago and as has been confirmed by [Foreign Minister] Eduard Kukan, the Slovak Government is not only ready but also determined to not only brief the minority's representatives before and after the talks but also to consult them on problems concerning the minorities. The principle was adopted in Paris that relations between states are involved, in which only subjects of international law can participate. One cannot but express the hope that the work on bilateral documents that will be a part of the pact, as well as the roundtables, will be marked by a constructive spirit, even if polemics cannot be ruled out in advance. However, Bonn and Paris will quite certainly try to prove their active attitude toward the problems of Central and Eastern Europe. Therefore, we can expect a very rapid solution to any disputed problems so that the final document can be signed no later than in one year's time. Let us only hope that the signing will not be accompanied by problems such as occurred while taking the so-called family portrait, when the quite undiplomatic hustle on the wooden platform almost caused diplomatic and human tragedy. However, this was probably the French organizers' only serious mistake.
