"Theological arguments over definitions of terms" (as stated by a senior Foreign Ministry official), such as objective criteria, came to an end for the time being at informal negotiations held in May. Sectoral talks will now be held to discuss setting "objective criteria" to gauge foreign access to Japanese markets. However, there arises a possibility that the dispute between Japan and the United States over the meaning of objective criteria could further intensify, since the interests of relevant industries would be involved. It is still uncertain as to how much progress would be made in the trade talks by late June, when it is hoped an agreement will be reached. On the day following announcement of the resumption of the bilateral trade talks, Walter Mondale, U.S. ambassador to Japan, and Tatsuro Toyoda, chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, held talks in Tokyo. Although details of the meeting were not disclosed, officials concerned believe that "prior to the resumption of the trade talks, the ambassador made it perfectly clear that the United States wants Japan to pour greater efforts into selling imported automobiles." They feel so all the more because in the past, the ambassador has questioned the Japanese marketing system, saying, "Only a small number of dealers in Japan handle foreign automobiles." Automobile and auto parts trade, which accounts for a large portion of the Japanese trade surplus with the United States, is the greatest pending issue among the three priority sectors in the framework trade talks. Although a certain amount of progress has been made in the insurance and government procurement sectors, discussions on automobiles and auto parts, for the most part, are yet to reach the final stages. In a lecture, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said: "Japan should be able to promise to increase the number of imported car dealers within a designated period." In reaction, an official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry in charge of trade negotiations complained: "This is tantamount to numerical targets and is beyond government control, so we cannot accept it." There is also a possibility that Japan may be pressed with new U.S. demands in the insurance and government procurement sectors where talks are to be held along with the automobiles sector. Punitive measures will be in the picture when talks are held on five additional sectors that the United States has asked to have included as priority areas. Regarding sheet glass and forestry products, the United States hints at imposing punitive measures by reinstating the Super 301 provision (for determining and taking counteraction against unfair traders and trade practices) of the 1988 Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act. Regarding intellectual property rights, the United States hints at imposing punitive measures under the Special 301 provision of the 1988 U.S. Trade Act. In the financial services sector, the United States is moving toward enacting by the yearend a legislation that will allow it to take retaliatory action against unfair practices. Moreover, the possibility of the United States making further demands regarding macroeconomic policies has not disappeared, either. The U.S. Government has said that it "would praise Japan if it decides to implement tax cuts for three years ahead of tax hikes" (as stated by Lloyd Bentsen, U.S. secretary of treasury) to help it boost domestic demand. However, it is also not clear whether the ruling coalition parties would be able to make a final decision on a consumption tax hike in June. In that case, it would become difficult to extend income tax cuts for up to three years. Japanese and U.S. leaders hope to reach accords on at least three of the priority sectors by the July Naples summit and use this as an opportunity to help stabilize their political steering. However, in some quarters of the industrial circles, which closely watch in which direction the trade talks are headed, there are those who feel indifferent. For example, the head of an industrial materials manufacturing firm has said: "In the end, the talks will wind up being ambiguous with decisions put off. The framework trade talks is a game played by bureaucrats and lawyers." Despite such circumstances, however, a point of compromise must be found. Apparently, Japanese and U.S. leaders must find a way to break the ice, eying the possibility of making political decisions, while not simply letting bureaucrats take care of the issue.
