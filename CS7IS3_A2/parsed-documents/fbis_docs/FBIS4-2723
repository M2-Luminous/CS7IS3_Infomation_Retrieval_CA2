It is also a major reform of common concern to urban residents and the broad masses of staff and workers. Why do we need to conduct housing reform? How do we carry out Tibet's housing reform in 1994 and 1995? These are the two topics people are most concerned about at the moment. Tibet's current urban housing system is a welfare system whereby actual services are distributed in kind in the form of low rent with heavy subsidies. According to relevant statistics, during the 40 years between 1952 and 1991, Tibet invested about 800 million yuan on housing construction projects for urban residents. It is assumed people should be very satisfied with such great efforts of the government when state and local governments have been facing relatively tough financial difficulties. In fact, it is not so. There is a very large gap when we compare the masses' actual needs. Unfair housing conditions are relatively common. The practice of the past several decades has shown that not only can the current housing system not resolve China's urban housing problems, but it has also deadlocked the way to resolve urban housing problems. To change the situation and get out of the current predicament, we must resolutely conduct housing reform.

Rental reform is a first step in reforming Tibet's housing system in 1994, and it is the beginning of Tibet's efforts in this regard. Second, we should comprehensively implement a housing pension fund system. The housing pension fund is a long-term savings aimed at resolving housing problems of staff and workers. It is a principal means to transform a housing unit under a welfare system whereby actual services are distributed in kind in the form of low rent into a housing unit maintained by wages. It has important significance in strengthening the sense of security in the staff and workers by having their own housing units and in raising their ability to acquire housing units on their own. Third, we should actively carry out the four-pointed tasks to sell state housing units, including reforming Tibet's housing system, and commercializing and socializing housing units. Selling state housing units is one of the major reform measures, has strong policy tenor, involves many sectors, and is complicated. Additionally, Tibet's basic administration over the sales of state housing units has been relatively poor, and its preparatory work in various aspects has been inadequate. To actively and prudently sell state housing units and to ensure a smooth progress in related work, we should strictly implement four measures in restricted sectors in 1994 and 1995 and will, after gaining experience, gradually implement them across Tibet in an all-around manner afterward. Fourth, we should gradually establish government unit housing funds. While conducting housing reform, the state, units, and individual workers should jointly make financial contributions. How do the state and units get their funds? According to relevant state policies, most of the funds must be derived from existing housing funds. In other words, existing funds currently allocated by the state and units for housing, production, operation, and consumption should be reallocated, straightened out, gradually lumped together, and used to form government unit housing funds. The funds should be rationalized, consolidated, specialized, and used only to reform urban housing system and to construct housing projects. [end recording]
