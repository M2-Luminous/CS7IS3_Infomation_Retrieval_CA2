The main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which set the submission as a condition to start deliberations of the fiscal 1994 state budget at the House of Representatives budget committee, reacted angrily, with the result that debates on the budget are likely to be delayed until later this month, Diet sources said. Chiefs of the Diet affairs committee from the coalition parties and the LDP met in the afternoon in order to reach agreement on the opening of debate on the 73.08 trillion yen budget. The negotiations, however, broke off after Hosokawa rejected the LDP demand, the sources said. The LDP decided not to attend Wednesday's scheduled meeting of senior members of the budget committee, which will discuss a timetable to deliberate the national budget for fiscal 1994 that starts April 1, LDP officials said. The government last Friday submitted to the panel documents relating to the loan but the LDP and the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) were not satisfied, saying the submissions were insufficient, and renewed their demands that the government offer further detailed materials. Hosokawa has insisted he borrowed the 100 million yen from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin in 1982 to repair his home in Kumamoto Prefecture and buy a condominium in Tokyo, and fully repaid the money nine years later. The parcel delivery firm was involved in a money-and-mob scandal which forced LDP kingpin Shin Kanemaru to resign in disgrace in 1992. Hosokawa maintains he repaid the money by January 31, 1991, using part of his retirement allowance as Kumamoto governor. But the LDP argues that Hosokawa could not have received the retirement allowance before finishing his second term as governor in February 1991.
