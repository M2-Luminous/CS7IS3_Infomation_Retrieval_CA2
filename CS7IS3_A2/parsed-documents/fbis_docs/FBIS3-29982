Testifying at the National Assembly session, Yi said his government would submit a market opening schedule to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) after taking into account the contents of similar schedules to be submitted by major countries like the United States, Japan and the European Union (EU). He thus implied that South Korea may revise its original market opening plan depending on the outcome of the on-going U.S.-Japan trade talks. The premier said that so far most other countries are withholding their market opening schedules. "This is due to their policy to cope with the outcome of the U.S.-Japan trade talks," Yi said. Also speaking at the assembly floor, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Kim Yang-pae said that last year, South Korea recorded a deficit of about 5,040 million dollars in the trade of agricultural and fishery products. He said exports amounted to some 2,750 million dollars and imports to 7,790 million dollars. "We plan to boost farm and fishery goods exports by promoting, for instance, the shipment of large amounts of hog meat and Kimchi to the vast Japanese market," Kim said.
