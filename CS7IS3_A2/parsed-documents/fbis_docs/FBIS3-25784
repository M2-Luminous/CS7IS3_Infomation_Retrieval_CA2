(UMC) will transfer its advanced 0.8- micrometer integrated circuit (IC) manufacturing technology to the German semiconductor maker Thesys, a company spokesman said Saturday [29 January]. It is the first time that a Taiwan company has sold its IC technical know-how to a European firm, the spokesman noted. UMC is Taiwan's top and the world's 31st largest IC producer. Under a cooperative contract signed in Taipei by UMC Chairman Tsao Hsing-cheng and Thesys Chairman Cludio Loddo [spelling of name as received], UMC will transfer 0.8-micrometer IC design rules, production facilities and management expertise to the German firm. Thesys will pay UMC millions of US dollars in royalties. Meanwhile, the spokesman said, Thesys will produce 2,000 6 inch IC wafers a month on an original equipment manufacturing basis for UMC starting late this year. Thesys has technology for producing 1.2-micrometer ICs and can turn out 30,000 6-inch wafers monthly. "By cooperating with Thesys, our company has gained greater access to the European market," the spokesman noted. UMC began to produce 7-micrometer ICs 17 years ago by buying know-how from America's RCA Co. with a paid-in capital of NT [New Taiwan] $6 billion (US$226 million), the company registered a business turnover of NT$10 bill on (US$377.35 million) in 1993. Taiwan had a 2.67 percent share of the world's total IC output last year and the ratio is expected to rise to 10 or 15 percent in the next few years as all major local IC producers have launched expansion projects, industry sources said.
