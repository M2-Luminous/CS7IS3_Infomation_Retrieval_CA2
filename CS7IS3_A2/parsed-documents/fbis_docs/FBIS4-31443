The voting continued all night and part of the day today. Of 688 votes 640 were for Videnov. DUMA, the BSP daily, reported the news on its front page two hours before the voting had actually started. Several copies of the newspaper, circulated in the congress hall shortly after midnight, gave the news much to the surprise of some MP's and above all of Aleksandur Marinov, considered an alternative candidate for the leadership. The highlights of the 41st Congress are calls for early parliamentary elections and for the BSP in office. The congress lasted one night and one day more than had been scheduled. While the counting of the votes for supreme leadership was still in progress, the delegates broke into song and had a national dance. "We are rehearsing for the jubilation on election night in the autumn," a delegate cried. Leader Zhan Videnov joined in the dance. The top leadership of the anti-communist Union of Democratic Forces (SDS), which has been pressing for early elections for over a year, held an extraordinary meeting today. "It was interesting for us to see the Communist Party adopt a major idea upheld by the SDS," SDS leader Filip Dimitrov told the press later on. In his view, all major political forces and institutions have recognized the need of parliamentary elections in the autumn. Proceedings at the congress were smooth. Most delegates backed the party leadership. The only issue to provoke debates was whether a party programme should be adopted at the congress, or by an all- party consultation in September. Quite a few delegates insisted on the first option but the majority voted for the second one. The congress adopted the basic principles of a party programme, a draft election platform and a new statute. In the draft election platform the Socialists declare themselves in favour of national consensus, against ethnic confrontation, for Bulgaria's single-nation character and territorial integrity. They will be applying a new economic reform model, including a comprehensive policy of social protection, socially-oriented mass privatization, halting the decline in output, reduction of unemployment, returning the land to its former owners and setting up farmer cooperatives on a voluntary basis. The BSP calls for goodneighbourly relations with all Balkan countries, active and independent policy, absolute neutrality in the Yugoconflict and total integration into the European structures. The congress voted a resolution proposed by delegates from Kurdzhali, Khaskovo and Smolyan (southeastern Bulgaria, a region populated predominantly by ethnic Turks). The BSP will oppose by legal means parties and movements which act counter to the national interests and security and try to forcibly Turkicize Bulgarians professing Islam, the resolution says. In another resolution the congress condemned the court trials of former communist state officials, charged with plunging the country into an economic crisis, calling the trials "political." The Socialists will make efforts to rehabilitate Georgi Atanasov and Stoyan Ovcharov, respectively prime minister and minister of economics under Zhivkov. Many asked how much it cost to hold the well-organized forum in the most prestigious convention centre, Sofia's National Palace of Culture. The BSP Press Office said the three scheduled days of the congress had cost 750,000 leva and all MP's of the BSP (about 100) had donated 5,000 leva each towards the congress. According to staff members of the convention centre, however, the rate for the largest congress hall is 300,000 leva per day which, added to the cost of materials printed on glossy paper, of the hall where briefings were held, and refreshments for the delegates, brings the total to about 4 million leva, sources outside the BSP said. The congress reelected Stefan Prodev editor-in-chief of the DUMA daily. Asked by delegates to account for the premature report on Videnov's election as leader, Prodev said it was based on polls by the press -- an answer which satisfied the delegates.
