Seven people died following an attack on the Inter-Arms Regiment camp in Lome on 5 January. [Unidentified correspondent] A curfew has been imposed in Lome. Olabire da Cruz has the details: [Begin recording] Sporadic gunshots were heard again this morning at 0600, especially near the military camp and the airport. The Army and the Gendarmerie, who seem to have the situation under control, have erected barricades all over to dislodge the attackers, who, according to a government communique, came from Ghana. The government has asked the people in Lome and its environs to remain calm and stay at home today to enable the security forces to deal with the situation. Thus, public and private sector workers are not going to work today. A curfew was imposed from 1800 to 0600 on 5 January. The aim of the attack was reportedly to surround the Inter-Arms Regiment camp, the residence of President Eyadema, who was not there at the time. It all began around 1830 GMT when gunshots from automatic weapons punctuated by explosions were heard for two hours at various areas in Lome, especially near the military camp. The security forces' reaction enabled them to kill seven of the attackers. Some of them allegedly managed to flee to Ghana, from where they reportedly came. An active search has been mounted for the others. It must be noted that the attack occurred just a few hours after the arrival of the French military observers in Lome and had virtually the same characteristics as that of 25 March 1993, during which 23 people died, including four senior officers. [end recording] Mr. (Jean-Pierre Fabre), spokesman for the Union of Forces of Change [UFC] -- Mr. Gilchrist Olympio's party -- has given his reaction. He is refuting allegations that the 5 January attack on the Inter-Arms Regiment camp was the opposition's doing. He spoke to Raphael Mbadinga a few minutes ago. [Begin recording] [(Fabre)] Last night a reporter alleged that the attack was from the opposition wing which refused to take part in the parliamentary elections. Of course, I strongly protest these unfounded statements. The UFC has always said that conditions of security and fairness have not been met for holding parliamentary elections. In our view, the minimum requirements we laid down have not been met; therefore, we said that if they were not met we would not take part in the elections. I think the facts confirm our analysis that there has been a recurrence of violence in Lome, which began around 1830 on 5 January. Shots are still being fired now. [Mbadinga] No, no it ended at 2130.... [(Fabre), interrupting] No, no, I live in a suburb near the Aflao border and at 0600 this morning there were still shots. [Mbadinga] You say that the opposition has nothing to do with this violence. Does the opposition suspect there is a lead on that? [(Fabre)] I would not like to comment on that, but I am inclined to think there is a mutiny at the military camp. I am inclined to favor that theory. [end recording]
