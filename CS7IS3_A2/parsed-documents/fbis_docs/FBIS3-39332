EC Industry Commissioner Martin Bangemann told journalists here that the private steel sector had been given until April to share out amongst themselves the required capacity cuts. He said the two to four million capacity reduction target was the bare minimum to destroy over-production of between 19 and 25 million tonnes of hot-rolled steel a year. Bangemann was speaking after a meeting with steel executives here on Tuesday to discuss the over-production crisis. "I think they got the message," he said, adding that he planned another meeting with the steelmen shortly before a gathering of EC industry ministers on April 22 to review the rescue plan. He repeated that the European Commission would abandon a plan to lend financial support for a slimming down of the steel industry unless the private sector accepted the Commission's capacity-cut targets. But Bangemann said the threat had nothing to do with the Commission's decision Wednesday to levy fines totalling ECU104 million (115 million dollars) on 16 European steel firms for running a cartel in steel beams. About one third of the total fine was levied on British Steel, and the fines provoked outrage in Britain. Reflecting British sentiment, Keith Brookman, general secretary of Britain's Iron and Steel Trades Confederation, suggested earlier that the fines might be a "blackmail tactic" to enforce the production cuts. The Commission's capacity reduction targets would mean scrapping at least 60,000 jobs -- a sacrifice deemed essential medicine for an industry buffetted by a steel glut, falling demand, plummetting prices and economic recession. Last December, EC governments agreed that the public sector steelworks would cut production by 5.5 million tonnes of hot-rolled steel a year, as a condition for allowing them last-time subsidies totalling about 7.5 billion dollars. Bangemann said there were indications that the private sector might be ready to slice capacity by about 11 million tonnes, leaving two to four million tonnes still to be found. But the private steelmakers are upset about continuing subsidies paid to their public sector competition in Spain, Germany, Italy and Portugal. They say they are being asked to shoulder an unfairly large share of the production sacrifice in the face of state-subsidised competition.
