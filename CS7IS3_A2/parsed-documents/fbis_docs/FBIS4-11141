Brum is an officer who was engaged in the operation against the numbers game operators. Brum's dismissal was decided at a meeting between former Rio de Janeiro Governor Leonel Brizola and leaders of the Democratic Labor Party [PDT]. Lieutenant Colonel Francisco Sergio Rangel, who has also taken action against the numbers game kingpins, will also be dismissed. Lieutenant Colonel Marcos Antonio Paes, chief of the PM Secret Service, who also actively participated in the operation, will be given a leave of absence on 28 April to take a course, and is not likely to resume his post. The three officers have always been praised by their PM superiors and by the Rio de Janeiro State Government, but they were criticized when they disclosed that politicians linked to the PDT were on the list of whose who received bribes from the numbers game kingpins. They have been charged with "planting" the names of Governor Batista and PDT congressmen. The dismissals have provoked indignation among the prosecutors who are handling the case, who once again contended that the list is genuine.
