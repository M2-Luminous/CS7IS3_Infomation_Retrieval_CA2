The defense minister stressed that Ukraine was a peaceful state, and the numerical strength of its Armed Forces would gradually decrease. Radetskyy added that Ukraine would actively take part in tackling European security issues. As for the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, he spoke in favor of its peaceful settlement. On the subject of the Black Sea Fleet, the defense minister said Ukraine primarily needed to make an inventory of the Black Sea Fleet's property as of December 1991 [date as received]. This work could be done by an interstate commission with the participation of independent experts and observers. The next stage should be reducing the fleet's existing group of forces, which now is a burden both for Ukraine and Russia. Putting these measures into practice, in Radetskyy's view, will prompt what to do with the Black Sea Fleet in the long run. As for the main base of the Ukrainian Navy, it is and will be in Sevastopol.
