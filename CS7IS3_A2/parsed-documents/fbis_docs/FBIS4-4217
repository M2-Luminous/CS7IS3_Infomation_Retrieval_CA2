After 1500 [local time] on the afternoon of 22 April, Hu Jintao and his party arrived by car in San Nicolas, a town located 30 km to the south of Buenos Aires. They enthusiastically visited the town's community training center. Hu Jintao came to the training center warden Cuellar's house first. Cuellar was about 50 years old and strong. He and his whole family happily welcomed the visiting CPC delegation. Touching the shoulder of Miguel, Cuellar's young son, Hu Jintao cordially asked: "How old are you?" The child bashfully answered: "Eight years old." His mother Naomi interrupted: "He was working at the vegetable farm just now." Hu Jintao praised him: "You really are a good boy." After hearing this, his parents smiled happily. Hu Jintao presented gifts of embroidered table cloth, a Chinese painting, and colorful velvet birds to Cuellar's family. Holding a velvet bird, young Miguel innocently asked: "Where did the bird come from?" Hu Jintao humorously said: "It flew over here from China." The answer made everyone laugh. Community training centers are a type of nongovernment educational organization that has appeared in Argentina in recent years. Their objectives are to train youngsters from poor areas to master certain skills to earn a living or get jobs. The government has affirmed the project and supplied partial subsidies. The San Nicolas Community Training Center has 17 teachers and nearly 100 students. It mainly teaches techniques for carpenters, bricklayers, blacksmiths, and vegetable farmers. Hu Jintao asked detailed questions on the course system, curricula, the number of students, and the source of funds. Personnel in charge of the training center answered all his questions in succession. Hu Jintao visited the training center's vegetable farm and noticed that sprinkling irrigation facilities -- made by students out of plastic bottles and plastic pipes -- were sprinkling water evenly on the young plants. He said happily: "These are home-made sprinkling irrigation facilities. The kids are very smart." It has been learned that the vegetable farm has been converted from a garbage dump. Vegetables growing in the farm include green lettuce, unripened tomatoes, big cabbages, eggplants, onions, and greens. Hu Jintao asked Orlando, a student working at the farm, how long he has been training. Orlando answered: "Two years." Hu Jintao asked again: "Can you properly handle a vegetable farm if one is handed over to you?" The student nodded and said: "Yes." The Chinese guest wished him success. Hu Jintao said to the teachers, students, and residents who gathered at the edge of the vegetable farm: "On behalf of the Chinese people, I am extending cordial greetings to you. The community conducts technical training classes to help youths get jobs in an effort to improve everyone's living standards. We are very interested in the project. Some people in China are still poor and the government is taking measures to help them shake off poverty. We have come to learn from your experiences." As soon as he finished, everyone energetically clapped their hands.
