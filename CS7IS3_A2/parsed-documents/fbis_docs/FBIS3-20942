But the European leader might come out stronger. Car manufacturers are like politicians or show biz stars. The higher we praise them, the quicker we are to dismiss them. Only two years ago, observers raved about the forced growth of Volkswagen, the undisputed European leader; today, many promise it the fate of dinosaurs. True, according to Ferdinand Piech, the German group is expected to lose Fr7 billion this year. True, the Wolfsburg manufacturer is forced to cut its workweek to 28.8 hours (instead of the present 36) in order to save 30,000 jobs. With a 10 percent wage cut. True, Volkswagen plants remained idle some 30 days between January and last October, Audi plants some 50 days over the whole year, and the Spanish subsidiary SEAT [Spanish Passenger Car Company] is operating in the red. True, the group's production dropped by 16 percent during the first nine months of the year--as much as the European market. True, production costs are still 15 percent higher than those of French competitors. True, finally, investments over the period 1994-1994 will be 20 percent below the fantastic forecasts of the group's former president, Carl Hahn. Yet, the position of the fourth largest manufacturer worldwide is in no way desperate. Having little debt, it launched a serious campaign last March to increase its productivity; it is known by the quite unpoetic name of KVP2. Already, 350 plants have been screened, with average competitiveness gains of 27 percent within just a few months. The group's models still enjoy a good reputation of quality, and high-level technology. Besides, although it is hardly represented in the United States, Volkswagen is the most international of European manufacturers: it is strongly established in East Europe and, during the first half of the year, it achieved sales of 167,000 vehicles in Brazil, 64,000 in China, and 75,000 in the Asia-Pacific area. Today, the patient is suffering but after a long period of recovery it should come out still stronger.
