According to GRANMA newspaper, the attorney general's office has reiterated that Decree Law No. 149 should not be and is not intended to be a crusade or witch hunt, but the beginning of a practice that should become an everyday affair, a resolution with a permanent nature. In principle, it has been demonstrated that the term money hoarder does not exempt any part of the population nor that the action taken is uncalled for, judging by what has been found. There are specific examples that demonstrate this, such as the case of the workshop administrator in Guira de Melena, who with a salary of 167 pesos per month, was the owner of four boats, a motorcycle, a truck, and several household appliances; or of another citizen in Pinar del Rio, who had four trucks, two cars, two motorcycles, a rice mill, a welding plant, six houses, more than 35,000 pesos, and large quantities of automobile parts, accessories, and tires. GRANMA newspaper also points out that the provincial prosecutors must act according to the methodological dispositions and not on whim. The process has been to make an inventory of the goods, leave some as a deposit, freeze certain assets, and seize others that are stored at an established place until the investigation has concluded, and a decision is made regarding the case. During this process, other hidden illegal activities may be found, including the use of forms to acquire profit, and the lack of control that has allowed state resources to end up in the hands of these individuals. Decree Law 149 has ceased to represent the money hoarders as cases on file. It has become action against those who enjoy a lifestyle that exceeds their income.
