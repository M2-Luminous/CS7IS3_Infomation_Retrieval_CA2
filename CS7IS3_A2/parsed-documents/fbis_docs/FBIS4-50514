The enterprises on sale have long suffered losses and have been on the verge of bankruptcy. The accumulated volume of losses amounted to more than 2 million yuan. The city previously adopted the contracting and leasing systems to save these enterprises. However, these systems have proved to be only slightly effective. In response, since 1993 the city has sent its work teams to carry out investigations to learn about their situation. These teams have also estimated their assets and had them form a list according to their different situation so that these enterprises can be sold all at once, sold by issuing shares, and sold by transferring the repayment of bank loans and debts. The city has sold all at once through public bidding the rubber plant, the fertilizer plant, and the daily chemical necessities plant because their management has been relatively poor and their losses have been serious. After the sale, these state-owned plants have become privately run enterprises. As for the vibration prescription equipment plant, whose equipment runs well, the department in charge of the sale has fixed its sale price at 1.1 million yuan and sold it by issuing shares to the 132 staff members and workers of the plant. As for the shoe general plant, the knitwear general factory, and the No.3 foodstuffs plant, whose debits and bank loans have been relatively large, the city has rented them out by transferring the repayment of their bank loans and debts. This means these plants can be leased in line with the negotiated prices without paying the entire sum for the deal, but have the renters be responsible for repaying the bank loans and debts. The property rights of these plants is owned by the staff members and workers. After the sale, all legal persons in these enterprises said: More persons have assumed responsibility in the enterprise at present, more personnel have taken charge of management, and more persons have a sense of crisis. Since the beginning of this year, the fertilizer plant has turned out more than 3,000 tonnes of compound fertilizer of various categories, showing a 50 percent increase over the same period of 1993. The mining parts plant has turned out more than 460 tonnes of steel ingots and shape steel products, topping the previous peak scored in the same period. The vibration prescription equipment plant has succeeded in increasing the variety of three new products within a short period of several months. Each share owned by the staff members and workers of the plant is expected to increase its value by 20 percent. The wages of staff members and workers in the fertilizer plant has shown a 100 percent increase over that before the sale.
