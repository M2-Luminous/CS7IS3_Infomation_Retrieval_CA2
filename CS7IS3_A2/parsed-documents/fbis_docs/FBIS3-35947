Without putting the results of last December's constitutional vote in doubt, Mr. Isakov still maintained that the contradictions inherent in the new constitutions will require amendments in the near future. Mr. Isakov told RIA, in particular, that the Constitution does not remove many contradictions between the executive and legislative authorities in Russia. At the same time, Mr. Isakov's interview implies that the former fervent proponents of the "Soviet" draft of the Constitution as opposed to Mr. Yeltsin's version have drawn lessons from last year's political developments and are not going to fan passions around the constitutional issue. Mr. Isakov said that the effort to elaborate cardinally new drafts of the Constitution will take place in the framework of public initiatives, but in no way in the Duma.
