Recently, 20 passenger aircraft delivered Kalashnikov ammunition and RPG-type missiles to Mazar-e Sharif airport. Sources close to militias say that Dostam-Golboddin's militias faced a shortages of arms and ammunition in the recent fighting, and that is why they are supplied from abroad. At the present, mojahedin of Balkh Province have the airport of Mazar-e Sharif under the pressure by heavy weapons in order to prevent the airport being used as a means for the continuation of foreigners' military interference. Also, the security officials say that a system that was guiding the aircraft was fired at by the air forces of the Islamic Army in the heights of Pul-e Khomri and was destroyed. The destruction of this system fully paralyzes the militias air power. Recently, militias had used training aircraft instead of fighter planes, and with the destruction of this system they have now been deprived of this as well.
