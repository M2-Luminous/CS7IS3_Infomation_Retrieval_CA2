FR940111-2-00098 FR940111-2-00060 III. Discussion Section 17A(b)(3)(A) of the Act 7 requires a clearing agency to be organized so as to enable it to enforce compliance by its participants with its rules. Section 17A(b)(3)(G) and section 17A(b)(3)(H) of the Act 8 require the rules of a clearing agency to provide that is participants shall be appropriately disciplined for violations of any provision of those rules and to provide fair procedures, consistent with section 17A(b)(5) of the Act, for disciplining participants. 9 Section 17A(b)(5) of the Act 10 outlines the procedures to be followed by a clearing agency in disciplining participants. A clearing agency must bring specific charges, notify the participant of the charges, provide the participant with an opportunity to defend against such charges, and keep a record. GSCC's proposal is consistent with the Act, and section 17A in particular, because it provides fair, efficient procedures for disciplining participants and enforcing its decisions as required by that section. 7 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1(b)(3)(A) (1988). 8 U.S.C. 78Q&hyph;1(b)(3)(G) & (H) (1988). 9 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 16900 (June 17, 1980), 45 FR 41920. 10 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1(b)(5) (1988). GSCC has specific rules governing the circumstances pursuant to which it may take certain disciplinary actions against a member, such as increasing a member's margin requirements, ceasing to act for a member, terminating a member's membership in either or both the comparison and netting systems, and/or liquidating a member's positions. Pursuant to recent changes in membership standards, GSCC also has rules governing the specific consequences of a failure of a member to maintain an applicable membership standard. 11 11 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32722 (August 5, 1993), 58 FR 42993 (order approving establishment of new categories of membership in the GSCC netting system). By providing a more formal process, the proposed rule change allows GSCC to more effectively discipline its members. Prior to imposing a sanction, members will be informed of the Committee's determination that a major or minor offense has occurred. This procedure may prevent future violations by providing members with early notice of a violation. In the case of a major offense, members must provide GSCC with a written explanation. This explanation may give GSCC guidance in determining the appropriate sanction to be imposed. The members are, in turn, permitted a greater opportunity to participate in the internal disciplinary process. By allowing the members to provide input, GSCC may be able to resolve disputes prior to an appeal to the Commission. The Commission believes that GSCC's proposal will enable it to discipline its members for rule violations, consistent with sections 17A(b)(3)(A) and 17A(b)(3)(G) of the Act. The Commission also believes that GSCC's proposed procedures are consistent with the fair disciplinary procedures requirement of section 17A(b)(3)(H), and with the mandatory procedures enumerated in section 17A(b)(5) of the Act. The proposal permits GSCC's Board to address rule violations fairly and efficiently. Members will be provided with notice of any disciplinary action to be taken by the Committee or the Board, including the reasons for the action. Members will be given two opportunities to have an internal hearing on the proposed sanction_before a panel of the Committee or Board, and before the full Board. IV. Conclusion For the reasons discussed above, the Commission finds that the proposal is consistent with the requirements of the Act, and particularly with section 17A of the Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder. It is therefore ordered, Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the above-mentioned proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;GSCC&hyph;93&hyph;06) be, and hereby is, approved. For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
