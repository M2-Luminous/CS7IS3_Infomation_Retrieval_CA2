At the beginning of the session President A. Akayev ran up to the podium with a red file in his hands. He stated literally the following: "I know that some deputies are collecting compromising evidence against me. This does not scare me. Moreover, I am asking the prosecutor general to check out the first document that has ended up in this file--a statement of the control chamber...." I will outline the content of this document for our readers. In the opinion of the control chamber, it has revealed egregious violations of legislation in the process of the receipt and disbursement of foreign exchange credit by a certain commercial company. The brother of the president's wife is the director of the company. Understandably, throughout the days following this event the parliament was abuzz and anxious as it discussed this unconventional conflict. On the last day, the general prosecutor reported on the results of the investigation. As many had expected, the prosecutor found all the arguments of the control chamber to be unsubstantiated. However, the picture changed abruptly when the deputies began to ask questions. First, it came out that the brother of the president's wife had right away transferred $1 million which had been borrowed at "a ridiculous rate of interest" to Vienna, to his son-in-law--the chairman of the National Bank. The latter purchased in Malta "merchandise that was most necessary for Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan]"--ladies' coats with fur collars and underwear--and shipped them to Bishkek. The slow-witted people were in no hurry to purchase the merchandise, and for this reason the foreign exchange still has not been recovered, although all the deadlines have long since passed. It was precisely these circumstances, rather than the legal intricacies, that outraged the deputies the most. For example, a female physician from Bishkek asked reasonably: "Do we really have no other way to spend foreign exchange? Give it to our hospital or buy medicines.... We do not have what we need to treat patients...." D. Tentiyev, general director of the Ilbirs Knitwear Association: "Had we purchased raw materials for this $1 million, the entire republic could have been buried under cheap underwear and clothing for children." Rural residents were outraged in particular. All their requests to help with purchasing gasoline for the planting campaign or fertilizer have invariably drawn the same response: There is no money. It turns out that Minister of Industry and Commerce A. Iordan offered this to the director of the commercial company even without a request: Take $1 million! Deputy from Dzhalal-Abad O. Tekibayev said: "The prosecutor's office may not be interested in the moral, ethical aspect of the issue. However, we cannot remain silent about the fact that since as early as the year before last earthquake victims have not had a roof over their heads. Hundreds of families who have lost their houses to landslides have now been added to the victims. And at such a time the president defends his relatives who are churning state dollars for their own benefit...." Incidentally, a blood-curdling episode occurred during the same days. Right on the steps of the White House (Bishkek also has one), a peasant was selling his child so that his other children might survive. It turned out that he had sold his tobacco and cotton to the state but was unable to get the money. Fervent monetarists were saying that a lot of cash cannot be issued, or there will be inflation. Such was the unexpected outcome of the president's attempt to whitewash his relatives and take in hand the "loudmouths and provocateurs," although, to tell you the truth, this entire session was given to such scandals and score-settling. Precisely while the session was in progress, the press reported that chief of the Issyk-Kul Oblast Administration Zh. Saadanbekov had repaired a two-story residence at the expense of the state and had privatized it free of charge right away. A huge downtown restaurant was sold at the price of a passenger car. The plague of corruption has reached even into the Ministry of Defense. Its employees have given hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash to commercial structures "on interest." Meanwhile, soldiers frequently faint of hunger and flee their units. The accusation of pouring it on too thick can be leveled against me. Unfortunately, only a fraction of the unseemly facts that were talked about at the session have been mentioned here. It was no accident that the deputies themselves established a special commission to "verify the purity and integrity" of their ranks, that is, those who, taking advantage of their positions, "grab-it-ized" houses, shops, hotels, and cars, and those who "churn" loans which the rural residents lack so badly. However, I am afraid that all these commissions, score-settling, and even dismissals and resignations will hardly change the situation radically. President A. Akayev responds to all sharply worded questions in the same manner: "they will give us credit," "they will help us, they will pay for us." Unfortunately, many problems are now solved in Kirghizia at this level. The Kazakhs will come to build the Naryn Hydropower Stations; the Russians will come to restore defense enterprises; and the Turks will come to build hotels. A. Akayev promised this to even the blind and the deaf who assembled in front of the parliament after the deputies had canceled all preferences for them: We will set up a foundation, and international organizations will help you. "We will get it, we will split it up, we will grow rich"--it appears that this formula is becoming increasingly dominant in the minds of present-day reformers. At any rate, almost nobody is talking about production. Prime Minister A. Dzumagulov makes some attempts to have society face real, specific endeavors. However, this policy does not enjoy any support from the president or his team. On the other hand, the reformers themselves are beginning to look askance at A. Akayev. An alarm signal sounded at this session. Three ambassador designates nominated by the president were not confirmed. For the second time they sent packing E. Karabayev, Akayev's closest comrade-in-arms, who headed his staff for a long time. First, they failed to confirm him as minister of foreign affairs, and this time--as ambassador to the United States. T. Chyngyshev, former prime minister, who did not resign of his own volition, also failed to become ambassador to the FRG. Just like E. Karabayev, he is "deeply privy" to the still smoldering "gold scandal." In deputy smoking rooms it was said: "They know too much." Therefore, on one hand, they needed to be bought off, while on the other--"sent far away." All the more so because T. Chyngyshev himself said directly in an interview to the newspaper POLITIKA that he was suffering "for someone else's fault" in the "gold affair." For whose fault can the number two person in the state suffer in silence? There is a reason they say in the Orient that all reassignments at the top are prepared "behind the scenes." I think that the "foreign exchange" and "gold" scandals mentioned here and mistakes in personnel selection are nothing other than reverberations of the skirmishes in the back rooms. Akayev's rating, which is declining more and more, points to the same. Recent surveys ranked him as low as seventh. The last meetings of the session indicated that the attitude toward the policy of the president and the government is undergoing a major change. People are losing hope that their lives will finally improve. At present city bazaars are piled high with relatively cheap meat. Rural residents are slaughtering cattle in order to survive. They have not been paid for a long time; the money is being kept in the basement of the national bank, thus preventing inflation. For the fourth year now almost no fertilizer has been applied on irrigated lands in the Chu Valley. This is what concerns people more than anything else. There is already a shortage of food for children, while the old, solidly designed economy has not ultimately fallen apart. Alas, the president prefers to talk about credit and the image of Kirghizia in the international arena. He is leaving for Paris again....
