Czaczkowska and Kazimierz Groblewski; place and date not given: "How Did It Happen? One Cannot Negate Everything"] [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Luczak] The Democratic Union, which is beyond a doubt the strongest party derived from Solidarity roots, keeps suffering defeats. The Solidarity camp failed to establish a party that would be a driving force for the transformations. Practically speaking, it is hard to tell what the social basis of Solidarity is now supposed to be. You keep asking: "How did you manage to score the [election] success?" I think the answer lies in the clarity of the social groups that both parties addressed: The Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] addressed urban residents, mainly laborers, whereas we addressed residents of rural areas, mainly farmers. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] But Solidarity parties also addressed the same social group. [Luczak] But Solidarity units kind of went against all that, and, in this way, they wasted their victory of 1989. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Don't think that what happened on 19 September was simply a matter of society displaying an opposite reaction? [Luczak] It is possible. We [the Polish Peasant Party (PSL)] and they [the SLD] are both at the stage of adapting ourselves to democracy. Before the elections, society supported the previous system very vigorously, but now, after four years have passed, society made a decision that now is the time for us. Those who are in power are always more vulnerable to criticism. But I would oppose it when someone says that our parties are postcommunist. Genealogy is what it is; everyone was born at some point. Take a look at the origins of some Solidarity activists. [passage omitted] [RZECZPOSPOLITA] But isn't it so that the main reason for the PSL's success [in the 19 September 1993 elections] was that the party guaranteed to maintain the status quo in rural areas and the areas' structure, that the PSL gave hope that nothing would change and that what was going on for four years will be slowed down, if not completely withdrawn? [Luczak] My view is that, as is the case with many other areas, agricultural changes must be evolutionary. Any type of action aimed at gaining a fast result is doomed to failure. Throughout the 1970's and the 1980's, the authorities were afraid of farmers. They were afraid to interfere with farmers' property so they maintained the status quo. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] So you [PSL activists] decided to echo the authorities by saying: Let the rural areas remain the way they are. [Luczak] Belarusians or Ukrainians would give a lot in return for being able to have the kind of rural areas we have. We, on the other hand, have them but are not happy anyway. Unless appropriate means are directed to rural areas, nothing will come of policies written down on paper. Even if those means are indeed directed there, I am terribly skeptical as far as agricultural reforms are concerned. I can see that the civilized world is helpless when faced with agricultural problems. [Excerpts] [RZECZPOSPOLITA] So, in your view, problems in rural areas are unsolvable? [Luczak] They can be solved, but that is very hard to do because, with current technologies, one can lead to the kind of growth of agricultural output that is almost without limits. That, of course, causes rules of employment to change. There is also a clash with routine ways of behavior, with attachment to land, and with tradition. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] You promised before the [19 September] elections that you would find such appropriate financial means for rural areas, as well as subsidies and inexpensive credits. But now it turns out that there is not enough money in the budget; even your own Sejm deputies club is critical of that. [Luczak] There is more money in the budget than was the case last year, but there is still not enough for everyone. Those who think that one can achieve progress in that area in a very short time are wrong. The purpose of our election program was to convince people, and my view is that it was done well. But another issue is that the program's implementation must be spread out over time. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Is it your view that the fall in popularity rating for the United Peasant Party-PSL in the period preceding the 1989 and 1991 elections was just temporary, or is it perhaps the case that the PSL's current success is just temporary? What is permanent? [Luczak] Nothing in this world is permanent. We are all just a passing phase.... Not to waste the great victory--that is what wise behavior should be about, in this situation. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] All right, but we will have self-governmental elections shortly. [Luczak] Let it all boil there, in that melting pot. Then it will turn out that some people are destined to be in office two years, whereas other people four years. We have a democracy now, and there is nothing permanent in a democracy. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] So you can imagine the PSL not being permanent? [Luczak] As a peasant movement, we have a hundred years behind us, and I would not like to live long enough to see the movement's end. I will always keep saying that the peasant movement has achieved the most now, when you take a look at its entire history. I think it is likely that, in the future, we may be in the opposition, that we will be a party without successes. But that possibility is a feature of democracy. The peasant movement may go through a worse period of its history, but the most important thing is that it be on the list of those parties that will be permanently participating in the country's political life over the next two decades. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Can you imagine a situation where a completely different party would gain the votes of your electorate, whereas you would disappear from the scene and become a very small, a miniature kind of party? [Luczak] It is possible theoretically, but I think we have enough common sense in what we do to not let that happen. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] You are a class party, the last of your kind. Will such parties continue to exist much longer? [Luczak] There is a whole debate going on about whether we are a class party or an all-nation one. An all-nation party was being built beginning in the early 1940's, from the days of Mikolajczyk. But the fact that it is so hard for us to detach ourselves from the class nature is a consequence of tradition and of various interdependencies linked to it. We are a young society, genealogically speaking. The first generations made up of laborers and intelligentsia are always very negatively predisposed toward their rural origins. We gained big support in rural areas; that group of people was convinced by what we told them. But I think that, in terms of a party program, we are not a class party but one whose program is for all social groups. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Will the PSL "guarantee everyone profitability of agricultural production through the selling of their products?" You know where that quote is from--your campaign leaflet. [Luczak] There is nothing you can guarantee forever in a market economy. Every artificial creation will prove impossible to implement after some time passes. But it would also be a bad thing if one were to discontinue measures aimed at guaranteeing the profitability of production. Everyone wants to receive the kind of payment for his work that would compensate for the labor he invested. If you have a peasant investing more in his production than what he receives after selling the product (I am ignoring here his own labor for the moment), that is morally repugnant and economically unacceptable, and, in that case, perhaps one should guarantee the profitability of agricultural production through administrative measures. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] That would be a complete return to the old ways. [Luczak] No one will do it generally and as a wide-sweeping measure. But to promote agricultural production and to preserve certain types of crops, one must create the right conditions to make profitability clearly visible. But we will not go back to quotas or uniform prices throughout the country. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Does a politician feel ashamed at any time? I mean the kind of shame when he promises something during an election campaign but later, when his party is in power and he has the means to implement it, he fails to do what he promised. I am saying that because you sound as if you assumed from the very beginning that what you had talked about will not be implemented. [Luczak] You cannot approach politics in a way that is detached from reality, nor can you, I would say, approach politics in moral terms only. Politics has its own rules. One knows from the very beginning that nothing contained in an election program can be implemented right away. Such is the case the world over. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Are you saying one should not believe politicians? [Luczak] Politics is an art of talking to society. There definitely should be a certain margin of confidence, but not "from wall to wall." There must be a certain margin, there must be something that binds society together, something that will make it... [RZECZPOSPOLITA] ...Decide that the thing is lost? [Luczak] Well, yes. Such are the rules of the game. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Your government implements to a large extent the program of the previous cabinets. [Luczak] It is a very good thing that there are no major turning points; society would not stand for that. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] But, in that case, don't you think there is room on the political scene for the kind of PSL the people think it is or for the kind they voted for? While in power now, the PSL is doing something different from what it promised. [Luczak] How many times did we have radicals, socialists, or Christian-democratic activists in power--I am talking about other countries now--and then it seemed it was the end, but they gained power again. There is something in nations, in society, something... [RZECZPOSPOLITA] ...Irrational? [Luczak] No, I mean more like expecting a change. Once the new governing team brings disappointment, nostalgia for the past is born. It was better in the old days.... [RZECZPOSPOLITA] ...And we were younger then? [Luczak] Exactly. So people say: Let us go back to that now; let us not vote for those who are in power now. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] So that means party programs have nothing to do with choices, but, instead, there are simply some stages? A party leaves and another comes along. So, in your view, party programs are completely meaningless? [Luczak] You keep trying to make me say that election promises are just black and white. That is not true. In my view, when something is black only or white only, that is a very bad thing because it gives rise to extremes--for instance, communism or fascism. Poland has entered the kind of phase where parliamentary coalitions will be establishing cabinets, and, after gaining power, these coalitions will mark their identity on the political scene not by making something black and white but by approaching social needs and privatization needs in a different manner. And once social moods take a swing in the other direction, there will be different priorities visible. Politics cannot be black and white. Countries that want to be stable and play even a small role must counteract extremes to enable them to keep moving down the same road but in a slightly different groove. We may see that happen in Poland. When it comes to election campaigns, they are based on their own rules. During an election campaign, you must present programs, you must speak through slogans because you are talking to people who often see a politician for the first time. These people would be bored if you tried to detail the program item by item. So you must use simple words like "here," "now," "we," "nobody again," "never." But the people must understand that, if a particular coalition is back in power, particular issues will be focused on more. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] What role did the church play in the PSL's success in the most recent elections? Do you think the church has reached the stage of regarding the PSL as "its own" party? [Luczak] The church did not involve itself unequivocally on either our side or anyone else's. I would regard it as a sign that the church refuses to involve itself politically. The church's neutral position during the election campaign--not telling people who to vote for--objectively helped us. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] I am wondering whether the ability to create the view among people that the PSL is both a left-wing party and a Catholic one is not a prescription for your next success. [Luczak] That is a special trait displayed by parties active in rural areas. We are a party that, from the very beginning of its activity, has always wanted to have good rapport with the church, in terms of both religion and the philosophy of life. But, beginning with Witos, the PSL did not want to have the church as its patron. Peasants wanted to decide on their own which direction their policies should take. True, there were cases of priests who wanted to be in command of the peasant movement, but these measures ended in failure. Generally speaking, the peasant movement was with God, but it refused to act with the church as its patron. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] A politician said that we will have a PSL-Belvedere coalition in power by year's end. [Luczak] No, no. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] We will probably know the names of presidential candidates at the end of the year. Will that be a cause for disagreement with the SLD. In other words, will you come up with your own candidate? [Luczak] I cannot imagine the PSL running in the presidential elections in the coalition. The PSL will come up with its own candidate. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Who will that be? [Luczak] [No response published] [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Will your candidate compete with the SLD's? [Luczak] The governing coalition is one thing, but presidential elections are quite another. Despite the complexity of the issue, presidential campaigns are always very personalized. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] The previous presidential elections extracted a heavy toll on the Solidarity camp. Will these coming ones have a destructive effect on the coalition? [Luczak] At that time, the starting point was different--the Solidarity camp constituted a whole that all of a sudden cracked during the election campaign. Despite the coalition nature of our government, I think we do not constitute a whole, either in terms of ideology or party programs. The governing coalition was set up for a defined period of time, with the goal of implementing the tasks defined in the coalition agreement. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Don't you dream of a demonstration on Aleje Ujazdowskie under the banner "Out with Luczak, out with [Prime Minister] Pawlak, out with the PSL and [chief of the Office of the Council of Ministers] Strak"? [Luczak] I have a view on this that boils down to this: When you dream of something, it will not come true. So may I have only such dreams and not other kinds.
