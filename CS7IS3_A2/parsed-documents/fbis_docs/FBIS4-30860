Setting aside the fact that foreign partners very often do not know whom to address, do you not think that the control over this vital sector of the national economy has lost some of its operational effectiveness and efficiency? [Zieleniec] I resolutely reject the use of the term "control of foreign trade," since the conditions for the functioning of the entire economy, and foreign trade as a part thereof, have to be created in cooperation among many ministries. Specifically, foreign policy creates general prerequisites for the development of trade, it opens political opportunities, and sees to it that our entrepreneurs are not discriminated abroad, and so forth. This, however, has nothing to do with the control of foreign trade. The control of foreign trade is exactly what we had here in Czechoslovakia under communism. The fact that we have got rid of it shows how far we have progressed in economic and institutional reforms. If we want our foreign trade to become an organic part of our economic life -- which is based on private initiative -- then we have to create equal conditions for both foreign and domestic trade. [Sklenka] I do not want to argue about little words, but a number of post-communist countries, and also industrially advanced countries, have, within the framework of their state administration, certain bodies for controlling foreign trade at their disposal, such as ministries of external economic relations. [Zieleniec] A ministry of external economic relations is something other than the Ministry of Foreign Trade. In the Czech Republic, too, it ensues from the law on power-sharing that the Foreign Ministry has within its jurisdiction, among other things, the coordination of external economic relations. It is a question of how the state administration is organized, whether it establishes an independent body for this purpose, or not. It is also true that many countries have a different opinion on this matter, above all, other postcommunist countries that had ministries of foreign trade in the past. In most cases, they have kept them. If we look at them more carefully, however, for instance, at Poland -- which even has the Central Planning Commission -- we will see that the institutional structure in these countries is directly connected, to a certain extent, with the state of reforms there. [Sklenka] Let us return to the direct connection between trade and diplomacy. Without doubt, foreign trade is an inseparable part of foreign service. How does the Foreign Ministry want, in this connection, to support Czech exports and open new markets to our exporters? [Zieleniec] The role of diplomacy is immensely important in that respect. First, it is necessary for the foreign service to exactly monitor the political and macroeconomic situation in other countries, and be able to point to the opportunities that exist for the expansion of Czech trade on the markets there. At the same time, it is necessary to secure an efficient information channel so that required information might get, as fast as possible, to the hands of not only the state administration bodies, but, above all, to our entrepreneurial public. Either directly, or through the Economic Chamber, the Union of Industry and Transportation, stock market, or other institutions. I consider the propagation of the Czech Republic abroad to be no less important in the work of the foreign service. This not only applies to general information, but also to specific business opportunities, conditions for investors, legislative regulations for conducting business on the Czech market, and establishing joint firms. [Sklenka] Much has been said about the fact that, apart from the representative offices, this function will be secured by the so-called Czech Centers in the future. [Zieleniec] Yes, these organizations, founded by the Foreign Ministry, will function on semi-commercial basis. It signifies a certain transformation of our former cultural centers into information and commercial centers. Their task will be to provide not only general information about investment opportunities in the Czech Republic and about the export and import conditions, but, on the basis of demands by specific entrepreneurial entities, also to organize industrial expositions, secure public relations, and mediate marketing studies for state institutions, as well as for private entrepreneurs. [Sklenka] The Czech Centers, if the entire project is implemented as planned, are certainly an appropriate step on the way to a more specific definition of the Czech proexport policy. Up to now, we have had such centers, de facto, only in former socialist countries, and not the capitals of industrially advanced countries that are centers of world trade. In view of the fact that our export is mostly oriented toward the West, we need them precisely there. [Zieleniec] Of course, under socialism we had centers in Sofia, but not in New York, in Warsaw but not in Paris, we had them in Budapest, but not in London. This is why we are trying intensively to remedy this situation, without abolishing the existing network. Due to the fact that the centers are being established on the basis of intergovernmental treaties, they enjoy certain advantages abroad, advantages that a regularly registered firm does not enjoy there. The Czech Republic is a small industrial country that is dependent on wide contacts with the world. Our open foreign policy and liberal trade policy correspond to this. [Sklenka] Despite the fact that our trade policy is liberal, many people believe that it is not proexport enough. Czech exports may have grown by more than 18 percent last year, nevertheless, their structure has only slightly improved and still remains on the level of a developing country. In exports to the OECD countries, machines and equipment represent only some 22 percent of the overall volume. What does the government want to do about this? [Zieleniec] Within the framework of support to export, the state furnishes the entrepreneurial sphere with very important public goods [verejny statek], which is the koruna's proexport exchange rate. This precisely was, and still is, the engine of the enormous boom in Czech exports. It is a great advantage that the state deliberately tries to maintain our foreign trade as a dynamic element in the development of the Czech economy. [Sklenka] However, the koruna's proexport exchange rate has fallen by about one-third during past three years, and is still falling, which is a proof that this comparative advantage is only of short duration. Do you not think that the state should do something more for restructuring exports [komoditni reorientace] and making exports "healthier?" [Zieleniec] Yes, proexport tools such as the insurance of exports, long-term export loans at competitive interest rates, etc., we mentioned very frequently, but, today, we have institutions for this purpose. Apart from the functioning insurance company EGAP, Ceska Exportni Banka [Czech Export Bank] has been established recently. The state does for our entrepreneurs everything possible that is in its power, since proexport policy is an inseparable part of its economic policy and foreign policy, but the state cannot directly conduct business on behalf of enterprises. If it did, then it could also draft plans for them, for example. We had this here before, but it did not prove to be good. Nevertheless, this does not mean that the state will not engage in business in certain specific cases. For instance, if the export of large investment units is involved, in which the state is interested, the state may help not only politically, but also directly -- financially, for example. This is the genuine essence of the mechanism of support to foreign trade that our government is pushing for. This is precisely the proexport regime that we consider to be the most economic.
