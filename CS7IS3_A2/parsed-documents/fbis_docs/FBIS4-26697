May's overall economic performance received a score of 28 points on the CEPD-designed monitoring scale, up 2 points from April and also the highest level so far this year, the council said. It was the sixth straight month the domestic economy has received a "green" rating. The index of leading economic indicators, which gauges the country's economic prospects for the next three to five months, rose 0.9 percent from April to reach a five-year high of 114.8. However, the index of coincident economic indicators, which measures economic performance for the month, dropped 0.5 percnt from April to 138.2 mainly because of a slight decrease in manufacturing sales due to seasonal factors. CEPD officials said the rise in the leading index indicates the economy will continue to grow steadily in the months ahead. Of the nine indicators the CEPD regularly monitors to measure the overall economic performance, five remained in the "green light" category in May. They were the industrial production index, the nonfarm-sector employment rate, manufacturing inventory, new orders received by manufacturers and bank loans. Two indicators -- the stock index and the M1b money supply growth -- were upgraded from the "green" rating in April to the more bullish "yellow-red" rating, and the check-default rate also improved from the gloomy "blue" rating to the "yellow-blue" category. Only one indicator -- the export growth rate -- was downgraded. It slipped from the "green" category to the "yellow-red" rating. Hung Hui-yen, a section chief at the CEPD's Economic Research Department, said May's factory facility utilization rate reached 78.8 percent, up 1.3 percent from the same month of 1993 and a two- year high. The profit rate for local manufacturers also reached a 22-month high of 6.1 percent in May, Hung reported. Moreover, manufacturing sales and new orders grew by 6.1 percent and 10.7 percent, respectively, from the year-earlier levels. "All these figures show the domestic economy will grow even faster in the second half of this year," Hung noted. A recent CEPD survey of local manufacturers also reflected optimism about the country's future economic prospcts, Hung said. The survey found that 28 percent of manufacturers interviewed said they believe economic prospects will continue improving in the months ahead; 59 percent said the economy will remain almost the same, and only 13 percent said they are pessimistic about their business prospects.
