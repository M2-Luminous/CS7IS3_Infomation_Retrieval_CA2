About 75,000 people waited much of the day for the ANC president at Miami Beach, a popular picnic resort at the dusty Vaal Triangle township where police shot dead 69 protesters 34 years ago. Just how much has changed in the intervening years was demonstrated by the brazen display of weaponry, including AK-47 rifles, handguns, axes and assegais carried by rallygoers. Sporadic gunfire was heard from time to time and stones were thrown at people who refused to sit when the ANC president began his address. Earlier marshals battled to control the crowd as it thronged forward to get a glimpse of Mr Mandela when he arrived. Nobody appeared to be injured but several people fainted due to the heat. There were anxious moments as mr mandela's motorcade inched through the crowd. Mr Mandela, thanking the crowd for their turnout, then lashed out at the ANC's organisers. "I must condemn in the strongest terms their lack of organisation and their inability to anticipate the crowds. "It's lucky that nobody has died. I don't want to see this again. If I see such a mess I will have to deal with the region and the branch," he said. At one stage, Mr Mandela stopped his address to remonstrate with some "ruffians" and at another point he complained about the rough manner in which marshals handled the crowd. Mr Mandela, referring to the 1960 killings, said there would never be a Sharpeville again. He then turned to the election campaign, saying the ANC wanted a better life for all. That included houses, education and medical care. He said the ANC's opponents said the ANC was being over-ambitious. What they meant by this, he said, was that providing social services to blacks would be too costly. But the ANC was determined to go ahead with its plans whether its opponents liked it or not. "The National Party has never cared for the masses of this country," he said. Mr Mandela, referring to the interim Goldstone Commission report concerning alleged gunrunning said to involve senior policemen, he said there were good policemen in the force and good soldiers in the South African Defence Force. He then led the crowd through the voting procedure, telling them they must look for his face on the ballot paper and put their cross alongside that face. The roads of Sharpeville were crowded with buses taking supporters home when the rally finished. Sporadic gunfire punctuated the din. Earlier, Pan Africanist Congress [PAC] President Clarence Makwetu addressed about 3,000 people at the George Thabe stadium about three kilometres away. Mr Makwetu said the ANC had not wanted to become involved when the PAC launched the pass protests that led to the Sharpeville killings. He said only the PAC had stuck to its principles and only the PAC could ensure real liberation. The PAC's rhetoric at the rally, complete with "one settler, one bullet", was more militant than the ANC version. But the gathering itself was quieter.
