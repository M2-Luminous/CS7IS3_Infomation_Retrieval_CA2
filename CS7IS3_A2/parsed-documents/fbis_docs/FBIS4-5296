This is the first time that the prices of steel plates supplied to automakers have been cut since 1989. Automakers, eager to quickly reduce their production costs, have strongly urged major steelmakers to lower their prices on steel plates. Major steelmakers have gone along with the request because of the wide price differentials existing between Japanese-produced plates and those of other nations. With the prices of steel plates set to be lowered, the manufacturers of rubber, nonferrous metals, and plastic products will certainly be pressed to lower their prices. Negotiations are now under way between major steelmakers and commercial electric appliance makers on price cuts, and the prices of steel plates supplied to electric appliance makers are expected to be lowered by about 4 percent. The prices of surface-processed steel plates, cold-rolled steel plates, and hot-rolled steel plates will be reduced. In the case of cold-rolled steel plates that are used to manufacture car bodies, both major steelmakers and automakers appear to have agreed to lower their prices from 90,000 yen to 85,000 yen per ton. Automakers have adopted a concentrated purchase system under which they make a large purchase of steel plates which they then sell to their subsidiaries which manufacture auto parts. Automakers have pressed them to sharply cut their production costs in order to bolster their international competitiveness. Auto parts makers are increasingly voicing complaints about the prices of steel plates supplied by automakers that are higher than those on the open Japanese and foreign markets. Major steelmakers which registered large deficits in their 1993 settlement of accounts have gone along with the request.
