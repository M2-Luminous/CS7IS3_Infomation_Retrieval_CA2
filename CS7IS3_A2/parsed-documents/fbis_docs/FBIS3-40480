This measure was taken out of consideration for the fact that ocean dumping of radioactive waste by Russia has rapidly strengthened sentiment for a total ban on ocean dumping. The government has expressed the plan to vote in favor of a total ban on ocean dumping at a conference of London Treaty signatories, which will convene in London on 8 November, and the JAEC's decision confirms this. STA says that ``this will not affect Japan's nuclear energy policy immediately'' because Japan is not dumping in the ocean at this time. The JAEC maintains that ocean dumping of low level radioactive nuclear waste has no special effect on public health according to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) standards. However, judging from the Japanese and international reaction to ocean dumping by Russia, it believes that ``from a political and social viewpoint, it would be extremely difficult to carry out ocean dumping.'' It says that hereafter, ``underground burial will be used,'' and it is seeking to expand those facilities.
