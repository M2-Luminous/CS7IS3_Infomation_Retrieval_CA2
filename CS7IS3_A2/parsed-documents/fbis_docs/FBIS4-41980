Today he met Viktor Mikhaylov, Russian minister for atomic energy. Problems of ensuring the safety of weapons-grade uranium and plutonium released during the dismantling of nuclear warheads were discussed. Other topics under discussion included the safety of storing radioactive elements and joint projects to ensure safety at atomic power stations. In a conversation with journalists Hans Blix highly appraised the prospects for the best Russian atomic technological processes in the world markets, first and foremost in the area of state-of-the-art reactor technology, and the production of isotopes and of enriched uranium. The IAEA general director also gave new details concerning the North Korean nuclear problem. The agency extended to the DPRK technical assistance in the area of development of atomic power engineering for peaceful purposes only, checking the activities which have been officially notified and the relevant nuclear facilities and materials. The IAEA began to suspect Pyongyang of concealing certain data and of supplying incomplete and inaccurate data. In an attempt to have the situation clarified, the IAEA demanded that two new facilities should be made available for inspection. The conflict began when Pyongyang refused. So far it is difficult, on the basis of the current data, to speculate how close North Korea is to making nuclear weapons.
