Delegation head Li Ping told a group of Amman World Trade Centre members that "frankly speaking, we still don't know very much about the Jordanian market." The CCPIT team Thursday visited the Jordan Trade Association (JTA), The Amman World Trade Centre (AWTC) and the Jordan Export Development and Commerical Centres Corporation (JEDCO), where it was addressed by Marwan 'Awad, the secretary-general of the Ministry of Industry and Trade. Both the members of the JTA and Mr. Awad emphasised to Mr. Ping that Jordan wished to see greater equality in the current trade balance between the two countries. Although official figures vary, Jordan currently imports from China a little over three times in value as it exports there. "I think that it is our responsibility as well as yours to bridge the trade gap," Mr. 'Awad told the Chinese team. In that area, he stated, discussions were underway between the two countries on how to structure Jordan's repayments of some $47 million in debts due to China from foreign aid, and that the loans would be repaid by Jordan partly in commodities. "Although the amount of commodities involved will be relatively small, it will give us the chance to introduce some of our products to the Chinese market." Mr. Ping stated at the meeting with JTA members, however, that "an actual balance in bilateral trade may be very difficult to achieve." Mr. Ping told the JORDAN TIMES that "the two countries' economic complementarity is not very large, and Jordanian products suitable to China are few." "The key point, and one which we are stressing very heavily to the Jordanians, is that they need to provide us with detailed information and specific lists of suitable products which we could select from. Our attitude is positive," he said, but the bottom line regarding hard benefits of any imported Jordanian commodities to china and their price range still had to be adhered to. Mr. Ping told the JORDAN TIMES that China's economy was currently undergoing near-explosive expansion, with last year seeing a 12 per cent economic growth rate and an overall foreign trade increase of 18 per cent. "Last year, our total import value reached $104 billion, a 29 per cent increase over the previous year, so you see that we are looking for suitable products with great urgency." He said that China's current main needs were in the areas of technology and infrastructure development, specifically in the areas of air, land and sea transport and transport facilities, telecommunications and communications network development, energy technology and raw materials processing technology, and modernisation of China's agricultural sector. "All of these are top priorities for China's development. With regard to these areas, China has great demand for import. But the key issue is, once again, what products does Jordan have that are suitable for our market." At the Amman World Trade Centre, the AWTC's members told Mr. Ping that one important area for improvement in Sino-Jordanian commece was in the field of banking communications. There were no direct routes of correspondence between Jordanian and Chinese banks, and the banks from both sides had very limited knowledge of each other, which leads to indirect and inefficient routing of bank transaction and transfers, long delays and added costs. Overall, they told Mr. Ping, this present situation cramps trade between the two countries greatly. They suggested the establishment of a comprehensive communications network between Jordanian and Chinese banks as well as exchange of information between the two banking communities. They also suggested that the Bank of China open a major branch office sometwhere in the Middle East. Mr. Ping concurred with the AWTC members, saying that banking and its development in China had not kept pace with overall economic growth, and that foreign banks had only recently begun to establish branch offices in China, and on a limited scope. Wang Yuechun, third secretary at the Chinese Embassy commerical office in Amman, told the JORDAN TIMES that in the future, China planned to send trade delegations to the West Bank and Gaza Strip. He said that China was very interested in assisting in the rebuilding of the Palestinian economy and that China's motives in the case were not merely economic, but political as well, as China had long been in sympathy with the Palestinian people and "their struggle to regain their rights and dignity."
