The officials said the nation will donate blankets, sleeping mats and portable kerosene stoves for victims of the disaster, in which up to two dozen people died, many more went missing and thousands were left homeless. Three days of heavy rains in the country's central Andean region caused the Fraile River to burst through its banks, sending forth a giant wave of mud and rocks that swept away hundreds of homes in such towns as Florida, Pradera and Tulua.
