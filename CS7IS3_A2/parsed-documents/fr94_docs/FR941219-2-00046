Frequency of Response: On occasion reporting requirement. Estimated Annual Burden: 33,600 responses, .5 hours average burden per response, 16,800 hours total annual burden. Needs and Uses: On 11/10/94, the Commission adopted a Sixth Order on Reconsideration, Fifth Report and Order, and Seventh Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, in MM Docket No. 93&hyph;215, Implementation of Sections of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, Rate Regulation. In this Order, we added rules establishing an additional cable programming service tier (CPST) category which we refer to a new programming tier (NPT). Section 76.987(g) requires cable operators to file with the Commission, within 30 days of offering a NPT, a copy of the new rate card that contains the following information on the BSTs (basic service tiers), CPSTs, and NPTs: 1) the names of the programming services contained on each tier; and 2) the price of each tier. Operators also must file with the Commission, copies of notifications that were sent to subscribers regarding the initial offering of NPTs. After this initial filing, cable operators must file updated rate cards and copies of customer notifications with the Commission within 30 days of rate or service changes affecting the NPT. The information is used by FCC staff to ensure that cable operators are complying with our conditions for NPTs, i.e., that operators are not making fundamental changes to what they offer on their tiers of service, and that subscribers are given due notice of NPT introductions.
