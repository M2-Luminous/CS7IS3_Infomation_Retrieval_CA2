Some compensate their temporary suspension by larger volume. The Sofia dailies, as well as most provincial ones, did not come out for four days in protest against the value-added tax introduced as of April 1, which newsmen call a "killer-tax" that will ruin the Bulgarian press and book publishing. A bill exempting the media from VAT is expected to be included as item No. 1 in today's agenda of parliament.
