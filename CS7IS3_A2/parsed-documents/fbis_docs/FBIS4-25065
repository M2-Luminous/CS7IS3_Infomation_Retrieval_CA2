By concentrating their efforts on investigating and cracking down on serious and appalling economic cases, they have recovered the embezzled money and articles worth more than 1.05 billion yuan Renminbi and retrieved a tremendous amount of economic losses for the state in a timely manner. Economic offenders are criminals with strong covertness. As a heavy industrial base in the country, Liaoning Province has more than 1,000 large and medium-sized enterprises. Under the condition of building a market economic structure, these enterprises are shifting their track; changing their style; and entering the markets. During the period, various social problems caused by the economy have steadily cropped up and economic swindling cases in some localities have rapidly increased. Of these cases, serious and appalling ones have sharply increased and the volume of funds involved in these cases has become increasingly large. In 1993 the province as a whole incurred 85 economic cases and each of them involved more than 1 million yuan. Of these cases, 10 involved more than 10 million yuan. The province's number of such cases has been rare since the founding of the PRC. By regarding the work of safeguarding the economic order as their own duty and persistently regarding the cases that are exerting large harm and influence as the focal points of attack, the departments in charge of economic crime investigation under the public security organs throughout the province have investigated and wound up more than 10,000 cases of various economic crimes by adopting effective measures and methods and boldly overcoming the difficulties. They have arrested more than 9,000 criminal elements and recovered a large amount of funds and articles for the state. Recently, Vice Governor Cong Zhenglong paid a special visit to the provincial public security department to speak highly of the achievements scored by the departments in charge of economic crime investigation under the public security organs across the province.
