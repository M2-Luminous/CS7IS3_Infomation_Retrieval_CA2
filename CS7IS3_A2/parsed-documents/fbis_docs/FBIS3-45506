In an interview carried in the latest issue of the fortnightly magazine, CHINA'S TALENTS, Qiao, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), said that China has to explore ways to shift from a planned economy to a market economy and to introduce a corresponding legal system. Since 1979 the NPC and its Standing Committee have adopted promulgated 200 laws and regulations, he said, adding that a number of important laws will be enacted in the near future. The enforcement of these laws have guided, standardized and guaranteed the creation of a market economy, he noted. Qiao, who is also a Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, stressed that the NPC and its Standing Committee must act promptly to formulate laws to standardize market behavior, protect the order of a market economy, and improve macro-economic control and social guarantee. "The enactment of laws in these areas is essential to the establishment and perfection of a socialist market economy," the leader said. Qiao also stressed the importance of using laws to guide, promote and guarantee the smooth progress of the reforms, and to provide a legal basis for the growth of a market economy. Meanwhile, laws, decrees and regulations short of the need of the market economy must be either revised or abolished in time, he said. He said that in formulating laws concerning the market economy, it was imperative to follow the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and act in the spirit of the party's 14th National Congress and in accordance with China's Constitution. While formulating such laws, he said, "we must proceed from the reality in China, and make an extensive study and draw on the experience of the rest of the world." All new laws must be made to facilitate the expansion of China's economy, and stability and unity throughout the country, he stressed. "Since a market economy is an open one geared up with the global market, Chinese laws governing the market economy must be compatible with relevant laws in other countries and internationally accepted practices," he pointed out. That approach will not only quicken the pace of China's economic legislation, but also enable China to adapt to the world economy and to participate in global economic competition, he added. Qiao Shi also noted that only by taking educational, administrative, legal and other measures can successes be scored in the anti-corruption campaign. Over the past few years, the NPC and its Standing Committee have enacted a series of new laws to crack down on embezzlement, bribery, smuggling, prostitution, and drug trafficking and abuse, he said. The leader also stressed the importance of formulating and perfecting laws regarding the building of a clean government by studying characteristics and circumstances in combating corruption under a socialist market economy. In conclusion, he expressed the belief that the establishment of a legal system governing the market economy will certainly help prevent corruption most effectively.
