FR940713-0-00042 FR940713-0-00019 Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures This action was not reviewed under the Executive Order. NHTSA has considered the impact of this rulemaking action under the Department of Transportation's regulatory policies and procedures and determined that this action is not significant within the meaning of those policies and procedures. This final rule gives manufacturers the option of complying either with the current requirements of Standard No. 209, or the requirements of Standard No. 209 as amended by the April 15, 1994 final rule, which will be effective October 12, 1994. Accordingly, this final rule will not impose any costs on manufacturers. The impacts are thus so minimal that a full regulatory evaluation was not prepared. Regulatory Flexibility Act NHTSA has also considered the impacts of this final rule under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I hereby certify that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. As explained above, the agency has determined that this final rule will not have any cost impacts. Accordingly, a regulatory evaluation has not been prepared for this final rule. Paperwork Reduction Act In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (P.L. 96&hyph;511), there are no requirements for information collection associated with this final rule. National Environmental Policy Act NHTSA has also analyzed this final rule under the National Environmental Policy Act and determined that it will not have a significant impact on the human environment. Executive Order 12612 (Federalism) Finally, NHTSA has analyzed this rule in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in E.O. 12612, and has determined that this rule will not have significant federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Civil Justice Reform This final rule does not have any retroactive effect. Under 49 U.S.C. 30103, whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety standard is in effect, a State may not adopt or maintain a safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance which is not identical to the Federal standard, except to the extent that the State requirement imposes a higher level of performance and applies only to vehicles procured for the State's use. 49 U.S.C. 30161 sets forth a procedure for judicial review of final rules establishing, amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. That section does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court. Issued on July 8, 1994. Christopher A. Hart, Deputy Administrator. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;17000 Filed 7&hyph;12&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;59&hyph;P
