"Democratic Russia should not be guided by the heritage of anti-popular bolshevik rule" -- this idea ran all through the rally which is to be continued outside the Russian Embassy in Yerevan. The rally organizers intend to present Russian Ambassador Vladimir Stupishin with a statement to be delivered to Russian authorities. The statement calls for cancellation of what they consider to be "an anti-Armenian treaty". According to the newspaper ANKAKHUTYUN (INDEPENDENCE) published by the National Self-determination movement, since the collapse of the former Soviet Union in 1991, Russia "has been abandoning, revising and dumping to the dung-heap of history international treaties immortalizing the crimes of bolshevik diplomacy". Among these crimes the newspaper cited the 1921 Moscow treaty, which "re-adjusted" Armenia's boders and handed over part of its territory to Turkey. By denouncing this treaty, Russia would demonstrate its "new and just attitude towards the shameful past, as well as confirm its current political course in the transcaucasian region", the newspaper believes.
