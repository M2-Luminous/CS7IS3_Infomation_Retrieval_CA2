NPC Chairman Qiao Shi told a preparatory meeting Wednesday that the session "is extremely important since it is convened at a time when China is establishing a socialist market economic structure and marching on the road of modernisation," XINHUA reported. Nearly 3,000 delegates to the 13-day second session of the eighth NPC are expected to approve the economic and social development plan and the budget for 1994, as well as examining a draft budget law, NPC spokesman Zhou Jue told journalists. The delegates are also to study Premier Li Peng's government work report, likely to focus on efforts to cool the overheated economy. Zhou said that this year the NPC and its standing committee "will accelerate the pace of legislation so as to roughly put in place the legal framework necessary for the establishment of the socialist market economy." Some 152 pieces of legislation, of which 53 relate to economic reform, are due to be dealt with in 1994, compared with 19 and 12 respectively last year. A Western diplomat, however, doubted the NPC would succeed in laying the legal framework for a socialist market economy this year, saying much of the planned legislation covered relatively minor issues. Legislation in vital areas like banking and securities would take longer than originally planned, as the Chinese authorities were now taking a "reality check" on the amount of preparatory work necessary, the diplomat said. Zhou made no mention of any banking legislation and acknowledged that problems remained in progress towards a long-awaited securities law. "Securities is a new subject so we lack adequate experience to cope with it," Zhou said, adding that "more careful study" was needed. Qiao said the NPC session would be guided by the theories of senior leader Deng Xiaoping and the communist party's basic line, thereby indicating that political reform was not on the agenda. NPC spokesman Zhou appeared to rule out consideration of long-standing proposals to replace legal clauses on "counter-revolutionary crimes" -- frequently used to detain dissidents -- with references to specific violations. "Counter-revolutionary crimes as contained in China's criminal law refers to crimes that endanger state security," he said. "I think for such crimes that endanger state security it deserves punishment in every country." Zhou also defended the NPC's reputation as little more than a rubber-stamp body [as received], saying the system of China's parliament "fully suited the national conditions of my country." "China's National People's Congress is different from parliaments in other countries and we will not mechanically copy the experiences of others," he said. In a vivid reminder that dissenting views will not be entertained, China has recently launched a crackdown on political activists, detaining them or escorting them from the capital to ensure the NPC's smooth running. The 163-member NPC presidium, elected Wednesday, includes 89- year-old Deng -- who retired from his last official post in 1990 -- as well as President Jiang Zemin. Deng, who looked frail and dazed when he appeared in public last month for the first time in one year, was also a member of the 1993 NPC presidium but did not make an appearance. The NPC, created in 1954, is elected every five years and convenes an annual plenary session. Its standing committee meets several times a year to examine and adopt laws.
