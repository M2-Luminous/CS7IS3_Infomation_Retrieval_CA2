ACTION: Notice of Implementation. SUMMARY: This notice implements special local regulations for the Blackbeard Pirate Jamboree to be held on the Elizabeth River at Town Point Park, Norfolk and Portsmouth, Virginia. The regulations are needed to control vessel traffic within the immediate vicinity of the event due to the confined nature of the waterway and the expected congestion at the time of the event. The regulations restrict general navigation in the area for the safety of life and property on the navigable waters during the event. EFFECTIVE DATE: This regulation is effective from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., July 30, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Stephen L. Phillips, Chief, Boating Affairs Branch, Boating Safety Division, Fifth Coast Guard District, 431 Crawford Street, Portsmouth, Virginia 23704&hyph;5004 (804) 398&hyph;6204, or Commander, Coast Guard Group Hampton Roads (804) 483&hyph;8567. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Drafting Information The drafters of this notice are QM2 Gregory C. Garrison, project officer, Boating Affairs Branch, Boating Safety Division, Fifth Coast Guard District, and LT Monica L. Lombardi, project attorney, Fifth Coast Guard District Legal Staff. Discussion of Regulation Norfolk Festevents, Ltd. submitted an application to hold the Blackbeard Pirate Jamboree on the Elizabeth River at Town Point Park, Norfolk and Portsmouth, Virginia. The event will consist of a parade of sail followed by an orchestrated water drama with cannon fire between two vessels. Since many spectator vessels are expected to be in the area to watch the jamboree, the regulations in 33 CFR 100.501 are being implemented for the safety of life and property. The waterway will not be closed for an extended period; therefore, commercial traffic should not be severely disrupted. In addition to regulating the area for the safety of life and property, this notice of implementation also authorizes the Patrol Commander to regulate the operation of the Berkley drawbridge in accordance with 33 CFR 117.1007, and authorizes spectators to anchor in the special anchorage areas described in 33 CFR 110.72aa. 33 CFR 110.72aa establishes the spectator anchorages in 33 CFR 100.501 as special anchorage areas under Inland Navigation Rule 30, 33 U.S.C. 2030(g). 33 CFR 117.1007 closes the draw of the Berkley Bridge to vessels during and for one hour before and after the effective period under 33 CFR 100.501, except that the Coast Guard Patrol Commander may order that the draw be opened for commercial vessels. Dated: April 13, 1994. W.T. Leland, Rear Admiral, U.S. Coast Guard, Commander, Fifth Coast Guard District. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;11983 Filed 5&hyph;18&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;14&hyph;M
