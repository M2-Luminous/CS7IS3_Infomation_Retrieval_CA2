The merchandise trade figures for May released earlier in the day underscored "the rising imports and falling exports in terms of volume," Saito told a regular news meeting. "But I want to see if that becomes a fixed trend, and I'm worried about the unchanged (upward) trend with the U.S.," Saito said. The May preliminary figures showed that Japan's surplus fell 15.9 percent from a year before to score the first fall in six months, but the gap with the U.S. continued to rise for the third month in a row, gaining 7.5 percent.
