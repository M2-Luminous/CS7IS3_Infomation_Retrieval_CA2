Gianfranco Fini, the leader of the National Alliance, was replying to Umberto Bossi. Fini added that "presidentialism is the only corner in government where federalism can exist, but federalism does not mean overturning the article of the Constitution which assigns primary functions to the State and residual functions to the regions". Fini then recalled that there could not be a parliamentary majority without either the Northern League or the National Alliance.
