The grown GaAs was etched to realize an initial interface shape. Dopant distribution was measured by imaging infrared light transmission. Hall mobility was obtained by the Hall measurement. The temperature dependence of thickness of the InP single-crystal growth-layer was experimentally and numerically determined. Temperature effect on etch-pit density was examined. Striations and the shape of the initial interface were observed by etching the (211) plane. Photo-luminescence was measured for determination of dopant distribution. 1. Introduction The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), the Ministry of Education (MOE), and the Science and Technology Agency (STA) are planning to jointly launch an artificial satellite in February 1995 called the Space Flyer Unit (SFU)<sup> (1,2)</sup> which will be lifted aboard an H-II rocket now in development. As for the role of MITI, it is getting the New Energy Development Organization (NEDO) and the Unmanned Space Experimentation Foundation (USEF) to line up various companies to perform space experiments associated with compound semiconductors. At this point, they have lined up seven companies to perform eight experiments in the SFU mission (cf. Table 1). Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries (IHI) will carry out two of the experiments.<sup> (3,4)</sup> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.

The semiconductor materials to be studied in the space experiments include gallium arsenide (GaAs) and indium phosphide (InP) (cf. same table). The Bridgman technique, a melting method of growing crystal, will be the method used to grow GaAs crystal, and the THM technique, a type of solution growth method, will be used to grow the InP crystal. The main purpose of the GaAs crystal growth experiment is to obtain a crystal having a uniform concentration of impurities by conducting crystal growth under managed diffusion conditions.<sup> (3)</sup> The main purpose of the InP crystal growth experiment, meanwhile, is to investigate the effect that the convection generated in a solution has on the quality of crystal.<sup> (4)</sup> In order to achieve these goals, IHI has been conducting a battery of experiments on the ground for perfecting test conditions and evaluating crystal growth. The furnaces used for the ground experiments include an electric furnace, which belongs to IHI (hereinafter called IHI furnace), and a ground test furnace (hereinafter called ground furnace), which belongs to USEF, and which is identical to that to be carried aboard the artificial satellite. The IHI furnace has been mainly used to establish growth conditions and verify the safety of the space experiments, while the ground furnace has been mainly used to verify the furnace conditions satisfying the parameters of the experiments. In the future, the ground furnace will be used to obtain reference comparison crystal here in the gravity environment of earth. In this paper, we report on the crystal growth experiments and the results obtained therein. 2. Test Equipment 2.1 Gallium Arsenide The growth of GaAs crystal is performed by the Bridgman method, which is a melting method of growing crystal in which molten material is unidirectionally solidified from seed crystal. An electric furnace called a complex heating furnace (GHF: gradient heating furnace) has been built specifically for this growth method. In the ground experiments, a GHF is used together with the IHI furnace and the ground furnace. In Figure 1, we show a ground furnace having the same properties as the gradient heating furnace carried aboard the SFU.<sup> (2)</sup> The ground furnace is made up of a high-temperature furnace and a low-temperature furnace. A cooling block has been placed between both furnaces to achieve a sharp temperature gradient. A tantalum cartridge containing the growth material is inserted into the ground furnace. The outer diameter of the cartridge is 25, and the surface of the container is coated with aluminum in order to improve emissivity. Figure 1 shows a furnace in which the tantalum cartridge has been inserted in the starting position. The sample ampule, which fits inside the tantalum cartridge, has a maximum diameter of 23.6 and a length of 220. Figure 2 is a diagram showing the configuration of the actual GaAs ampule which will be used up in space. The ampule basically has a three-fold structure.<sup> (3)</sup> The very inner part is a boron nitride crucible which holds the molten GaAs, and surrounding that is a quartz container that seals the crucible in a vacuum. The very outer part is a graphite containment vessel which protects the sealed container from expansion and deformation. Cushions have also been provided in certain locations to absorb the stress generated by the differences in the thermal expansion coefficient when the temperature drops. The volume of GaAs or InP semiconductors with the zinc-blende crystal structure is reduced by about 10% when melted. In order to absorb this loss of volume and have the GaAs solution maintain continuous contact with the wall of the crucible, a graphite spring has been installed inside the crucible. 2.2 Indium Phosphide The growth of InP crystal is performed by the THM method. The THM method is a method of growing crystal on the seed crystal side in which a solution band sandwiched between the seed crystal and raw material polycrystal is locally heated, and in which the solution band shifts toward the polycrystal by the movement of the furnace or ampule. An electric furnace similar to a mirror heating furnace (MHF), which is able to perform local heating, has been designed specifically for this growth method. A MHF is also used together with the IHI furnace and the ground furnace in the experiments. In Figure 3, we show the configuration of a ground furnace having the same properties as the mirror heating furnace to be carried aboard the SFU.<sup> (2)</sup> The mirror heating furnace is an electric furnace that uses a single elliptical mirror to focus infrared radiation and heat the sample material. At one of the focusing points in the MHF, a halogen lamp has been installed to act as an infrared radiation source, and at the other focusing point is the sample ampule, which has a maximum diameter of 30 and a length of 120. In Figure 4, we show the structure of the InP ampule to be used in space. Following the direction in which the sample material moves, the ampule is made up of a vacuum sealed area, a cushion, raw material polycrystal, a solution band, InP monocrystal, a graphite rod, a cushion, and a vacuum sealed area. Indium is the material used for the solution band. In solution growth, the temperature of the solid-liquid interface on the raw material polycrystal side has to be higher than the temperature of the growing solid-liquid interface on the seed crystal side. That temperature difference is the driving force which causes the raw material to dissolve in the solution band, and causes the indium phosphide to be deposited on the seed crystal. The temperature gradient of the seed crystal growth interface is also what determines the length and quality of seed crystal growth. In this ampule, the temperature gradient of the growth interface on the seed crystal side is controlled by graphite rods positioned adjacent to the seed crystal.<sup> (5)</sup> Cushions have been installed in order to absorb the stress caused by the thermal expansion of the graphite and indium phosphide. Indium, unlike indium phosphide, gains more volume when molten than as a solid. For that reason, the seed crystal is precisely inserted into quartz tubes so that the molten indium does not find a way around the seed crystal when being dissolved. 3. Test Results and Studies 3.1 Gallium Arsenide When gallium arsenide is melted, it produces an arsenide (As) saturated vapor pressure of about one atmosphere. Because arsenide and arsenide compounds are toxic substances, arsenide steam cannot be discharged into the air. With that in mind, we decided to conduct a GaAs crystal growth experiment using the IHI furnace to verify the safety of the ampule. In Figure 5, we show the extracted ampule after completing the crystal growth experiment in the IHI furnace. In the upper part, we can see the graphite containment vessel, and in the lower part, the vacuum-sealed quartz container. A boron nitride crucible has been sealed within the quartz container. It is apparent from looking at the ampule that there has been some devitrification on the surface of the sealed container but no damage to the components that make up the ampule including the containment vessel, sealed container, and crucible. After verifying the safety of the ampule in the IHI furnace, we conducted a crystal growth experiment in the ground furnace with an identical ampule. The ultimate aim was to conduct the experiment in a weightless environment identical to that found in space, and obtain a reference crystal that can be used for comparison purposes. In Figure 6, we show the ground furnace in operation. In Figure 7, we show a GaAs sample after the crystal growth experiment. The growth plane is the (111) B plane. The metallic shiny part on the left side of the picture is the seed crystal, and the slightly more shiny area on the right is the growth portion. Also, the place where both these meet is the initial solid-liquid interface. We cut along the (110) plane in the direction of crystal growth and evaluated the shape of the initial solid-liquid interface by etching the crystal after pretreating. The etching liquid used was a solution of chromium oxide and silver nitrate called AB etchant, and the solvent was hydrofluoric acid and water. In Figure 8, we show a longitudinal microphotograph taken after etching. The curved line on the right side of the photograph is the initial solid-liquid interface. Crystal growth starts from the initial solid-liquid interface, and proceeds toward the left. The shape of the solid-liquid interface is convex, so we believe solidification is taking place from the wall of the crucible during crystal growth. This agrees quite well with the direction of intercrystal growth. In the future, additional improvements will have to made to the ampule material and dimensions so as to make the shape of the solid-liquid interface convex on the molten side. It is clear by looking at the photograph, however, that the shape of the solid-liquid interface on the seed side is convex, but from the location of the initial solid-liquid interface, the monocrystal obtained measures about 2 at the shortest point and about 9 at the longest. This length represents approximately 16% and 60%, respectively, of the crystal growth. We measured the distribution of dopant concentration in the sample by the infrared transmission method, which is one of the methods used to evaluate optical characteristics. The results of those measurements are shown in Figure 9. The bright arc-shaped border is the initial solid-liquid interface. Measurements indicate that the more transmitted light, the less dopant concentration. Accordingly, as we can see from the image, dopant concentration steadily rises as the crystal grows. This fact agrees quite well with what we have seen in crystal growth on the ground under managed thermal convection in which the dopant concentration shows a tendency to steadily rise. Hall measurements were taken to evaluate electrical characteristics. In Figure 10, we show the changes in Hall mobility along the direction of growth. This is the etch-pit density in which the thin lines indicate mobility and the fat lines indicate crystal fault density. It is clear from looking at the drawing that we have achieved the same mobility as seed crystal right from the time that crystal growth started. We were also able to confirm that when growth advances, mobility decreases as etch-pit density rises. 3.2 Indium Phosphide In Figure 11, we show a picture of the sample ampule used for the ground experiments. The ampule that will be used in the space experiments will have almost the same configuration. The metallic shiny area is the indium solution band. This is the part where infrared radiation is condensed from the mirror heating furnace. The growth plane is the (111) B plane. Heating was conducted in a maximum temperature range between 880°C and 1000°C. The furnace traveled at 0.05 to 0.2/h. Also, because it is a single-mirror heating furnace, the ampule is rotated at 5 rpm to improve the circumferential temperature distribution at the growth interface. In Figure 12, we show the relationship between length and maximum temperature in monocrystal growth. The white circles indicate the areas tested. The diagram clearly shows that as maximum temperature drops from 1000°C to 900°C the length of monocrystal growth grows and reaches a length of about 2. 2 is too large for InP crystal growth that belongs to the category of so-called liquid-phase epitaxial growth. We think the optimum temperature for crystal growth is between 880°C and 900°C. The solid line in the drawing is found by calculating the solution band flow, the P concentration distribution, and the temperature distribution in an IG environment. This is done to make it easier to estimate constitutional cooling (C/C<inf> sat</inf> ).<sup> (4)</sup> Constitutional cooling is a yardstick of polycrystallization, which means that the smaller the constitutional cooling, the easier it is obtain crystal. As the temperature drops to 900°C, the yardstick decreases and remains almost constantly below 900°C. This agrees quite well with the test results. In the space experiments also, we believe that studying constitutional cooling will be an effective tool with which to make comparisons. In Figure 13, we show the temperature dependency of etch-bit density (EPD), which is an indicator of crystal quality. It clearly shows that the bigger the drop in maximum temperature the smaller the EDP and the better the crystal quality. It also demonstrates that zinc dopants are more effective in reducing dislocation. Figure 14 is a photograph showing the growth region cut along the (211) plane in the direction of growth, and treated with AB etchant. The streak seen in the unevenness of the growth region is called an impurity band, and from it flow data can be obtained. It is our belief that this impurity band is more easily shaped on the ground than in space. We measured photo-luminescence by a method which evaluated the optical characteristics. In Figure 15, we show the peak half-width mapping results from the growth crystal (111) plane. The yellow region in the center indicates high zinc dopant concentration, the surrounding blue area shows very little dopant concentration. The shape of the growth interface is indicative of a protruding shape. There are two kinds of InP etch-pits, namely, the D-pit, which is associated with dislocation, and the S-pit,<sup> (6)</sup> which is assumed to be associated with impurity concentration. In Figure 16, we show the relationship between photo-luminescence intensity and S-pit density. We can see from looking at the diagram that the greater the photo-luminescence intensity, or rather the higher the impurity concentration, the greater the S-bit density. These tests further demonstrated that the S-bits originated from the impurities. 4. Conclusion 4.1 Gallium Arsenide We were able to verify the safety of GaAs using an ampule having a three-fold structure. In this ampule, we grew crystal with the furnace on the ground, cut the crystal obtained in the process along the growth axis, and performed a crystallographic evaluation. According to that evaluation, the shape of the initial solid-liquid interface was convex on the seed crystal side, yet showed 16% crystal growth in the shortest areas and 60% growth in the longest areas. To evaluate crystal characteristics, we took an infrared transmission image and then measured distribution along the dopant concentration plane. We found that dopant concentration steadily rises as the crystal grows. This suggests that crystal growth was achieved under managed thermal convection. Next, we measured the Hall effect in the monocrystal area. We found that Hall mobility was the same as seed crystal in the initial stages of growth, and that it decreased later as etch-bit density increased. 4.2 Indium Phosphide We elucidated the optimum conditions under which InP crystal can be grown by the THM method. A monocrystal of about 2 was obtained with a maximum temperature range between 880°C and 900°C. We found that the main reason for polycrystallization was constitutional supercooling, and confirmed this by agreement between a yardstick arrived at by numerical calculation and actual test results. We also found that the lower the maximum temperatures, the smaller the EDP and the better the crystal quality. Meanwhile, by etching the (211) plane, we found impurities which indicate the effect of heat convection characteristic of IG. We believe that comparing the degree to which this occurs in space will give us the difference in flow behavior. To evaluate the optical characteristics, we measured photoluminescence, and were able to confirm dopant distribution within the plane. The measurements for photoluminescence also confirmed the fact that S-bits, which had been assumed to be based on impurities, were, according to the experiments we conducted, associated with impurity concentrations.
