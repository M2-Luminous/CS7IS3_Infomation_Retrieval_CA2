What were the contents of his message, (Christophe Burunziza)? [(Burunziza)] As we reported to you last night, the speaker of the National Assembly began his message by stating that the Burundian people had once again been hit by tragedy. Sylvestre Ntibantunganya went on to say that the president of the Republic yesterday went to the Republic of Tanzania in order to meet his counterparts in the subregion. On his way back to Bujumbura, President Ntaryamira traveled in the same aircraft as Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana. The tragic deaths occurred as the presidential aircraft was landing at Kanombe International Airport, Kigali. All the passengers, the speaker of the National Assembly continued, were killed. [passage omitted] The speaker of the National Assembly once again called on the Burundian people and friends of Burundi to remain calm and keep their courage up in spite of these present unfortunate, trying times. This was necessary, Ntibantunganya continued, because the Burundian parliament and government were continuing to perform the functions vested in them. The speaker of the National Assembly urged the whole population to safeguard security. He called on all Burundians to transcend the current situation so that we could together all look for the true path, which would open new horizons for us, especially in seeking to strengthen peace and security, so that the government and parliament could jointly look for a way out of the present crisis for Burundi. That is why, the speaker of the National Assembly added, a committee in charge of examining the development of the current situation was set up yesterday to allow all Burundians, without exception, regain peace and security. The committee is composed of the following officials: National Assembly Speaker Sylvestre Ntibantunganya; Prime Minister Anatole Kanyenkiko; Defense Minister Gedeon Fyiroko; (Corneille Buzigye), the chairman of the Front for Democracy in Burundi parliamentary group; (Vames Vantsuhye), coadministrator general of documentation; and Lieutenant Colonel Jean Bikomagu, the Army Chief of Staff.
