FR940511-0-00037 FR940511-0-00015 Boundary Alternative 3 Comment: NOAA should choose boundary alternative 3 as the preferred alternative. Response: Boundary Alternative 3 excludes the Juan de Fuca Canyon, which is one of the richest regions of the offshore oceanic ecosystem. It also excludes some of the highest concentrations of human uses which threaten the health of the marine ecosystem off the Olympic Peninsula. Comment: NOAA should not choose boundary alternative 3 as the preferred alternative because it will be too restrictive for vessel traffic. Response: NOAA is proposing no regulations that will unduly restrict vessel traffic. (See response to comment on boundary alternative 1). Boundary Alternative 4 Comment: NOAA should select boundary alternative 4 as the preferred alternative because: (1) Many of the unique unspoiled ecological resources that might be significantly impacted by oil are located in the physically complex area north of Pt. Grenville including areas of submarine canyons, productive fishing grounds, and coastal features that are critical habitat; (2) Sanctuary status in the southern portion of the study area would conflict with state managed activities such as dredged material disposal, while most of the shoreline in the north has little commercial activity; and (3) NOAA can enlarge the boundary in the future. Response: NOAA agrees. One of the most valuable qualities of the Olympic Peninsula is that it is undeveloped and relatively pristine. NOAA recognizes that the southern portion of the boundary is much more developed, especially with respect to the harbor maintenance activities in Grays Harbor. Further, the rocky intertidal habitats in the north are much more sensitive to pollution from oil and gas compared to the sandy beach environments in the southern portion of the study area. In the event of a spill of hazardous materials, experts predict that it would take years for intertidal communities of rocky intertidal environments to become reestablished, whereas it would take an order of months for the sandy intertidal communities to recolonize. Lastly, NOAA can expand Sanctuary boundary 4 in the future, in accordance with the requirements of the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA), the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), if deemed necessary. Comment: NOAA should not choose boundary alternative 4 because: (1) It is not scientifically defensible for it fails to protect the important and environmentally delicate estuaries along the southern coast; (2) It would render ineffective NOAA's resource monitoring and sanctuary enforcement mandates; and (3) It will be too restrictive for vessel traffic. Response: The boundary of a marine sanctuary should approximate the most identifiable boundaries of a marine ecosystem. The Site Evaluation List (SEL), from which sites are selected for consideration as marine sanctuaries, identified the coastal offshore islands as the core of the proposed Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary (originally identified as the Western Washington Outer Coast). With this focus, NOAA has determined that the boundaries of the ecosystem are encompassed by boundary alternative 4. NOAA recognizes that the coastal estuaries are ecologically valuable and that many organisms that exist within, or transit through boundary alternative 4, depend on the estuaries. However, while the estuaries and outer coast are ecologically linked, the productivity of the two environments is a function of very distinct environmental processes. NOAA believes that protection of the estuaries could be best achieved through possible inclusion of these areas in programs targeting estuarine management such as, the National Estuarine Research Reserve System, the National Estuary Program, or the Coastal Zone Management Program. NOAA believes that the size of the sanctuary encompassed by boundary alternative 4 is manageable with respect to research and monitoring initiatives. As discussed above, NOAA is working with the U.S. Coast Guard to develop a proposal for an ATBA off the northern Olympic Peninsula. It is designed to be as compatible with existing customary practices among mariners as possible. NOAA is not promulgating vessel traffic regulations with designation.
