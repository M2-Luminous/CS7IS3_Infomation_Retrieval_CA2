FR941216-1-00124 FR941216-1-00012 (c) Nonmetallic, internally spring-held caps should protect outlets exposed to explosive vapors, gases, or dust. Upon exertion of pressure within the outlet, the cap shall pop immediately. Caps should be attached to outlets to prevent their dropping into equipment during a deluge. (d) Required water flow and pressure should be determined for the hazard. (e) Periodic inspections of deluge systems shall ensure that they are in proper operating condition. (f) The deluge valve should allow for automatic and manual activation. Manual activation devices shall be placed at exits in explosives-operating buildings. They may also be located at the operator stations when hazard analysis determines the risk to personnel acceptable. (g) National Fire Protection Association Standards No. 13, 7 Installation of Sprinkler Systems, and No. 15, 8 Water Spray Fixed Systems, contain basic installation rules. 7 Copies may be obtained from the National Fire Protection Association, Batterymarch Park, Attn: National Fire Codes Subscription_Service Department, Quincy, MA 02269. 8 See footnote 6 to ยง184.109(g). ยง184.110 Hazards in fighting fires involving liquid propellants. For safety's sake, firefighters shall know the burning characteristics and specific hazards of liquid propellants. Burning liquid propellants fumes are generally toxic, so firefighters should remain on the upwind side. Protective clothing should include an approved, self-contained breathing apparatus. ยง184.111 Firebreaks. The primary purpose of vegetation control is to limit the probability of fires causing a hazard to ammunition and explosives areas. Therefore, a firebreak, at least 50 feet wide in all directions, shall be maintained around magazine areas, aboveground magazines and explosives operating buildings/locations. Firebreaks need not be devoid of vegetation but the growth shall be controlled to prevent rapid transmission of fire. Maintenance of firebreaks around earth-covered magazines is not required. However, combustible material and large trees shall be removed. Vegetation around ventilators on earth-covered magazines shall be controlled to prevent transmission of fire into the magazine.
