These purchases are time-restricted because, as early as spring of this year, contracts will be concluded for the purchase of foodstuffs wheat, with the deadline for delivery to coincide with the harvest period. On the basis of such agreements, down payments amounting to 50 percent of the value of the deliveries are to be paid as early as this month. The council decided on the above method of purchasing following the experiences of last year's harvest, when the fund purchased only an insignificant quantity of foodstuffs wheat, with which it was totally unable to influence the situation on the market. Other buyers had simply paid more than the fund, which is authorized to purchase at the so-called minimum (guaranteed) price or to pay in advance, even if those payments were at a lower price. The fund failed to purchase a significant amount of wheat, despite the fact that the minimum (guaranteed) price before the harvest rose significantly. The Market and the Import of Grain In view of the fact that the fund virtually purchased no wheat from the 1993 harvest, it did not even have any stockpiles with which it could have blunted the increase in the consumer price of flour, baked goods, and even fodder grains for production consumption in livestock production. The desire to have such stockpiles at its disposal was also the sole motive for the decision of the fund council regarding imports. This decision actually halted the rise in grain prices. And it did so even before the actual importation of a single kilogram of foodstuffs wheat. The effect developed even in the face of subsequent announcements that these imports represent current imports at market prices abroad, including customs duties. The Ministry of Finance merely adopted measures according to which the customs duties are assessed but not collected for the time being. Such procedures are valid until such times as the minister of agriculture submits (in the case of need) a proposal to forgo such duties; the proposal is submitted to the government, which makes the final decision. The Ministry of Finance was motivated in this direction primarily by the virtual balance between grain resources and requirements in the Czech Republic, including foodstuffs wheat. Another reason was the fact that the difference between the market price of this wheat at the time on our domestic market (3,500-3,700 korunas [Kc] per metric ton) and the cost of possible imports, including customs duties of approximately Kc4,200 per ton, was not considered an impenetrable barrier in terms of foodstuffs consumer prices. For example, such a price increase for wheat would show up in the consumer prices of crescent rolls only to the extent of 10 halers. There was thus no reason that foodstuffs wheat could not be sold on our markets at prices of its possible import costs, including customs duties. Despite the effect of this procedure, it must be said that the fund for the importation of agricultural products was never conceived. It is supposed to purchase interventional stockpiles on the domestic market when prices paid to farmers are lower than the minimum (guaranteed) price and is thus supposed to assist in revitalizing farm prices and not to import stockpiles when market prices are higher than the minimum (guaranteed) price. In the latter case, it then acts against the interest of farmers; in the event the forgiveness of customs duties is not subsidized, consumer prices on the domestic market would not even benefit consumers or processors. Thus, in discussing procedures for the year 1994, the fund council was faced by a decision: either to engage in interventional purchases in a traditional manner at harvest time, with a great risk of repeating the situation of last year, or to conclude contracts for futures purchases, paying out deposits and thus adapting to the practices used by a number of buyers. The decision was made to buy time-limited futures. Regular analyses of the grain market indicate that the decision by the council has already influenced the conduct of the other buyers without the fund's having purchased a single kilogram of grain and without having concluded any futures contracts. Buyers are offering higher market prices than the minimum (guaranteed) price, lower-quality parameters than called for by tough export criteria for the fund; concluding contracts for futures purchases and paying down payments; using bills of exchange to make these payments; supplying agricultural chemicals with the provision that they will subtract their value from the compensation paid for grain delivered at harvest time; and so forth. The Task of the Agricultural Chamber Because the conclusion of futures contracts to affect interventional purchases required that the offerings of growers be concentrated, the fund council asked the Agricultural Chamber of the Czech Republic for assistance. The agreement with the director of the fund regarding the most important criteria and conditions for purchases was aimed at at least allowing growers to more or less orient themselves and to begin, with the assistance of okres agricultural chambers, to make a listing of offerings. The first round of offerings took place as early as January so it would be possible to meet the deadline for making downpayments in March. The result was an offering that corresponds to the quantity of 500,000 tons being considered by the council. The procedures adopted by the okres agricultural chambers, however, encountered the criticism of some members of the fund council. They were calling on their findings in the field, which indicated that some growers did not find out about the possibility for interventional purchases and, in some locations, allegedly even refused to register their offerings in the listing (although this involved a grower who is capable of producing foodstuffs wheat) because the individual involved allegedly was not a member of the agricultural chamber. But this was never proved. Therefore, the agricultural chambers organized a second round of listings, the results of which (halfway through February) already amounted to approximately 50,000 tons more than was being considered by the council. Therefore, the offerings were curtailed by the Commodity Council of the Agricultural Chamber at okres levels according to the actual quantities of foodstuffs wheat purchased over the past three years, according to production in recent years and the listing of areas sown to wheat. However, such an offering was again rejected by the fund council, with a reference to the fact that there is a need to leave room for the registration of growers. Therefore, a third round of offerings was conducted, which ended on 25 February. A Systems or Nonsystems Approach The principal effect of any kind of interventional purchases--in other words, even of futures purchases--is to influence market prices paid to farmers and the conduct of buyers in the market. A secondary effect of futures intervention purchases is the payment of deposits and, thus, the payment of advances to growers for their expenses for the next harvest. From the standpoint of the principal effect, therefore, it is completely immaterial in terms of price levels whether a purchase for intervention purposes is actually made from any one specific grower. Moreover, a specific grower does not care at all whether a deposit is paid by the fund or by another buyer. After all, another buyer can (and frequently does) contract for even more advantageous conditions than the fund. In some okreses, particularly in production okreses, this was reflected in low offerings made to the fund. The fact that there have now been three rounds of listing offerings, however, also leads to the fact that, particularly in the less productive okreses, offerings are obviously no longer being made with the intention of actually delivering foodstuffs wheat, but with the secondary intent of borrowing financial resources without demonstrating their returnability to commercial banks or to the Supportive and Guaranteeing Agricultural and Forestry Fund. And the fund was not designed to effect an individual approach to every market entity (so no one could complain that he did not have the opportunity to participate in interventional purchases). One can thus believe that the current approach by the fund with respect to futures intervention purchases is based solely on a complicated financial situation faced by agricultural primary producers and on the fact that the measures are being asserted for the first time. After evaluating the experiences, this nonsystems approach will surely be transformed into a systems-type approach and will gain the right to exist.
