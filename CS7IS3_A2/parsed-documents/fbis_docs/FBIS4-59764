FBIS4-59764 "drnes096_j_94017" FBIS-NES-94-096 Daily Report 16 May 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen Opposition Announces Salvation Initiative Opposition Announces Salvation Initiative EA1705141794 Aden Yemeni Republic Radio Network in Arabic 1645 GMT 16 May 94 EA1705141794 Aden Yemeni Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Text] In these critical and grave moments in the history of our people in which towns and villages are destroyed, lives lost, children orphaned, women widowed, and the hopes and aspirations of our people for unity, security, stability, and progress sacrificed, and when full blows are being dealt to democracy with the aim of enshrining the hegemony of forces hostile to the people and their aspirations to build modern Yemen in the light of the documents of pledge and accord, the patriotic opposition bloc announced a salvation initiative on 9 May, which is summarized here as follows: 1. The immediate cessation of all war operations. 2. The cancellation of all government institutions because of their inability to solve the crisis and to prevent the catastrophe. 3. To speed up the formation of a national salvation government so as to enable it to save the country from the deep abyss. 4. The salvation government is to undertake the application of the pledge and accord document which has won national consensus, a matter that is unprecedented in the life of our people. 5. The salvation government is to undertake the investigation and exposure of those who caused the crime of in-fighting and to present them for trial. 6. To oppose any side which refuses this initiative which seeks to save our people and our country and to end this destruction. The dialogue commission outside the coalition announced its initiative on 30 April which is summarized in the cancellation of the institutions of the existing authority and the formation of a national salvation government. This followed the events of 'Imran which led to this overall disaster. This was then followed by the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] initiative on 12 May, when it stated its agreement with and acceptance of the initiative of the patriotic opposition bloc, and responded to it. Consequently, any opposition or rejection of these initiatives must be considered as opposition to the Yemeni national consensus. The patriotic and democratic forces represented by the political parties and organizations which signed this declaration defined the bases of their moves as cooperation and standing in one trench to achieve those patriotic initiatives which seek to end the bloodshed and the machinery destroying our people, their unity, and land. They continue to hope that reason and Yemeni wisdom will prevail and that all honorable people will rally to this initiative throughout Yemen, in all political organizations, as well as the older men of reason in the parties of the authority which has not responded to the initiative of the patriotic national opposition. These patriotic forces represent by this responsible stand a basis for a responsible patriotic and democratic alliance relying on the pledge and accord document to continue the struggle to save the homeland from the destructive war, to preserve unity, and to build a modern state on the basis of the following concepts and commitments: 1. The objective we are striving to achieve is the implementation of the pledge and accord document. 2. The machinery to implement the document has already been stated in the initiative of the patriotic opposition bloc on 9 May and the dialogue commission outside the coalition on 30 April, and the YSP through its initiative of 12 May, namely a national salvation government which reflects national unity and widespread participation in the building of the nation on the foundations of democracy as a firm option from which there can be no retreat. 3. We are committed to the pledge and accord document and to work for its implementation with all honorable and wise people, wherever we are able to do so in the land of Yemen. 4. We are irrevocably committed to democracy based on multipartyism and peaceful alternation of authority. 5. We all pledge and are committed, as far as we are able, to condemn any manifestations of authoritarianism in government or any manifestations by an individual, party or group of attempts to control the instruments of authority anywhere in Yemen. 6. We pledge and are committed to the equality of opportunity in political action without the tyranny of one group over another or of one region over another region or of one party over others. Government institutions, resources, and tools should not be run for the benefit of any particular group, party or tribe. 7. Opportunity should be made available to all national and capable patriotic cadres regardless of their party or regional affiliation in all fields and at all levels. 8. The homeland belongs to all. All are partners in both good and bad times. The responsibility for its protection, defense, the safety of its sons and ending this catastrophe, belongs to all. All political forces committed to this national salvation initiative document are equal in rights and duties. 9. We are all committed to cooperating in order to eliminate the vestiges of the far and near past, to soothe the wounds and to eliminate these vestiges from people's minds through national, historic reconciliation which would restore everyone's rights, guarantee justice and equality, and sow the seeds of love and brotherhood. 10. To work for the elimination of the effects of division in people's minds through parity in communication, balancing of interests between groups, governorates and provinces, and the rejection of all attempts to sow hatred and malice. We must rise above any narrow regional, sectarian, divisive or partisan tendencies. 11. We do not support those who advocate war, in-fighting, division or secession. However, we shall confront with all honorable people the mentality which desires the continuation of killings and destruction and refuses to silence its guns. The continuation of the [word indistinct] stubborn refusal to stop the massacres and destruction will increase our determination to mobilize all the energies of our people to confront the perpetrators of the catastrophe and the destructive war. The democratic forces are capable of doing this with reason, wisdom, and real democratic work and by the application of parity in communication and equilibrium which will take care of all the sons of our people. 12. On the basis of commitment by us all to the pledge and accord document, the document of national consensus, and on the basis of the fact that we constitute a foundation for an extensive, democratic and national alliance, we all agree to form joint machineries which will lead, manage, and supervise all affairs, relations, actions and activities. None of us will take a unilateral decision. The proper machineries for this will be formed to represent all and to lead all activities with the aim of attaining a government of national salvation and the implementation of the pledge and accord document. The political parties and organizations signing this agreement warn of the consequences of ignoring this agreement which is aimed at saving the homeland and safeguarding the land and people of Yemen. It is a natural culmination of all previous political initiatives. We appeal to the rest of the political parties and organizations participating in the dialogue commission to play their full role by taking part in all the machineries of this agreement. God knows our intentions.
