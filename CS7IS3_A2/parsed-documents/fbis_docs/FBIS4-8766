[end recording] [Begin Ohranovic recording] There is only death in Gorazde. There is no one to stop this death and horror. Fighting is taking place around the hospital itself. In the past hour, hundreds of shells have landed on the town. The hospital, the International Red Cross, and collective accommodation are all being targeted. We demand once again that a stop be put to this. I do not know whether I will have the opportunity to repeat this appeal. I appeal to the defenders of Gorazde and the residents of Gorazde to devote everything to the service of defense. Do not fall for rumors and disinformation. The town must be defended. Do not forget the dead and wounded. Do not forget your co-fighters without arms and legs. It is better to die than be taken into the hands of the enemy alive. Do everything possible to prevent the enemy from entering the town and carrying out an unprecedented slaughter. I know that we can and want do it. [end recording]
