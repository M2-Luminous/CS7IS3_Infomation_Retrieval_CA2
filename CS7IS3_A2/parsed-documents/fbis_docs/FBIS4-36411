[Salih] That question suggests that it was Sanaa which resorted to force. We would like to stress to you that we went to impossible lengths to avert the fighting. It would take a long time and numerous pages to explain all that in detail. Nevertheless, we are willing to reply to any suggestion that Sanaa was working for a military solution to the crisis, which was prepared and stirred up by known leaders in the Socialist Party who were preparing to implement its military aims at least 10 months before the fighting began. Numerous states have irrefutable evidence of this, namely the arms supplies which were delivered secretly to al-Mukalla and Aden ports with financing from some states in the region. Sanaa is certain that al-Bid's return to Aden on 19 August 1993 and his remaining there until the day he moved (to Hadhramaut) and his refusal to return to Sanaa after the signing of the Pledge and Accord Document in Amman on 20 February, after Aden's failure to engage in a long-term confrontation with the al-'Amaliqah forces in Abyan on the same evening the signing took place...all this was part of the conspiracy which resulted in the current state of war. So Sanaa cannot be accused of preparing for this war. And if you have any doubts in this connection, we want you to provide evidence of your doubts so we can reply to them more clearly. [Taheri] What can the Yemeni leadership achieve through military confrontation that it cannot achieve through negotiation? [Salih] We confirm to you that negotiation and dialogue were the Presidential Council chairman's preferred option. The military option was imposed by the other party, because his real aim since he fabricated the crisis on 19 August 1993 was to impose secession by force -- which so far he has failed to achieve. Thus we stress that the political leadership in Sanaa can achieve all its aims through dialogue as long as this dialogue is based on constitutional legitimacy, adherence to Yemeni unity, and compliance with the results of the 27 April 1993 elections. But if the secessionists are seeking to achieve through dialogue what they have failed to achieve by force, they will suffer a more severe failure than their military failure. [Taheri] Under what conditions would the Yemeni leadership be willing to accept a halt to the operations, starting with agreeing to the cease-fire? [Salih] A cease-fire is not a problem for us, because our Armed Forces have been able to destroy the huge military equipment the rebels inherited from their close relations with the Warsaw Pact and as a result of the huge supplies they purchased before and after fabricating the crisis through al-Bid's return to Aden, and with finance from some Gulf Cooperation Council states. However, we do not conceal that we are very concerned that the Security Council resolution is nothing but a prelude to new accusations to be fabricated against the Republic of Yemen and its political leadership for the sake of passing new resolutions or justifying blatant interference in our internal affairs, especially as we had bitter experience in the early sixties during the conflict between monarchists and republicans. [Taheri] Under what conditions and within what framework do you expect the Security Council to play a role in ending the armed conflict? [Salih] We are certain that the Security Council's role in ending the existing dispute cannot transcend the existing legitimacy. Proof of this is the situation the government of north Cyprus has been experiencing for about 20 years. You know who is behind it. But we cannot ignore the possibility that Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas may become a second Denktas. However, he cannot achieve at the international level more than his opposite number has achieved. [Taheri] Are you demanding the restoration of the situation that existed before the fighting erupted? Or is your government willing to negotiate a new formula for unity with the southern leadership? [Salih] The Yemeni leadership is demanding nothing from anyone under the legitimate unity announced on 22 May 1990 on the basis of legal and constitutional foundations governed by the laws in force in what used to be called the Yemen Arab Republic and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen. The Republic of Yemen was established on the basis of the constitutional rules and legal stipulations that governed the two countries. After the announcement of the unified state, the Constitution, over which we negotiated for 10 years, became the foundation of the new entity. After the announcement of the Republic of Yemen, a referendum was conducted on the new state's Constitution, on which the inhabitants of the republic overwhelmingly agreed. Nearly three years after the state was announced, general elections were held, and the world attested they were honest. Then the coalition government you know was formed. Despite all this, the secessionists relied in their announcement on House of Representatives members loyal to them, who had been elected by the people under the Constitution of the Republic of Yemen and the electoral law ratified by the House of Representatives, whose speaker was a prominent member of the Socialist Party, which is now seeking a new legitimacy for itself. So can there be any other demands for us to submit to the secessionists except the abolition of their decision to secede? If that is not achieved through legitimate channels internationally, I am certain that the Yemeni people are capable of achieving their unionist aims. And we stress to you that the preceding means that we are not willing to accept any formula. [Taheri] Are there any mediation efforts which enjoy the Presidential Council's support? Or is the aim to achieve a decisive and complete victory on the battlefield? [Salih] We believe that it is the secessionists who desperately need to achieve a decisive military victory on the battlefield, because that is the only way to prove their legitimacy. As for the legitimate authority in the Republic of Yemen, it does not need to do that, because it cares very much about every citizen's life, and shedding citizens' blood cannot be a means to prove its legitimacy. It is the rebels who need to prove their legitimacy by shedding the Yemenis' blood. On that basis, we have confronted them firmly and powerfully, because we know who is behind them. And we can clearly tell you now that we are not fighting a party that obtained 25 percent of the citizens' votes. It represents a minority that cannot be relied on. We are facing a foreign scheme.
