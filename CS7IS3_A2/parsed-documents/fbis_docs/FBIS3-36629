The Foreign Ministry statement, published Sunday, expresses anger at the monstrous crime against civilians and also contains a call for the culprits, whoever they might be, to be severely punished. The Russian side's position remains unchanged, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said -- a solution to the Bosnian problem must be sought by peaceful, political means. The attempts to wreck the peace settlement process that are currently being made by gunmen on various sides could lead to disaster. Air strikes against Bosnia, in his opinion, can only result in the sides' taking a harder line, and every effort must be made toavoid this "last resort." [passage omitted] According to observers, the incident could not only provoke a hasty decision by NATO to strike at Bosnian Serb positions around Sarajevo but could also greatly worsen the situation in the city itself. Sarajevo radio is already urging Muslims to "unsheathe their knives and deal with the Serbs and Croats living in the city." Clearly, those who are responsible for the explosion were hoping not least to radicalize the thinking of the Muslim population of Sarajevo, which lately has been increasingly blaming the current Sarajevo authorities for its ills.
