Kolesnikov said these abominable publications are aimed at splitting the leadership of the Defence Ministry and thus weakening one of the most stable institutions of the state -- the armed forces. In his statement for the press circulated by the Information and Press Agency of the Defence Ministry, the chief of the General Staff said no secret is made of the work of the Defence Ministry. Its work can always be discussed in an open and constructive way. Representatives of the media are informed of every important function of the Defence Ministry or of the General Staff. Those who are really interested in getting reliable information about the armed forces have every opportunity to receive this information, the statement says.
