Yushenkov told a news conference on Thursday the call will come if the faction finds "decisions made by Chenomyrdin's cabinet pose a real threat of a catastrophe in Russia," particularly in a situation where "the president remains all but the last guarantor of reforms and stability in Russia." Commenting on the latest reshuffle in the government, the parliamentarian said the decision that Yegor Gaydar and other pro-reform ministers should quit was taken by Russia's Choice think-tank. However, no complete exodus of the faction's members from the government was planned, he added. First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoliy Chubays and other four ministers, including Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, will continue to work under Chernomyrdin. As one of the four, the Science Minister Boris Saltykov put it, "as long as I am able to carry on reforms, I will stay in the government. I believe this will eventually be more effective than any spectacular demarche."
