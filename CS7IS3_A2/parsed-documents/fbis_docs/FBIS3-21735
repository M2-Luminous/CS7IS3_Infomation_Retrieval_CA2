Therefore, as the institution of federal justice announced yesterday, this type of police checkpoint will soon be expanded. The office stressed that there are currently 19 Precos in operation, disseminated in 13 states of the republic with high rates of crime on highways, noting that there is less insecurity in those states now. The Federal Judicial Police forces detailed to them have arrested large numbers of criminals, with a presence that has prevented the commission of crimes to a considerable extent. The Precos operate in towns such as Ensenada, Baja California; and settlements such as Benjamin Hill and San Luis-Rio Colorado, Sonora; Los Mochis and Villa Union, Sinaloa; El Sueco, Chihuahua; Gomez Palacio and Santiago Papasquiario, Durango; Las Norias (Southern Highway, San Fernando), Tamaulipas; Carapan (Glorieta Highway crossing) and Zitacuaro (Southern Highway and Huetamo), Michoacan; and Linares-Monterrey-Monclova Highway, Nuevo Leon. They are also located at boundaries: in Guerrero; Michoacan (Ixtapa-Lazaro Cardenas Highway); La Ventosa, Oaxaca; Gregorio Mendez, Tabasco; Huehuetan and Comitan, Chiapas; and Caoba and Kilometer 56 (Chetumal-Carrillo Puerto Highway), Quintana Roo. The PGR noted that these checkpoint operations are headed by highly qualified personnel, including agents from the Public Prosecutor's Office and the Federal Judicial Police, and a representative of the Human Rights Commission, to prevent irregularities and to ensure that their operations adhere strictly to the law. Their only goal is to raise the levels of security for persons traveling on the nation's highways, especially the federal ones. Their intention is to reduce the crime rate and to meet the demand expressed by various social sectors for a resolute battle against the drug traffic and arms contraband. They are also required to cooperate with the state governments to prevent kidnappings; and, if they should occur, they must assist the local authorities in investigating them, as well as intensifying the battle against the drug traffic.
