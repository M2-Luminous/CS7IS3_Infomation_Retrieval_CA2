Workers at a canned food factory discussed this proposal, along with other suggestions like paying for sports and cultural events, increasing electricity charges, and seizing money and goods that were obtained illegally. The discussion at that Cuban industry is a sign of what will happen at all work centers in Cuba on 30 January after more than 400,000 labor leaders conclude their analysis of these topics. Despite the social cost of many proposals, most Cuban workers agree on the need to adopt a program to reorganize the country's finances, a program that is indispensable to apply other measures with a view to overcome the serious crisis that the nation is facing. With regard to this, the government also recognized the urgency of making these decisions, but at the same time it issued a call to preserve the achievements of the Cuban socialist project, such as in health and education, which are free to all inhabitants of the island. The last session of the Cuban parliament -- 27 and 28 December -- analyzed the country's economic situation, but no agreements were reached because, it was learned, a process of consultations and explanations to the population was needed first. Cuban experts considered that the main guidelines for a possible program to improve the financial situation will stem from the people's opinions. Such a program could be approved by the Cuban deputies during a special session that is to be convoked for that purpose. According to these experts, the fact that there is a budget deficit of 4.2 billion pesos and that over 10 billion pesos (at par with the dollar at the official exchange rate) are in circulation demand the adoption of certain measures to control it. This latter problem is considered one of the most harmful because it contributes to a drop in efficiency and productivity and increases a lack of labor discipline and interest. But the solutions, the experts said, must include measures to improve profitability in most state enterprises because, according to official statistics, 69 percent of them are operating at a loss.
