Ningbo, once a renowned trading port from where pottery and porcelain ware were transported to other countries for over a thousand years, did not take off again until 1984, when it became one of the 14 open port cities in China. Since then the port has been exploiting its advantage in marine transport and a nearby harbor called Beilun. Dai Longyue, director of the local committee for foreign trade, said that an economic and technological development zone had been quickly set up, followed by a free trade zone. Imports and exports soared to the present 1.6 billion U.S. dollars from 50 million in 1988. Every year, Ningbo holds a number of trade talks and commodity fairs with businessmen from all over the world. This helped expand the city's overseas market. Its exports now cover 119 countries and regions, including Arab and African countries. Last year Ningbo imported goods worth 580 million U.S. dollars, a 170 percent increase over the year before. Ningbo has a strong connection with families of overseas Chinese merchants who went abroad when the city became one of the country's five open commercial ports after China lost the Opium War in 1840. Now it is forging ahead to build itself into "the most important trading port in east China", as charted by the central government. It is striving to establish itself as a center connecting China's interior and the Chang Jiang River regions with the international market, the official said. Work is in full swing to enlarge the handling capacity of the port. With the growth of trade, foreign capital also poured in. Ningbo has 2,088 overseas-funded firms now, with a total investment of 4.63 billion U.S. dollars. The Concord Group, a U.S. transnational corporation run by overseas Chinese, launched a petrochemical project that includes wharfs, a power plant and other support units. In using foreign capital, emphasis is given to renovate old enterprises. As many as 1,262 enterprises have been upgraded so far. More importantly, such financial aid has turned inefficient establishments around and thrust them forward to compete in the world market, said Dai. The growing contacts with the rest of the world have rekindled Ningbo people's historic abilities to "venture into the world and prosper." To date, businessmen from Ningbo, including ones from rural and private establishments, have formed 61 firms in 25 countries and regions. Dai said that a new Ningbo, with better qualified personnel and sharpened market consciousness, was aiming high to emerge as a strong competitor on the international market in the near future.
