FR940208-0-00049 FR940208-0-00019 Iowa, in a letter dated August 30, 1993 (Administrative Record No. IA&hyph;389), proposed to editorially clarify its program at IAC 27&hyph;40.71(4) by providing alternate State substitute citations that are the exact counterparts to the Federal provisions cited at 30 CFR 840.11(g)(3)(ii). Therefore, the Federal Citations at sections 518(e), 518(f), 521(a)(4) and 521(c) of SMCRA are proposed to be replaced by Iowa Code subsections 207.15(6), 207.15(7), 207.14(3), and 207.14(8), respectively. The Director finds Iowa's proposed revision at IAC 27&hyph;40.71(4) to be no less effective than the Federal counterpart regulation and is approving it. However, the Director finds that the State proposal at IAC 27&hyph;40.74(3) is less effective than its Federal counterpart provision. The Federal provision at 30 CFR 845.15(b)(2) refers to very specific enforcement procedures that the regulatory authority should take under particular circumstances. In contrast, the State proposal at IAC 27&hyph;40.74(3) merely refers to the statutory sections of the Iowa program dealing with enforcement in general. Therefore, the Director is not approving the proposed revision at IAC 27&hyph;40.74(3). Iowa is required to amend its program by providing the same specific editorial citation corrections at IAC 27&hyph;40.74(3) as it did at IAC 27/40.71(4). 29. IAC 27&hyph;40.74(207) and (8), Use of Civil Penalties for Reclamation Iowa proposes, at IAC 27&hyph;40.74(207), to incorporate 30 CFR Part 845 as in effect on July 1, 1992. This incorporation by reference includes 30 CFR 845.21 which deals with the use of Federal funds collected from civil penalties by OSM for reclamation. The Director recognizes that 30 CFR 845.21 deals with the disbursement of money collected by the United States from the assessment of civil penalties and does not have application within the State program. Iowa also proposes to revise its rules at IAC 27&hyph;40.74 by adding a paragraph (8) which provides as follows: Use of civil penalties for reclamation. In accordance with Iowa Code section 207.10(6), the division may expend funds collected from civil penalties to perform reclamation work on sites where the bond has been forfeited and additional funds are needed to complete the reclamation of the site. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 845.21 address only how the Federal government is to allocate its funds. Therefore, Iowa has discretion as to how it spends its monies collected from civil penalties.
