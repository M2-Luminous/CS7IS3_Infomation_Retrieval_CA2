As is known, U.S. President Bill Clinton revealed his intention to stage "Team Spirit 94" joint military exercises and ordered the deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea. And U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry cried for a dispatch of additional troops and weapons to South Korea, and chairman of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee Sam Nunn pushed home the need to make "steady war preparations" to counter an "attack". The U.S. military has worked out an operational plan to hurl 600,000 troops, more than 200 warships and 1,600 aircraft and so on from the U.S. mainland within 80 days in case of an "emergency" on the Korean peninsula. The "New Operation Plan 5027" for a surprise attack on the DPRK by the U.S. imperialist aggression forces and the South Korean puppet army in the event of "contingency" on the Korean peninsula has been made known to have been worked out between the master and the servant. On bellicose orders from the U.S. ruling quarters and under their aggressive war plan, forty-eight U.S. missile [word indistinct] and a more than 800-men Patriot missile unit are on their way to South Korea at present. Overseas-based warplanes of various types are flying into U.S. Air Force bases in South Korea one on the heels of the other, and the airlifted aggressor troops and lethal equipment are being deployed in operational zones. And U.S. vessels including a nuclear aircraft carrier are at so close a range that they can reach the coastal area of Korea within 24 hours. Meanwhile, the traitor Kim Yong-sam of South Korea shouted to army brasshats to establish a "thoroughgoing alert posture against the North", and the puppet prime minister turned up at puppet army frontline units and incited a war fever. The South Korean puppet armed forces are on "an alert posture" from March 23. The United States keeps more than 40 major Army, Navy and Air Force bases, over 200 military installations and 40,000 troops in South Korea. A large number of missiles and more than 1,000 pieces of nuclear weapons have been deployed at these bases. Some 100 U.S. military bases and about 50,000 U.S. troops are also in Japan to cope with an "emergency" on the Korean peninsula. The U.S. imperialist aggression forces and the South Korean puppets are staging various war exercises almost every day in the sky, on the ground and in the sea, in areas near the northern half of Korea. The U.S. Secretary of Defense will reportedly visit South Korea in April to [word indistinct] himself with the preparations for a war. Facts tell that the situation on the Korean peninsula resembles that on the eve of the past Korean war. The U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets had rapidly reinforced their aggression armed forces and committed armed provocations threatening the North on more than 5,100 occasions for three years and a half before unleashing the war on June 25, 1950. Dulles, dispatched to South Korea as a special envoy of the then U.S. President, had shown up at the 38th Parallel to inspect the preparations for mobilization and examined and ratified the plan of northward invasion on the spot. On the basis of this, the U.S. imperialists finally made an invasion of the DPRK on June 25, 1950, by instigating the Syngman Yi [Rhee] clique. Now the world peaceloving people express deep apprehensions for the situation on the Korean peninsula and denounce the U.S. imperialists' anti-DPRK campaign and are conducting vigorous international movements to check and frustrate it.
