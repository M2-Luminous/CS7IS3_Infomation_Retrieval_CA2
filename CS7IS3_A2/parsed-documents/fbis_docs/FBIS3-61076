It has been learned from reliable sources that he is still free but has been removed from his duties. Yuriy Konovalenko is suspected of having committed a series of crimes while in office, the most serious among them being the embezzlement and resale of especially valuable equipment and nonferrous metals. If these charges are confirmed by the official investigation now under way, the case of the former chief of the Semipalatinsk test site will more than likely be taken over by Russian law enforcement organs, since Konovalenko is a Russian citizen.
