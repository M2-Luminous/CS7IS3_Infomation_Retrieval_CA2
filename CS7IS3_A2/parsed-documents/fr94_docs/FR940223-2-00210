FR940223-2-00210 FR940223-2-00101 The duration of the use of a racial classification should be no longer than is necessary to its purpose, and the classification should be periodically reexamined to determine whether there is a continued need for its use. Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. F.C.C., 497 U.S. at 594. Thus, the use of race-targeted financial aid should continue only while it is necessary to achieve a diverse student body, and an assessment as to whether that continues to be the case should be made on a regular basis. In addition, the use of the classification should be sufficiently flexible that exceptions can be made if appropriate. For example, the Supreme Court in United States v. Paradise found that a race-conscious promotion requirement was flexible in operation because it could be waived if no qualified candidates were available. 480 U.S. at 177. Similarly, racial restrictions on the award of financial aid could be waived if there were no qualified applicants. Finally, the burden on those who are excluded from the benefit conferred by the classification based on race or national origin ( i.e., non-minority students) must be considered. Id., at 171. A use of race or national origin may impose such a severe burden on particular individuals_for example, eliminating scholarships currently received by non-minority students in order to start a scholarship program for minority students_that it is too intrusive to be considered narrowly tailored. See Wygant v. Jackson Board of Education, 476 U.S. at 283 (use of race in imposing layoffs involves severe disruption to lives of identifiable individuals). Generally, the less severe and more diffuse the impact on non-minority students, the more likely a classification based on race or national origin will address this factor satisfactorily. However, it is not necessary to show that no student's opportunity to receive financial aid has been in any way diminished by the use of the race-targeted aid. Rather, the use of race-targeted financial aid must not place an undue burden on students who are not eligible for that aid. A number of commenters argued that race-targeted financial aid is a minimally intrusive method to attain a diverse student body, far more limited in its impact on non-minority students, for example, than race-targeted admissions policies. Under this view, and unlike the admissions plan at issue in Bakke, a race-targeted financial aid award could be a narrowly tailored means of achieving the compelling interest in diversity. The Department agrees that there are important differences between admissions and financial aid. The affirmative action admissions program struck down in Bakke had the effect of excluding applicants from the university on the basis of their race. The use of race-targeted financial aid, on the other hand, does not, in and of itself, dictate that a student would be foreclosed from attending a college solely on the basis of race. Moreover, in contrast to the number of admissions slots, the amount of financial aid available to students is not necessarily fixed. For example, a college's receipt of privately donated monies restricted to an underrepresented group might increase the total pool of funds for student aid in a situation in which, absent the ability to impose such a limitation, the donor might not provide any aid at all. Even in the case of a college's own funds, a decision to bar the award of race-targeted financial aid will not necessarily translate into increased resources for students from non-targeted groups. Funds for financial aid restricted by race or national origin that are viewed as a recruitment device might be rechanneled into other methods of recruitment if restricted financial aid is barred. In other words, unlike admission to a class with a fixed number of places, the amount of financial aid may increase or decrease based on the functions it is perceived to promote. In summary, a college can use its financial aid program to promote diversity by considering factors other than race or national origin, such as geographic origin, diverse experiences, or socioeconomic background. In addition, a college may take race or national origin into account as one factor, with other factors, in awarding financial aid if necessary to promote diversity. Finally, a college may use race or national origin as a condition of eligibility in awarding financial aid if it is narrowly tailored to promote diversity. 5. Private Gifts Restricted by Race or National Origin The fifth principle sets out the circumstances under which a recipient college can award financial aid provided by private donors that is restricted on the basis of race or national origin. As noted by many commenters, pursuant to the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987, all of the operations of a college are covered by Title VI if the college receives any Federal financial assistance. 42 U.S.C. 2000d-4a(2)(A). Since a college's award of privately donated financial aid is within the operations of the college, the college must comply with the requirements of Title VI in awarding those funds. 12 12 Similarly, other organizations that receive Federal financial assistance must comply with Title VI in their award of student financial aid. On the other hand, individuals or organizations not receiving Federal funds are not subject to Title VI. They may thus, as far as Title VI is concerned, directly award financial aid to students on the basis of race or national origin. A college may award privately donated financial aid on the basis of race or national origin if the college is remedying its past discrimination pursuant to Principle 3 or attempting to achieve a diverse student body pursuant to Principle 4. In other words, Principles 3 and 4 apply to the use of privately donated funds and may justify awarding these funds on the basis of race or national origin in accordance with the wishes of the donor. Similarly, under Principle 1, a college may award privately donated financial aid that is restricted to disadvantaged students. Some commenters were uncertain whether it is permissible under Title VI for a college to solicit private donations of student financial aid that are restricted to students of a particular race or national origin. If the receipt and award of these funds is permitted by Title VI, that is, in the circumstances previously described, it is similarly permissible to solicit the funds from private sources. Financial Aid at Historically Black Colleges and Universities To ensure that the principles in this policy guidance do not subvert congressional efforts to enhance historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), these institutions may participate in student aid programs established by third parties for black students that are not limited to students at the HBCUs and may use their own institutional funds in those programs if necessary for participation. 13 See 20 U.S.C. 1051, 1060, and 1132c (congressional findings of past discrimination against HBCUs and of the need for enhancement). 13 This provision is limited to HBCUs as defined in Title III of the Higher Education Act. It does not apply generally to predominantly black institutions of higher education. The reason for this distinction is that Congress has made specific findings concerning the unique status of the HBCUs that serve as the basis for this provision. This finding is based upon congressional findings of past discrimination against HBCUs and the students they have traditionally served, as well as the Department's determination that these institutions and their students would be harmed if precluded from participation in programs created by third parties that designate financial aid for black students. That action would have an unintended negative effect on their ability to recruit excellent student bodies and could undermine congressional actions aimed at enhancing these institutions. Congress has repeatedly made findings that recognize the unique historical mission and important role that HBCUs play in the American system of higher education, and particularly in providing equal educational opportunity for black students. 20 U.S.C. 1051, 1060, and 1132c. Congress has created programs that strengthen and enhance HBCUs in Titles II through VII of the Higher Education Act, as amended by Public Law 99&hyph;498, 20 U.S.C. 1021&hyph;1132i-2. It has found that ``there is a particular national interest in aiding institutions of higher education that have historically served students who have been denied access to postsecondary education because of race or national origin .␣.␣. so that equality of access and quality of postsecondary education opportunities may be enhanced for all students.'' 20 U.S.C. 1051. ``A key link to the chain of expanding college opportunity for African American youth is strengthening the Nation's historically Black colleges and universities.'' House Report No. 102&hyph;447, 1992 U.S. Code Cong. and Adm. News p. 353.
